JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.933 --> 00:08.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:08.366 --> 00:11.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Tensions mount over
North Korea's missile
test, as questions

00:11.900 --> 00:16.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on dealing with the nuclear
threat follow President
Trump on his trip to Europe.

00:18.900 --> 00:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then: While Republicans work
to salvage their health care
reform bill, we talk with the

00:24.266 --> 00:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
governor of New Hampshire about
what the plan could mean for
the nation's opioid epidemic.

00:28.900 --> 00:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And singing the blues together.

00:35.866 --> 00:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two musical greats join forces
for a new album and tour that's
bringing joy to the blues.

00:42.866 --> 00:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAJ MAHAL, Musician: Our job
as musicians is to help them
get loose and have a good

00:48.266 --> 00:49.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
time and feel good
about themselves.

00:49.900 --> 00:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:53.633 --> 00:57.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:57.933 --> 01:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: From North
Korea today, new defiance.

01:09.133 --> 01:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The communist regime's leader,
Kim Jong-un, insisted that
he will never negotiate away

01:15.300 --> 01:17.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his missile and
nuclear programs.

01:17.366 --> 01:22.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the world's highest
diplomatic body held
an emergency session
on how to get the North

01:22.233 --> 01:24.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do just that.

01:24.233 --> 01:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Correspondent Nick Schifrin
begins our coverage.

01:26.733 --> 01:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: This afternoon
in the U.N. Security Council,
the U.S. tried to rally

01:32.866 --> 01:34.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the world to punish and
isolate North Korea.

01:34.966 --> 01:36.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NIKKI HALEY, U.S. Ambassador
to the United Nations: It is a
dark day, because yesterday's

01:36.466 --> 01:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
actions by North Korea made the
world a more dangerous place.

01:40.900 --> 01:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: U.S. Ambassador
Nikki Haley said North Korea's
test of an intercontinental

01:44.733 --> 01:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ballistic missile requires
a global response.

01:47.300 --> 01:52.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NIKKI HALEY: They have
not had any care for
Russia or China in this.

01:52.233 --> 01:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have not listened to
anything that you have said.

01:54.633 --> 01:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're not going to listen
to anything that you say.

01:57.466 --> 02:01.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it's time that we all
stand together and say, we will
not put up with this action.

02:01.366 --> 02:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Haley is trying
to lead a diplomatic effort to
change North Korean behavior.

02:08.300 --> 02:11.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. needs Chinese and
Russian help, but Beijing and
Moscow have their own strategy.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VLADIMIR SAFRONKOV, Deputy
Russian Ambassador to the United
Nations (through translator):

02:13.366 --> 02:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We call for all interested
states to act with restraint,
rather than provocation
and war-mongering.

02:17.600 --> 02:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LIU JIEYI, Chinese Ambassador
to the United Nations (through
translator): We call on all

02:21.200 --> 02:25.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the concerned parties
to exercise restraint,
avoid provocative
actions and belligerent

02:25.433 --> 02:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rhetoric, and demonstrate the
will for unconditional dialogue.

02:29.033 --> 02:34.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Tuesday's
missile launch crossed
the intercontinental
threshold the U.S. had

02:34.766 --> 02:36.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
been hoping to prevent.

02:36.833 --> 02:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In science terms, the missile
advance was an incremental,
but U.S. officials tell the

02:39.933 --> 02:43.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"NewsHour" it was in a new,
previously unseen configuration.

02:43.366 --> 02:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was fired from a mobile
launcher, had a reentry vehicle,
and was two-stage, as seen

02:48.000 --> 02:49.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on North Korean TV.

02:49.466 --> 02:53.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The immediate American
response was its own launch.

02:53.966 --> 02:58.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The U.S. and South
Korean militaries fired
tactical missiles today
that can be rapidly

02:58.133 --> 03:00.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
deployed.

03:00.233 --> 03:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And South Korea released a
video of what an attack on North
Korea would look like, blowing

03:06.400 --> 03:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up North Korean missiles, and
video game graphics of a South
Korean jet bombing Pyongyang.

03:11.600 --> 03:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, as of now, the focus is
very much on diplomacy and
increasing pressure on North

03:17.633 --> 03:19.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Korea.

03:19.566 --> 03:22.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson
released a statement hours
after the missile launch,

03:22.066 --> 03:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying any country that helps
North Korea is aiding and
abetting a dangerous regime,

03:27.000 --> 03:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that all countries that
all countries must show North
Korea there are consequences

03:30.633 --> 03:33.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to their pursuit
of nuclear weapons.

03:33.266 --> 03:37.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a tweet this morning,
President Trump expressed
frustration that China
hasn't done more, writing:

03:38.333 --> 03:39.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
"So much for China
working with us.

03:39.266 --> 03:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But we had to give it a try."

03:41.033 --> 03:44.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, the administration
is casting a wide net.

03:44.133 --> 03:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Mr. Trump talked with
Egyptian President Abdel
Fattah El-Sisi by phone.

03:51.600 --> 03:54.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Korea sells missile
technology and receives
remittances from Africa
to Southeast Asia.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To try and stop that income,
today, the U.S. delivered a
threat to China and others.

03:58.966 --> 04:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NIKKI HALEY: There are countries
that are allowing, even
encouraging, trade with North

04:03.433 --> 04:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Korea, in violation of U.N.
Security Council resolutions.

04:07.666 --> 04:12.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Such countries would
also like to continue
their trade arrangements
with the United States.

04:12.533 --> 04:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's not going to happen.

04:14.633 --> 04:18.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The U.S. military
in South Korea says it is being
-- quote -- "self-restrained."

04:18.466 --> 04:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That policy will remain until
the diplomacy plays out.

04:21.900 --> 04:24.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Nick Schifrin.

04:24.200 --> 04:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will take a
detailed look at the question
of sanctions and North Korea

04:28.433 --> 04:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
right after the news summary.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news:

up to 100,000 people,
at this weekend's summit
of the leaders of 20 top
industrialized nations.

04:42.233 --> 04:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Last night, police used water
cannons to disperse crowds.

04:45.866 --> 04:50.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today saw hundreds of
people dressed as zombies
staging a peaceful march.

04:50.866 --> 04:55.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tomorrow, activists plan what
they call a Welcome to Hell
March to greet President Trump

04:57.200 --> 04:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the leaders of
Russia, China and Turkey.

Warsaw Square.

05:10.233 --> 05:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

mortar attack on Monday.

05:25.966 --> 05:28.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It happened in Helmand

05:28.500 --> 05:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

killed in Afghanistan this year.

05:35.033 --> 05:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

airstrikes pounded away
today at Raqqa, the
Islamic State's self-styled

05:40.900 --> 05:42.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
capital.

05:42.900 --> 05:46.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kurdish-led militia fighters
backed by U.S. coalition planes
are steadily advancing into

05:47.500 --> 05:49.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the city.

05:49.533 --> 05:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Ray of Independent
Television News is there,
and filed this report.

05:52.333 --> 05:57.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN RAY: Into the
city of Jihadi John and
countless barbarities,
a road stretching back

05:58.700 --> 06:03.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to terror in London,
Manchester, and beyond.

06:03.100 --> 06:05.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It lies in ruins now.

06:05.033 --> 06:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We pass the body of an
ISIS fighter, his caliphate
decomposing with him.

06:11.900 --> 06:16.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Beyond the sand barrier is the
wall of ancient Medina that
has now fallen to the Kurds.

06:18.866 --> 06:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have obtained exclusive
pictures from a drone above
this urban battlefield.

06:24.766 --> 06:27.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They show the devastating
power of the West's
warplanes and missiles.

06:27.766 --> 06:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The so-called Islamic State
is being wiped off the map.

06:34.733 --> 06:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The route to the front line
involves a sprint across sniper
alley, and careful steps over

06:38.966 --> 06:43.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rubble that often
conceals mines.

06:46.533 --> 06:49.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We are close enough
to hear ISIS radio.

06:49.200 --> 06:54.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
"Now is time for jihad,"
a commander urges his
beleaguered forces.

06:55.833 --> 06:58.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Kurds are claiming
this is a great victory.

06:58.400 --> 07:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have taken the Old City
walls after a months-long
blood-soaked slog through the

07:04.133 --> 07:06.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
streets of Raqqa.

07:06.166 --> 07:10.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But ahead of them now,
heavily armed ISIS
fighters, booby-trapped
buildings and suicide

07:12.100 --> 07:13.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bombers.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These soldiers took up arms
against ISIS from the start.

07:16.800 --> 07:19.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They believe they are
moving in for the kill.

07:19.033 --> 07:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RASHO, Kurdish Fighter: I want
a free Raqqa for my family,
for everyone in here, for every

07:24.633 --> 07:25.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
family in Syria.

07:25.833 --> 07:28.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN RAY: Is ISIS
finished in Raqqa now?

07:28.400 --> 07:29.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
RASHO: Yes.

07:29.566 --> 07:32.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's finished.

07:32.133 --> 07:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN RAY: Inside the Old
City, perhaps 100,000
civilians are trapped,
caught between airstrikes

07:38.133 --> 07:40.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and 4,000 ISIS fighters.

07:40.900 --> 07:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Those who can't escape run.

07:43.433 --> 07:48.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Home is this makeshift
camp in the desert.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
"We have left hell
behind," they tell us.

07:54.900 --> 07:58.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But in one corner, separated
from the rest, the brides
and children of is.

07:59.833 --> 08:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Their husbands or fathers
are dead or in jail.

08:03.500 --> 08:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here, ISIS might measure its
future in weeks or months,
but its days are numbered.

08:11.300 --> 08:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That was John Ray
of Independent Television News.

08:15.433 --> 08:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A gunfight between two armed
gangs in Northern Mexico left
at least 14 people dead early

08:21.633 --> 08:23.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

08:23.633 --> 08:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It happened in Chihuahua State,
when members of rival drug
cartels got into a shoot-out.

08:29.600 --> 08:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Drug violence has pushed
homicides in Mexico to their
highest point in 20 years.

08:34.800 --> 08:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pro-government militias in
Venezuela attacked opposition
lawmakers today with sticks and

08:39.433 --> 08:41.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
metal bars.

08:41.066 --> 08:44.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They stormed into the

the Bronx last night.

09:08.766 --> 09:11.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He was killed moments

police in recent years.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said -- quote -- "These
killings must stop."

In economic news, the
European Union and Japan

Still to come on the "NewsHour":
could new economic sanctions
stall North Korea's nuclear

09:50.333 --> 09:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
program?; a change of mind --
a new poll suggests the British
now want to stay in the European

09:56.233 --> 10:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Union; New Hampshire's governor

care bill could affect his

10:02.066 --> 10:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
state's opioid epidemic that
is raging; and much more.

10:16.900 --> 10:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are no easy answers, and
few good options, when it comes
to dealing now with North Korea.

10:23.733 --> 10:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We look at whether new economic
sanctions like those being
considered at the United

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nations could change
the trajectory of
the country's nuclear
ambitions with David Cohen,

10:34.100 --> 10:37.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who served as undersecretary
for terrorism and financial
intelligence at the Treasury

10:39.200 --> 10:41.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Department during the
Obama administration.

10:41.733 --> 10:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also served as the
deputy director of the
Central Intelligence
Agency from 2015 to 2017.

10:48.300 --> 10:52.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And John Mearsheimer, a
West Point graduate and
former Air Force officer,
he writes extensively

10:54.633 --> 10:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on strategic issues and is a
political science professor
at the University of Chicago.

10:59.466 --> 11:01.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He also works with the U.S.
intelligence community.

11:01.466 --> 11:03.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we welcome both of
you to the "NewsHour."

11:03.700 --> 11:06.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I want to start with
you, David Cohen.

11:06.133 --> 11:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We heard in Nick Schifrin's
report Ambassador Nikki
Haley referring to
countries doing business

11:11.400 --> 11:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with North Korea in
violation of U.N. sanctions.

11:14.533 --> 11:16.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is the picture?

11:16.600 --> 11:19.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Give us a picture of the
financial and business
dealings other countries
do right now with

11:19.700 --> 11:21.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the North.

11:21.666 --> 11:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID COHEN, Former U.S.
Undersecretary for Terrorism and
Financial Intelligence: Well,

11:23.700 --> 11:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most of it is illicit, with
the exception of the trade
with China, and that tends to

11:28.166 --> 11:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be in coal, in minerals
and very few other items.

11:35.166 --> 11:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are other countries
around the world, in Africa in
particular, in the Gulf, where

11:40.633 --> 11:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you have North Korean laborers
working and where you have
North Korea selling weapons

11:46.366 --> 11:48.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to these countries.

11:48.466 --> 11:52.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is in violation of U.N.
Security Council resolutions and
in violations of the sanctions.

11:54.500 --> 11:58.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And those transactions
tend to flow through
financial institutions
in China in a way that

12:01.500 --> 12:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is intended to be disguised
from the international
community, because they
are illicit transactions.

12:08.433 --> 12:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, you have
written that new sanctions could
be written, could be enacted

12:12.000 --> 12:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a way that would put
real pressure on the North.

12:14.933 --> 12:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What would those look like?

12:17.033 --> 12:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID COHEN: Well, what they
would look like are sanctions
principally focused on Chinese

12:22.933 --> 12:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
front companies and Chinese
institutions that are
facilitating this illicit trade.

12:29.966 --> 12:34.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If you look at the way
that North Korea engages
with the world today,
there are a few nodes,

12:36.033 --> 12:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
20, 40, 100 nodes, but it's a
limited sets of these companies
and these financial institutions

12:43.200 --> 12:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in China where the bulk of
the financial activity occurs.

12:48.166 --> 12:53.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We could focus on those nodes,
squeeze those nodes, and as a
result of that, squeeze North

12:55.000 --> 12:56.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Korea.

12:56.700 --> 12:57.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, John
Mearsheimer, you have
taken a look at this.

12:57.666 --> 12:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you think that could work?

12:59.800 --> 13:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN MEARSHEIMER, University
of Chicago: No, I don't think
sanctions will work, Judy, and

13:02.733 --> 13:04.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think there are
two reasons for that.

13:04.833 --> 13:08.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
One is that North Korea
is not going to give
up its nuclear weapons.

13:08.566 --> 13:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Indeed, it would be crazy to
give up its nuclear weapons.

13:12.533 --> 13:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The United States is interested
in regime change, and nuclear
weapons are the ultimate

13:16.800 --> 13:18.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
deterrent.

13:18.833 --> 13:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you would have to inflict
enormous pain on North Korea
to get it to give up those

13:25.266 --> 13:27.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nuclear weapons.

13:27.300 --> 13:31.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, you would really
have to put tremendous
economic pressure on them.

13:33.233 --> 13:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you cannot do that, in
large part because the Chinese
will not allow you to do it.

13:37.933 --> 13:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For China, North Korea is
a vital strategic asset.

13:40.266 --> 13:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For China, it's imperative
that the North Korean regime
remain in place and that the

13:45.200 --> 13:47.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
regime not be toppled.

13:47.200 --> 13:51.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Therefore, if we try to put
really significant pressure,
economic pressure, on Pyongyang,

13:53.966 --> 13:58.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Chinese will just move in
and counter it and make sure
that the North Korean regime

13:59.600 --> 14:00.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
survives.

14:00.466 --> 14:02.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me...

14:02.500 --> 14:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN MEARSHEIMER: And, again,
that regime is determined
to keep its nuclear weapons.

14:03.700 --> 14:05.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David
Cohen, what about that?

14:05.700 --> 14:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID COHEN: Well, John's right
that the North Korean regime
looks at the nuclear weapons

14:11.333 --> 14:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
programs as the guarantor
of regime survival.

14:15.200 --> 14:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there is the possibility
that there is a wedge that can
be driven between the nuclear

14:21.833 --> 14:25.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
weapons program and
Kim Jong-un's desire
to stay in power.

14:25.333 --> 14:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the way to drive that
wedge is by putting coercive,
diplomatic and economic pressure

14:33.766 --> 14:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on the regime in North Korea.

14:36.400 --> 14:40.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We will need China to
make this effective.

14:40.300 --> 14:41.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We cannot do it over
China's objections.

14:41.933 --> 14:43.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But his
point is China won't do it.

14:43.666 --> 14:46.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVID COHEN: Well, I
think we have not fully
tested that proposition.

14:46.900 --> 14:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one of the purposes served
by the sanctions that were done
last week and the sanctions

14:53.866 --> 14:57.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we can do is to encourage
China to take this more
seriously and to work with us.

14:59.900 --> 15:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John
Mearsheimer, why can't that
be -- why can't that happen?

15:02.300 --> 15:04.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN MEARSHEIMER: Well, let
me respond to David's point.

15:04.866 --> 15:06.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sure.

15:06.833 --> 15:10.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN MEARSHEIMER: What President
Trump wanted to do was, he
wanted to get the Chinese to

15:10.600 --> 15:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
put significant pressure on
North Korea to stop these
nuclear tests and to reach some

15:17.500 --> 15:21.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sort of modus vivendi
with the United States.

15:21.333 --> 15:24.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the Chinese
could not do that.

15:24.066 --> 15:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the reason the Chinese
could not do that and the reason
they won't be able to implement

15:28.933 --> 15:33.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
David's suggested policy
is because the Chinese
have remarkably little
leverage over North

15:36.266 --> 15:37.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Korea.

15:37.533 --> 15:39.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the North Koreans
fully understand that.

15:39.533 --> 15:44.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the North Koreans don't
play along with the Chinese
when they put pressure on them,

15:46.133 --> 15:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because the North Koreans fully
understand that the Chinese
need North Korea to survive.

15:51.333 --> 15:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And once the North Koreans
understand that, it gives them
significant room to basically

15:55.866 --> 15:57.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
poke the Chinese in the eye.

15:57.900 --> 16:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, David Cohen,
what about his point that North
Korea -- that China really

16:00.433 --> 16:03.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
does have limited leverage,
not as much as I think some
people have been thinking?

16:03.966 --> 16:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID COHEN: They actually have
quite a lot of leverage, in
both the illicit and the illicit

16:10.900 --> 16:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - sorry -- the licit and
the illicit financial activity
that goes in North Korea.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They can squeeze North
Korea on the coal sales.

16:17.400 --> 16:21.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They can squeeze North
Korea on their illicit
financial activity.

16:21.233 --> 16:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They will do it to an
extent that doesn't
cause a destabilizing
situation in North Korea,

16:28.200 --> 16:32.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but they can do it in a way
that can make North Korea
more interested in a potential

16:32.600 --> 16:34.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
negotiation.

16:34.566 --> 16:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So you're
talking about threading a
needle here, John Mearsheimer.

16:37.566 --> 16:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It sounds like we're talking
about something in between doing
nothing and doing a lot more.

16:42.233 --> 16:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN MEARSHEIMER: Well, you
can do a little bit more, but
the point is to make the North

16:47.000 --> 16:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Koreans give up their nuclear
weapons, you have to put a
great deal of pain, a great

16:53.266 --> 16:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
deal of punishment on them.

16:55.400 --> 17:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Chinese are not going
to play that game, because the
Chinese are heavily dependent

17:01.466 --> 17:03.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on maintaining a
sovereign North Korea.

17:03.966 --> 17:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the last thing they want
to do is see the West bring
North Korea to its knees, and

17:08.633 --> 17:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then see North Korea crumble,
and run the risk of South
Korea incorporating North Korea

17:14.900 --> 17:16.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into a greater Korea.

17:16.433 --> 17:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This would be a strategic
disaster for the Chinese.

17:18.933 --> 17:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is why we have so
little leverage over North
Korea when we try to go through

17:24.533 --> 17:25.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Chinese.

17:25.466 --> 17:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about that?

17:27.533 --> 17:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID COHEN: Well, I think
that John and I agree that it
would require an extraordinary

17:32.533 --> 17:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
amount of pressure to bring
the North Koreans to the table.

17:34.900 --> 17:37.033 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
My point is that
we ought to try.

17:37.033 --> 17:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The alternative is to sort of
accept a North Korea with a
nuclear weapon, with an ICBM.

There is the potential
that we can use pressure
working with the Chinese
to thread that needle

17:51.266 --> 17:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to bring the North Koreans
to the table and to find
a way to denuclearize
the Korean Peninsula,

17:57.333 --> 18:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which the Chinese have been very
clear about for many years is
also their policy preference,

18:02.166 --> 18:04.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is a denuclearized
Korean Peninsula.

18:04.266 --> 18:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And to bring --
perhaps this would bring them
to the table to talk in that

18:07.800 --> 18:08.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID COHEN: Correct.

18:10.266 --> 18:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
we're not going to resolve...

18:10.933 --> 18:11.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

18:11.800 --> 18:13.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Go ahead.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think what we agree -- John
Mearsheimer, quick comment?

18:14.500 --> 18:16.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN MEARSHEIMER: Yes,
just very quickly.

18:16.500 --> 18:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's assume that David's
right, and we can put tremendous
pressure on the North Koreans.

18:21.733 --> 18:23.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do we really want to do that?

18:23.766 --> 18:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do we want to back a
nuclear-armed state run by
Kim Jong-un into a corner?

18:29.600 --> 18:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Isn't that the most likely
scenario where they might use
nuclear weapons, when they're

18:32.666 --> 18:34.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
desperate?

18:34.700 --> 18:38.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID COHEN: Well, I think
the most likely scenario is if
we threaten them militarily.

18:38.166 --> 18:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it's very
important we exercise restraint
militarily in the short-term.

18:42.200 --> 18:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think this is a long-term
plan that needs to be
implemented smartly, but
it can be accomplished.

18:49.166 --> 18:51.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I think what
everybody agrees is, there
is a lot at stake here.

18:51.700 --> 18:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
David Cohen, John
Mearsheimer, thank you both.

18:59.633 --> 19:04.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN MEARSHEIMER:
You're welcome.

19:06.633 --> 19:11.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In what
was perhaps the most
consequential decision
in Britain this century,

19:14.633 --> 19:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voters are now having second
thoughts about their choice
to leave the European Union.

19:19.133 --> 19:24.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A new opinion poll shows
a majority of British
people now want to stay,
and business leaders

19:26.166 --> 19:29.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are warning their once
flourishing economy
will flounder unless
the right compromise

19:31.266 --> 19:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is reached with the E.U.
during exit negotiations.

19:33.400 --> 19:37.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Add to that a deeply
divided government after
the recent election has
left a hung Parliament,

19:39.300 --> 19:43.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and it has become harder for
many to keep calm and carry on.

MALCOLM BRABANT: Aldeburgh
in Eastern England,
this is Brexit beach.

19:50.766 --> 19:55.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The town's centuries'
old fishing tradition
is on its deathbed.

19:57.666 --> 20:00.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In common with kindred coastal
communities around the country,
fishermen voted to leave

20:00.866 --> 20:02.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the European Union.

20:02.900 --> 20:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They believe excessive
regulation from Brussels
is killing their industry.

One year after Britain's
so-called independence
day, Mark Foreman is
worried that the country's

20:12.633 --> 20:15.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
commitment to
Brexit is wavering.

20:15.133 --> 20:18.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK FOREMAN, Fisherman:
I thought that would
improve the fishing
situation, but now I have

20:18.500 --> 20:20.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
got my doubts.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I would have still come out
anyway for anything else.

20:21.533 --> 20:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want the country to be run by
British people, not by the E.U.

20:25.100 --> 20:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there's too many
people who are in power who
are against Brexit, and I think

20:29.600 --> 20:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there are so many people
with money tied up in Europe.

20:32.666 --> 20:36.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They just don't
want to come out.

20:36.833 --> 20:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The government
has promised to revitalize the
fishing industry post-Brexit,

20:41.366 --> 20:45.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but, in the current climate,
Kirk Stripling fears betrayal.

20:45.633 --> 20:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KIRK STRIPLING, Fisherman:
I'm really afraid that we
will be sold down the river.

20:48.600 --> 20:51.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They will do a deal
over something else and
sacrifice us fishermen.

20:51.400 --> 20:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're in a ludicrous situation,
where we only catch what is in
season at the time and which

20:56.200 --> 20:58.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is on our doorstep.

20:58.333 --> 21:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And quite often, we can have
loads of the fish in the sea
right here and we have got

21:01.700 --> 21:03.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
no quota to catch it.

21:03.200 --> 21:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we sit here and starve to
death, while the fish swim by.

21:06.633 --> 21:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Polar opposite
views about Europe prevail
80 miles away in Cambridge,

21:11.233 --> 21:15.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a historic seat of
learning and innovation.

21:15.000 --> 21:20.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is Britain's
Silicon Valley, whose
ethos is that science is
collaborative and requires

21:21.100 --> 21:24.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an international,
frontier-free mentality.

21:24.366 --> 21:29.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But campus director
Professor Michael Wakelam
fears its cutting-edge
biotech research and

21:29.300 --> 21:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
development could be jeopardized
by what some perceive as the
xenophobic nature of Brexit.

21:36.366 --> 21:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL WAKELAM, Professor: We
will have a reduced access to
the talent pool within Europe.

21:39.133 --> 21:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, secondly, what Brexit
says about our approach as a
country is that people no longer

21:45.666 --> 21:48.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
want to work with us.

21:48.266 --> 21:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a perception
that Britain is no longer
a welcoming place for
talented people to come.

MALCOLM BRABANT: Cambridge-based
entrepreneur David Cleevely
specializes in turning great

21:57.600 --> 21:59.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ideas into profitable
businesses.

21:59.800 --> 22:04.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A self-proclaimed angel
investor, he disputes
the Brexit mantra that
leaving the E.U. would

22:06.766 --> 22:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
enable British companies
to exploit untapped markets
in the rest of the world.

22:10.233 --> 22:13.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID CLEEVELY, Entrepreneur:
We do business in some of the
most difficult countries, in

22:13.100 --> 22:17.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pakistan, or in Nigeria
or other countries, for
example, in South America.

22:17.666 --> 22:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the amount of extra margin
there is there for increasing
those exports is, quite frankly,

22:25.000 --> 22:27.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
limited.

22:27.033 --> 22:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My concern about Brexit is
that we have a big market just
a few miles away, and we're

22:32.433 --> 22:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not going to be able to access
it as freely as we could before.

22:35.833 --> 22:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: According
to a new opinion poll, the
result of the Brexit referendum

22:40.433 --> 22:43.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would be reversed if
it was held today.

22:43.666 --> 22:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The survey showed that a clear
majority, 54 percent, would vote
to remain within the European

22:48.333 --> 22:52.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Union, and 46 percent
would decide to leave.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's quite clear that many
Britons regret the decision
they made last year, and perhaps

22:55.900 --> 22:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wish that the Brexit
mechanism could be reversed.

22:59.966 --> 23:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
According to experts, that's
technically possible, but
it's unlikely to happen.

23:04.433 --> 23:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At Trinity College,
professor Catherine
Barnard believes the recent
election, which left Britain

23:09.333 --> 23:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a minority government,
has further undermined
its hand during protracted
talks to withdraw

23:15.066 --> 23:17.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from Europe.

23:17.066 --> 23:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CATHERINE BARNARD, Trinity
College: In reality, the U.K.
is in a somewhat weak bargaining

23:20.100 --> 23:22.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
position.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The famous phrase is to have
your cake and eat it, that
it would be possible both to

23:24.366 --> 23:28.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
leave the European
Union, but have the
best bits of membership.

23:28.400 --> 23:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's always been clear that
the E.U. wasn't going to allow
this, because why would they?

23:32.733 --> 23:37.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's not in the E.U.'s
interests for a country
to do what the U.K. did.

23:37.000 --> 23:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it's in the E.U.'s
interests, as Chancellor
Merkel has said, is
to look after the E.U.

23:43.133 --> 23:45.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
27, which means being
tough on the U.K.

MALCOLM BRABANT: This monument

of London, which wiped out

23:49.300 --> 23:52.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
much of England's
capital in 1666.

23:52.800 --> 23:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many economists fear that Brexit
will have a similar impact on
the city of London, Europe's

23:57.433 --> 23:59.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

24:04.166 --> 24:05.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Brexit.

24:05.166 --> 24:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Others may join the exodus.

Jens Torpe is the Danish
publisher of a daily
business newspaper.

24:20.033 --> 24:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENS TORPE, Newspaper
Publisher: I think,
inevitably, that a number
of bankers and institutions

24:24.600 --> 24:26.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would have to move
over to the continent.

24:26.733 --> 24:29.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's about half-a-million
people working here.

24:29.300 --> 24:33.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think you would see at
least some 50,000 moving out.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think it's going
to have quite dramatic
implications for the city.

Some traders favor a so-called
soft Brexit, which would permit
the continued free movement

25:03.200 --> 25:05.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of goods and people
from the continent.

25:05.233 --> 25:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A hard Brexit would mean the
reimposition of import tariffs
and restrict the migration

25:20.766 --> 25:25.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I am trying to remain
positive, and I really hope
that nothing is going to change,

25:27.166 --> 25:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because it's not in the

MALCOLM BRABANT: Thea Wunder

Austria, and she fears customs

25:37.800 --> 25:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
duty resulting from a
hard Brexit would compound
price increases on her
meat products, caused

25:42.466 --> 25:45.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by the British currency dropping
in value after the referendum.

25:45.266 --> 25:50.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THEA WUNDER, Vendor: So the
exchange rate, it has already
affected it, so the euro has

25:51.400 --> 25:52.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
much more value
than it used to be.

25:52.900 --> 25:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I already -- the business
already loses money on that.

25:56.066 --> 26:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's only so much we
can put our prices up to be
still fair and competitive.

26:03.600 --> 26:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Britain's
tourism and hospitality
industry generates 10
percent of the nation's

26:08.366 --> 26:10.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
income.

26:10.366 --> 26:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It relies heavily on foreign
workers; 25 percent of the three
million people in this field

26:15.233 --> 26:16.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
comes from the European Union.

The duty manager Bashir Issa
is originally from Somalia.

26:19.733 --> 26:22.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BASHIR ISSA, Duty Manager:
British people are not working
in the industry, and we need

26:22.933 --> 26:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to have the European community
or anywhere else in the
world coming to us with their

26:29.333 --> 26:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
expertise, helping us
and the industry to grow.

26:31.933 --> 26:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The
industry wants to preserve
freedom of movement, and
is lobbying the government

26:35.266 --> 26:36.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hard.

26:36.266 --> 26:38.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Spokesman Vernon Hunte:

26:38.766 --> 26:40.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VERNON HUNTE, Hospitality
Industry Spokesman: We
believe that the economy
must be put first,

26:40.866 --> 26:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the British industry,
especially, of course, from
our perspective, hospitality

26:43.933 --> 26:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
businesses, their needs and
requirements are put first.

26:46.333 --> 26:48.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK WARD, Britain: Independent
doesn't mean isolated.

26:48.800 --> 26:50.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's an interactive
independence.

26:50.866 --> 26:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where do people get this idea
that, when you're independent,
you're closing your doors?

26:55.500 --> 26:57.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They're mad.

26:57.100 --> 27:00.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Nick
Ward relishes the
freedom of motorcycling.

27:00.666 --> 27:04.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Independence and national
sovereignty drive his
continued support for Brexit.

27:04.466 --> 27:08.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NICK WARD: There's more
to it than economics.

27:08.000 --> 27:13.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What Brexit actually means is
that you want to control your
own borders and you want to

27:13.733 --> 27:15.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
make your own laws.

27:15.233 --> 27:18.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is your starting
point for negotiations.

27:18.700 --> 27:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why do so many people want to
come here in the first place?

27:21.366 --> 27:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Britain is probably the
least racist or xenophobic
country in all of Europe.

27:26.333 --> 27:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Try being black and
playing football in Poland.

27:28.900 --> 27:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want to interact and
we want to maintain this
beautiful island for
everybody and generations

27:35.833 --> 27:37.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to come.

27:37.866 --> 27:41.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: British
attitudes towards
Europe are turning, as
people belatedly agree

27:41.333 --> 27:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the so-called remainers
that pre-referendum,
pro-Brexit rhetoric was flawed.

27:48.866 --> 27:52.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Business leaders hope
the prospect of economic
trouble will convince the
government to compromise

27:52.066 --> 27:53.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Brussels.

27:53.566 --> 27:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On Brexit beach, Britain's
schisms are as deep as ever.

27:57.000 --> 28:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant in Aldeburgh.

28:08.366 --> 28:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

28:12.333 --> 28:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
the toll insecticides
are having on bees; two
renowned blues musicians

28:19.966 --> 28:24.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
team up on a new album; and
what it's like to be the
first Muslim cover girl.

28:26.933 --> 28:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, let's turn to
the Senate Republican bill to
overhaul parts of Obamacare.

28:33.333 --> 28:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Senate may be in recess
this week, but Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell is working

28:37.033 --> 28:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
behind the scenes to craft a
bill that will appeal to enough
Republican votes to pass.

28:43.966 --> 28:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the key stumbling blocks,
the provision to cut Medicaid
spending by more than $770

28:49.400 --> 28:51.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
billion over 10 years.

28:51.866 --> 28:56.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That has sparked serious
concern among many governors,
among other reasons, over what

28:58.433 --> 29:01.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
it could mean for opioid
abuse treatment and
related health needs.

29:01.466 --> 29:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Medicaid expansion under
the Affordable Care Act
provided new coverage to many.

29:08.733 --> 29:11.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reportedly, Senator McConnell
has been considering
a $45 billion fund to
deal with opioid abuse.

29:13.666 --> 29:16.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
New Hampshire is one state
that is dealing with a crisis.

29:16.966 --> 29:21.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has the second highest
rate of opioid deaths
relative to its population.

29:21.766 --> 29:26.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke with the state's
Republican governor, Christopher
Sununu, a short time ago, and

29:26.466 --> 29:30.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
started by asking him why he
doesn't support the current
Republican Senate proposal.

29:30.466 --> 29:32.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

29:32.500 --> 29:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS SUNUNU (R), New Hampshire:
Well, I think it's important
to start off by understanding

29:34.500 --> 29:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Obamacare has failed,
it is not sustainable,
it is not affordable.

29:38.933 --> 29:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Specifically here in New
Hampshire, the health care
exchange is really on the brink.

29:42.100 --> 29:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're looking at upwards
of 40 percent cost
increases to individuals.

29:46.033 --> 29:48.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's just not
affordable to anyone.

29:48.066 --> 29:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I do applaud the Senate
and the House's efforts and the
Trump administration's efforts

29:51.800 --> 29:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to really take Obamacare as
a reform that has to happen.

29:58.866 --> 30:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That being said, what they're
really doing here is, they're
kind of conflating two issues.

30:00.933 --> 30:05.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're looking at Medicaid,
traditional Medicaid entitlement
reform, which absolutely has to

30:05.166 --> 30:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be a viable discussion in
Congress, and Obamacare reform.

30:08.033 --> 30:10.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they're really
putting the two together.

30:10.566 --> 30:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's the end result there.

30:12.833 --> 30:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The cost implications, if you
will, are really drastic to
the state of New Hampshire.

30:16.833 --> 30:20.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You're looking at over
$1.5 billion at best
over the next 10 years.

30:20.433 --> 30:22.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's not just a challenge
for us in the state.

30:22.566 --> 30:23.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not practical.

30:23.566 --> 30:24.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's just not practical at all.

30:24.833 --> 30:27.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have no sales tax,
we have no income tax.

30:27.066 --> 30:32.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't have the taxes to
raise, nor would we ever want
to, like other states do.

30:33.233 --> 30:34.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So we have to find a
better solution there.

30:34.466 --> 30:36.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So I commend them for
taking up the challenge.

30:36.500 --> 30:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But right now, as it sits, the
Senate plan is not a viable
solution for this state.

30:40.433 --> 30:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Governor,
specifically with regard to
the opioid use crisis in your

30:47.466 --> 30:50.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
state of New Hampshire,
what would this bill, this
proposal mean for that?

30:50.466 --> 30:52.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

30:52.533 --> 30:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS SUNUNU: Well, we have been
on kind of ground zero, if you
will, for the opioid crisis.

30:56.266 --> 30:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have one of the fastest
growing economies, one of
the best qualities of life.

30:59.566 --> 31:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because we are a small state,
that allows us to be very
innovative in our approach.

31:03.833 --> 31:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we have been able to
sustain great success in the
state, in spite of the opioid

31:08.100 --> 31:10.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
crisis.

31:10.033 --> 31:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But part of that, when you
look whether it's Medicaid
expansion or other programs that

31:12.600 --> 31:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have allowed individuals to
get care, recovery services,
medical care that they otherwise

31:19.566 --> 31:22.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may not have -- would have been
able to receive, that has been
a big boon for our state and

31:22.266 --> 31:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's been a big boost to those
individuals and allowed those
doors to be opened to them

31:26.600 --> 31:29.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in ways that otherwise
it wouldn't have.

31:29.200 --> 31:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when you look at both
the cost implications,
how Medicaid expansion
right now as it's proposed

31:33.233 --> 31:37.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to being winnowed down, if
you will, over the next few
years, again, those costs are

31:37.866 --> 31:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
real severe and they're again
something that just is not
practical for the state of New

31:42.566 --> 31:45.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hampshire.

31:45.133 --> 31:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What would
it mean to the program
that you have in place
now in New Hampshire?

31:46.433 --> 31:48.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

31:48.566 --> 31:51.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS SUNUNU: Well, when you
look at folks that are coming
through recovery or treatment

31:51.166 --> 31:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or folks that are looking
to fight that addiction,
you have remember
addiction with opioids is

31:53.833 --> 31:55.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not something that you get
through in a couple of years.

31:55.866 --> 31:57.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a lifelong struggle.

31:57.933 --> 32:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a lifelong kind of battle,
if you will, that folks have
to have the programs in place

32:03.600 --> 32:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not just for six months or a
year, but for the long-term.

32:05.400 --> 32:07.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we have to have
those recovery programs.

32:07.366 --> 32:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have to have those
treatment options in place.

32:09.633 --> 32:14.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
With opioid addiction
comes some very severe
medical conditions as
well, whether liver

32:15.766 --> 32:17.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or heart issues
that come with that.

32:17.666 --> 32:19.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Right now, we're
able to treat those.

32:19.633 --> 32:23.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're able to be preventative
with a lot of those, as opposed
to just allowing the old

32:23.000 --> 32:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way of doing things where
everyone would just pile
into the emergency room.

32:26.100 --> 32:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, going back, taking instead
of one or two steps back,
but three or four steps back,

32:33.133 --> 32:37.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all the way to the point where
we're cutting services that,
pre-Obamacare, were in place,

32:39.066 --> 32:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right, we're looking for a
system that, for New Hampshire
at least, is worse than there

32:40.933 --> 32:43.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
were even pre-Obamacare.

32:43.033 --> 32:46.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So my message to the
Senate is very clear.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Look at Obamacare reform as is.

32:47.966 --> 32:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Look at that program, what
we can do to reform it.

32:51.133 --> 32:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Understand that the opioid
crisis is affecting a lot of
states, not just New Hampshire.

32:55.100 --> 32:57.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Understand what those
implications might be.

32:57.266 --> 33:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not just in the funding,
but it's in the flexibilities
that states have to have.

33:00.433 --> 33:01.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

33:01.366 --> 33:02.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

33:02.866 --> 33:04.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRIS SUNUNU: You have to
have a flexible system.

33:04.866 --> 33:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And being able to do that
will allow us as governors to
implement the programs that much

33:07.066 --> 33:09.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
easier.

33:09.100 --> 33:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, it's
been reported, as I think you
know, that the Senate majority

33:11.500 --> 33:16.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
leader, Mitch McConnell,
is looking at possibly
adding something like
$45 billion to deal

33:18.000 --> 33:22.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with opioid abuse around the
country over a period of years.

33:22.466 --> 33:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Would that make a difference?

33:23.533 --> 33:25.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

33:25.600 --> 33:28.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS SUNUNU: When you look
at $45 billion to deal with
the opioid crisis, absolutely

33:28.600 --> 33:29.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's going to
make a difference.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no doubt about it.

33:31.666 --> 33:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it's money going in to kind
of hopefully get votes in the
Senate bill, that's a different

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issue.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm not going to sign onto that.

33:38.633 --> 33:40.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But there is no doubt
that more resources
would help this crisis.

33:40.833 --> 33:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It allows recovery centers to
have more longer-term programs,
open up treatment options.

33:45.300 --> 33:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can break down some
of the permitting process
to get more of those beds
open for individuals,

33:49.500 --> 33:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
peer-to-peer recovery services.

33:51.533 --> 33:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have been able to be very,
very innovative here in New
Hampshire, really on the cutting

33:56.066 --> 33:58.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
edge.

33:58.166 --> 34:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's how we have been
able to sustain such a growing
economy, such a high quality

34:00.366 --> 34:02.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of life, in spite of the crisis.

34:02.466 --> 34:06.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't want to start throwing
a wrench in those gears right
now and slow down the incredible

34:06.700 --> 34:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
process we have been able
to make in New Hampshire.

34:08.666 --> 34:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I ask you about
that money because specifically
other governors, I know

34:12.033 --> 34:16.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Kasich of Ohio and others
who have an opioid crisis in
their own states, have said

34:16.900 --> 34:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's just not enough money
to make a difference over
a long number of years.

34:21.533 --> 34:23.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

34:23.566 --> 34:26.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS SUNUNU: Well, as I said
earlier, you know, this is
something that is not going

34:26.166 --> 34:27.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to get solved in the
next couple of years.

34:27.733 --> 34:30.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is going to be a lifetime
issue for a lot of these folks.

34:30.266 --> 34:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to have lifetime-style
programs in place to kind
of ease them not just off of

34:35.100 --> 34:39.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the opioids they're in,
making sure they have
peer-to-peer support
recovery programs, making

34:39.000 --> 34:43.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
sure they can enter the
work force and hopefully
get on better private
insurance plans, as

34:43.366 --> 34:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opposed to just relying
on expanded Medicaid or
the health care exchange.

34:47.133 --> 34:51.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, when you're able to create
systems that work efficiently
-- I'm an engineer by trade.

34:51.666 --> 34:53.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm all about creating
an efficient system.

34:53.933 --> 34:57.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you're able to do that
and implement that, there is
a lot of savings you can have

34:57.266 --> 34:58.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the back end.

34:58.533 --> 35:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I do believe dollars can help.

35:00.100 --> 35:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no doubt about that.

35:02.100 --> 35:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when you look at the total
implication of this Senate
bill, $1.5 billion at best

35:06.433 --> 35:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the next 10 years, I don't
mean to sound glib, but $45
billion here and there really

35:13.400 --> 35:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
isn't making the dent and really
making the long-term effects
that we have to be addressing

35:17.000 --> 35:19.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as part of a long-term
Medicaid reform.

35:19.166 --> 35:23.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Governor, one
other thing, the argument that
the Republicans in Congress

35:23.500 --> 35:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have made on Medicaid and
that is -- and the president's
budget director, Mick Mulvaney,

35:30.333 --> 35:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has said Medicaid is
unsustainable on the path that
it's on now, it's grown way too

35:36.033 --> 35:39.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
expensive, it cannot continue
like this, cuts have to come,
there has to be a change in

35:40.366 --> 35:41.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the trajectory.

35:41.100 --> 35:42.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

35:42.633 --> 35:44.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CHRIS SUNUNU: Well,
look, I would absolutely
agree with that.

35:44.966 --> 35:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, Washington is dealing
-- the Senate and the House
and the president are dealing

35:48.100 --> 35:50.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with nearly $20
trillion in debt.

35:50.700 --> 35:55.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That is real money
owed to someone, and
a lot of it oversees.

35:55.266 --> 35:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, our spending over the
last eight years has gone
completely out of control.

35:59.500 --> 36:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they do have
the challenge ahead of
them of reeling that
spending back in, creating

36:03.133 --> 36:04.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more efficient systems.

36:04.833 --> 36:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Reeling it in is one thing.

36:06.900 --> 36:10.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Going above and beyond from
even where we were eight
years ago is another story.

36:10.700 --> 36:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's where we kind of
draw the line and say, look,
let's deal with Obamacare here,

36:15.366 --> 36:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
let's deal with Medicaid
entitlement reform in another
discussion, another discussion

36:19.833 --> 36:24.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that frankly has to probably
be a longer discussion,
have to really get the
input from the states,

36:24.166 --> 36:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nothing that should be rushed.

36:26.600 --> 36:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So if we can deal with
those two issues separately,
I think we can have just
much better outcomes

36:29.433 --> 36:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and a much more viable
solution for all the states.

36:32.733 --> 36:36.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Governor Chris
Sununu of New Hampshire, thank
you very much for talking

36:36.166 --> 36:37.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with us.

36:37.166 --> 36:38.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

36:38.166 --> 36:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRIS SUNUNU: Thank you, Judy.

36:40.233 --> 36:44.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Time now for our
weekly segment on science and
technology, the Leading Edge.

36:53.466 --> 36:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this week, Hari Sreenivasan
is here with an update on a
pair of important stories.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: They are
important findings and analyses
on a pair of stories we have

37:01.966 --> 37:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
long been covering, the
health of bees and the
impacts of climate change.

37:05.500 --> 37:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A recent study looked at
the economic consequences
of climate change and
concluded it will make

37:10.200 --> 37:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the U.S. poorer and more unequal
if present trends continue.

37:14.633 --> 37:16.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The South would be
hit the hardest.

37:16.700 --> 37:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A different set of studies
looked at the health of bees in
connection to insecticides used

37:20.766 --> 37:22.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in crops.

37:22.266 --> 37:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bees are critical for our
global food production.

37:24.500 --> 37:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Honeybees alone are
responsible for pollinating
$15 billion of U.S. crops.

37:31.866 --> 37:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The new papers demonstrated
the popular insecticide
used in agriculture
called neonicotinoids

37:35.333 --> 37:37.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can be harmful to bees.

37:37.466 --> 37:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Miles O'Brien is with us again.

37:39.566 --> 37:43.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Miles, we have been
looking at or scientists
have been thinking
about the chemicals that

37:43.900 --> 37:48.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are used in insecticides as
kind of one of the number one
culprits for colony collapse

37:48.566 --> 37:49.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for a long time.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, what is so new
about these studies?

37:51.066 --> 37:53.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well,
you're right, Hari.

37:53.100 --> 37:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There have been a lot of studies
in the past looking at bees
and these insecticides, which

37:56.433 --> 38:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are coated on the seeds
and absorbed -- they call
it systemic to the plants.

38:03.433 --> 38:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have been widely used for
a decade, an alternative to
spraying insecticides on the

38:05.833 --> 38:07.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
plant as they grow.

38:07.433 --> 38:09.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The concern is that they
can harm pollinators.

38:09.766 --> 38:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, so far, that's only
been a theory in the lab.

38:13.700 --> 38:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Separate teams in Europe and
Canada tested the possible
link between these neonics and

38:18.566 --> 38:21.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bee losses in the field
for the first time.

38:21.066 --> 38:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They placed bee colonies close
to crops that had been treated
with the neonicotinoids and

38:27.200 --> 38:29.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
other colonies far
away from agriculture.

38:29.366 --> 38:33.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They sampled a variety
of specimens, pollen,
nectar, larvae, bees
themselves, of course.

38:35.333 --> 38:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they say the insecticide
is not only found in the crops
they are meant to protect, but

38:38.133 --> 38:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it spreads to other plants in
the area that are attracted
to bees, and it persists for

38:43.733 --> 38:45.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
months.

38:45.800 --> 38:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, how does
it affect the bees, and what
happens to the whole colony?

38:48.000 --> 38:51.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: That's the key
question, connecting those dots.

38:51.166 --> 38:56.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Researchers at York University
in Ontario did a second test
in the laboratory mimicking

38:57.033 --> 38:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what they found in the field.

38:58.933 --> 39:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they exposed bees
to a small amount of the
neonicotinoids-infused pollen.

39:02.400 --> 39:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And those bees stopped --
get this -- maintaining
the hygiene of their hive.

39:07.066 --> 39:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Typically, bees will
remove sick or dead bees.

39:10.433 --> 39:14.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the insecticide-exposed
bees for some reason stopped
doing this, leaving sick bees

39:14.700 --> 39:15.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
inside the hive.

39:15.966 --> 39:19.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the beehive became
a pigsty, if you will.

39:19.000 --> 39:24.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I caught up with Nadejda
Tsvetkov, one of the
lead authors of the
York University study.

39:26.100 --> 39:29.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NADEJDA TSVETKOV, York
University: What we
found in our study was
that worker bees from

39:31.066 --> 39:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exposed colonies die 23
percent sooner, so that's a
very big hit to the colony.

39:38.466 --> 39:40.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They also had abnormal
foraging behaviors.

39:40.100 --> 39:43.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We found also that the
colonies had difficulty
replacing a queen.

39:43.600 --> 39:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, over time, we had more and
more queenless colonies, which,
unless there is an intervention,

39:45.000 --> 39:49.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the colonies will perish.

39:49.966 --> 39:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: At first blush,
this study seems to put to rest
the neonic collapse debate.

39:57.866 --> 40:02.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, in a separate study also
published last week, a European
team found some bee colonies

40:04.766 --> 40:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Germany that thrived even
though they were close to fields
with neonic-treated crops.

40:10.666 --> 40:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This led researchers to believe
there must be other geographical
or environmental factor

40:14.733 --> 40:16.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in play.

40:16.733 --> 40:19.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Maybe some bees are
more susceptible to the
toxins, depending on
their locations, for

40:19.700 --> 40:21.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
example.

40:21.633 --> 40:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In short, the studies suggests
the effects of neonics
on bees are inconsistent.

40:28.066 --> 40:30.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that study was funded
in part by the German
chemical and pharmaceutical
giant Bayer, which

40:31.966 --> 40:34.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
happens to be the maker
of neonicotinoids.

40:34.166 --> 40:39.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, in a statement, Bayer
says it remains convinced that
neonicotinoid seed treatments

40:39.066 --> 40:44.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have no short- or long-term
negative effects on bees, and
that these seed treatments are

40:45.266 --> 40:47.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
useful and effective
tool for farmers.

40:47.333 --> 40:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the
totally different category of
climate science, there was a big

40:51.333 --> 40:53.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
study this week.

40:53.300 --> 40:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, usually, when climate
studies come out, we're looking
at environmental impacts.

40:55.600 --> 40:58.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What was interesting
about this one was, it was
looking at economic impacts.

40:58.800 --> 41:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tell us a little bit about that.

41:00.933 --> 41:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, this
one is a very impressive
study on climate change.

41:04.200 --> 41:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Scientists in the climate realm
teamed up with economists,
the dismal science meeting

41:10.066 --> 41:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
climate science, if you will.

41:12.100 --> 41:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they looked at the economic
impacts of climate change as
you project out to the future.

41:16.133 --> 41:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And perhaps the most interesting
finding was that climate change
will hit different socioeconomic

41:21.866 --> 41:23.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
classes differently.

41:23.866 --> 41:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here's Berkeley scientist
and lead author of the
study Solomon Hsiang.

41:26.766 --> 41:29.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLOMON HSIANG, University of
California, Berkeley: In the
South, where it's hot, and

41:29.166 --> 41:33.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
along the coasts, we
might see populations
losing the equivalent
of 20 percent of their

41:33.733 --> 41:38.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
income, whereas, in the cooler
Northern and Western regions,
we actually see that populations

41:38.300 --> 41:40.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
might benefit a little.

41:40.366 --> 41:44.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And because the North tends
to be wealthier and the South
tends to be poorer, what we

41:44.100 --> 41:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see is that, in the
future, climate change
is going to increase
economic inequality within

41:49.866 --> 41:51.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the United States.

41:51.400 --> 41:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, how
does the U.S. fare overall?

41:53.566 --> 41:57.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, the team
estimates that for each degree
Fahrenheit increase in global

41:57.366 --> 42:02.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
temperatures, the U.S. economy
overall loses about 0.7 percent
of gross domestic product,

42:04.266 --> 42:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with each degree of
warming costing more than
the last as you go up.

42:07.600 --> 42:10.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, the U.S. as a whole is
not a winner economically.

42:10.466 --> 42:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, does
it break down by industry?

42:12.933 --> 42:16.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Say, for example,
agriculture might be hit
harder or real estate?

42:16.433 --> 42:21.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well,
agriculture, especially
in the Midwest, will
likely suffer immensely.

42:21.300 --> 42:23.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That seems obvious.

42:23.333 --> 42:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it could be comparable to
the Dust Bowl of the 1930s,
according to these researchers.

42:28.866 --> 42:30.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Of course, real estate
on the coastline, that's
another obvious one.

42:30.300 --> 42:32.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But here's a surprise.

42:32.433 --> 42:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The team found the biggest
economic impact of climate
change was in health care.

42:39.100 --> 42:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They expect people living
in the South especially
will be hit more with
heat-related complications,

42:42.600 --> 42:44.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like heatstroke.

42:44.666 --> 42:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Managing that and dealing
with the victims is, of
course, very expensive.

42:47.700 --> 42:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And this
is happening to a population
that's already poorer than the

42:52.200 --> 42:53.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
general average in
the United States.

42:53.500 --> 42:55.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: And there
is the vicious cycle.

42:55.333 --> 42:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right.

42:56.633 --> 42:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Miles O'Brien, thanks so much.

42:59.800 --> 43:04.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN:
You're welcome, Hari.

43:06.700 --> 43:11.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight:
A pair of blues greats are
collaborating on a new album

43:14.933 --> 43:16.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and a North American tour.

43:16.966 --> 43:21.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have known each other
for decades, but their joint
project has only recently come

43:21.266 --> 43:22.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to fruition.

43:22.800 --> 43:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

43:26.633 --> 43:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The Chautauqua
Auditorium in Boulder, Colorado
recently, at the start of

43:33.600 --> 43:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a new tour by two musicians
who've been doing this a long
time, but never together.

43:42.666 --> 43:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And while it's called the
blues, 75-year-old Taj Mahal and
65-year-old Keb' Mo' are feeling

43:49.300 --> 43:50.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nothing but joy.

43:50.800 --> 43:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAJ MAHAL, Musician: That's
what we like about music.

43:52.533 --> 43:56.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's why we do music,
to share the fun.

43:56.666 --> 43:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Life brings a lot of strife.

43:59.500 --> 44:01.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In the digital age,
it's even more intense.

44:01.433 --> 44:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And a lot of people don't
know how to get loose of it.

44:04.833 --> 44:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, our job as musicians is to
help them get loose and have a
good time and feel good about

44:11.500 --> 44:13.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
themselves.

44:13.533 --> 44:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Born Henry Saint
Clair Fredericks, Taj Mahal is
a living legend in the world

44:19.433 --> 44:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of roots and blues music, a
singer-songwriter who plays
many instruments and draws from

44:24.366 --> 44:29.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
many musical influences.

44:31.300 --> 44:35.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Kevin Moore, Keb' Mo''s
given name, spent many
years in various R&amp;B,
rock, and pop bands,

44:37.700 --> 44:41.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
until he went out on his own
in the early 1990s and focused
on his first love, the blues,

44:43.466 --> 44:46.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
gaining renown as
a master guitarist,
singer, and songwriter.

44:46.733 --> 44:51.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEB' MO', Musician: It was
like a missing piece that
made everything relevant.

44:51.666 --> 44:56.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what I did was, I took all
of those things that I had been
doing before, those experiences,

44:58.366 --> 45:02.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
took the blues and
wrapped it in there.

45:02.233 --> 45:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And what came out was Keb' Mo'.

45:09.800 --> 45:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, together,
they are TajMo, the name of
their new album, which features

45:17.800 --> 45:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
several songs they co-wrote,
including "Don't Leave Me Here."

45:31.566 --> 45:36.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On "Take a Giant Step," one
of Taj Mahal's earlier songs,
they were joined on stage by

45:37.166 --> 45:41.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his daughters.

45:43.666 --> 45:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then there was the more raw
acoustic duet of "Diving Duck
Blues," a song that Taj Mahal

45:53.566 --> 45:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first recorded on his
debut album back in 1968.

46:00.600 --> 46:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have heard you for a long
time, blues, folk, world

46:16.766 --> 46:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
music, I mean, different
kinds of elements, different
kind of influences.

46:20.600 --> 46:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAJ MAHAL: My grandparents
come from the Caribbean.

46:22.666 --> 46:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I grew up listening to Caribbean
music, as much as I listened
to the Southern gospel.

46:26.500 --> 46:28.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My dad liked bebop.

46:28.433 --> 46:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had bebop and jazz, and
jump blues, you know, and
spirituals, and classical music,

46:34.766 --> 46:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
opera, everything, you know?

46:36.600 --> 46:40.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, it's like it didn't
hurt me because I
heard all those things.

46:40.866 --> 46:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It didn't take away from -- if
I heard a real deep blues song,
I don't care how much ragtime

46:46.966 --> 46:49.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I listen to, that
song's going to get me.

46:49.366 --> 46:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's going to get somebody
else too, if they get
a chance to hear it.

46:53.200 --> 46:58.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KEB' MO': It's a
beautiful -- the beauty
in it is just so deep.

47:00.133 --> 47:02.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I heard the old Muddy
Waters stuff, but, wait a
minute, now, that's what it is.

47:02.466 --> 47:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I could feel the slave
ship coming over the ocean.

47:06.566 --> 47:08.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TAJ MAHAL: Yes.

47:08.033 --> 47:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KEB' MO': I could feel the
Jim Crow, the cotton-picking.

47:10.100 --> 47:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I could feel the sense of
pride welling up in a man out
of his own circumstances, that

47:17.033 --> 47:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he had to rise up out of a
challenging circumstance of
Jim Crow and slavery and stuff.

47:22.866 --> 47:25.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I hear all of that.

47:25.066 --> 47:27.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that resonates universally.

47:27.166 --> 47:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But what you
two have managed to do is make
a life of this, right, without

47:34.166 --> 47:35.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
worrying about
the commercialism?

47:35.166 --> 47:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEB' MO': Yes, commercialism.

47:37.233 --> 47:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's something working in
life and in the universe in the
bigger picture that has nothing

47:42.433 --> 47:45.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to do with commerce and money.

47:45.033 --> 47:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, for me, I found that after
20 years going after money, that
the faster I ran after money,

47:53.633 --> 47:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the faster the money ran.

47:55.533 --> 47:56.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:56.533 --> 47:57.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

47:57.533 --> 47:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That sounds like a blues song.

47:58.933 --> 48:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAJ MAHAL: Yes, yes, the
faster I run after the money...

48:01.833 --> 48:03.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

48:03.900 --> 48:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEB' MO': And so I finally
just got out of breath and
stopped -- stopped running.

48:13.233 --> 48:14.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:14.866 --> 48:16.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, of
course, neither of them
has stopped playing.

48:16.500 --> 48:19.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Together, the sound
they're creating is both
upbeat and uplifting.

48:19.633 --> 48:23.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAJ MAHAL: Did we know
what it was going to
sound like at this point?

48:23.366 --> 48:24.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

48:24.833 --> 48:26.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we knew that it was
going to be something good.

48:26.300 --> 48:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes, we knew it was going
to be something good.

48:27.600 --> 48:29.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, it could have
gone the other way too.

48:29.233 --> 48:31.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I could have said,
Moore, get out of here.

48:31.700 --> 48:32.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:32.933 --> 48:37.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KEB' MO': That's what
I thought might happen.

48:39.800 --> 48:41.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:41.800 --> 48:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: As always,
there's the question of how long
the blues will live on and who

48:47.166 --> 48:49.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will take up the mantle.

48:49.333 --> 48:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Taj Mahal and Keb' Mo' are
supremely confident the music
will take care of itself.

48:54.033 --> 48:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KEB' MO': Taking on the blues
is a big responsibility.

48:56.733 --> 48:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I understand why
people would be concerned.

48:59.166 --> 49:03.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the music and riches
is about happiness.

49:03.133 --> 49:04.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The blues will be fine.

49:04.800 --> 49:06.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAJ MAHAL: Disciples?

49:06.300 --> 49:10.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have got plenty of them.

49:10.600 --> 49:12.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:12.633 --> 49:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Taj Mahal and
Keb' Mo', TajMo, are touring the
country throughout the summer

49:18.233 --> 49:19.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and into the fall.

49:19.800 --> 49:24.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Jeffrey Brown in
Boulder, Colorado.

49:26.700 --> 49:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you -- yes,
you -- can watch Taj Mahal
and Keb' Mo' perform "Diving

49:34.333 --> 49:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Duck Blues" on our Web
site at PBS.org/NewsHour.

49:47.300 --> 49:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now to a "NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught our eye
that might be of interest to

49:52.100 --> 49:54.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you, too.

49:54.166 --> 49:58.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just five years ago, Nura Afia
was a young mother in Denver
who enjoyed watching YouTube

49:59.366 --> 50:01.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
videos while taking
care of her daughter.

50:01.333 --> 50:03.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It turns out it was
time well spent.

50:03.700 --> 50:07.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She began producing her own
videos on how to apply makeup.

50:07.966 --> 50:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now she's a sensation,
becoming the first Muslim
brand ambassador for CoverGirl.

Mary MacCarthy from
Colorado Politics brings
us her story from Denver.

50:19.400 --> 50:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NURA AFIA, Model: CoverGirl
was the big break for me that
I never thought I would get.

50:26.400 --> 50:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was a national beauty
campaign that I never thought
I would see anyone that looks

50:28.800 --> 50:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like me featured in or
anyone that dresses like me.

50:32.633 --> 50:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY MACCARTHY, Colorado
Politics: From this humble home
studio, with her daughter's toys

50:36.066 --> 50:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at her feet, Nura Afia has built
an international following.

50:45.066 --> 50:50.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
With 340,000 followers
on Instagram and over
200,000 subscribers to
her YouTube channel,

50:52.866 --> 50:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the 25-year-old makes a very
good living with these tutorials
on the art of applying makeup,

50:59.366 --> 51:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the benefits of skin care, and
how to wear the Muslim hijab.

51:01.833 --> 51:05.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NURA AFIA: I line the
edge up to my scarf.

51:05.833 --> 51:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I posted I was in the
"Glamour" magazine today.

51:08.666 --> 51:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And someone said,
"Congratulations, paving the way
for Muslim women everywhere."

51:12.566 --> 51:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY MACCARTHY: It was after
Afia built up her own following
online that makeup brands

51:17.500 --> 51:22.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
started reaching out to her.

51:22.400 --> 51:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even though her career has
taken off, Afia admits it's a
complicated time to be a visible

51:28.200 --> 51:30.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Muslim in the U.S.

51:30.300 --> 51:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The atmosphere caused by the
election has made her more
cautious, while, at the same

51:34.833 --> 51:37.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
time, some in her community
have been reaching out.

51:37.700 --> 51:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NURA AFIA: More people, I
feel like, go out of their
way to smile and are nicer.

51:41.400 --> 51:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I feel like that those few
people that are very angry or,
you know, scared of Muslims,

51:51.533 --> 51:53.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they are still few
and far between.

51:53.933 --> 51:58.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARY MACCARTHY: The
wider fashion world
has begun embracing the
hijab, with retail giant

52:00.833 --> 52:04.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
H&amp;M featuring a veiled
model, and Nike recently
launching a hijab sports line.

52:05.466 --> 52:07.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NURA AFIA: Hijab isn't
just how you dress.

52:07.733 --> 52:10.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's supposed to be how you act.

52:10.166 --> 52:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If someone that has never met
a Muslim and they meet me, and
that's their first experience,

52:14.033 --> 52:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm hoping that it's the best
experience, and that wearing
the hijab reminds me that

52:20.666 --> 52:23.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
it needs to be the best
experience for everyone
that comes across me.

52:23.100 --> 52:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY MACCARTHY: Afia hopes the
greater exposure of Islam in the
fashion world will help reduce

52:29.300 --> 52:32.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
negative stereotypes
of Muslim Americans.

52:32.000 --> 52:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Mary MacCarthy in Denver.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And you could
even ask what took us so long.

52:40.566 --> 52:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

resurgent nationalism.

53:05.866 --> 53:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: And authoritarianism
is organic.

53:08.233 --> 53:09.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not artificial.

53:09.766 --> 53:12.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NARRATOR: Built by
and around one man.

53:12.966 --> 53:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Russians told
pollsters that suddenly they
felt like a super power again.

53:17.433 --> 53:19.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NARRATOR: But for
Putin's opponents:

53:19.433 --> 53:23.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: People who have tried
to leave the Putin family
voluntarily have not fared very

53:23.666 --> 53:25.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
well.

53:25.733 --> 53:29.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: A rare look inside
Putin's Russia all next
week on the "PBS NewsHour."
