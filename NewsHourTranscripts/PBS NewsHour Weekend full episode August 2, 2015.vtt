>> Sreenivasan: ON THIS EDITION

00:11.567 --> 00:13.033
FOR SUNDAY, AUGUST 2:

00:13.033 --> 00:14.533
PRESIDENT OBAMA PUSHES FOR

00:14.533 --> 00:16.367
DEEPER CUTS IN PLANET-WARMING

00:16.367 --> 00:18.133
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.

00:18.133 --> 00:20.133
BUT INDUSTRIES VOW TO SUE TO

00:20.133 --> 00:21.733
BLOCK NEW REGULATIONS.

00:21.733 --> 00:23.567
IN OUR SIGNATURE SEGMENT, SOWING

00:23.567 --> 00:25.100
SEEDS OF DIVERSITY IN THE TECH

00:25.100 --> 00:26.833
INDUSTRY, BY TRAINING BLACK AND

00:26.833 --> 00:28.933
HISPANIC TEENS TO CODE.

00:28.933 --> 00:30.200
>> I CAN NOW BUILD SOMETHING AND

00:30.200 --> 00:31.233
BRING IT TO THE TABLE AND SHOW

00:31.233 --> 00:33.000
THIS IS WHAT I'VE DONE.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.733
>> Sreenivasan: AND, TAKING ON

00:34.733 --> 00:36.367
MUSLIM STEREOTYPES... THROUGH

00:36.367 --> 00:37.333
STAND-UP COMEDY.

00:37.333 --> 00:40.533
NEXT ON PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:40.533 --> 00:43.100
>>FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS

00:43.100 --> 00:44.467
IN LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:44.467 --> 00:47.267
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:47.267 --> 00:48.100
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING AND

00:48.100 --> 00:49.633
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:49.633 --> 00:50.533
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS PROPOSING THE

00:50.533 --> 00:51.633
TOUGHEST REGULATIONS IN U.S.

00:51.633 --> 00:52.433
HISTORY TO COMBAT CLIMATE

00:52.433 --> 00:53.333
CHANGE.

00:53.333 --> 00:54.700
IN A VIDEO PREVIEWING TOMORROW'S

00:54.700 --> 00:55.967
ANNOUNCEMENT, THE PRESIDENT SAYS

00:55.967 --> 00:57.033
CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT AN

00:57.033 --> 00:57.833
OPINION, BUT A FACT AND A

00:57.833 --> 00:59.333
THREAT.

00:59.333 --> 01:00.800
HE CALLS POWER PLANTS THE

01:00.800 --> 01:01.900
BIGGEST DOMESTIC SOURCE OF

01:01.900 --> 01:02.900
POLLUTING EMISSIONS THAT

01:02.900 --> 01:04.400
CONTRIBUTE TO GLOBAL WARMING.

01:04.400 --> 01:05.800
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RULE WOULD

01:05.800 --> 01:07.600
REQUIRE EXISTING POWER PLANTS TO

01:07.600 --> 01:09.767
CUT EMISSIONS BY 32% BY THE YEAR

01:09.767 --> 01:12.400
2030, COMPARED TO 2005 LEVELS.

01:12.400 --> 01:13.767
OTHER RULES WOULD LIMIT

01:13.767 --> 01:14.733
CONSTRUCTION OF NEW COAL-BURNING

01:14.733 --> 01:15.667
PLANTS AND REQUIRE MORE USE OF

01:15.667 --> 01:17.200
CLEAN ENERGY SOURCES LIKE WIND

01:17.200 --> 01:18.967
AND SOLAR.

01:18.967 --> 01:20.133
>> WE LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF TOXIC

01:20.133 --> 01:21.400
CHEMICALS-- LIKE MERCURY AND

01:21.400 --> 01:22.800
SULFUR AND ARSENIC-- IN OUR AIR

01:22.800 --> 01:23.767
AND WATER, AND WE'RE BETTER OFF

01:23.767 --> 01:25.333
FOR IT.

01:25.333 --> 01:26.600
BUT EXISTING POWER PLANTS CAN

01:26.600 --> 01:28.433
STILL DUMP UNLIMITED AMOUNTS OF

01:28.433 --> 01:30.000
HARMFUL CARBON POLLUTION INTO

01:30.000 --> 01:31.767
THE AIR WE BREATHE.

01:31.767 --> 01:33.633
FOR THE SAKE OF OUR KIDS, FOR

01:33.633 --> 01:35.333
THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL

01:35.333 --> 01:37.167
AMERICANS, THAT'S ABOUT TO

01:37.167 --> 01:38.633
CHANGE.

01:38.633 --> 01:39.567
>> Sreenivasan: EVERY STATE

01:39.567 --> 01:40.767
WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GIVE THE

01:40.767 --> 01:41.767
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

01:41.767 --> 01:43.333
ITS PLAN FOR CURBING EMISSIONS.

01:43.333 --> 01:44.733
BUT THE RULES FACE OPPOSITION

01:44.733 --> 01:46.700
FROM CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS

01:46.700 --> 01:48.533
AND LAWSUITS FROM THE ENERGY

01:48.533 --> 01:50.733
INDUSTRY AND COAL POWER STATES.

01:50.733 --> 01:52.900
TO DISCUSS OBAMA'S CLIMATE

01:52.900 --> 01:53.900
CHANGE PLAN, I'M JOINED BY "NEW

01:53.900 --> 01:54.767
YORK TIMES" REPORTER GARDINER

01:54.767 --> 01:55.933
HARRIS, WHO IS COVERING THE

01:55.933 --> 02:00.767
STORY IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

02:00.767 --> 02:02.267
SO THESE HAVE TARGETS UNDER THIS

02:02.267 --> 02:04.667
PLAN BUT THEY CAN SET THEIR OWN

02:04.667 --> 02:06.300
WAY TO GET TO THOSE TARGETS

02:06.300 --> 02:07.267
RIGHT?

02:07.267 --> 02:07.933
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

02:07.933 --> 02:10.500
AND THEY CAN SORT OF TAKE TWO

02:10.500 --> 02:13.333
DIFFERENT PATHS, EVEN DO A CAP

02:13.333 --> 02:15.000
AND TRADE PATHWAY WHICH IS

02:15.000 --> 02:16.633
ACTUALLY THE FAVORED PATHWAY BY

02:16.633 --> 02:18.900
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WHICH

02:18.900 --> 02:21.333
STATE'S SORT OF GET TOGETHER IN

02:21.333 --> 02:23.333
A REGIONAL WAY TRY HIT THEIR

02:23.333 --> 02:25.433
TARGETS AND IF ONE STATE GETS A

02:25.433 --> 02:27.467
LOT MORE IN TERMS OF CARBON

02:27.533 --> 02:29.433
REDUCTION IT CAN THEN SELL THAT

02:29.433 --> 02:30.667
CARBON REDUCTION TO A

02:30.667 --> 02:31.900
NEIGHBORING STATE THAT DIDN'T

02:31.900 --> 02:33.567
QUITE HIT ITS TARGET.

02:33.567 --> 02:36.067
THE OTHER WAY TO DO IT IS, THAT

02:36.067 --> 02:38.233
THE STATES COULD SIMPLY REGULATE

02:38.233 --> 02:40.933
THEIR WAY TO THE CUT.

02:40.933 --> 02:43.067
AND REQUIRE REDUCTIONS ON A SORT

02:43.067 --> 02:46.667
OF A PLANT-BY-PLANT BASIS.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.867
AND HARI THIS IS OBVIOUSLY GOING

02:49.867 --> 02:51.300
TO LEAD TO A HUGE POLITICAL

02:51.300 --> 02:52.333
BATTLE.

02:52.333 --> 02:53.733
>> RIGHT AND THE OPPOSITION IS

02:53.733 --> 02:54.967
LINED UP.

02:54.967 --> 02:56.333
CERTAINLY THERE ARE COAL STATES

02:56.333 --> 02:57.400
SUCH AS WEST VIRGINIA THAT ARE

02:57.400 --> 02:59.200
GOING TO PUSH BACK.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.867
SO HOW LONG COULD THIS TAKE?

03:00.867 --> 03:05.967
>> SO I LIVED IN HAZARD,

03:05.967 --> 03:07.467
KENTUCKY FOR MANY, MANY YEARS

03:07.467 --> 03:09.667
OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE IMPORTANT

03:09.667 --> 03:11.533
COAL PRODUCING AREAS OF THE

03:11.533 --> 03:12.500
COUNTRY AND THIS IS GOING TO BE

03:12.500 --> 03:14.467
VERY HARD FOR THOSE PLACES AND

03:14.467 --> 03:17.567
IT'S LIKELY GOING TO LEAD TO THE

03:17.567 --> 03:20.967
SHUTDOWN OF MUCH OF THE COAL

03:20.967 --> 03:22.867
PRODUCING CAPACITY IN THE UNITED

03:22.867 --> 03:26.667
STATES, AT LEAST IN THE

03:26.667 --> 03:28.100
APPALACHIA REGION.

03:28.100 --> 03:30.200
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT, STATES HAVE TO

03:30.200 --> 03:32.500
COME UP WITH THEIR PLANS WITH

03:32.500 --> 03:35.367
THE GOAL FOR THESE REDUCTIONS TO

03:35.367 --> 03:36.833
BEGIN BITING IN 2022.

03:36.833 --> 03:39.333
>> THE OPPOSITION SAYS THIS IS

03:39.333 --> 03:41.067
GOING TO RAISE PRICES FOR

03:41.067 --> 03:42.867
UTILITY CONSUMERS, ENERGY

03:42.867 --> 03:43.333
CONSUMERS.

03:43.333 --> 03:44.333
THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT WILL

03:44.333 --> 03:45.333
LOWER PRICES.

03:45.333 --> 03:46.767
HOW DO WE FIGURE THIS OUT?

03:46.767 --> 03:48.933
>> WHAT THIS RULE WILL DO IS

03:48.933 --> 03:49.867
ACCELERATE CHANGES THAT ARE

03:49.867 --> 03:51.233
ALREADY GOING ON IN THE MARKET.

03:51.233 --> 03:56.933
I MEAN, THE COAL POWERED POWER

03:56.933 --> 03:58.433
PLANT IS GOING AWAY ALREADY.

03:58.433 --> 04:01.233
BECAUSE COMB IS ACTUALLY FAIRLY

04:01.233 --> 04:03.267
EXPENSIVE, COMPARED TO, RIGHT

04:03.267 --> 04:06.167
NOW, NATURAL GAS WHICH IS ALMOST

04:06.167 --> 04:08.100
FREE BECAUSE OF THE ABUNDANCE OF

04:08.100 --> 04:09.733
GAS IN FRACKING.

04:09.733 --> 04:11.233
THERE ARE SOME PLACES THAT ARE

04:11.233 --> 04:12.933
CLEARLY, THIS IS GOING TO BE

04:12.933 --> 04:15.100
MORE EXPENSIVE, SOME PLACES OUT

04:15.100 --> 04:19.967
WEST, SOME PLACES IN APPALACHIA

04:19.967 --> 04:22.633
THAT DEPEND HEAVILY ON COAL

04:22.633 --> 04:23.467
FOURTH POWER PLANTS.

04:23.467 --> 04:26.333
THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE

04:26.333 --> 04:28.267
SOME FAIRLY WRENCHING

04:28.267 --> 04:29.067
TRANSITIONS.

04:29.067 --> 04:32.800
>> ALL RIGHT, GARDINER HARRIS,

04:32.800 --> 04:34.400
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.

04:34.400 --> 04:41.467
>> HAPPY TO BE WITH YOU HARI.

04:41.467 --> 04:42.400
>> Sreenivasan: MAJOR

04:42.400 --> 04:43.400
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES ARE

04:43.400 --> 04:44.333
REPORTEDLY RECRUITING THOUSANDS

04:44.333 --> 04:45.200
OF RECREATIONAL DRUG USERS TO

04:45.200 --> 04:46.000
TEST A NEW GENERATION OF

04:46.000 --> 04:46.967
MEDICINES THAT DETER ADDICTION.

04:46.967 --> 04:47.933
THE IMPACT OF THE NEW MEDS COULD

04:47.933 --> 04:48.600
BE SIGNIFICANT.

04:48.600 --> 04:49.333
THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG

04:49.333 --> 04:50.333
ADMINISTRATION CALLS

04:50.333 --> 04:51.467
PRESCRIPTION DRUG ADDICTION A"

04:51.467 --> 04:52.667
NATIONAL EPIDEMIC" AND

04:52.667 --> 04:54.067
ESTIMATES THAT MORE THAN TWO-

04:54.067 --> 04:55.600
MILLION AMERICANS ABUSE OPIOIDS.

04:55.600 --> 04:56.967
OFFICIALS SAY ROUGHLY 45 PEOPLE

04:56.967 --> 05:00.000
DIE OF OVERDOSES EVERY DAY.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.600
FINANCIAL TIMES REPORTER DAVID

05:01.600 --> 05:02.800
CROW REPORTED THIS STORY AND

05:02.800 --> 05:04.500
JOINS ME TO EXPLAIN EXACTLY HOW

05:04.500 --> 05:05.167
THESE DRUG TESTS ARE BEING

05:05.167 --> 05:10.400
CONDUCTED.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.267
SHOCKS PEOPLE TO SAY WAIT A

05:11.267 --> 05:13.233
MINUTE, THEY WERE RECRUITING

05:13.233 --> 05:14.567
DRUG USERS, HOW DO THE TRIALS

05:14.567 --> 05:15.767
WORK?

05:15.767 --> 05:18.000
>> THEY RECRUIT THESE DRUG

05:18.000 --> 05:20.367
USERS, THEY FIND THEM THROUGH

05:20.367 --> 05:22.167
MARKETING NAMELY WORD OF MOUTH.

05:22.167 --> 05:24.767
YOU HAVE TO BE A BE RECREATIONAL

05:24.767 --> 05:28.600
DRUG USER BUT NOT ADDICTED.

05:28.600 --> 05:30.333
THESE TRIALS LAST BETWEEN THREE

05:30.333 --> 05:31.967
DAYS AND 30 DAYS AND YOU ARE

05:31.967 --> 05:37.667
ASKED TO ABUSE THE OLD OPIOID,

05:37.667 --> 05:40.800
THE BE DRUG THAT IS EASY TO

05:40.800 --> 05:44.333
ABUSE, THE ABUSE DETERRENT AND

05:44.333 --> 05:46.500
THEN THE DETERRENT.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.200
MANY FOR THE PHARMACEUTICAL

05:48.200 --> 05:49.767
COMPANIES WITH DEVELOPING THESE

05:49.767 --> 05:51.500
NEW MEDICINES YOU WANT TO GET A

05:51.500 --> 05:56.333
LOWER SCORE, LOWER THE PLACEBO

05:56.333 --> 05:58.867
THAN THE ACTUAL PRODUCT.

05:58.867 --> 06:01.133
>> ONE OF THE PEOPLE TOOK 21

06:01.133 --> 06:02.167
PILLS IN FIVE MINUTES IS THAT

06:02.167 --> 06:03.067
CORRECT?

06:03.067 --> 06:05.467
>> THAT'S CORRECT, THE CLINIC I

06:05.467 --> 06:07.400
SPOKE TO SAID THE VAST MAJORITY

06:07.400 --> 06:09.400
OF THOSE WERE PLACEBOS.

06:09.400 --> 06:10.867
>> HE WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN THAT.

06:10.867 --> 06:13.933
>> HE WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN THAT

06:13.933 --> 06:15.400
AND TAKING 21 PILLS IN FIVE

06:15.400 --> 06:16.600
MINUTES IS QUITE DIFFICULT.

06:16.600 --> 06:20.467
>> HOW BIG A MARKET IS IT?

06:20.467 --> 06:23.333
>> IT IS A BIG MARKET.

06:23.333 --> 06:25.900
THERE IS AN ISRAELI COMPANY THAT

06:25.900 --> 06:29.200
IS VERY BIG IN THIS AND

06:29.200 --> 06:36.867
PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES, PURDUE

06:36.867 --> 06:38.867
PHARMA IS PRODUCING THEM.

06:38.867 --> 06:40.767
>> IF SOMEBODY COULD TAKE FOR

06:40.767 --> 06:44.000
PAIN BUT WOULD BE LESS ADDICTED

06:44.000 --> 06:45.067
TO?

06:45.067 --> 06:47.700
>> STOP TAMPERING THE PILL TO

06:47.700 --> 06:50.267
MAKE THE EXPERIENCE MORE

06:50.267 --> 06:51.600
ENJOYABLE.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.900
>> SNORT IT GRIND IT UP?

06:53.900 --> 06:56.767
>> AND INSERT IT IN A SYRINGE.

06:56.767 --> 06:58.633
THESE PILLS HAVE A VERY HARD

06:58.633 --> 07:00.633
COATINGS, THEY HAVE A GUMMING

07:00.633 --> 07:03.433
AGENT THAT MAKES THEM HARDER TO

07:03.433 --> 07:03.800
DISSOLVE.

07:03.800 --> 07:06.500
BUT THEY DON'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM

07:06.500 --> 07:07.833
OF ABUSING THESE PILLS ORALLY.

07:07.833 --> 07:10.167
YOU CAN STILL TAKE MORE OF THEM

07:10.167 --> 07:12.033
THAN YOU OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE

07:12.033 --> 07:12.600
BEEN MEANT TO.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.233
>> IS THERE A POSSIBILITY

07:15.233 --> 07:17.867
SOMEBODY ABUSING THESE OPIOIDS

07:17.867 --> 07:19.333
MIGHT COME OUT WORSE?

07:19.333 --> 07:20.933
SAY THEY ARE TAKING 21 PILLS AND

07:20.933 --> 07:23.767
IT IS THE OPIOID AND THEY ARE

07:23.767 --> 07:25.100
ALREADY ABUSING THE DRUG?

07:25.100 --> 07:28.067
>> THESE PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCED

07:28.067 --> 07:28.833
DRUG USERS.

07:28.833 --> 07:31.333
THERE IS A TEST TO MAKE SURE

07:31.333 --> 07:32.633
THEY'RE NOT ADDICTED.

07:32.633 --> 07:35.100
THEY GO THROUGH WASHOUT PERIOD.

07:35.100 --> 07:38.567
IF THEIR BODIES SHOW SIGNS OF

07:38.567 --> 07:39.700
ADDICTION THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED

07:39.700 --> 07:40.867
ON THE TRIAL.

07:40.867 --> 07:42.367
THERE ARE EXPERTS WHO SAY THIS

07:42.367 --> 07:44.333
IS NOT A FOOLPROOF SYSTEM AND

07:44.333 --> 07:47.400
THE LINE BETWEEN ABUSE AND

07:47.400 --> 07:48.933
ADDICTION CAN OFTEN BE VERY

07:48.933 --> 07:50.767
SO SOME OF THESE PEOPLE

07:50.767 --> 07:52.767
MAY NOT BE ADDICTED TODAY BUT

07:52.767 --> 07:54.867
YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY

07:54.867 --> 07:56.533
WON'T GET ADDICTED FURTHER DOWN

07:56.533 --> 07:57.133
THE LINE.

07:57.133 --> 08:01.467
>> SO DAVID CROW OF THE

08:01.467 --> 08:02.267
FINANCIAL TIMES THANKS FOR BEING

08:02.267 --> 08:04.433
HERE.

08:04.433 --> 08:08.133
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

08:08.133 --> 08:10.400
LEADING AMERICAN

08:10.400 --> 08:11.567
>> Sreenivasan: LEADING AMERICAN

08:11.567 --> 08:12.467

08:12.467 --> 08:13.267
APPLE, GOOGLE, FACEBOOK,

08:13.267 --> 08:14.367
TWITTER, AND YAHOO, CONCEDE A

08:14.367 --> 08:15.467
VERY LOW PERCENTAGE OF THEIR

I'M LEARNING, YOU KNOW.

12:46.033 --> 12:46.800
IT'S LIKE THE PROCESS.

13:00.700 --> 13:01.467
YOU KNOW, I WAS EXCITED.

13:01.467 --> 13:02.467
I WAS, LIKE, "YES, THIS IS GONNA

YOU KNOW, I WOULD TRY TO TOUGH

13:25.200 --> 13:25.733
IT OUT.

13:25.733 --> 13:26.900

13:35.200 --> 13:37.433
INTRINSIC TO OUR PROGRAM.

13:37.433 --> 13:39.133
WHEN YOU FAIL AT SOMETHING, WHEN

13:39.133 --> 13:41.067
YOU STRUGGLE WITH IT, THAT

13:41.067 --> 13:42.233
DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE BAD AT IT.

13:42.233 --> 13:43.367
THAT MEANS YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT

13:43.367 --> 13:44.633

15:03.633 --> 15:04.733
THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES.

15:04.733 --> 15:05.733

WORKFORCE.

15:13.467 --> 15:14.867

15:16.433 --> 15:17.133
LEARN BETTER WHEN THEY'RE

15:17.133 --> 15:19.167
COMFORTABLE.

15:19.167 --> 15:21.533

16:09.700 --> 16:11.067
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR--

16:11.067 --> 16:11.733

16:17.667 --> 16:18.333
IDEAS BASED ON THEIR CODING

16:18.333 --> 16:19.467
PROJECTS.

16:19.467 --> 16:20.967
>> LET'S SAY THERE'S A CAR

16:20.967 --> 16:23.600
ROBBERY.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.500
AND SO YOU CAN ESSENTIALLY TAKE

16:25.500 --> 16:26.500
PICTURE OF THE MODEL OF THE CAR

16:26.500 --> 16:28.633
THAT YOU KNOW WAS STOLEN.

16:28.633 --> 16:29.900
YOU CAN USE PAINT SHOP TO

16:29.900 --> 16:32.533
GENERATE THE COLOR YOU'RE

16:32.533 --> 16:33.933
LOOKING FOR OF THE CAR, AND YOU

16:33.933 --> 16:35.100
CAN LOOK THROUGH IMAGES ON

16:35.100 --> 16:36.167
GOOGLE MAPS TO FIND THE COLORED

16:36.167 --> 16:37.867
CAR.

16:37.867 --> 16:40.133
SO IMAGINE YOUR CAR GETS STOLEN

16:40.133 --> 16:42.067
AND YOU HAD A WAY TO HAVE AN APP

16:42.067 --> 16:43.033
THAT WOULD CHANGE IT TO A BRIGHT

16:43.033 --> 16:44.133
GREEN COLOR SO YOU WOULD KNOW IF

16:44.133 --> 16:45.133
IT WAS A STOLEN CAR.

16:45.133 --> 16:46.433
>> OH, I LIKE THAT.

16:46.433 --> 16:47.600
I GO IN THERE LITERALLY JUST TO

16:50.733 --> 16:52.167

16:52.167 --> 16:53.700
THEY'LL REMEMBER THE GUY THAT

16:53.700 --> 16:55.600
CAME INTO TO THEIR PROGRAM AT

16:55.600 --> 16:56.333
A.S.C. THINK, "HE TOLD ME X AND

16:56.333 --> 16:58.367
I'M DOING X."

16:58.367 --> 16:59.633
SO LEGITIMATELY, I'M DEFINITELY

16:59.633 --> 17:05.933
TRYING TO BE AN EXAMPLE.

17:07.967 --> 17:11.667
WHERE WOULD YOU WANT TO WORK?

17:11.733 --> 17:13.500

17:13.500 --> 17:15.100

THAT THERE'S NOT PEOPLE OF COLOR

17:28.167 --> 17:32.967
IN THE TECH FIELD.
