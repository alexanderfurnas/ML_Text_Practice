JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the second
part of my conversation with
billionaire Warren Buffett.

00:04.766 --> 00:09.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke with him last week in
Omaha last week at the Nebraska
Furniture Mart, the largest

00:09.566 --> 00:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
furniture store in America. It
is just one small piece of a
huge portfolio of investments

00:16.433 --> 00:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
owned by his company, Berkshire
Hathaway, but one that Buffett
takes particular pride

00:20.733 --> 00:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in as part of his legacy.

00:22.733 --> 00:27.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both the Senate and House
Republican health care reform
bills would roll back taxes that

00:28.766 --> 00:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are part of Obamacare. Buffett
has taken issue with that.

00:32.666 --> 00:35.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's where my
conversation picks up.

00:35.766 --> 00:40.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One of the things the
Republicans are looking
at, as you know very
well, is doing away with

00:40.533 --> 00:45.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the so-called Obamacare
surcharge on people
earning a higher income.

00:45.366 --> 00:47.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT, Chairman and
CEO, Berkshire Hathaway: Yes.

00:47.466 --> 00:50.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Republicans
are looking at taking that
away, or doing away with that,

00:50.466 --> 00:52.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which would mean a tax
cut, you have said...

00:52.066 --> 00:53.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: Yes.

00:53.333 --> 00:54.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ...
for people like you.

00:54.166 --> 00:56.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: Yes.

00:56.266 --> 01:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, I brought my tax return
along for the last year. I
filed this on April 15. And if

01:02.100 --> 01:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Republican -- well, if the
bill that passed the House with
217 votes had been in effect

01:07.333 --> 01:11.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this year, I would have saved --
I can give you the exact figure.
I would have saved $679,999,

01:15.366 --> 01:17.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or over 17 percent
of my tax bill.

01:17.633 --> 01:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's nothing ambiguous about
that. I will be given a 17
percent tax cut. And the people

01:22.133 --> 01:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's directed at are couples
with $250,000 or more of
income. You could entitle this,

01:29.166 --> 01:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you know, Relief for the Rich
Act or something, because it
-- I have got friends where it

01:32.533 --> 01:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would have saved them as
much as -- it gets into the
$10-million-and-up figure.

01:40.033 --> 01:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I might point out --
it might be an interesting
question. I think
members of the Senate and

01:42.133 --> 01:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the House get $174,000 a year.
But most of them have -- if
you look at the disclosures,

01:45.366 --> 01:50.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have substantial other
income. If they get to higher
than $250,000, as a married

01:52.366 --> 01:55.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
couple, or $200,000 as a
single person, they have given
themselves a big, big tax cut,

01:56.866 --> 01:58.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
if they -- if they
voted for this.

01:58.966 --> 02:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking
of taxes, let's just use that
as an entry point to talk about

02:03.400 --> 02:05.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

02:05.433 --> 02:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You shared some of your
tax return with us for
2016. Thank you very much.

02:08.633 --> 02:10.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: Yes.

02:10.633 --> 02:12.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But before I
ask you about that, how wealthy
are you? I mean, I'm reading

02:12.700 --> 02:14.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that you're $77 billion?

02:14.800 --> 02:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Ninety-nine
percent of my net worth is
in Berkshire Hathaway stock.

02:20.900 --> 02:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Every share of that stock has
been pledged to philanthropy.

02:23.033 --> 02:27.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I'm a trustee for
that stock. So, it will
go to society. And then
the rest will as well.

02:29.533 --> 02:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if you add up what's in
my name, if we go down to my
safe deposit box, we will find

02:34.633 --> 02:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some stock certificates
that are worth that much.

02:37.833 --> 02:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But as I -- you know, I have
written, they have no utility
to me. They can't do anything

02:42.033 --> 02:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make me happier. I'm already
happy. I would be happy with,
you know -- certainly with

02:49.066 --> 02:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
$100,000 a year, I could be
very happy. And they can't buy
anything for me that I want.

02:53.700 --> 02:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
If they did, I would buy it.

02:56.266 --> 03:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they do have utility
to others, so I have got
this system to essentially
try and translate

03:01.800 --> 03:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that into vaccines and education
and all of that sort of thing.

03:04.033 --> 03:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The reason I
bring that up, Warren Buffett,
is that that's your wealth,

03:10.933 --> 03:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your worth. And yet, on
your tax return, you earned
$19 million-something.

03:14.300 --> 03:15.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: Right.

03:15.900 --> 03:17.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
Nineteen-and-a-half
million last year.

03:17.966 --> 03:22.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Your effective tax rate was
16.3 percent, which -- we
looked it up. This is what an

03:24.933 --> 03:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
average couple, a married
couple, no children, taking the
standard deduction would pay on

03:31.166 --> 03:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an income of $136,000. In other
words, a couple who earned --
you earn 143 times more than

03:36.433 --> 03:39.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they do, but your tax rate
is the same as theirs.

03:39.100 --> 03:42.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: Yes, I
have pointed that out
in past, in the past.

03:42.100 --> 03:45.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it's even worse than
you say, Judy, because
you're looking at what
that couple would pay

03:45.666 --> 03:50.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in federal income tax. But they
are also paying payroll taxes,
in overwhelming cases. And

03:52.600 --> 03:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my cleaning lady has a 15
percent tax, you know, just from
Social -- just from the Social

03:57.766 --> 04:02.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Security that she and
her employer pay, but
it's kind of incredible.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now they want to cut it.
No, they want to cut it for
me. I mean, you know, they -- I

04:06.733 --> 04:09.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
don't look like somebody
that deserves a cut.

04:09.333 --> 04:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, they --
the Republicans are talking
about lowering taxes...

04:14.200 --> 04:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Absolutely.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... on the...

04:17.233 --> 04:18.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: They want to
cut my tax 17 percent. They saw
those figures and were shocked

04:18.433 --> 04:19.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that I was paying
that much, apparently.

04:19.533 --> 04:21.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

04:21.566 --> 04:24.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, among other
things, they're talking about
doing away with some of the

04:24.000 --> 04:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
- - some of the deductions,
charitable deductions,
maybe, mortgage deductions,
maybe, state and

04:29.233 --> 04:32.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
local tax -- taxes
paid as deductions.

04:32.033 --> 04:34.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do you have a thought
about all those?

04:34.033 --> 04:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, you can't
really talk about specifics
without looking at the whole

04:37.733 --> 04:40.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
thing.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if they're talking about
making it revenue-neutral,
you know, I think if
they're going to make

04:42.500 --> 04:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it revenue-neutral, it ought to
be -- it ought to be something
other than revenue-neutral

04:49.500 --> 04:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the guys like me. Our
rates should go up, allowing
others to go down somewhat.

04:52.433 --> 04:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there ought to be
minimum taxes for people that
make $10 million a year, and a

04:56.833 --> 04:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
different one at a million
a year, but certainly
at $10 million a year.

04:59.500 --> 05:04.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: They also, as you
know, want to tackle business
corporate tax rates. They're

05:04.300 --> 05:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talking about the current
corporate rate, lowering it
from 35 percent to 15 percent?

05:08.900 --> 05:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president has talked about
-- I guess Speaker Paul Ryan
this week said 20 percent.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What would that
mean for you if...

05:17.733 --> 05:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, it
would mean, for Berkshire,
in all probability,
that we would pay less

05:22.633 --> 05:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in U.S. federal income taxes.

05:25.033 --> 05:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But until you see the final
thing, you can't tell. Berkshire
Hathaway is the second largest

05:29.600 --> 05:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
corporation on the Fortune 500
this year. I don't know any
case where our competitiveness

05:36.633 --> 05:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is being hurt by the federal
income tax rate on corporations.

05:40.033 --> 05:42.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Estate
taxes, a thought about that?

05:42.666 --> 05:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Oh, estate
taxes, I mean, I -- you hear
people call it the death tax.

05:46.166 --> 05:50.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are going to be
two-and-a-half million
people die in the
United States this year.

05:50.333 --> 05:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How many estate tax returns
are there going to be? Probably
about 5,000. And the interesting

05:57.366 --> 05:59.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
thing is, if I talked to
somebody about welfare
mothers or something
like that, they say how

05:59.466 --> 06:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debilitating it is to have these
food stamps, and it takes away
their incentive to do anything.

06:03.433 --> 06:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If a kid comes out of the right
womb in this country, they
have got food stamps for their

06:07.033 --> 06:10.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rest of their life. They just
call them stocks and bonds. And
their welfare officer is their

06:10.800 --> 06:13.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
trust officer.

06:13.333 --> 06:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I think I -- I
think having a significant
estate tax that starts
at a fair-sized level

06:19.300 --> 06:23.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is -- if you're going to have
to raise $3.5 trillion, I
think that's a good source of

06:23.833 --> 06:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
revenue, and that I -- it
shouldn't apply to, you know,
99 percent of the people.

06:28.033 --> 06:32.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You have been
very -- I mean, very open about
your own taxes, and people

06:32.466 --> 06:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have taken a look at that,
and they have also looked at
Berkshire Hathaway. It has been

06:35.333 --> 06:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pointed out that Berkshire
Hathaway does take
advantage of the legal
ability to defer taxes,

06:43.600 --> 06:44.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
and...

06:44.833 --> 06:46.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: Sure.
Well, that's because...

06:46.966 --> 06:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I saw a
number, something like $75
billion in deferred taxes?

06:49.033 --> 06:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, that's we
haven't cashed things that we
-- just like you, if you have

06:50.533 --> 06:52.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
got a stock that's gone up a
whole lot, until you sell it.

06:52.933 --> 06:57.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that's just the law. And
we're going to - - we don't
have any of the Cayman Islands

06:59.933 --> 07:03.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or anything like that stuff.
But we follow the law, and we
got a million shareholders.

07:03.366 --> 07:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think they probably
expect us to do that. That
doesn't mean I don't think the

07:06.466 --> 07:08.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
law shouldn't be
changed in some way.

07:08.533 --> 07:11.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I follow the law in terms
of my personal return. I do
not send an extra $5 million

07:11.833 --> 07:13.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the Treasury.

07:13.866 --> 07:18.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Your
philanthropy, we have
talked about it a little
bit. It's legendary.

07:20.033 --> 07:24.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You and Bill Gates, Melinda
Gates have come together and,
I guess, broken all records

07:25.366 --> 07:27.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
imaginable for giving.

07:27.800 --> 07:32.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time, it's being
pointed out that you're also
making -- you first made that

07:32.066 --> 07:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pledge, what, 10, 11 years ago.

07:33.866 --> 07:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: 2006, yes.

07:34.966 --> 07:36.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: 2006.

07:36.933 --> 07:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're now making so much
more even than you did then.
People are saying, well, wait a

07:42.333 --> 07:43.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
minute, you know, is he
going to be giving more away?

07:43.266 --> 07:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do you think about that?

07:45.300 --> 07:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I have
got it set up so that, if I make
more, I do give more, because

07:47.700 --> 07:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm giving on a schedule,
and that schedule ends
10 years after I die.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's all -- so I'm not
setting up -- and, actually,
they can't use it for endowments

07:57.333 --> 08:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or anything. It has to be
spent within 10 years, really,
after my estate's closed, but

08:03.066 --> 08:05.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
call it after I die.

08:05.133 --> 08:08.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How
much influence do you
think you had on other,
others with wealth, with

08:10.366 --> 08:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
means to give, to be as
generous as you have been?

08:13.666 --> 08:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, a lot of
people come back to me on that.

08:16.300 --> 08:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And basically, I said, you
know, if you're extremely rich,
and you have got children,

08:23.200 --> 08:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my theory was, you give them
enough so they can do anything,
but not enough so they can

08:25.200 --> 08:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do nothing. And I have had more
people come back to it, so,
apparently I was smarter in

08:29.000 --> 08:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
1980, whatever it was, than
I am now. But that seemed
to have some influence.

08:32.033 --> 08:35.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are you
comfortable today with
what you're giving? I
mean, does it feel...

08:35.600 --> 08:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: It's
exactly what I wanted to do.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does it
feel like the right thing
to be doing right now?

08:39.633 --> 08:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: It's the right
thing. It's the right thing,
because it's going -- it's

08:41.666 --> 08:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to people who believe,
as the Gates, for example, that
every life is of equal value.

08:45.800 --> 08:50.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, the truth is, I have
got a lot of wealth, little
pieces of paper, says Berkshire

08:52.766 --> 08:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hathaway on it. They are claim
checks on all kinds of goods
and services in the world.

08:57.933 --> 09:01.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They can buy anything. I can
buy 400-foot yachts and have 20
homes and all that. I wouldn't

09:01.166 --> 09:03.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be happier. But they
can buy anything.

09:03.666 --> 09:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And once they move into the
hands of people who are working
like hell on getting something

09:10.666 --> 09:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
accomplished in areas I want
them to -- you know, I love
the idea of getting them used,

09:16.000 --> 09:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and that's what they're doing.

09:18.033 --> 09:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You said it
wouldn't make you happy to have
a hundred, 200 homes and yachts

09:21.033 --> 09:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and so forth. What does
make Warren Buffett happy?

09:23.800 --> 09:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: I just have
a lot of fun doing my job.

09:26.333 --> 09:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I can do anything
I want, basically,
as long as it doesn't
involve athletic ability,

09:30.833 --> 09:31.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or something like that.

09:31.833 --> 09:33.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

09:33.866 --> 09:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: But if it's
something I can buy, I can
buy anything, basically.

09:35.833 --> 09:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have been on 400-foot yachts,
and I have - - I have lived
the life a little bit with

09:40.566 --> 09:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people that have 10 homes and
everything. And I live in the
same house I bought in 1958.

09:47.566 --> 09:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if I could spend $100
million on a house that would
make me a lot happier, I would

09:49.133 --> 09:51.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do it.

09:51.100 --> 09:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, for me, that's the happiest
House In the world. And it's
because it's got memories,

09:54.666 --> 09:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and people come back, and all
that sort of thing. So, I am
doing what I love to do with

09:58.733 --> 10:01.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people I love. And it doesn't
get any better than that, Judy.

10:01.366 --> 10:06.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And -- but I should be. I mean,
why in the hell -- why should
I be working at 86 at something

10:06.200 --> 10:08.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that I don't like or
with people I don't like?

10:08.566 --> 10:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I see
you're drinking a Cherry Coke.

10:11.233 --> 10:12.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: Right.

10:12.466 --> 10:14.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How
do you stay healthy?

10:14.500 --> 10:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I
think I stay healthy partly
by being happy, actually.

10:17.833 --> 10:22.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that -- I think it
really helps if your stomach
isn't grinding all the time,

10:22.366 --> 10:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and you're doing things you
don't want to do, or you're
working with people that -- you

10:25.500 --> 10:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know? So I have gone very
light on the diet advice.

10:30.233 --> 10:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I eat like a normal 6-year-old,
but if you look at the
mortality statistics, I mean,

10:34.666 --> 10:36.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
6-year-olds don't
die very often.

10:36.066 --> 10:37.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

10:37.566 --> 10:38.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: I mean, the
diet's doing something for them.

10:38.966 --> 10:40.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How
much sleep do you get?

10:40.733 --> 10:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: I get quite a
bit of sleep. I like to sleep.

10:42.833 --> 10:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I will usually sleep eight
hours a night, and that --
no, I have no desire to get to

10:50.000 --> 10:52.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
work at 4:00 in the morning.

10:52.066 --> 10:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So many people
look at you and they think,
oh, my goodness, this man,

10:54.700 --> 10:58.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's accomplished so much.
He's been so successful.
He's 86 years old, and
he's still going strong.

11:00.300 --> 11:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: I love it.

11:01.766 --> 11:03.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what do
they -- so, what's the secret?

11:03.266 --> 11:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: The secret is
to find what you love to do.

11:05.300 --> 11:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, I tell the students
look for the job that you would
take if you didn't need a job.

11:08.933 --> 11:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it's that simple. And
I was lucky enough to find
it very early in life. And

11:13.633 --> 11:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then the second thing is to
have people around you that make
feel good every day, and make

11:19.833 --> 11:21.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you a better person than
you otherwise would be.

11:21.866 --> 11:24.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have more fun doing this than
anything else I can think of
in the world, and I have seen

11:24.100 --> 11:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a lot of other things you
could do in the world.

11:25.700 --> 11:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Warren
Buffett, thank you very much.

11:28.433 --> 11:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you, Judy.

11:29.933 --> 11:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And he does
come across as a happy man.

11:32.533 --> 11:37.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, for the record,
