THEIR INFLUENCE WAS ON THE WANE.

02:43.630 --> 02:45.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

LITTLE BIT MORE ENERGY FOR THEIR

THEY DIDN'T GET TO THEIR

FORCED THEM TO RETREAT BACK TO

03:19.332 --> 03:20.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE STATION.

03:20.067 --> 03:21.868 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

03:21.868 --> 03:23.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY HAS BEEN-- BECOME VERY

03:23.303 --> 03:23.904 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNPLEASANT.

EXTREMELY SHOCKED BY WHAT

HAPPENED, NOT JUST IN COLOGNE

03:43.090 --> 03:44.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IN OTHER GERMAN CITIES.

03:44.558 --> 03:47.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS THE REAL SCALE OF THE

03:47.260 --> 03:48.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN.

03:48.995 --> 03:50.630 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

COMPLAINTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE

03:57.571 --> 03:58.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

03:58.505 --> 04:00.807 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
300, NEARLY 400, AND MANY OF

04:00.807 --> 04:02.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE ARE OF A SEXUAL NATURE.

04:02.275 --> 04:03.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THIS HAS REALLY SURPRISED

04:03.243 --> 04:05.245 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE, AND SOME PEOPLE THINK

04:05.245 --> 04:06.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE BEEN

04:06.379 --> 04:08.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN

04:09.049 --> 04:11.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACCEPTING IN.

04:11.151 --> 04:11.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THERE ARE OTHERS WHO SAY

04:11.952 --> 04:13.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE PEOPLE WHO COMMITTED

04:13.453 --> 04:16.223 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE CRIMES ARE JUST A SMALL

04:16.223 --> 04:17.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

LIFE.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WHAT IS BEING DISCUSSED HERE

04:21.695 --> 04:22.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS BASICALLY THAT COLOGNE MAY

04:22.796 --> 04:24.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POSSIBLY BE A TURNING POINT FOR

04:24.998 --> 04:26.032 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TRAIL, AND INDEED ANGELA MERKEL

04:30.470 --> 04:31.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS HAD TO RESPOND TO THAT TODAY

04:31.838 --> 04:34.074 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BY BEING AT A POLITICAL RALLY

04:34.074 --> 04:35.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAYING THAT SHE IS GOING TO

04:35.876 --> 04:37.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRING IN NEW LAWS WHICH WILL

04:37.377 --> 04:39.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAKE DEPORTATIONS EASIER FOR

04:39.846 --> 04:40.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE BREAKING

04:40.981 --> 04:42.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GERMAN LAWS.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THE MOMENT, PEOPLE HAVE TO

04:44.151 --> 04:45.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SERVE AT LEAST THREE YEARS'

04:45.352 --> 04:46.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPRISONMENT BEFORE THEY CAN BE

04:46.386 --> 04:49.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEPORTED, BUT THERE IS A NEED

04:49.055 --> 04:50.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, SOME GERMANS WOULD SAY, TO

04:50.690 --> 04:51.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACCELERATE THAT PROCESS.

04:51.858 --> 04:52.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: AND NONE OF

04:52.726 --> 04:54.828 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS HAPPENED IN A POLITICAL

04:54.828 --> 04:55.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VACUUM.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> NO.

04:57.330 --> 04:59.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND PEOPLE ARE REALLY SORT OF

04:59.399 --> 05:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERESTED TO KNOW WHETHER OR

05:00.500 --> 05:02.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT ANGELA MERKEL-- WHAT HER

05:02.135 --> 05:03.503 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICAL FUTURE IS LIKE

05:03.503 --> 05:05.005 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE SHE HAS REALLY PUT

05:05.005 --> 05:08.074 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERSELF OUT ON THE EXTREME OF

05:08.074 --> 05:12.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EUROPEAN OPINION BY OPENING UP

05:12.112 --> 05:13.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GERMANY TO VIRTUALLY ANYBODY NOW

05:13.947 --> 05:15.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SHE IS HAVING TO REVERSE

05:15.515 --> 05:16.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT PROCESS.

05:16.216 --> 05:17.851 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, THE NUMBERS IN GERMANY ARE

05:17.851 --> 05:18.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUITE STAGGERING; OVER THE PAST

05:18.985 --> 05:20.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEAR, THE GERMANS SAY THEY HAVE

05:20.287 --> 05:21.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKEN IN MORE THAN A MILLION

05:21.855 --> 05:23.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIGRANTS.

05:23.056 --> 05:23.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SOMEHOW THOSE FIGURES DON'T

05:23.957 --> 05:25.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY QUITE JIBE BECAUSE THAT'S

05:25.358 --> 05:26.393 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF PEOPLE

05:26.393 --> 05:28.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE LET

05:28.628 --> 05:29.462 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN.

05:29.462 --> 05:30.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO PERHAPS THERE HAS BEEN SOME

05:30.297 --> 05:31.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOUBLE REGISTRATION IN GERMANY

05:31.798 --> 05:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH HAS BOOSTED THOSE NUMBERS,

05:33.033 --> 05:34.334 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT NEVERTHELESS THOSE NUMBERS

05:34.334 --> 05:35.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE PRETTY HIGH.

05:35.468 --> 05:36.870 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THERE IS A DEMOGRAPHIC

05:36.870 --> 05:37.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBLEM BECAUSE MANY OF THE

05:37.704 --> 05:40.373 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE COMING INTO EUROPE FROM

05:40.373 --> 05:43.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TURKEY, THROUGH GREECE, ARE

05:43.143 --> 05:47.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOUNG MEN, AND THEY, AS I FOUND

05:47.247 --> 05:48.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT YESTERDAY WHEN I TALKED TO

05:48.081 --> 05:49.749 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME MOROCCAN PEOPLE, THEY HAVE

05:49.749 --> 05:50.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOT TO LEARN THERE IS A

05:50.817 --> 05:52.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY IN

05:52.786 --> 05:53.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EUROPE ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH

05:53.753 --> 05:55.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU TREAT WOMEN.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND PEOPLE ARE VERY CONCERNED

05:56.523 --> 05:58.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THERE IS A SERIOUS CULTURAL

05:58.592 --> 06:00.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLASH THAT IS HAPPENING BETWEEN

06:00.160 --> 06:03.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

BACKGROUND AND THOSE NEWCOMERS.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO, COLOGNE COULD VERY WELL

06:07.734 --> 06:09.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE A TURNING POINT.

06:09.169 --> 06:10.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
