JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.239 --> 00:06.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.240 --> 00:07.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

00:07.975 --> 00:11.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
From Trump Tower to Twitter, the
president-elect

00:11.612 --> 00:17.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
continues to shake up tradition
by attacking
the Boeing company's plans to
build a new

00:17.117 --> 00:18.886 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Air Force One.

00:18.919 --> 00:23.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Wednesday:
The Pentagon hides a study that
exposes $125

00:23.657 --> 00:27.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
billion in wasteful spending,
fearing Congress
would cut its defense budget.

00:27.895 --> 00:31.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus: a passion
for improvisation.

00:31.231 --> 00:36.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two jazz greats open up to
Jeffrey Brown about
their new album and staying in
the moment.

00:36.837 --> 00:40.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSHUA REDMAN, Saxophonist: It's
an emotional,
it's an intuitive process.

00:40.407 --> 00:46.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, of course it's happening
in the brain,
right, but if I'm thinking about
responding

00:46.046 --> 00:48.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in that way, then I'm
overthinking it.

00:48.548 --> 00:51.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:51.084 --> 00:55.255 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:55.289 --> 01:09.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He is spending
most of his
time out of public view, but,
today, president-elect

01:09.469 --> 01:11.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump was suddenly much more
visible.

01:11.939 --> 01:17.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Items on his agenda: the cost of
new presidential
aircraft and prospects for new
jobs in the

01:18.011 --> 01:20.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
telecommunications industry.

01:20.047 --> 01:26.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The day started with a surprise
appearance
in the lobby of Trump Tower in
New York.

01:26.053 --> 01:31.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump lit into the Boeing
company over
its contract to build two new
versions of

01:31.825 --> 01:33.694 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Air Force One.

01:33.727 --> 01:36.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: It's going
to be over $4 billion for the
Air Force One

01:36.797 --> 01:37.998 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
program.

01:38.031 --> 01:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I think it's ridiculous.

01:40.067 --> 01:43.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think Boeing is doing a little
bit of a
number.

01:43.570 --> 01:46.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want Boeing to make a lot of
money, but
not that much money.

01:46.540 --> 01:50.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Earlier, on
Twitter, he had
gone further, saying the
government should

01:50.711 --> 01:53.213 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cancel the order with Boeing.

01:53.246 --> 01:58.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Boeing's initial contract was
for roughly
$3 billion, but costs have been
rising.

01:58.919 --> 02:05.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, the White House said
today it has no
idea where the president-elect
got his $4

02:05.092 --> 02:06.827 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
billion figure.

02:06.860 --> 02:11.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Boeing said in a statement that
it hopes to
deliver the best planes for the
president

02:12.032 --> 02:14.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at the best value for the
American taxpayer.

02:14.968 --> 02:22.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Later, another sudden
appearance, this time
with Japanese billionaire
Masayoshi Son, CEO

02:22.409 --> 02:25.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of SoftBank, a Japanese tech and
telecom company.

02:25.946 --> 02:32.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And he's just
agreed to invest
$50 billion in the United States
and 50,000

02:32.185 --> 02:33.820 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
jobs.

02:33.854 --> 02:38.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's one of the great men of
industry,
so I just want to thank you very
much.

02:38.892 --> 02:39.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MASAYOSHI SON, CEO, SoftBank:
Thank you.

02:39.893 --> 02:40.861 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

02:40.894 --> 02:42.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very
much.

02:42.729 --> 02:45.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There was also
news that the
president-elect has divested
himself of his

02:45.465 --> 02:47.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
entire stock portfolio.

02:47.834 --> 02:51.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His transition team said he sold
it off back
in June.

02:51.371 --> 02:57.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The statement gave no details,
amounts or
documentation for the stock
sales, all of

02:57.911 --> 03:03.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this as meetings with potential
staff and
Cabinet nominees continued,
including the

03:03.550 --> 03:10.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CEO of ExxonMobil, Rex
Tillerson, said to
be a candidate for secretary of
state, talk

03:10.390 --> 03:16.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
radio host Laura Ingraham, a
possibility for
White House press secretary, and
Iowa Governor

03:16.630 --> 03:20.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Terry Branstad, who could be up
for a diplomatic
post.

03:20.801 --> 03:26.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump will visit Iowa later
this week
as part of a thank you tour that
began last

03:26.506 --> 03:28.175 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
week in Ohio.

03:28.208 --> 03:33.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The tour also carried him to
Fayetteville,
North Carolina, for a rally this
evening.

03:33.613 --> 03:37.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the day's
other news:
President Obama defended his
record fighting

03:37.551 --> 03:42.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terrorism in his last major
national security
speech before leaving office.

03:42.055 --> 03:46.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Obama traveled to MacDill
Air Force Base
in Tampa, Florida, home to the
Special Operations

03:46.359 --> 03:48.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Central Commands.

03:48.195 --> 03:52.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president told the troops
that he's led
a relentless assault on the
Islamic State,

03:52.299 --> 03:56.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but he also warned against
targeting Muslims
in the name of battling
extremism.

03:56.203 --> 03:58.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
The United States of America is
not a place

03:58.705 --> 04:04.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where some citizens have to
withstand greater
scrutiny or carry a special I.D.
card or prove

04:04.978 --> 04:06.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that they are not an enemy from
within.

04:06.913 --> 04:12.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are a country that has bled
and struggled
and sacrificed against that kind
of discrimination.

04:12.119 --> 04:16.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The president
also denounced
any use of torture, defended
drone strikes

04:16.256 --> 04:20.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and urged again that the U.S.
prison at Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba, be closed.

04:20.694 --> 04:25.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Iraq, army
units made a
new push toward the center of
Mosul today.

04:25.699 --> 04:30.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Islamic State fighters had tied
up the Iraqi
forces on the southeastern side
of the city

04:30.670 --> 04:32.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for nearly a month.

04:32.038 --> 04:35.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, this morning, an armored
division launched
a fresh assault.

04:35.709 --> 04:40.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A senior commander says they
moved within
a mile of the Tigris River,
backed up by U.S.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.749 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
airstrikes.

04:42.782 --> 04:46.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A human rights
group is
accusing China's Communist Party
of systematically

04:46.520 --> 04:51.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
using torture and coerced
confessions against
members accused of corruption.

04:51.958 --> 04:57.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of President Xi
Jinping's sweeping
anti-graft campaign, now in its
fourth year.

04:57.397 --> 05:02.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Human Rights Watch says it found
widespread
abuse at interrogation and
detention sites

05:02.536 --> 05:05.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that are outside China's
official criminal
justice system.

05:05.839 --> 05:09.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, crews
have now searched nearly all of
the Oakland,

05:09.843 --> 05:15.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
California, warehouse that went
up in flames
during a music party, leaving at
least 36

05:15.348 --> 05:16.616 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
people dead.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officials say they do not expect
to find more
bodies.

05:19.286 --> 05:24.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Overnight, firefighters
stabilized parts of
the gutted building to continue
the search

05:24.457 --> 05:25.425 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

05:25.458 --> 05:27.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They say they hope to finish the
job tonight.

05:27.260 --> 05:29.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The cause of the fire is still
under investigation.

05:29.763 --> 05:35.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The U.S.
Supreme Court sided
today with Samsung, in a
high-profile patent

05:35.068 --> 05:36.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fight with Apple.

05:36.870 --> 05:43.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All eight justices voted to
throw out a $399
million judgment against Samsung
for copying

05:43.543 --> 05:45.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
features of Apple's iPhone.

05:45.412 --> 05:49.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The high court said the award
was too large,
and ordered a federal appeals
panel to come

05:49.549 --> 05:51.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
up with a new amount.

05:51.351 --> 05:55.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wall Street edged
higher again
today, with telecom companies
leading the

05:55.689 --> 05:57.090 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

05:57.123 --> 06:02.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 35
points to close at 19251.

06:02.329 --> 06:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 24, and the S&amp;P
500 added
seven.

06:06.299 --> 06:12.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Still to come
on the "NewsHour":
the buried Pentagon report
showing $125 billion

06:12.906 --> 06:19.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in waste; a bipartisan bill that
funds Joe
Biden's Cancer Moonshot; Liberia
experiments

06:19.045 --> 06:26.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with privatizing its education
system; and
much more.

06:26.419 --> 06:38.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Every few years,
Pentagon leaders
conduct efficiency reviews,
looking for ways

06:38.898 --> 06:40.734 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to save money.

06:40.767 --> 06:45.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two years ago, Deputy Defense
Secretary Robert
Work commissioned a study that
looked at how

06:45.705 --> 06:50.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much the Defense Department
spent on things
like its supply chain, property
management

06:50.477 --> 06:52.212 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and health care.

06:52.245 --> 06:56.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But according to The Washington
Post, when
the results came back that said
an estimated

06:56.249 --> 07:04.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
$125 billion could be saved over
five years,
the report was buried by top
Pentagon officials.

07:04.824 --> 07:10.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reporter Craig Whitlock broke
the story for
The Post, and he is here now to
tell us more.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Craig Whitlock, tell us how all
this started.

07:12.399 --> 07:15.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why did -- why was the study
ordered in the
first place?

07:15.035 --> 07:18.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRAIG WHITLOCK, The Washington
Post: Well,
a couple years ago, the
Pentagon's budget,

07:18.805 --> 07:20.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the defense budget, was under a
lot of pressure.

07:20.774 --> 07:26.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It had been flat for a few
years, and military
leaders were worried that, under
sequestration

07:26.379 --> 07:30.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the Budget Control Act, that
they could
actually be forced to stomach
some pretty

07:30.216 --> 07:32.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
substantial cuts in the coming
years.

07:32.652 --> 07:38.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Deputy Defense Secretary Bob
Work ordered
a federal advisory panel of
private sector

07:38.625 --> 07:44.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
executives to start collecting a
lot of data
about how much the Pentagon
spends on its

07:44.464 --> 07:48.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back office functions as a way
to find ways
to save money.

07:48.535 --> 07:51.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the work --
the study got
under way.

07:51.404 --> 07:55.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They asked them to do it in a
relatively short
period of time, just a few
months.

07:55.575 --> 07:57.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It wasn't easy to do.

07:57.043 --> 08:01.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I gather there wasn't a great
deal of cooperation
across the board.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But they did come back with a
report.

08:03.049 --> 08:04.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And what did it find?

08:04.284 --> 08:06.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CRAIG WHITLOCK: Well, what they
found was
pretty striking.

08:06.386 --> 08:09.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is kind of hard, I think,
for most folks
to understand.

08:09.422 --> 08:14.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the Pentagon actually up
until then had
no idea how many contractors
actually worked

08:15.028 --> 08:16.796 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for it.

08:16.830 --> 08:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they were trying to figure
out how many
people worked in its business
operations.

08:20.667 --> 08:25.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they found that more than
one million
people worked in these core
business operations,

08:25.472 --> 08:31.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like you said, health care
management, human
resources, property management,
things that

08:31.211 --> 08:33.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
any organization needs.

08:33.146 --> 08:36.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, you know, even for the
Pentagon, one
million is a lot of people.

08:36.649 --> 08:38.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
These are essentially desk jobs.

08:38.718 --> 08:43.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that compares to only 1.3
million active-duty
troops.

08:43.556 --> 08:47.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the backing of the Pentagon
was almost
as big as, you know, the tip of
the spear,

08:47.494 --> 08:49.195 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
so to speak.

08:49.229 --> 08:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Secretary
Work, number
two man at the Pentagon, when he
and others

08:53.466 --> 08:55.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saw this report, what did they
do?

08:55.335 --> 08:59.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRAIG WHITLOCK: Well, they had
touted this
in advance, saying this was
going to be really

08:59.406 --> 09:04.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
important, and that they had
asked these private
sector executives to help them
make sure that

09:04.144 --> 09:08.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the report didn't gather dust
and that they
would, you know, pass all these
-- or adopt

09:08.248 --> 09:09.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
these recommendations.

09:10.016 --> 09:13.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when the numbers came back
much bigger
than they thought, and the
recommendation

09:13.753 --> 09:19.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they could save $125
billion over five
years, effectively, they buried
and killed

09:19.192 --> 09:20.960 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the study.

09:20.994 --> 09:25.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The data that had been collected
internally
for the first time to pinpoint
how many people

09:25.665 --> 09:28.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
worked in these jobs was kept
secret.

09:28.468 --> 09:30.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is still classified and
confidential.

09:30.770 --> 09:33.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We worked hard for months to get
our hands
on it.

09:33.306 --> 09:35.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We were unable to.

09:35.208 --> 09:38.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I was working with Bob
Woodward, my colleague
here at The Post, who is pretty
good at that

09:38.511 --> 09:39.546 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stuff.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
To this day, they have kept that
data confidential.

09:41.514 --> 09:47.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But the -- and
you write the
reason it seemed that they
wanted this buried

09:47.320 --> 09:51.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was that they were afraid that,
if this information
came out, that Congress wouldn't
appropriate

09:51.991 --> 09:56.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what he and others thought the
Pentagon needed
to get in terms of future
appropriations.

09:56.963 --> 09:57.964 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRAIG WHITLOCK: That's right.

09:57.997 --> 09:59.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's a political calculation.

09:59.833 --> 10:03.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were worried that members
of Congress
would say, look, you have been
asking us for

10:03.136 --> 10:04.904 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more money.

10:04.938 --> 10:08.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have been saying the troops
need more
money, you need more funds for
ships and tanks

10:08.675 --> 10:15.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and airplane, but, look, your
own report,
your own data show that you
could save $125

10:15.748 --> 10:16.716 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
billion.

10:16.749 --> 10:18.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why are you asking us for more?

10:18.551 --> 10:21.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they were worried Congress
would cut the
budget, instead of them giving
them more.

10:21.721 --> 10:26.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So that's when they decided this
wasn't something
they wanted to act on and that
they wanted

10:26.926 --> 10:28.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to keep it quiet.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Craig
Whitlock, what's
the fallout from this today?

10:30.530 --> 10:32.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How is the Pentagon dealing with
this disclosure?

10:32.599 --> 10:36.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRAIG WHITLOCK: Well, I think
the Pentagon
is -- it's very uncomfortable
for them.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't dispute the numbers
here.

10:38.271 --> 10:42.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They don't dispute that there's
a million
people working in their back
office jobs.

10:42.275 --> 10:46.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't dispute that the
study found they
could save that much money.

10:46.312 --> 10:51.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They do say it would take more
time, that
maybe it wasn't practical to do
this so quickly.

10:51.751 --> 10:56.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what they're feeling today
is some pressure
from Congress, members of
Congress, members

10:56.456 --> 10:58.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the Armed Services
Committees.

10:58.258 --> 11:02.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're saying at a minimum the
Pentagon owes
it to the American public to
release this

11:02.595 --> 11:05.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
data showing how all this money
could be saved.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think the Pentagon's
concerned.

11:06.799 --> 11:10.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They want to see how
president-elect Trump
reacts.

11:10.203 --> 11:16.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here's a guy who campaigned on a
platform
for a major military buildup,
and he said

11:16.109 --> 11:20.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he would pay for it by cutting
waste and abuse
in the military budget.

11:20.914 --> 11:25.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wasn't very specific about
how he would
do that, but, you know, here's a
blueprint

11:25.118 --> 11:27.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for how they could save a
substantial amount
of money.

11:27.787 --> 11:32.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking of
the president-elect
and speaking of Pentagon
spending, separately

11:33.026 --> 11:37.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from all this, the
president-elect today tweeted
and then talked to the press --
and we showed

11:37.830 --> 11:45.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this just a moment ago -- that
he's upset
about how much he says it's
going to -- the

11:45.138 --> 11:51.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Boeing company is going to be
charging to
build two new Air Force Ones.

11:51.177 --> 11:55.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know there are two of these
airplanes that
carry the president around.

11:56.015 --> 12:01.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do we know for a fact from
Boeing that that's
how much these planes are now
supposed to

12:01.387 --> 12:03.189 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cost?

12:03.222 --> 12:05.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRAIG WHITLOCK: Well, you know,
he's actually
pretty close on that, Donald
Trump, when he

12:05.858 --> 12:06.826 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
says $4 billion.

12:06.859 --> 12:09.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, that's over the whole
program.

12:09.262 --> 12:14.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the cost of developing
and designing
these airplanes and to build and
to buy them.

12:14.601 --> 12:18.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Boeing doesn't have all those
contracts yet,
but it really is the inside
track.

12:18.338 --> 12:21.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the only company the
Pentagon has been
dealing with to work on this.

12:21.741 --> 12:28.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But over the next several years,
the Pentagon
has projected or set aside $3.9
billion for

12:28.948 --> 12:30.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
these two airplanes.

12:30.683 --> 12:35.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, one reason it costs so much
is that these
aren't just Boeing 747 passenger
planes.

12:35.521 --> 12:40.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have to be equipped as
essentially an
airborne command center for the
commander

12:40.093 --> 12:41.294 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in chief.

12:41.327 --> 12:45.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has to be able to issue
orders in case
of nuclear war.

12:45.098 --> 12:49.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has to have anti-missile
defenses, electromagnetic
defenses.

12:49.702 --> 12:54.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, these are pretty fancy
essentially warplanes
and command centers.

12:54.641 --> 12:59.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That said, president-elect Trump
is saying,
do we need to be spending that
much on them?

12:59.112 --> 13:02.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And very quickly,
Craig Whitlock,
is it believed that Boeing will
now hold the

13:03.016 --> 13:05.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
costs down as a result of the
president-elect's
comments?

13:05.451 --> 13:08.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRAIG WHITLOCK: Well, I think
it's fair to
say it's making a lot of people
at Boeing

13:08.721 --> 13:10.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the Air Force squirm a bit.

13:10.556 --> 13:13.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now they're going -- they have
already had
some scrutiny from Congress on
this program.

13:13.926 --> 13:18.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they know now there is going
to be a new
commander in chief who,
symbolically, one

13:18.398 --> 13:23.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the first things he's done to
point out
alleged Pentagon waste is point
at this program.

13:23.736 --> 13:27.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you know, I think they're
going to go
back to the drawing board and
they're going

13:27.306 --> 13:30.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to have to justify the
projections.

13:30.043 --> 13:34.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Craig Whitlock,
great reporting
by you and Bob Woodward at The
Washington

13:34.080 --> 13:35.581 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Post.

13:35.615 --> 13:40.186 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We thank you.

13:40.219 --> 13:46.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRAIG WHITLOCK: Thank you.

13:46.359 --> 13:52.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: While most
attention has
been focused on the action at
Trump Tower

13:52.098 --> 13:57.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Manhattan, lawmakers at the
U.S. Capitol
are close to passing a major
bill that would

13:57.403 --> 14:01.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lead to big changes with drug
approval, medical
research and much more.

14:01.607 --> 14:04.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins kicks off our
coverage with
this report.

14:04.677 --> 14:08.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Weeks from the
end of its
term, Congress is on the verge
of passing

14:08.915 --> 14:10.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a whopper of a bipartisan bill.

14:10.917 --> 14:12.685 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:12.719 --> 14:14.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: This
legislation promotes critical
investments

14:14.387 --> 14:15.354 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in research.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.856 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:16.889 --> 14:18.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARRY REID (D-NV), Minority
Leader: We're
going to pass the Cures Act.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: A godsend to
supporters,
a spending spree or corporate
giveaway to

14:21.694 --> 14:25.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
critics, here's a look at the
21st century
medical cures bill.

14:25.565 --> 14:31.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is a mammoth $6 billion
measure, now four
major pieces of legislation
packed in one,

14:32.004 --> 14:37.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
starting with a giant nearly $5
billion shot
of funding to the National
Institutes of Health

14:37.243 --> 14:38.945 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for research.

14:38.978 --> 14:43.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That includes almost $2 billion
for the Moonshot
effort led by Vice President Joe
Biden to

14:43.316 --> 14:47.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
find a cure for cancer praised
in a White
House Web video today.

14:47.120 --> 14:50.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN, Vice President of
the United
States: A lot of lives will be
affected by

14:50.123 --> 14:51.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this bill, God willing.

14:51.524 --> 14:53.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's one
reason many Democrats
are on board.

14:54.026 --> 14:55.328 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Another?

14:55.361 --> 14:59.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The bill now includes $1 billion
to address
the opioid epidemic.

14:59.665 --> 15:02.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a national crisis that's
been in funding
limbo for months.

15:02.668 --> 15:04.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
A third major piece?

15:04.637 --> 15:09.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mental health reform, including
a new assistant
secretary position for mental
health and substance

15:09.842 --> 15:11.244 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
use.

15:11.277 --> 15:14.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Republican Tim Murphy, a
psychologist, has
pushed for this for years.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.048 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

15:16.082 --> 15:17.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM MURPHY (R), Pennsylvania:
This doesn't
end the scourge of mental
illness, but this

15:17.617 --> 15:21.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
puts us on a path to really make
some substantial
change and give people help.

15:21.087 --> 15:25.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Now for what
Republican leaders
love, the bill's core, reforming
and speeding

15:25.858 --> 15:29.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
up the Food and Drug
Administration's drug
approval process.

15:29.362 --> 15:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To some, that's modernization
that cuts red
tape, but to others it's a
safety risk.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And some lawmakers see it as a
gift to drug
companies.

15:37.303 --> 15:40.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Those voices are led by
Massachusetts Senator
Elizabeth Warren.

15:40.540 --> 15:41.908 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH WARREN (D),
Massachusetts: I cannot
vote for this bill.

15:43.609 --> 15:48.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will fight it, because I know
the difference
between compromise and
extortion.

15:48.548 --> 15:51.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But she is in
the minority.

15:51.184 --> 15:55.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bill has received bipartisan
support in
Congress so far, and the
president plans to

15:55.755 --> 15:57.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sign it into law.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

15:59.559 --> 16:04.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Let's dive a
little deeper
now into this bill, what would
change, and

16:04.230 --> 16:06.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some of the criticisms around
it.

16:06.065 --> 16:08.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For that, we're joined by two
reporters who
have covered this field
extensively, Sydney

16:08.668 --> 16:12.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lupkin of Kaiser Health News,
and Ed Silverman,
senior writer with STAT News, a
site covering

16:12.738 --> 16:14.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
medicine and health care.

16:14.307 --> 16:18.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Sydney Lupkin, let's start
with what does
or doesn't happen to the FDA.

16:18.411 --> 16:19.579 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's been a lot about that.

16:19.612 --> 16:20.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's the biggest potential
change?

16:20.646 --> 16:22.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SYDNEY LUPKIN, Kaiser Health
News: Sure.

16:22.381 --> 16:27.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, one of the things that
happens for the
FDA is, it gets another $500
million over

16:27.153 --> 16:28.855 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
10 years.

16:28.888 --> 16:34.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It also has more hiring power to
fill the
hundreds of vacancies that it
has as a result

16:34.560 --> 16:36.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of new initiatives, new laws
other over the
years.

16:36.963 --> 16:38.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, that's one thing that does
happen to it.

16:38.931 --> 16:46.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the big thing is that it
really sort of
makes the approval standards a
bit more flexible

16:46.072 --> 16:48.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for drug and device
manufacturers.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK.

16:50.509 --> 16:55.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Ed Silverman, if this
flexibility increases,
is the FDA stick on the hook if
something

16:55.047 --> 16:56.949 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
goes wrong?

16:56.983 --> 16:59.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ED SILVERMAN, STAT News: Yes,
it's a double-edged
sword for the agency, because on
the one hand

16:59.552 --> 17:03.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there will be a new process that
could be
in place.

17:03.823 --> 17:09.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The agency will have to come up
with a guidance,
as it's called, a program that
will determine

17:09.061 --> 17:17.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether or not it can use
different data to
evaluate the approval process
for new indications

17:17.069 --> 17:20.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or new uses for existing
medicines.

17:20.106 --> 17:25.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The catch with that could be
that, if something
goes awry, the agency is still
on the hook.

17:25.578 --> 17:28.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's say there's patient harm,
for instance.

17:28.447 --> 17:32.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So that's the downside, because,
at the end
of the day, it's the regulator
who is typically

17:32.551 --> 17:34.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
blamed when something goes
wrong.

17:34.453 --> 17:37.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, Ed, this
has already
gotten pushback from the likes
of Bernie Sanders

17:37.924 --> 17:39.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Elizabeth Warren.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.060 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ED SILVERMAN: Right.

17:41.093 --> 17:48.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, the concern is that, in
making the approval
process more flexible for new
uses for existing

17:48.367 --> 17:53.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
medicines, it's actually
lowering the standards,
because of instead of using what
is considered

17:53.506 --> 18:01.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the gold standard, randomized
control trial,
the new approach would allow the
agency possibly

18:01.247 --> 18:08.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to look at other sorts of data,
something
like safety surveillance data,
patient-reported

18:08.087 --> 18:11.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
outcomes, these observational
studies.

18:11.691 --> 18:16.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are the sorts of things
that are legitimately
useful and tell us real things,
but they're

18:16.495 --> 18:19.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not the same as having a
full-blown trial.

18:19.832 --> 18:24.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's the sort of tool that
is used to
determine the safety and
effectiveness of

18:24.036 --> 18:25.037 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
any medicine.

18:25.071 --> 18:26.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, that's a big potential
difference.

18:26.973 --> 18:30.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, Sydney
Lupkin, that
also affects the bottom line of
pharmaceutical

18:30.643 --> 18:34.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
companies, because while the
clinically approved
double blind is the gold
standard, it's also

18:34.513 --> 18:35.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pretty time- money-expensive.

18:35.514 --> 18:37.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SYDNEY LUPKIN: It's more
expensive.

18:37.116 --> 18:43.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this does stand to save them
a lot of
money, which is why they lobbied
for it.

18:43.723 --> 18:49.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a lot of lobbying
activity on this
bill, more than 1,400 registered
lobbyists

18:49.528 --> 18:55.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on it representing 400 different
organizations,
many of them pharma.

18:55.234 --> 18:58.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes, it stands to save them a
lot of money.

18:58.237 --> 19:03.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, a lot of
people, whether
it's people who are dealing with
the impacts

19:03.309 --> 19:08.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of opioid abuse or hospitals
that are focused
on research, they have been for
it.

19:08.848 --> 19:10.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They stand to benefit from this.

19:10.116 --> 19:13.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SYDNEY LUPKIN: Right, because of
the NIH funding
in the bill.

19:13.519 --> 19:18.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The NIH is the National
Institutes of Health,
and, basically, a lot of that
money will wind

19:18.758 --> 19:25.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up going into grants that go to
hospitals,
that go to universities, that go
to different

19:25.498 --> 19:27.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
labs to do research.

19:27.867 --> 19:32.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mostly -- you have all heard of
Joe Biden's
Cancer Moonshot.

19:32.938 --> 19:37.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's also a -- something
called the brain
initiative to sort of study the
brain more,

19:38.010 --> 19:42.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alzheimer's, understand more
about how it
works, that you can prevent
things, and precision

19:42.381 --> 19:47.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
medicine, which is, to very much
simplify
it, a lot of genetics research.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Ed Silverman,
how about
the appropriations of this?

19:50.923 --> 19:55.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it's not the Cancer Moonshot
or brain research,
and if it's not one of those
marquee things

19:55.828 --> 19:59.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that people care about, what
happens to the
rest of these huge amounts of
dollars, and

19:59.932 --> 20:02.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is it a guarantee that it will
happen year
after year?

20:02.368 --> 20:06.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ED SILVERMAN: Well, it all
sounds wonderful,
but the money has to be
appropriated.

20:06.439 --> 20:11.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, from day one, we have that
question hanging
over the entire effort.

20:11.210 --> 20:16.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Will that money actually go as
intended to
the right agencies, so it can do
the work?

20:16.782 --> 20:21.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Presumably, the FDA will get
funds, so they
can have more resources to take
on things

20:21.587 --> 20:24.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
like different approval
processes.

20:24.423 --> 20:26.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But the money's got to be there.

20:26.058 --> 20:30.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if it's not appropriated,
well, then where
are we?

20:30.696 --> 20:35.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The agency will end up having
more work without
the added resources.

20:35.901 --> 20:40.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's one of the
struggles that
has made the process over the
past few weeks

20:40.606 --> 20:46.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and months difficult to sort out
and really
feel comfortable that Congress
is going to

20:46.545 --> 20:48.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
do what it says it will do.

20:48.347 --> 20:50.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, Sydney
Lupkin, there
seems to be a shift away from
preventative

20:50.983 --> 20:52.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
measures in parts of the bill.

20:52.852 --> 20:59.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SYDNEY LUPKIN: What the bill
does is, is takes
away, I believe, $3.5 billion in
funding for

20:59.525 --> 21:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
preventative medicine, funds set
up under
Obamacare to study things like
Alzheimer's,

21:06.999 --> 21:09.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
chronic conditions,
hospital-acquired infection.

21:09.435 --> 21:17.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, the goal of that
fund is to
study these things so that then
it ultimately

21:17.543 --> 21:19.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saves the health care system
money.

21:19.245 --> 21:23.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you can prevent something,
you don't have
to spend as much money treating
it.

21:23.482 --> 21:26.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that had been mandatory
funding.

21:26.218 --> 21:28.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So now it will get about 30
percent less than
it had.

21:28.787 --> 21:33.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Ed Silverman,
when it comes
to big pharma companies, drug
prices are something

21:33.058 --> 21:37.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that consumers care about,
something that
even hospitals and different
insurance companies

21:37.062 --> 21:38.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are trying to figure out a way
to decrease.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Does this tackle that at all?

21:40.232 --> 21:42.101 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ED SILVERMAN: No, not really.

21:42.134 --> 21:46.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that that's one
problem that Congress
is going to have to face up to,
whether it

21:46.639 --> 21:48.474 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
likes it or not.

21:48.507 --> 21:52.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It may not be in this
legislation, given that
the Senate vote appears to be
near, at this

21:52.811 --> 21:54.547 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
point anyway.

21:54.580 --> 21:59.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the bill doesn't really
address some of
the fundamental challenges and
issues that

21:59.218 --> 22:04.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are inherently problematic right
now in the
pricing system in this country.

22:04.890 --> 22:08.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is this just
the general
nature of such a large omnibus
bill?

22:08.861 --> 22:10.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ED SILVERMAN: Yes.

22:10.696 --> 22:15.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's almost the kitchen sink
approach, but
not quite, because Congress is
trying to pick

22:15.267 --> 22:20.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and choose a little bit of
what's easiest
and what it's most ideologically
comfortable

22:20.406 --> 22:22.308 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pursuing.

22:22.341 --> 22:27.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For all the detail -- and there
are close
to 1,000 pages in this bill --
it really doesn't

22:27.580 --> 22:29.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
address everything.

22:29.148 --> 22:32.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, unfortunately, we discuss
pricing.

22:32.918 --> 22:37.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's not really mentioned here
in a way
that's going to be meaningful
for Americans.

22:37.489 --> 22:41.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while there may be portions
that are helpful,
there are portions that are also
problematic,

22:41.827 --> 22:46.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as I mentioned before, with
concerns about
the FDA approval process and
what that means

22:46.565 --> 22:48.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
down the road for patient
safety.

22:48.367 --> 22:52.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Ed
Silverman
of STAT News and Sydney Lupkin
of Kaiser Health

22:52.805 --> 22:54.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
News, thanks so much.

22:54.406 --> 22:59.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYDNEY LUPKIN: Thank you.

22:59.445 --> 23:04.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ED SILVERMAN: Thank you.

23:04.550 --> 23:07.853 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

23:07.886 --> 23:12.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
when it's not
just children who are distracted
by their

23:12.291 --> 23:19.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
devices; a guide to creating a
presidential
administration ready on day one;
and two jazz

23:19.798 --> 23:22.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
greats improvise their live
performance.

23:22.901 --> 23:29.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: how one for-profit
school model
is being tested to help
revitalize a school

23:29.942 --> 23:32.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
system in West Africa.

23:32.077 --> 23:38.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our story is in Liberia, a
country founded
by freed American slaves with a
history marked

23:38.050 --> 23:43.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by suffering, including two
recent civil wars
and the Ebola epidemic.

23:43.389 --> 23:48.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the government is trying
to rebuild
a shattered nation, but a move
to employ a

23:48.193 --> 23:53.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for-profit American education
company has
drawn controversy.

23:53.098 --> 23:58.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Fred de
Sam Lazaro reports
as part of our weekly education
series on

23:58.637 --> 24:00.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Making the Grade.

24:00.639 --> 24:08.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: It's Friday
morning, and
the children at this public
elementary school

24:08.414 --> 24:13.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are singing patriotic songs that
honor their
country's founding by freed
American slaves.

24:13.719 --> 24:20.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as the U.S.-inspired flag is
being raised,
so too are hopes about how
public education

24:20.459 --> 24:23.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can be quickly and dramatically
improved.

24:23.829 --> 24:29.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These students are part of a
grand experiment
to see if a private for-profit
U.S.-based

24:29.535 --> 24:35.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
company can turn things around
in a nation
utterly destroyed by a 14-year
long civil

24:35.107 --> 24:38.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
war and a recent battle with
Ebola.

24:38.610 --> 24:43.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president of Liberia has
called the country's
education system a mess.

24:43.716 --> 24:45.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What did she mean?

24:45.551 --> 24:53.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Consider this statistic: In
2013, not one
of 25,000 high school graduates
in this country

24:53.625 --> 24:59.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
managed to pass the college
entrance exam
for the University of Liberia.

24:59.131 --> 25:04.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The experiment to bring in
private partners
was designed by Education
Minister George

25:04.069 --> 25:09.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Werner, who took office 15
months ago, hired
by the president, he says, to
act quickly.

25:09.174 --> 25:13.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GEORGE WERNER, Liberian
Education Minister:
If we stayed the course,
followed the traditional

25:13.746 --> 25:19.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ways of doing things, we
wouldn't catch up
with our neighboring
counterparts.

25:19.151 --> 25:24.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Werner had
been impressed
during a visit to Kenya, where
the U.S. company

25:24.623 --> 25:30.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bridge International Academies
operates more
than 350 private schools.

25:30.629 --> 25:36.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Liberia, where average annual
household
income is less than $500, Werner
knew most

25:36.268 --> 25:41.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
families could not afford the
monthly $6 fee
that Bridge charges per child in
those other

25:41.874 --> 25:43.208 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
countries.

25:43.242 --> 25:44.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But he had an idea.

25:44.576 --> 25:51.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEORGE WERNER: What if we had a
hybrid for
public and private?

25:51.316 --> 25:57.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are certain things that
the private
sector does better than the
public sector.

25:57.222 --> 26:03.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Government can come up with the
policies,
but management systems and
service delivery,

26:03.061 --> 26:06.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
often, the private sector does
better than
the government.

26:06.298 --> 26:12.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Werner hired
seven private
organizations to run a total of
94 primary

26:12.304 --> 26:13.272 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
schools.

26:13.305 --> 26:18.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bridge, the only for-profit,
runs 24 of them.

26:18.544 --> 26:20.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Josh Nathan is the company's
academic director.

26:20.646 --> 26:22.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH NATHAN, Academic Director,
Bridge International
Academies: What the government
has done in

26:22.314 --> 26:24.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Liberia is quite courageous.

26:24.149 --> 26:27.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They've said, we're struggling
with providing
children this basic right, so
what we want

26:27.886 --> 26:33.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do is look around, look
inside Liberia
and outside Liberia, at other
people who are

26:33.392 --> 26:36.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
succeeding in providing children
with an excellent
education.

26:36.361 --> 26:40.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The
government agreed
to pay the companies directly,
so education

26:40.866 --> 26:43.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
remains free for families.

26:43.068 --> 26:48.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The companies also provide
uniforms, which
are required at public schools
and whose cost

26:48.073 --> 26:50.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
keeps many from attending.

26:50.309 --> 26:56.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we visited the Bridge
school in Kendaja,
the semester was only two weeks
underway,

26:56.081 --> 26:58.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and many of the uniforms had not
yet arrived.

26:58.050 --> 27:00.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAGDALENE BROWN, Bridge School
Principal:
Today is a wonderful day for us
too.

27:00.319 --> 27:05.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Principal
Magdalene Brown
said the improvements were
already very apparent.

27:05.123 --> 27:09.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For one thing, there's a much
longer school
day.

27:09.328 --> 27:11.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Last year, it was just four
hours a day.

27:11.196 --> 27:19.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAGDALENE BROWN: Bridge has us
come to school
much earlier, like we at 7:30,
and then Bridge

27:19.238 --> 27:23.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have us stay on until 3:30 every
day.

27:23.575 --> 27:26.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that means the children will
learn better.

27:26.545 --> 27:31.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Even the
students seem
to like it more, including
15-year-old Mercy

27:31.750 --> 27:32.818 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Freeman.

27:32.851 --> 27:33.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MERCY FREEMAN, Student: We come
to school
on time.

27:33.752 --> 27:35.020 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We sit in class.

27:35.053 --> 27:39.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And school
actually runs
like a school?

27:39.224 --> 27:40.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MERCY FREEMAN: Yes.

27:40.926 --> 27:45.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: There are
also new rules,
such as no more corporal
punishment.

27:45.330 --> 27:50.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And along with new textbooks,
every teacher
is given a computer tablet and
is required

27:50.502 --> 27:54.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to stick to pre-loaded lesson
plans.

27:54.506 --> 28:00.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Critics of this so-called
school-in-a-box
approach say it encourages
robotic teaching

28:00.612 --> 28:04.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and has allowed Bridge in other
countries
to hire cheaper, less qualified
instructors.

28:04.950 --> 28:11.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's less of an issue in
Liberia, where
Bridge schools retrain teachers
who are already

28:11.123 --> 28:16.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
working in the school system and
where many
had their own education
disrupted by the civil

28:16.728 --> 28:17.996 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
war.

28:18.030 --> 28:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In this building, teachers
seemed grateful
for the guidance.

28:21.833 --> 28:25.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Amos Jumanine has taught for
seven years,
but says he was a late bloomer.

28:25.737 --> 28:28.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMOS JUMANINE, Teacher: I was 17
years when
I started ABCs.

28:28.440 --> 28:33.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: You went to
kindergarten
learning your ABCs when you were
17?

28:33.812 --> 28:35.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMOS JUMANINE: Yeah, 17.

28:35.581 --> 28:40.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He is
hopeful the new
partnership will be good for the
students.

28:40.519 --> 28:46.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he is adamant on one thing
that needs
to change: Teachers need to be
paid more money,

28:46.291 --> 28:49.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
especially now that they're
required to work
longer hours.

28:49.294 --> 28:51.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMOS JUMANINE: I cannot afford
to buy food
for myself.

28:51.530 --> 28:53.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Financially,
it's very
difficult?

28:53.632 --> 28:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMOS JUMANINE: Yes, financially.

28:54.700 --> 28:56.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Very
difficult.

28:56.368 --> 28:58.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMOS JUMANINE: Very difficult.

28:58.136 --> 29:02.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Teachers in
Liberia earn
about $100 a month, and many say
they take

29:02.574 --> 29:05.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
second jobs just to make ends
meet.

29:05.110 --> 29:11.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That contributes to one of the
biggest problems
in Liberian schools: chronic
teacher absenteeism.

29:11.149 --> 29:14.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Not only are teachers routinely
absent.

29:14.686 --> 29:20.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many really never existed, just
their names
on paychecks issued by the
schools.

29:21.026 --> 29:27.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Education Minister Werner says
he's purged
about 1,300 so-called ghost
teachers, saving

29:28.000 --> 29:30.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
$2 million that was being
siphoned away in
fraud.

29:31.003 --> 29:34.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH NATHAN: The president
herself has acknowledged
that this is a system that is
really a mess.

29:34.339 --> 29:38.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Josh Nathan
says the Bridge
schools use software in the
teachers' tablets

29:38.276 --> 29:40.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to track their daily attendance.

29:40.178 --> 29:44.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH NATHAN: We think this is
incredibly important
to creating accountability and
being able

29:44.182 --> 29:47.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to watch every single day, where
are our teachers,
are they where they need to be?

29:47.786 --> 29:51.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: For their
part, the teachers
union is strongly opposed to the
partnership

29:51.590 --> 29:53.291 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
program.

29:53.325 --> 29:58.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It points out that these new
schools have
smaller class size, around 45 to
55 pupils,

29:58.330 --> 30:04.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and receive about $10 to $15
more per student
than regular public schools.

30:04.369 --> 30:08.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Union leaders say their teachers
could get
even better outcomes than Bridge
if they were

30:08.473 --> 30:10.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
given that extra money and
smaller classes.

30:10.976 --> 30:16.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you had the right conditions
and a better
salary, a lot of the problem
would be solved?

30:16.181 --> 30:17.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARY MULBAH, Teachers Union:
Yes.

30:17.549 --> 30:20.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And when you
argued this,
what were you told?

30:20.485 --> 30:23.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY MULBAH: The ministry,
they're not even
listening to the teachers.

30:23.789 --> 30:29.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Mary Mulbah
blames corruption
at the ministry for hiring the
ghost teachers

30:29.161 --> 30:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and alleges the ministry is
using its purges
to target union activists.

30:34.866 --> 30:39.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Immanuel Morris, who was in a
government program
to train and hire new teachers,
says his name

30:39.838 --> 30:40.806 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was deleted.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.274 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Are you a ghost?

30:42.307 --> 30:43.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IMMANUEL MORRIS, Union Activist:
I'm not a
ghost, and I can prove that.

30:43.775 --> 30:45.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: They're
calling you a
ghost.

30:45.510 --> 30:46.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IMMANUEL MORRIS: That is what
I'm saying.

30:46.511 --> 30:47.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And you're
not a ghost?

30:47.512 --> 30:49.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IMMANUEL MORRIS: I'm not a
ghost.

30:49.414 --> 30:52.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Union
leaders also question
whether such programs could be
scaled up to

30:52.951 --> 30:58.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
serve the 2,750 elementary
schools across
the country.

30:58.156 --> 31:03.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Minister Werner knows there are
risks, but
says the government has a moral
obligation

31:03.261 --> 31:04.529 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to take drastic measures.

31:04.563 --> 31:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GEORGE WERNER: It's not a
panacea.

31:08.567 --> 31:09.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it may just not work.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we should not just fold our
arms and do
nothing.

31:12.571 --> 31:17.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
Sixty-one-year-old Marie
Jaynes couldn't agree more.

31:17.676 --> 31:20.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She herself had to drop out of
school in fourth
grade.

31:20.645 --> 31:26.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She now sells water at the side
of the road
to support her three
grandchildren, their

31:26.885 --> 31:28.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
parents killed in the civil war.

31:29.020 --> 31:33.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jaynes says the new school will
give her grandchildren
a better life than she has had.

31:33.558 --> 31:38.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIE JAYNES, Grandmother: What
hope for them
is to go far in school, for them
to know the

31:38.864 --> 31:40.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
importance of school.

31:40.532 --> 31:44.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: They are the
first of
three generations in her family
that might

31:44.569 --> 31:48.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
enjoy the privileges of at least
a primary
school education.

31:49.007 --> 31:52.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Fred de Sam
Lazaro in Kendaja, Liberia.

31:52.911 --> 31:59.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A version of this
story aired
on the PBS program "Religion &amp;
Ethics Newsweekly."

31:59.918 --> 32:05.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Fred's reporting is a
partnership with the
Under-Told Stories Project at
University of

32:05.323 --> 32:10.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
St. Thomas in Minnesota.

32:10.162 --> 32:22.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We have spent
our share
of time looking at how kids and
teens spend

32:22.374 --> 32:24.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
time with their screens.

32:24.075 --> 32:27.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now there's a new survey that
finds their
parents have some of the same
habits.

32:27.712 --> 32:32.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The study, which asked for
feedback from 1,700
parents of children age 8 to 18,
found adults

32:32.851 --> 32:38.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spending more than nine hours a
day themselves
looking at video screens.

32:38.056 --> 32:42.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yet, even as they are worried
about how much
time their children spend
watching screens,

32:42.794 --> 32:47.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nearly 80 percent of parents
felt they were
good role models for their kids
when it came

32:47.999 --> 32:49.701 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to this.

32:49.734 --> 32:52.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jim Steyer is the founder and
CEO of Common
Sense Media, which conducted the
survey.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My jaw is still on the floor
about the nine
hours.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That seems unbelievable.

32:56.374 --> 32:58.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have got to be counting
stuff that I do
at work and my laptop.

32:58.877 --> 33:00.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES STEYER, Founder and CEO,
Common Sense
Media: It's astounding to me,
too.

33:00.612 --> 33:01.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I thought it was going to be
about four hours.

33:01.947 --> 33:03.014 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

33:03.048 --> 33:04.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I thought it would be four,
four-and-a-half-hours.

33:04.416 --> 33:07.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The truth is, though, it's only
an hour-and-a-half
of work time.

33:07.619 --> 33:12.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So that means seven hours and 45
minutes per
day, the average American parent
is spending

33:12.123 --> 33:13.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with screen media at home.

33:14.025 --> 33:15.327 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It was shocking.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they think they're good role
models.

33:17.162 --> 33:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, that's the
other part,
that while they try to tell
their kids, get

33:21.399 --> 33:26.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off your phone and pay attention
and talk
to each other, under the table,
they're checking

33:26.238 --> 33:27.205 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their e-mail.

33:27.239 --> 33:28.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES STEYER: That's exactly
right.

33:28.874 --> 33:31.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, actually, I do think that's
what the
bottom line about this whole
survey is.

33:31.309 --> 33:33.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First of all, nobody ever asked
parents.

33:33.111 --> 33:36.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you mentioned in the opening,
we have looked
at how much time kids do,
whether they're

33:36.414 --> 33:39.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
age 8 to 18 or zero to 8, but
nobody ever
asked parents.

33:39.618 --> 33:41.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I thought parents were much
more controlled.

33:41.720 --> 33:44.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the truth is, everybody is
addicted to
their devices these days.

33:44.356 --> 33:47.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And you
actually started
to break it down by income level
and ethnicity.

33:47.292 --> 33:48.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES STEYER: Right.

33:48.526 --> 33:50.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You started to
see some
patterns emerged.

33:50.295 --> 33:54.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAMES STEYER: The most
interesting pattern
is that Latino families are more
than twice

33:54.099 --> 34:00.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as concerned about and engaged
in their kids'
media consumption as white or
African-American

34:00.305 --> 34:02.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or Asian American parents.

34:02.073 --> 34:06.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there is a big cultural
difference, and
I think a very laudable one, in
the Latino

34:07.012 --> 34:08.513 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
community.

34:08.546 --> 34:13.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're more concerned about
cyber-bullying,
about pornography, about issues.

34:13.919 --> 34:15.754 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then they set tougher
limits.

34:15.787 --> 34:20.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I actually think it shows a
cultural tendency
toward family that's good, that
we should

34:20.392 --> 34:22.160 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all learn from.

34:22.193 --> 34:24.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It also seems
to be that
the more they know about what
their kids are

34:24.062 --> 34:25.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doing, the less worried they
are.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES STEYER: I think that's
true in general.

34:26.665 --> 34:29.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Your kids are going to get older
sooner than
you think, Hari.

34:29.334 --> 34:36.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you do know more, I
think you relax
and think, I can teach them
judgment and values.

34:36.207 --> 34:41.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think parents today are
just blown away
by the surfeit of digital media
platforms

34:41.780 --> 34:43.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that we all live with.

34:43.615 --> 34:47.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They don't understand Snapchat
or Instagram,
but they're using them
themselves more than

34:47.886 --> 34:48.853 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they were once.

34:48.887 --> 34:50.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think the number, nine hours,
is shocking.

34:50.956 --> 34:55.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TV is still the number-one
medium that parents
like, but they are spending time
on the same

34:55.927 --> 34:57.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
platforms that their kids are.

34:57.429 --> 34:59.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And how do
they feel about
social media for their kids?

35:00.031 --> 35:00.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES STEYER: Mixed.

35:01.032 --> 35:02.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Very mixed.

35:02.634 --> 35:04.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I actually think that's
really true about
media and technology in general.

35:04.836 --> 35:10.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the one hand, parents think
their kids
have to learn technology for
education, for

35:10.842 --> 35:12.510 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
jobs, for 21st century skills.

35:12.544 --> 35:16.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, 94 percent of parents
agree that technology
is really good.

35:16.214 --> 35:21.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, they're
worried about tech
addiction, lack of sleep,
cyber-bullying,

35:21.319 --> 35:23.054 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pornography, all the downsides.

35:23.088 --> 35:25.156 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it's a nuanced picture.

35:25.190 --> 35:27.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it reflects the way
I feel as
a parent of four kids, too.

35:27.993 --> 35:29.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have got to be there.

35:29.494 --> 35:31.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And actually they have to
understand social
media.

35:31.763 --> 35:33.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I'm worried about what might
happen to
them.

35:33.865 --> 35:37.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And in this
day and age,
you go to classrooms, so many of
them are

35:37.235 --> 35:39.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wired or wireless, and kids are
connected
to laptops.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sometimes, they're bringing that
software
home.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's necessary for homework.

35:44.009 --> 35:45.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES STEYER: That's right.

35:45.110 --> 35:46.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we believe strongly in that
at Common
Sense.

35:46.611 --> 35:49.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We now have 130,000 member
schools.

35:49.314 --> 35:52.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, the vast majority of
American schools
are members of Common Sense
Media and use

35:53.018 --> 35:57.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a curriculum we developed with
Harvard professors
called Digital Literacy and
Citizenship.

35:57.922 --> 36:05.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, technology -- comma -- used
wisely -- comma
-- is an extraordinary
educational tool.

36:05.230 --> 36:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But used inappropriately, it can
cause all
sorts of problems.

36:08.400 --> 36:11.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I actually think that's
clearly now as
true for parents as it is for
our kids.

36:11.836 --> 36:15.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Were there any
clear rules
of the road that these parents
advocated for?

36:15.673 --> 36:17.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JAMES STEYER: Well, it's
interesting.

36:17.509 --> 36:20.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you mentioned in the opening,
nearly 80
percent of parents say that
they're good role

36:20.278 --> 36:21.780 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
models.

36:21.813 --> 36:25.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you would think, therefore,
that they're
doing three or four hours a day.

36:25.784 --> 36:29.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The truth is, the big thing that
we have seen
and we have promoted at Common
Sense is what

36:29.621 --> 36:35.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we call device-free dinner,
meaning have family
meals, not just dinner, but all
family meals.

36:35.160 --> 36:39.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Get rid of the phones, get rid
of your laptops,
get rid of all those devices,
and just be

36:39.831 --> 36:44.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there with your kids, and create
sacred spaces,
what our colleague at MIT Sherry
Turkle refers

36:44.769 --> 36:49.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to as sacred spaces, where there
is just no
device in between you and your
children.

36:49.441 --> 36:53.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, parents say they do that,
but the numbers
sort of belie that.

36:53.778 --> 36:56.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What about any
kind of long-term
effects?

36:56.714 --> 37:00.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Relatively speaking, smartphones
are still
pretty new in the long arc of
technology.

37:00.251 --> 37:02.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES STEYER: Yes.

37:02.153 --> 37:06.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, I think it has an
enormous impact
on everything from empathy -- if
you're constantly

37:06.491 --> 37:11.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looking down at your phone, as
opposed to
talking to your kid, I think it
has an effect

37:11.529 --> 37:13.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on your relationship with that
child.

37:13.465 --> 37:17.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, with younger kids,
there's brain
development issues.

37:17.502 --> 37:21.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At my age, I don't -- whatever
little brain
I have is probably developed as
much as it's

37:21.439 --> 37:23.308 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going to be.

37:23.341 --> 37:27.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think it has to do with
long-term effects
on family relationships, human
interaction.

37:27.479 --> 37:31.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the positives are the
educational opportunities,
the chance to connect with
people around the

37:31.749 --> 37:33.651 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
world.

37:33.685 --> 37:37.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's all about how you use
it, and I actually
think setting limits, too, and a
healthy media

37:37.956 --> 37:39.457 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
diet.

37:39.491 --> 37:41.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Jim
Steyer, Common
Sense Media, thanks so much.

37:41.593 --> 37:51.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES STEYER: Great to be here,
Hari.

37:51.302 --> 37:58.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: With
president-elect Trump
focused on preparing to take
office in January,

37:58.543 --> 38:02.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we return now to the transition
process from
one president to the next.

38:02.647 --> 38:08.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I sat down recently with Max
Stier, no relation
to the Jim Steyer we just heard
from.

38:08.386 --> 38:13.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Max Stier is president and CEO
of the Partnership
for Public Service and an expert
on presidential

38:13.491 --> 38:15.493 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
transitions.

38:15.527 --> 38:17.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Max Stier, welcome to the
"NewsHour."

38:17.395 --> 38:20.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You have published this
presidential transition
guide.

38:20.632 --> 38:25.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you have also called the
Trump transition
the biggest takeover in history
of an organization.

38:25.770 --> 38:27.272 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Seriously?

38:27.305 --> 38:29.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAX STIER, President and CEO,
Partnership
for Public Service: Seriously.

38:29.107 --> 38:32.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You think about the United
States government,
you're talking about $4 trillion
in spend,

38:32.977 --> 38:36.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
four million people, when you
include the
military, hundreds of different
operating

38:36.614 --> 38:38.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
entities and the agencies.

38:38.550 --> 38:43.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have got 4,000 political
appointees; 1,100
of them have to go through
Senate confirmation.

38:43.922 --> 38:48.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No other democracy has that kind
of penetration
of political appointees in
government.

38:48.960 --> 38:54.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a phenomenally complex,
important, and
critical process that is
typically very ill-understood.

38:54.832 --> 38:59.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what does a
president-elect
coming in and his or her team,
what do they

38:59.237 --> 39:01.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have to get right from the
start?

39:01.673 --> 39:05.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAX STIER: Right from the start,
they have
to understand how difficult this
process is,

39:05.543 --> 39:10.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and that history is not
sufficient guidance
for what has to come going
forward.

39:10.048 --> 39:13.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Transition is also the point of
maximum vulnerability
for our country.

39:13.384 --> 39:17.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a post-9/11 world, getting
this right is
essential, not just for the
president to be

39:17.789 --> 39:22.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
able to achieve their policy
objectives, but
also to keep us safe.

39:22.293 --> 39:26.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Job number one is to get your
team on the
field when the clock starts, and
that means

39:26.531 --> 39:28.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
January 20 at noon.

39:28.733 --> 39:31.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's not going to be
everybody, but
our view is, you should have
your full White

39:31.703 --> 39:36.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House in place and at least your
top 100 Senate
confirmed positions that are
leading the agencies

39:36.841 --> 39:38.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that are critical to running
government.

39:38.676 --> 39:43.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we look at
this and we
hear some of the names that have
been announced

39:43.281 --> 39:46.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
so far by Donald Trump.

39:46.251 --> 39:50.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most of them either haven't
served in government
or, if they have, they haven't
served in the

39:50.188 --> 39:51.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
executive branch.

39:51.322 --> 39:53.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why does that matter?

39:53.124 --> 39:57.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAX STIER: It matters because
running these
agencies is a phenomenally
difficult task.

39:57.195 --> 40:01.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so when you think about
running a large
organization, and you want
people who have

40:01.232 --> 40:05.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
done that before, it's harder in
the government
than it is in the private
sector.

40:05.536 --> 40:10.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Truth is that almost -- and I
mean this -- almost
nobody ever comes into the
government at the

40:10.708 --> 40:13.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
senior levels with having the
experience of
having done it before.

40:13.845 --> 40:14.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's new for everybody.

40:14.846 --> 40:16.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The learning curve is very
steep.

40:16.581 --> 40:20.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One exception, obviously, is
someone like
Elaine Chao, who's both at
Transportation

40:20.718 --> 40:21.686 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and at Labor.

40:21.719 --> 40:22.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

40:22.720 --> 40:23.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAX STIER: But that truly is the
exception.

40:23.721 --> 40:26.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These are incredibly hard jobs
to get right.

40:26.357 --> 40:30.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as much experience as you
have is good,
but you really need to
contextualize that

40:30.828 --> 40:33.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
experience to specific issues
you face in
government.

40:34.032 --> 40:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that requires a lot of
learning fast.

40:35.867 --> 40:40.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you assess
so far -- I
know we're still early in the
process -- that

40:40.672 --> 40:44.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Trump team is doing in terms
of getting
its arms around what's coming?

40:44.475 --> 40:47.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAX STIER: So, I think that they
have a long
distance still to travel.

40:47.512 --> 40:50.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They did some very, very good
pre-election
planning.

40:51.015 --> 40:52.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now they're at game time.

40:52.383 --> 40:54.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're obviously naming a punch
of people.

40:54.218 --> 40:58.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But naming them isn't the same
thing as getting
them into the seats.

40:58.389 --> 40:59.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Clearing conflicts have to
happen.

40:59.924 --> 41:02.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have to go through the
Senate confirmation
process.

41:02.260 --> 41:04.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have a background checks
that the FBI
does.

41:04.796 --> 41:07.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a very difficult process
in the ordinary
course.

41:07.699 --> 41:12.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for a number of these
people, especially
with high net worth, very
complicated holdings,

41:12.103 --> 41:13.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it makes it even harder.

41:13.538 --> 41:15.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have got a long distance to
travel.

41:15.373 --> 41:19.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the key here is not to
focus on single
individuals, but, one, have they
adopted the

41:19.944 --> 41:21.813 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right goals?

41:21.846 --> 41:25.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, again, that means getting
their leaders
in place at the beginning,
coming to the table

41:25.216 --> 41:29.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a management agenda,
starting right with
Congress and with other critical
stakeholders,

41:29.721 --> 41:32.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like the career work force,
which they will
have to run.

41:32.123 --> 41:33.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those are the things that they
need to set
up now.

41:33.958 --> 41:37.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then they need to
demonstrate this in
the next couple of months, that
they're ready

41:37.595 --> 41:39.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to go when they own the place.

41:39.297 --> 41:44.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And how are these
skills that
are required right now different
from the

41:44.435 --> 41:45.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
skills in the private sector?

41:45.803 --> 41:48.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, Donald Trump clearly
comes out of
the business world.

41:48.840 --> 41:51.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many of the people he's named
come out of
the business world with these
early names.

41:51.542 --> 41:52.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAX STIER: Right.

41:52.543 --> 41:53.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There are more to
come.

41:53.678 --> 41:57.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what's different in the
muscles that are
needed?

41:57.181 --> 41:58.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAX STIER: It's a great
question.

41:58.983 --> 42:04.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would say one positive is
that the government
does need smart business
principles.

42:04.722 --> 42:08.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you get someone who has
run an organization
in the private sector in a good
way, there

42:09.026 --> 42:11.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are great principles that can be
transferred
over.

42:11.763 --> 42:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They need the good principles,
but government
cannot be run like a business,
so some differences.

42:16.334 --> 42:18.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Starts with Congress.

42:18.202 --> 42:20.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when you're in the private
sector, you
don't have to worry about a
board of directors

42:20.505 --> 42:25.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is in conflict with each
other, that
doesn't provide you with a
budget, that doesn't

42:25.610 --> 42:27.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have a capital budget.

42:27.245 --> 42:30.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The working-with-Congress piece
is phenomenally
different and very complicated.

42:30.815 --> 42:33.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have a high degree of
transparency.

42:33.484 --> 42:35.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have multiple different
stakeholders.

42:35.486 --> 42:39.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you have scale that you
almost never see
in the private sector that you
have in government.

42:39.957 --> 42:45.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly,
finally,
Max Stier, to the public
watching out there

42:45.530 --> 42:51.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who doesn't know a lot or really
isn't that
interested in the inner workings
of government,

42:51.135 --> 42:52.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
why should they care about this?

42:52.637 --> 42:53.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAX STIER: Right.

42:54.005 --> 42:55.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, fundamentally, this is --
it all begins
in the beginning.

42:55.840 --> 42:59.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you get the beginning wrong,
you're playing
catchup for the rest of your
administration.

42:59.644 --> 43:02.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It starts with national
security.

43:02.346 --> 43:04.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the core function of our
government.

43:04.515 --> 43:07.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, transition is the point
of maximum
vulnerability for our
government.

43:07.618 --> 43:09.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have a lot of enemies out
there.

43:09.454 --> 43:13.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're looking to see whether
or not that
baton handoff is clean, that the
new leadership

43:13.558 --> 43:14.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is actually ready.

43:14.559 --> 43:15.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, that's where it begins.

43:15.927 --> 43:18.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's also all the other
things we get
from our government.

43:18.596 --> 43:23.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In order for that to happen
right, we need
the new president to be ready on
day one,

43:23.601 --> 43:28.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people in place, right goals, a
management
agenda, and understanding how
the whole process

43:28.973 --> 43:30.675 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
works.

43:30.708 --> 43:33.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Max Stier with
the Partnership
for Public Service, thank you so
much for

43:33.678 --> 43:34.645 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coming by.

43:34.679 --> 43:38.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAX STIER: Thank you very much.

43:38.549 --> 43:51.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Next: how a
passion for
improvisation can make beautiful
music.

43:51.496 --> 43:55.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two jazz stalwarts rejoin forces
for a new
album and a series of concerts.

43:55.500 --> 43:58.269 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

43:58.302 --> 44:11.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The song, Hoagy
Carmichael's
1938 ballad "The Nearness of
You," performed

44:11.382 --> 44:26.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a kind of conversation
between two master
musicians who happen to be peers
and friends,

44:26.297 --> 44:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saxophonist Joshua Redman,
pianist Brad Mehldau.

44:29.367 --> 44:32.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRAD MEHLDAU, Pianist: If you're
going to
play a ballad with someone, and
you want it

44:32.703 --> 44:37.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be anything deeper than this
just sort
of surface, you're going to have
to be vulnerable

44:37.475 --> 44:38.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the other person.

44:38.876 --> 44:40.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's what the audience
wants to see,
too.

44:40.545 --> 44:41.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOSHUA REDMAN, Saxophonist: Yes.

44:41.546 --> 44:42.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jazz is all about vulnerability.

44:42.547 --> 44:43.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRAD MEHLDAU: So, you got to...

44:43.548 --> 44:44.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Vulnerability?

44:44.549 --> 44:45.516 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

44:45.550 --> 44:46.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRAD MEHLDAU: Yes.

44:46.984 --> 44:48.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSHUA REDMAN: I think so, yes,
because we're
improvising, you know?

44:48.786 --> 44:52.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're not coming to the
bandstand with
a preconceived notion of what
we're going

44:52.790 --> 44:54.625 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to play.

44:54.659 --> 44:59.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to be open and available
and vulnerable
to really make that connection
with ourselves

44:59.931 --> 45:01.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and with the other musician.

45:01.766 --> 45:07.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Redman, 47, and
Mehldau, 46,
have been filling concert halls
and jazz clubs,

45:07.638 --> 45:15.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on their own, as band leaders,
and together,
for more than 20 years.

45:15.680 --> 45:20.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This fall, they have joined
forces again in
a recent performance at New
York's Jazz at

45:20.184 --> 45:28.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Lincoln Center, and on a
newly-released album
titled "Nearness," a mix of
original material

45:28.459 --> 45:32.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and jazz standards recorded live
on tour in
2011.

45:32.096 --> 45:39.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOSHUA REDMAN: I feel so
fortunate to be able
to make the music that I believe
in, and to

45:39.136 --> 45:44.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get up there every night and
just play from
the soul and go for it.

45:44.508 --> 45:49.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRAD MEHLDAU: As an improvising
musician,
I really feel committed to not
going out there

45:49.614 --> 45:51.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and playing some nonsense for
people, you
know?

45:51.148 --> 45:52.116 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

45:52.149 --> 45:53.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRAD MEHLDAU: There's a bit of a
script.

45:53.918 --> 45:57.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have some plan, but what they
want to hear
is, they really want to hear us
try to be

45:57.321 --> 45:58.289 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
creative.

45:58.322 --> 46:00.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Both men came to
music early.

46:00.491 --> 46:06.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Redman, in California, was
raised by his dancer
mother, and is the son of
well-known saxophonist

46:06.631 --> 46:13.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dewey Redman, Mehldau in Florida
and Connecticut
in a family home never without a
piano.

46:13.871 --> 46:19.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They arrived separately in New
York in the
early 1990s, where each found
his own early

46:19.744 --> 46:21.379 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
success.

46:21.412 --> 46:26.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We spoke recently at the
Steinway Piano Showroom
in Manhattan just before a
concert.

46:26.384 --> 46:31.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRAD MEHLDAU: Even when I'm
ostensibly accompanying
him, and he's ostensibly taking
the solo,

46:31.689 --> 46:33.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we're still having this
conversation.

46:33.557 --> 46:38.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it may mean, for instance,
that he plays
a melodic idea, and then I
respond to it sort

46:38.195 --> 46:43.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of in real time, and I might
even give him
something back, that then he
responds to again.

46:43.167 --> 46:44.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOSHUA REDMAN: I'm always
looking for something.

46:44.669 --> 46:46.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRAD MEHLDAU: And he's kind of
waiting for
it.

46:46.370 --> 46:48.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's like, come on, what do you
got?

46:48.172 --> 46:49.106 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

46:49.140 --> 46:50.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What do you got?

46:50.141 --> 46:51.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRAD MEHLDAU: Yes.

46:51.442 --> 46:52.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSHUA REDMAN: Well, and often
because I don't
have anything.

46:52.143 --> 46:53.377 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:53.411 --> 46:55.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSHUA REDMAN: I always feel
like I'm -- as
an improviser.

46:55.246 --> 47:01.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I feel a little hamstrung by
this instrument
and its role in jazz, because
it's basically

47:01.385 --> 47:03.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a soloist instrument.

47:03.287 --> 47:08.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I play melodies, maybe some
accompanying harmonies
if there's another horn player,
and then I

47:08.926 --> 47:20.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will take a solo, and then I
have to go stand
at the side of the stage.

47:20.771 --> 47:25.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, I have rhythm section
envy because
they get to, like, be in there,
and always

47:25.910 --> 47:29.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- you know, they're always
listening, always
reacting.

47:29.113 --> 47:34.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I feel like my best ideas
often don't
come from me.

47:34.418 --> 47:37.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They come from the other
musicians that I'm
playing with, and especially
when I'm playing

47:37.888 --> 47:39.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with someone like Brad.

47:39.590 --> 47:50.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I asked for a
demonstration,
and the two launched into some
blues.

47:50.735 --> 48:00.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRAD MEHLDAU: One thing that
Josh does that's
very exciting for me, as an
accompanist, is

48:00.778 --> 48:11.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRAD MEHLDAU: One thing that
Josh does that's
very exciting for me, as an
accompanist, is

48:11.322 --> 48:14.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that I throw him a curve in the
middle of
his phrase.

48:14.925 --> 48:18.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he was starting to start a
phrase that
was a little more conventional.

48:18.696 --> 48:23.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he was going to kind of wrap
it up, OK,
we gave you an illustration, by
returning

48:23.200 --> 48:24.935 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the melody.

48:24.969 --> 48:32.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then I -- in the middle of
that phrase,
I sort of went -- and I
harmonically went

48:32.243 --> 48:46.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off the chart of what would be
the normal
harmony there in this 12-bar
blues we're playing.

48:46.857 --> 48:53.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In real time, somehow, he heard
me doing that
and adjusted his phrase in the
middle of the

48:53.864 --> 48:55.599 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
phrase.

48:55.633 --> 48:58.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Is that an
intellectual process
that he just described, where he
switches

48:58.869 --> 49:01.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and you have to react quickly,
or it just
happens?

49:01.105 --> 49:02.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOSHUA REDMAN: That's an
excellent question.

49:02.907 --> 49:07.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whatever it is, if I feel like
it's an intellectual
process, then I'm not
successful.

49:07.278 --> 49:08.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's not going to
work.

49:08.579 --> 49:11.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOSHUA REDMAN: It's an
emotional, it's an
intuitive process.

49:11.182 --> 49:16.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, of course it's happening
in the brain,
right, but if I'm thinking about
responding

49:16.821 --> 49:23.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in that way, then I'm
overthinking it, and
I probably won't do it well.

49:23.794 --> 49:30.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRAD MEHLDAU: It's very exciting
to really
improvise, and to have that
moment.

49:30.868 --> 49:32.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's also very social music.

49:32.770 --> 49:34.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A lot of times, you're with
other people.

49:34.605 --> 49:42.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to have that white-heat kind
of communication
between another musician, it's
very -- it's

49:42.246 --> 49:43.414 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pretty exciting.

49:43.447 --> 49:45.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSHUA REDMAN: It's a great time
to be a jazz
musician.

49:45.316 --> 49:50.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: After our talk,
Joshua Redman
and Brad Mehldau set off on a
European tour,

49:50.154 --> 49:53.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the two continue to perform
their separate
gigs.

49:53.390 --> 50:00.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From New York, I'm Jeffrey Brown
for the "PBS
NewsHour."

50:00.965 --> 50:07.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: After Jeff's
interview,
Redman and Mehldau played a song
from the

50:07.371 --> 50:09.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
new album just for us.

50:09.106 --> 50:19.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You can see that private
performance in its
entirety on our Web site,
PBSNewsHour.org.

50:19.817 --> 50:30.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now to our
"NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught our eye
that might be

50:30.261 --> 50:32.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of interest to you, too.

50:32.096 --> 50:37.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Rain showers and chilly
temperatures did little
to dampen spirits at the annual
lighting of

50:37.134 --> 50:39.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree
this evening.

50:39.603 --> 50:45.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This year's tree is an 80-foot
Engelmann spruce
from McCall, Idaho.

50:45.442 --> 50:50.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joan Cartan-Hansen of Idaho
Public Television
has been following the man
tasked with finding

50:50.481 --> 50:52.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that tree, and she sent us this
profile.

50:52.850 --> 50:57.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOAN CARTAN-HANSEN: Chris
Niccoli's day job
is fighting wildfires out of the
smokejumpers

50:57.254 --> 50:58.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
base in McCall, Idaho.

50:58.789 --> 51:01.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But for the last several months,
he's had
a new assignment.

51:01.692 --> 51:07.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS NICCOLI, U.S. Forest
Service: I'm also
the logistic section for the
U.S. Capitol

51:08.032 --> 51:09.667 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Christmas Tree.

51:09.700 --> 51:12.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOAN CARTAN-HANSEN: That means
Niccoli is
the man responsible for finding,
cutting,

51:12.503 --> 51:16.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and supervising the shipping and
delivery
of the U.S. Capitol's Christmas
tree.

51:16.507 --> 51:21.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since 1970, the U.S. Forest
Service has provided
the Christmas tree that stands
on the Capitol

51:21.378 --> 51:22.613 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
grounds.

51:22.646 --> 51:25.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This year's tree comes from
Idaho's Payette
National Forest.

51:25.916 --> 51:30.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Niccoli started seriously
looking for the
tree last spring.

51:30.354 --> 51:34.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When he would find a contender,
he'd mark
the GPS location and take a
picture.

51:34.391 --> 51:38.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS NICCOLI: We're looking for
a Doug fir
or an Engelmann spruce-type
species.

51:38.362 --> 51:42.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You know, those are the
quintessential Christmas
trees look.

51:43.000 --> 51:46.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOAN CARTAN-HANSEN: Niccoli
narrowed down
the choices to about a dozen
trees.

51:46.437 --> 51:51.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, last July, Ted Bechtol,
the superintendent
of the U.S. Capitol grounds,
came to Idaho

51:51.442 --> 52:00.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to make the final selection.

52:00.617 --> 52:05.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Deciding on the U.S. Capitol
Christmas Tree
is a lot like picking your
family tree, just

52:05.055 --> 52:06.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on a much bigger scale.

52:06.824 --> 52:10.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TED BECHTOL, Superintendent,
U.S. Capitol
Grounds: Sixty to 85 feet in
height, a nice

52:10.294 --> 52:13.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conical shape, because the tree
is viewed
from 360 degrees.

52:13.664 --> 52:16.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have think we have seen
better, yes.

52:16.100 --> 52:17.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHRIS NICCOLI: Yes.

52:17.201 --> 52:18.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have better ones.

52:18.302 --> 52:21.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TED BECHTOL: A nice looking
tree.

52:21.472 --> 52:23.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRIS NICCOLI: It's a good
looking tree.

52:23.340 --> 52:26.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOAN CARTAN-HANSEN: Just as
important as finding
the right tree is finding it in
the right

52:26.343 --> 52:28.078 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
location.

52:28.112 --> 52:32.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Access is important, because
crews will have
to take this 11,000-pound tree
and put it

52:32.616 --> 52:35.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
onto a 105-foot-long trailer.

52:35.486 --> 52:41.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They found the right combination
on the edge
of Little Ski Hill just west of
McCall.

52:41.258 --> 52:46.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On November 4, hundreds gathered
to watch
Niccoli and a fellow smokejumper
cut the prized

52:46.430 --> 52:48.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Engelmann spruce.

52:48.665 --> 52:52.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHRIS NICCOLI: One inch.

52:52.436 --> 52:53.404 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
One.

52:53.437 --> 52:54.405 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
One inch.

52:54.438 --> 52:55.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There you have it.

52:55.472 --> 52:57.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's just barely hanging on.

52:57.074 --> 53:02.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOAN CARTAN-HANSEN: With a few
more cuts from
an axe, and a little pressure...

53:02.513 --> 53:11.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRIS NICCOLI: Here it comes,
Bill.

53:11.321 --> 53:13.057 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And she's free.

53:13.090 --> 53:17.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOAN CARTAN-HANSEN: The tree,
all tied up
on the back of the
tractor-trailer, toured

53:17.161 --> 53:22.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Idaho for several days, and then
headed across
the country to its final home at
the U.S.

53:22.099 --> 53:23.467 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Capitol.

53:23.500 --> 53:27.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS NICCOLI: It's once in a
lifetime for
anybody involved, right?

53:27.071 --> 53:31.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for me especially, I just
feel really
grateful.

53:31.141 --> 53:32.109 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's great, yes.

53:32.142 --> 53:33.777 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's really fun.

53:33.811 --> 53:37.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOAN CARTAN-HANSEN: For the "PBS
NewsHour,"
I'm Joan Cartan-Hansen in Boise,
Idaho.

53:37.448 --> 53:39.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thanks to those
folks.

53:39.316 --> 53:41.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't think about all the
work that goes
into finding this tree.

53:41.885 --> 53:43.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: I had
absolutely no idea.

53:43.587 --> 53:48.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And separate from
that, on
