JUDY WOODRUFF: With Congress
back from their Independence
Day break, the pressure is on

00:04.833 --> 00:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for Republicans to broker a
deal on health care, in addition
to other high priorities

00:09.600 --> 00:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like tax reform, all of
this as the August recess
looms just weeks away.

00:16.500 --> 00:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a minute, John Yang will be
back to talk to Lisa Desjardins,
but, first, Lisa has the

00:20.900 --> 00:22.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
current state of
play on Capitol Hill.

00:22.933 --> 00:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: With the
health care fight unresolved
and no action on the budget or

00:29.566 --> 00:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tax reform, Utah Senator Mike
Lee and nine fellow Republicans
asked today to cancel the

00:33.666 --> 00:34.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
August recess.

00:34.666 --> 00:36.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE LEE (R), Utah: At this
time, it doesn't make sense for
us to just take the month of

00:38.933 --> 00:40.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
August off.

00:40.900 --> 00:42.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Majority
Leader Mitch McConnell
partially obliged.

00:42.366 --> 00:44.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:44.433 --> 00:45.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader: We will be in
session the first two weeks of

00:45.966 --> 00:48.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
August.

00:48.433 --> 00:51.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That
buys a little more time
to tackle a daunting
agenda, topped by replacing

00:51.866 --> 00:52.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Obamacare.

00:52.866 --> 00:54.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:54.400 --> 00:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL: We will be
on health care next week.

00:56.400 --> 00:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will be laying out a revised
version of the repeal and
replace effort, the text of

01:05.066 --> 01:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that, on Thursday morning.

01:07.566 --> 01:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Multiple
Republican senators
told "NewsHour" this
is what's in the latest

01:11.533 --> 01:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plan: It restores an
investment tax and a
Medicare tax on the wealthy.

01:15.933 --> 01:19.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Plans to cut those taxes drew
criticism as helping the rich.

01:19.366 --> 01:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More subsidies or tax
credits for lower-income
families and billions
more for opioid treatment.

01:26.266 --> 01:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But indications are there
will be essentially no changes
to the Medicaid section.

01:31.600 --> 01:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That would cut the number of
people on Medicaid by millions.

01:34.133 --> 01:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one unusual twist:
Republicans are still mulling an
amendment from Texas Senator Ted

01:41.100 --> 01:44.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Cruz that will allow
insurers to offer just
one Obamacare-compliant
plan and avoid its

01:45.333 --> 01:47.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
regulations in the rest.

01:47.333 --> 01:51.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That general idea could
bring on Cruz and other
key votes like Lee.

01:51.100 --> 01:52.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:52.633 --> 01:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE LEE: That's one way to
get me to yes on the bill.

01:54.733 --> 01:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But Democrats,
like Senator Jeanne Shaheen,
voiced a concern some Republican

01:58.533 --> 01:59.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
moderates share.

01:59.533 --> 02:02.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:02.100 --> 02:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEANNE SHAHEEN (D), New
Hampshire: Our Republican
colleagues haven't
had just six months to

02:03.100 --> 02:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
put together a health care bill.

02:04.533 --> 02:07.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have had seven
years and six months.

02:07.533 --> 02:10.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the Cruz amendment
is not the answer.

02:10.233 --> 02:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would roll back
protections for people with
preexisting conditions.

02:13.833 --> 02:16.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It would cost more
for consumers.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: All said, it
is not yet clear if a revised
plan will get the 50 votes it

02:20.966 --> 02:23.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
needs.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
McConnell wants to hold
that vote next week,
and many Republicans
say it's time, win or

02:27.566 --> 02:28.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lose.

02:28.333 --> 02:29.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:29.866 --> 02:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN KENNEDY (R), Louisiana: In
my judgment, it's time to vote.

02:31.700 --> 02:33.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: These
are unusual times.

02:33.766 --> 02:37.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Senate Historian's Office
tells me that only once in
modern history has the Senate

02:37.966 --> 02:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cut short its August recess.

02:39.900 --> 02:41.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John, guess what the topic was?

02:41.566 --> 02:43.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It was 1994.

02:43.500 --> 02:44.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was health care.

02:44.733 --> 02:46.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Democrats failed to pass
their bill back then.

02:46.533 --> 02:48.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG:
Hillarycare back then.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

02:50.033 --> 02:52.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Lisa, you said
that the Cruz amendment
is going to be key.

02:52.933 --> 02:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Senator McConnell also
said that Thursday, they
are going to see a text.

02:56.266 --> 02:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How are going to they
handle the Cruz amendment?

02:57.400 --> 02:59.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes.

02:59.533 --> 03:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a bit of a tricky --
it's actually - - think of it
as two different bills, a bill

03:02.133 --> 03:04.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A and a bill B. It
will be the same text.

03:04.166 --> 03:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Only, one will have the Cruz
amendment, one will not.

03:06.466 --> 03:10.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The big moment to decide which
goes forward will be Monday,
probably, when we expect the

03:10.566 --> 03:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congressional Budget Office
to come out with its score to
say, does the Cruz amendment

03:14.533 --> 03:18.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
help these markets, what does
it do for premiums, what does it
do for preexisting conditions?

03:18.766 --> 03:20.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That will be the
big decision moment.

03:20.800 --> 03:23.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And in your spot,
you said that they still don't
have the 50 votes for what

03:23.966 --> 03:26.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is probably going to
come out Thursday.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are they going to continue
to tweak it to try to
get the votes they need?

03:29.333 --> 03:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Or how is that going to work?

03:30.966 --> 03:32.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think
that's why we didn't
see text today, John.

03:32.900 --> 03:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why saw sort of a
framework and Vice President
Pence up there trying to massage

03:35.700 --> 03:37.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people into this.

03:37.733 --> 03:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, honestly, coming out of
the meeting, some people were
more warm to it, like Bob

03:40.100 --> 03:42.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Corker today.

03:42.633 --> 03:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Others, like Lisa
Murkowski, came out, was
there, was there progress
made on things important

03:45.500 --> 03:46.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to you?

03:46.666 --> 03:48.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She turned to reporters
and just said no.

03:48.400 --> 03:51.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: So, there's
still some work to go
for someone like that.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have got two
extra weeks now.

03:53.366 --> 03:55.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What else are they going to do?

03:55.466 --> 03:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are there other things they
have got to get done before
they get their reward by going

03:58.733 --> 03:59.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
home for recess?

03:59.733 --> 04:01.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

04:01.000 --> 04:02.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Well,
here's the thing.

04:02.966 --> 04:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they take the vote on health
care next week, there are
many who think it could fail

04:04.900 --> 04:06.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and that Mitch McConnell
will let it fail.

04:06.833 --> 04:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At that point, then, they would
have another decision to make.

04:09.600 --> 04:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do we try again, a different
kind of Republican bill, or do
we in fact work with Democrats,

04:14.300 --> 04:17.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
come up with an entire 'nother
approach to health care to try
to fix the Obamacare markets?

04:17.766 --> 04:21.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Do we try and pass
that before we leave in
the middle of August?

04:21.100 --> 04:23.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then they also have a budget
to deal with, spending bills.

04:23.966 --> 04:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Conservatives want to actually
do a proper spending process
and debate spending cuts,

04:27.733 --> 04:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rather than just have one
big bill dropped on at once.

04:30.300 --> 04:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is a lot of work to do.

04:32.700 --> 04:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not clear how they will
get the votes to do it, though,
but now they do have more

04:35.533 --> 04:37.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

04:37.500 --> 04:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Lisa Desjardins,
a lot of work for them,
a lot of work for you.

04:38.933 --> 04:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Thank you.
