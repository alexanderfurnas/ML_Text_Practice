GWEN IFILL: Good
evening. I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:08.475 --> 00:12.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: the immigration divide.
Republican presidential

00:12.379 --> 00:16.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
candidates debate what they
would do, and they don't always
agree.

00:16.950 --> 00:21.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Wednesday: another hit for the
companies behind fantasy

00:21.488 --> 00:26.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sports. New York state bans
what it calls illegal gambling.

00:26.393 --> 00:30.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And we travel to the
country of Georgia to stand at
the crossroads of human

00:30.163 --> 00:32.199 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
history.

00:32.199 --> 00:34.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK, Fellow, National
Geographic: I think we're
standing on one of the oldest

00:34.902 --> 00:38.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
boneyards in the world. Dmanisi,
in particular, is 1.8 million
years old.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:41.575 --> 00:47.414 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:47.414 --> 01:00.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It began as
Armistice Day, marking the end
of World War I. Now it's
commemorated

01:00.727 --> 01:04.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as Veterans Day, honoring all
those who have worn the uniform
of the United States, living

01:04.698 --> 01:07.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and dead.

01:07.200 --> 01:15.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the annual observances
were mixed in with new pledges
of reform. It was a day for

01:15.809 --> 01:20.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
keeping with traditions,
including the president laying a
wreath at the Tomb of the
Unknowns

01:20.280 --> 01:27.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in Arlington National Cemetery.

01:27.487 --> 01:36.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Afterward, Mr. Obama used the
occasion to call for more
progress on speeding up medical

01:36.463 --> 01:41.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
services and disability
claims for military veterans.

01:41.101 --> 01:45.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: If tomorrow,
after the parades and the
ceremonies,

01:45.539 --> 01:51.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we roll up the banners and sweep
the veterans halls and go back
to our daily lives forgetting

01:51.411 --> 01:57.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the bond between the service of
our veterans and our obligations
as citizens, then we will

01:57.651 --> 02:02.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be doing a profound disservice
to our veterans and to the very
cause for which they serve.

02:02.422 --> 02:08.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At the World War
II Memorial on the National
Mall, former Republican Senator

02:08.362 --> 02:13.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Army veteran Bob Dole paid
his own tribute to those who've
served.

02:13.767 --> 02:21.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BOB DOLE, Former U.S. Senator:
It's a day to remember all the
sacrifices made in American

02:21.008 --> 02:27.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
history by people who stood
up for their country.

02:27.514 --> 02:34.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And across the
Atlantic, Britain observed
Remembrance Day with moments of
silence

02:34.454 --> 02:43.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and other somber ceremonies,
while other European nations
marked it as Armistice Day,
honoring

02:43.797 --> 02:48.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the millions who lost their
lives during the First World
War.

02:48.402 --> 02:53.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Elsewhere, NATO troops in
Afghanistan held observances to
pay tribute to their fallen

02:53.273 --> 02:55.442 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
comrades.

02:55.442 --> 02:58.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PADRE COLIN MACLEOD, Chaplain:
So many have lost their lives.
And it would be unforgivable

02:58.845 --> 03:01.782 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of us to forget.

03:01.782 --> 03:07.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That sentiment
also resonated at Australia's
rain-soaked remembrance ceremony

03:07.654 --> 03:12.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Canberra with Britain's
Prince Charles and his wife in
attendance.

03:12.826 --> 03:18.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In Myanmar today,
the military-backed government
promised a peaceful transition,

03:18.131 --> 03:23.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the democratic opposition
headed toward a sweeping
election victory. The party led

03:23.770 --> 03:29.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by Aung San Suu Kyi has won the
overwhelming majority of
Parliament races decided since

03:29.476 --> 03:33.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sunday's vote. Her party won a
similar triumph in 1990, but the
military refused to give

03:33.947 --> 03:35.749 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

03:35.749 --> 03:41.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At least 10,000
people marched in Afghanistan's
capital today, protesting

03:41.388 --> 03:46.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the beheading of seven Shiite
Hazaras. Their bodies were found
in Zabul province on Saturday.

03:46.693 --> 03:49.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
One of the victims was a child.

03:49.863 --> 03:55.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, angry demonstrators
carried the coffins through
Kabul, and some tried to force
their

03:55.268 --> 04:00.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way into the presidential
palace. Police opened fire,
wounding at least 10 people.

04:00.407 --> 04:03.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And President Ashraf
Ghani called for calm.

04:03.577 --> 04:07.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ASHRAF GHANI, President of
Afghanistan (through
translator): We are committed to
taking revenge

04:07.280 --> 04:12.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for our countrymen's blood. In
this way, we will not spare any
effort. But you have to

04:12.085 --> 04:15.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remember that anything can
happen if we don't control our
feelings. We should avoid
reactions

04:15.222 --> 04:17.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that could result in anarchy.

04:17.991 --> 04:23.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Protesters
demanded that President Ghani
step down if he can't ensure
security.

04:23.430 --> 04:29.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The European Union
pressed African leaders today to
help curb the flow of migrants.

04:29.669 --> 04:33.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The two sides met on Malta,
where the Europeans offered
incentives, as we hear from
Jonathan

04:33.907 --> 04:37.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Rugman of Independent
Television News.

04:37.477 --> 04:43.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONATHAN RUGMAN: Emerging from a
building which once housed
medieval knights tasked

04:43.517 --> 04:50.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with protecting the holy land, a
new champions league, the E.U.'s
leaders still finding their

04:50.390 --> 04:54.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way in the dark, though, facing
an unprecedented wave of
migration and trying to square
the

04:54.828 --> 04:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
circle of helping the desperate
and protecting themselves.

04:59.900 --> 05:05.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their focus tonight is not
Syria, but Africa, with 1.8
billion euros now at the ready
to

05:05.572 --> 05:09.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
buy the cooperation of African
leaders, some of it to make sure
migrants turned down for

05:09.609 --> 05:14.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
asylum really do go home.

05:14.014 --> 05:19.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Africans account for 14 percent
of this year's arrival. But it's
much further east off Turkey

05:19.753 --> 05:25.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the packed boats are still
coming, 6,000 people reaching
Greece every day. It's thought

05:25.859 --> 05:31.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a trafficker dived off this
dinghy this morning, no doubt
hoping to cash in on the next.

05:31.598 --> 05:37.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in Malta, you need a ladder
to reach the uppermost files of
asylum seekers. And

05:37.337 --> 05:42.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the more new arrivals, the more
the tide is beginning to turn,
many in Germany are ruing

05:42.442 --> 05:48.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the day Angela Merkel flung her
country's door wide open, the
Greeks not prepared to

05:48.415 --> 05:55.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take back those who arrived
there first, and African leaders
demanding more visas so Africans

05:55.689 --> 06:01.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can visit Europe legally, rather
than risking their lives to get
here instead.

06:01.928 --> 06:08.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, a Missouri man is in
jail, suspected of posting
online

06:08.001 --> 06:13.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
threats against blacks at the
University of Missouri at
Columbia; 19-year-old Hunter
Park

06:13.607 --> 06:17.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was arrested at a separate
campus. He had allegedly said he
planned to open fire today

06:17.510 --> 06:20.880 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Columbia.

06:20.880 --> 06:26.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier this week, protests over
racial tensions led the
university system's president to
resign.

06:26.820 --> 06:30.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police are still investigating
other threats and have stepped
up patrols.

06:30.890 --> 06:37.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A Texas grand jury
has indicted 106 bikers arrested
in last may's deadly gang

06:37.764 --> 06:44.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shoot-out in Waco. Nine people
died in the confrontation
between rival motorcycle clubs.

06:44.137 --> 06:48.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those indicted face charges of
organized criminal gang
activity. The grand jury is
still considering

06:48.675 --> 06:52.612 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
charges against
another 71 bikers.

06:52.612 --> 06:57.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And on Wall
Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average lost 56 points to

06:57.817 --> 07:05.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
close back near 17700. The
Nasdaq fell 16 points, and the
S&amp;P 500 dropped six.

07:05.925 --> 07:11.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the debate heats up over illegal
immigration; New York

07:11.264 --> 07:17.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cracks down on fantasy sports;
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's on
Sherlock Holmes' older brother,
and much

07:17.203 --> 07:22.976 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

07:22.976 --> 07:35.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Republicans eager to
either hold on to or steal the
spotlight took to the stage

07:35.889 --> 07:42.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Milwaukee last night, as the
debate shifted from personality
to policy.

07:42.429 --> 07:45.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The candidates used their fourth
face-off to better define their
differences.

07:45.932 --> 07:52.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The topics ranged from
the economy and taxes.

07:52.839 --> 07:56.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY),
Presidential Candidate: I want a
government really, really small,

07:56.576 --> 07:59.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so small you can barely see it.

07:59.846 --> 08:03.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: You wouldn't favor
breaking up the big banks? You
think they're big enough,
they're

08:03.883 --> 08:07.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
OK as they are, as
big as they are?

08:07.854 --> 08:10.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN CARSON (R), Presidential
Candidate: I would have policies
that wouldn't allow that

08:10.023 --> 08:10.957 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to occur.

08:10.957 --> 08:13.660 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: To
international affairs.

08:13.660 --> 08:19.599 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate: I know
that Rand is a committed
isolationist.

08:19.599 --> 08:28.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not. I believe the world is
a stronger and a better place
when the United States

08:28.074 --> 08:34.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is the strongest military
power in the world.

08:34.147 --> 08:42.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. RAND PAUL: Yeah, but,
Marco, Marco, how is it
conservative, how is it
conservative

08:42.021 --> 08:44.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to add a trillion-dollar
expenditure for the federal
government that you're not
paying

08:44.424 --> 08:46.159 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for?

08:46.159 --> 08:49.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: We have to get smart.
We can't continue to

08:49.662 --> 08:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be the policeman of the world.

08:52.866 --> 08:57.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEB BUSH (R), Presidential
Candidate: Donald's wrong on
this. He is absolutely wrong on
this.

08:57.070 --> 09:01.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're not going to be the
world's policeman, but we sure
as heck better be the world's

09:01.307 --> 09:03.042 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
leader.

09:03.042 --> 09:07.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And they targeted
the Democrat they clearly expect
to face next year.

09:07.847 --> 09:11.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARLY FIORINA (R), Presidential
Candidate: We must beat Hillary
Clinton. Carly Fiorina

09:11.351 --> 09:14.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can beat Hillary Clinton. I
will beat Hillary Clinton.

09:14.788 --> 09:18.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But the biggest
chasm of policy difference was
immigration. Trump once again

09:18.892 --> 09:22.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
argued for building a wall
between the U.S. and Mexico, and
deporting 11 million immigrants

09:22.395 --> 09:24.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the country illegally.

09:24.731 --> 09:28.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Dwight Eisenhower,
good president, great president,
moved a 1.5 million illegal

09:28.301 --> 09:33.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immigrants out of this country,
moved them just beyond the
border. They came back. Moved

09:33.840 --> 09:38.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them way south. They never came
back. They moved a 1.5 million
people out. We have no

09:38.445 --> 09:39.412 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
choice.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: But others
on stage objected.

09:42.282 --> 09:46.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate: But for
the 11 million people, come on,
folks.

09:46.686 --> 09:51.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We all know you can't pick them
up and ship them across, back
across the border. It's

09:51.925 --> 09:55.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a silly argument. It is
not an adult argument.

09:55.728 --> 09:59.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEB BUSH: It's not embracing
American values. And it would
tear communities apart. And it

09:59.032 --> 10:01.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would send a signal that we're
not the kind of country that I
know America is.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

10:04.037 --> 10:07.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Bush and Kasich
didn't say what they would do
instead, but Ted Cruz said
anything

10:07.941 --> 10:10.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
short of deportation
would hurt the country.

10:10.844 --> 10:14.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate: If
Republicans join Democrats as
the party

10:14.747 --> 10:17.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of amnesty, we will lose. I
understand that when the
mainstream media covers
immigration,

10:17.951 --> 10:21.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it doesn't often see it as an
economic issue. But I can tell
you, for millions of Americans

10:21.421 --> 10:24.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at home watching this, it is a
very personal economic issue.

10:24.257 --> 10:27.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Rubio stayed out of
last night's fray, but weighed
in this morning on the Obama

10:27.193 --> 10:30.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration plan known as
DACA that would delay
deportation proceedings for
undocumented

10:30.163 --> 10:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
immigrants whose children
were born in the U.S.

10:33.566 --> 10:39.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCO RUBIO: I do not support
DACA. It's unconstitutional;
it's the wrong way to do this,
and, quite

10:39.138 --> 10:41.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
frankly, we need to begin to
enforce our immigration laws in
this country or we don't have
immigration

10:41.307 --> 10:43.142 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
laws.

10:43.142 --> 10:46.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Economics and the
politics of immigration are
expected to remain front and

10:46.379 --> 10:48.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
center throughout
the campaign year.

10:48.081 --> 10:51.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For more on the growing
immigration policy divide, I'm
joined by Marielena Hincapie,

10:51.651 --> 10:54.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
executive director of the
National Immigration Law Center
Immigrant Justice Fund, and Josh

10:54.587 --> 10:57.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Blackman, an associate professor
at the South Texas College of
Law.

10:57.991 --> 11:01.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Marielena Hincapie, let me ask
-- start by asking you what
leaped out at you in watching

11:01.895 --> 11:05.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that debate, especially the
part, the immigration debate
last night?

11:05.765 --> 11:08.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIELENA HINCAPIE, Executive
Director, National Immigration
Law Center: Thank you, Gwen.

11:08.301 --> 11:13.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I, frankly, was initially
shocked at what I was starting
to hear from Trump, and then

11:13.039 --> 11:18.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deeply, deeply troubled. It was
surreal. I think many viewers
may not realize that when

11:18.411 --> 11:23.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump was invoking
President Eisenhower's
immigration plan that resulted
in the deportation

11:23.883 --> 11:26.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of over a million individuals,
he was actually referring to
Operation Wetback.

11:26.052 --> 11:30.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Operation Wetback is one of the
darkest and most shameful
periods of our immigration
history

11:30.123 --> 11:31.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in this country, where
immigrants from Mexico,
including U.S. citizens of
Mexican descent,

11:31.891 --> 11:34.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were deported. That is basically
-- historians think of it as
ethnic cleansing. That is
shocking

11:34.227 --> 11:37.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that in 2015 one of our
presidential candidates is
espousing that as his model for
immigration.

11:37.764 --> 11:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Josh Blackman, as
you watched and listened to what
they were saying, what

11:40.033 --> 11:43.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
leaped out at you?

11:43.136 --> 11:46.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH BLACKMAN, Constitutional
Law Professor, South Texas
College of Law: So, I think
Marielena

11:46.940 --> 11:49.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is correct. It's physically
impossible to remove 11 million
immigrants.

11:49.943 --> 11:53.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But I think the correct
framework is that some sort of
reform has to be passed and that

11:53.212 --> 11:53.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this cannot be accomplished
through executive action, which
is what President Obama has

11:53.279 --> 11:54.881 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
done.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, what is it that
you heard last night that
sounded like a reasonable

11:56.316 --> 11:58.217 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
approach?

11:58.217 --> 12:01.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH BLACKMAN: So, I think
Senator Rubio advanced a
proposal where immigrants who
have been

12:01.788 --> 12:06.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here for a while who have
families and have not gotten in
trouble, had they stayed 10

12:06.125 --> 12:09.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years, there will be a pathway
for some sort of way for them to
remain. And he also suggested

12:09.762 --> 12:11.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that certain felons would be
able to be moved primarily.

12:11.998 --> 12:12.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Marielena Hincapie,
this week, the Fifth Circuit
Court of Appeals moved to

12:12.899 --> 12:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
delay, to block President
Obama's plan to delay
deportation for some people who
are

12:12.966 --> 12:11.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not here legally. Does this --
how does this change the
landscape of the immigration
debate

12:11.431 --> 12:12.999 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or does it?

12:12.999 --> 12:12.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIELENA HINCAPIE: Well, right
now, the decision was a
devastating decision,
particularly for

12:12.932 --> 12:12.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the five million U.S. citizen
children whose parents would
have benefited from DACA.

12:12.999 --> 12:13.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was an expected decision,
so it doesn't quite change
things too much, in the sense

12:13.032 --> 12:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we remain in legal status
quo, legal limbo for these
families. On the other hand,

12:12.966 --> 12:12.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because the Supreme Court is
likely to take this case -- and
we're very glad that the

12:12.999 --> 12:13.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama administration immediately
said that they would be
appealing -- this is a case

12:13.232 --> 12:13.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of national significance which
is likely to be decided just
months before the 2016 election.

12:13.232 --> 12:12.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think the issue will
continue to be front and center
and probably increase in terms

12:12.699 --> 12:13.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the debates, particularly
in the general election.

12:13.199 --> 12:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Josh Blackman, does
this help or hurt your election
year argument?

12:13.466 --> 12:12.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSH BLACKMAN: So, I think the
question is not whether the
Supreme Court will hear it,

12:12.565 --> 12:12.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but when the Supreme
Court will hear it.

12:12.198 --> 12:12.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, Marielena is correct.

12:12.565 --> 12:12.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's definitely
going to happen?

12:12.699 --> 12:13.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOSH BLACKMAN: Oh, it's
definitely going to happen.

12:13.299 --> 12:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it will either happen in May
of 2016 or November of 2016. And
the variable is when

12:13.433 --> 12:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the court is able to grant
certiorari, when it's able to
grant review. And this is based

12:13.700 --> 12:13.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
first on when the U.S.
government files their appeal
and second when Texas files
their response.

12:13.466 --> 12:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the process too late, it's
very possible that this process
will be stretched and kicked

12:13.333 --> 12:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
until next year, so it would not
even be argued until there's a
new president in office.

12:13.466 --> 12:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: There were as many
approaches to the immigration
debate on stage last night

12:12.966 --> 12:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as there were candidates.

12:14.100 --> 12:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to run through a few of
them with you, Marielena
Hincapie, starting with you.

12:14.100 --> 12:13.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeb Bush talked about fines and
talking as a way of making sure
that people stay -- obey

12:13.299 --> 12:14.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the law. How applicable
can that be?

12:14.200 --> 12:14.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIELENA HINCAPIE: Yes, paying
a penalty has actually been one
of the central factors

12:14.067 --> 12:14.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of all of the immigration reform
proposals, legislative proposals
in the past.

12:14.267 --> 12:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think Jeb Bush is right that
that is often -- and immigrants
are ready and willing to

12:14.233 --> 12:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pay a fine to be able to stay in
the U.S. to obtain lawful status
and work lawfully

12:14.300 --> 12:14.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and not have that fear of
deportations and contribute even
more to our country.

12:14.367 --> 12:14.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Josh Blackman, we
have heard much discussion about
the path to citizenship,

12:14.634 --> 12:14.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but a lot less discussion than
we used to. People like Jeb Bush
and Marco Rubio, who

12:14.801 --> 12:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
used to say -- and even John
Kasich, I think, last night
suggested it -- but it's being

12:13.866 --> 12:14.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
talked about a lot
less. Why is that?

12:14.834 --> 12:14.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSH BLACKMAN: I think one of
the factors we have to consider
is the role that President

12:14.901 --> 12:14.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Barack Obama's presidential
executive actions played in
chilling congressional reform.

12:14.801 --> 12:15.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Speaker Paul Ryan had a piece in
"USA Today" last week
effectively arguing that because

12:15.101 --> 12:15.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president acts unilaterally,
it's harder to trust the
president. I think, in many
respects,

12:15.034 --> 12:17.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this unilateral action has made
it more difficult to actually
have some sort of comprehensive

12:17.737 --> 12:19.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
immigration reform.

12:19.806 --> 12:21.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You're saying it's
the unilateral action, not the
actual substance of the policy

12:21.407 --> 12:23.009 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
itself?

12:23.009 --> 12:26.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSH BLACKMAN: Well, I think any
discussion of whether you're
actually rewarded people

12:26.980 --> 12:29.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
perhaps who enter the country
illegally must be premised on
what President Obama has done

12:29.015 --> 12:31.718 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
previously.

12:31.718 --> 12:35.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If in fact the president is
trying to abrogate and bypass
Congress, it makes it less
likely

12:35.855 --> 12:38.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that Congress will want to
work with him to move forward.

12:38.725 --> 12:43.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Marielena Hincapie,
some people -- Ben Carson is one
of the people who have

12:43.029 --> 12:46.599 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
suggested that perhaps a
guest-worker program might be an
approach. Is that something that

12:46.599 --> 12:50.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you can see happening
that is middle ground?

12:50.203 --> 12:53.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIELENA HINCAPIE: Absolutely
not, not a guest-worker program
by itself.

12:53.406 --> 12:57.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think particularly for Ben
Carson and the Republican
candidates who yesterday talked

12:57.977 --> 13:03.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about not being in support of
the minimum wage, when we --
when they are thinking of

13:03.282 --> 13:08.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
adding guest workers as the
solution to immigration, that
simply is going to depress wages
and

13:08.388 --> 13:11.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
working conditions even
more for U.S. workers.

13:11.257 --> 13:16.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need to ensure that the 11
million people who are here who
are already working have

13:16.062 --> 13:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a path to citizenship and that
we separately look at what are
the forms, legal channels

13:20.166 --> 13:23.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for people to come
in the future.

13:23.302 --> 13:27.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For current guest-worker
programs, they are extremely
full of exploitation, mainly
because

13:27.740 --> 13:32.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
workers are tied to an employer
who can exploit them and unless
those individual workers,

13:32.879 --> 13:38.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those temporary workers have the
same rights as U.S. workers, are
able to leave that work

13:38.284 --> 13:43.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and take their visa, have a
portable visa, that guest-worker
programs are just not the

13:43.089 --> 13:46.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
answer and not the solution. And
it's definitely not the solution
for the 11 million who are

13:46.159 --> 13:49.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here and who are working and who
have deep ties to our
communities.

13:49.762 --> 13:52.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Josh Blackman, what
about the so-called dreamers?
They got their hopes up

13:52.865 --> 13:57.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last year with the idea that
they would be able to stay here
or they could at least apply

13:57.103 --> 14:00.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to stay here. Is that going to
fall apart or is that anything
that any of these Republicans

14:00.573 --> 14:02.408 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are supporting?

14:02.408 --> 14:06.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSH BLACKMAN: So, I think the
senators are opposed -- sorry --
the candidates are opposed

14:06.245 --> 14:07.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to DACA. That's Deferred
Action for Childhood Arrivals.

14:07.613 --> 14:09.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Right.

14:09.215 --> 14:12.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSH BLACKMAN: Congress defeated
the DREAM Act and the president
went ahead and enacted

14:12.885 --> 14:16.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not the exact same thing, but
significant portions of it,
through executive action.

14:16.622 --> 14:20.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think in many respects,
that, too, that has chilled the
decision of whether Congress

14:20.293 --> 14:23.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can act. And one point I make --
I would like to make on the
timing of the Supreme Court

14:23.996 --> 14:29.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
appeal, the Obama administration
had a chance to appeal to the
Supreme Court in May of 2016.

14:29.001 --> 14:31.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their failure to do it basically
ensured that this couldn't be
decided until the earliest

14:31.304 --> 14:33.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the summer before
the election.

14:33.606 --> 14:37.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So whether it is in fact a
priority for the Obama
administration to appeal is not
clear.

14:37.877 --> 14:41.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They may be content to let this
sit as a political issue and
have Senator Clinton perhaps and

14:41.981 --> 14:43.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Republican candidate duke
this out. There may be political
elements here in delaying

14:43.750 --> 14:44.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the appeal itself.

14:44.951 --> 14:46.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Briefly, where
is public opinion on this?

14:46.486 --> 14:47.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSH BLACKMAN: On?

14:47.353 --> 14:50.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On this whole issue?

14:50.056 --> 14:53.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSH BLACKMAN: Well, I think for
the most part, people are
looking to have a comprehensive

14:53.626 --> 14:56.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reform through Congress and not
through unilateral executive
action.

14:56.395 --> 15:00.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, Marielena, one
final thought on public opinion.

15:00.299 --> 15:04.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIELENA HINCAPIE: Yes, as
Joshua said, there is a lot of
support. A majority of Americans

15:04.370 --> 15:08.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
support both comprehensive
immigration reform through
Congress, but recent polling
actually

15:08.407 --> 15:12.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shows that the majority of
Americans also support the
president's actions.

15:12.145 --> 15:17.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They don't believe that
undocumented immigrants who are
here, who are contributing to
our

15:17.083 --> 15:21.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
economy, who have children, who
have deep ties to our country
should be deported either.

15:21.087 --> 15:25.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there is support for the
president's action, as well as
Congress. We -- ultimately, we

15:25.124 --> 15:28.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need Congress to act so that a
future president can sign that
law into -- sign an immigration

15:28.861 --> 15:31.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
reform bill into law.

15:31.397 --> 15:35.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Marielena Hincapie
of the National Immigration Law
Center and Josh Blackman of

15:35.902 --> 15:37.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the South Texas College of
law, thank you both very much.

15:37.703 --> 15:38.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOSH BLACKMAN: Thank
you very much.

15:38.771 --> 15:47.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARIELENA HINCAPIE: Thank
you. Thank you, Gwen.

15:47.713 --> 15:56.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Playing daily
fantasy sports has become a
multibillion-dollar business,

15:56.422 --> 16:01.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and one increasingly connected
with professional sports leagues
who either have a sponsorship

16:01.761 --> 16:06.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deal with the biggest companies
or are investors in these
companies. But it's an industry
under

16:06.032 --> 16:09.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
widening scrutiny.

16:09.035 --> 16:13.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The latest front: New York
state's attorney general has
said they shouldn't be allowed

16:13.072 --> 16:17.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to operate in New York since
they constitute illegal
gambling.

16:17.109 --> 16:19.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
William Brangham fills
in the picture.

16:19.645 --> 16:23.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The two main
companies at the center of this
latest controversy, DraftKings

16:23.716 --> 16:27.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and FanDuel, have tens of
millions of players on their
sites everyday.

16:27.520 --> 16:31.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here's how they work. This is
from one of their promotional
videos. You pay some money

16:31.724 --> 16:36.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to play fantasy football or
baseball or whatever sport you
want. You then create a lineup
of

16:36.362 --> 16:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actual professional players to
be part of your fantasy team. If
your players do better

16:41.100 --> 16:43.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
statistically on a given day
than the other people in your
league, you win money. Or if

16:43.803 --> 16:46.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they don't, you lose.

16:46.539 --> 16:50.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The sites have said they're just
games of online skill, and not
actual gambling. But,

16:50.943 --> 16:54.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yesterday, New York Attorney
General Eric Schneiderman called
foul, saying -- quote

16:54.380 --> 16:59.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- "It is clear that DraftKings
and FanDuel are the leaders of a
massive, multibillion-dollar

16:59.485 --> 17:04.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
scheme intended to evade the law
and fleece sports fans across
the country."

17:04.924 --> 17:07.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining me now to help unpack
these developments is Devlin
Barrett, who's been covering
this

17:07.026 --> 17:08.828 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for The Wall Street Journal.

17:08.828 --> 17:11.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, how big a deal is this,
the attorney general's move?

17:11.797 --> 17:13.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT, The Wall Street
Journal: It's a really big deal.

17:13.799 --> 17:17.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One, it's 10 percent of their
customer base is based in New
York state. But, actually...

17:17.403 --> 17:20.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Ten percent of
all these players are in New
York itself?

17:20.172 --> 17:24.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT: That's according
to some of the internal figures,
as best as we can tell.

17:24.043 --> 17:31.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The larger problem, though, is
that if what the New York
attorney general says influences

17:31.417 --> 17:36.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or lines up with the thinking of
the federal officials who are
looking at this, these
companies,

17:36.656 --> 17:39.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this industry is in a world of
trouble, because what the
attorney general says in his
letter

17:39.392 --> 17:44.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is that this thing is
illegal in multiple ways.

17:44.597 --> 17:48.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Justice Department is
looking at that. Now, the New
York decision is important for

17:48.467 --> 17:53.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New York, and it's important,
obviously, for the company's
reputations, but if the U.S.

17:53.539 --> 17:57.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attorney for the Southern
District of New York, who's a
federal official, ends up
agreeing

17:57.410 --> 17:59.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with even half of what's in that
letter, these industries are in
huge -- this industry has

17:59.812 --> 18:01.814 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a huge problem.

18:01.814 --> 18:05.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let's talk a
little bit about what the
attorney general is arguing.

18:05.885 --> 18:10.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In one of his complaints against
these companies, he is saying,
you're basically a wolf in
sheep's

18:10.189 --> 18:13.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clothing. You pretend you're not
a gambling site, but you are a
gambling site.

18:13.326 --> 18:16.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In your analysis, is
that a fair accusation?

18:16.662 --> 18:21.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT: Well, I think
the biggest analogy you could
draw is to online poker.

18:21.701 --> 18:26.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you look at the screens
from what online poker used to
be, back when it was allowed

18:26.505 --> 18:30.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and done in the United States on
a regular basis, the screens
actually look quite similar.

18:30.476 --> 18:32.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You mean the
actual Web sites that you look
at?

18:32.278 --> 18:34.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT: Actual Web sites
that you look at, and the lines
of betting options

18:34.914 --> 18:38.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that you have, do I want to make
this bet, do I want to make that
bet?

18:38.351 --> 18:42.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The other thing that the
attorney general lays out which
is an interesting argument

18:42.188 --> 18:47.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and is really the crux of this
debate is, this is instant
gratification gambling, meaning

18:47.893 --> 18:52.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
traditional fantasy sports was
always about you play for a
whole season? At the end of

18:52.898 --> 18:56.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the season, someone wins the
office pool and they have a
party and everyone smiles and

18:56.035 --> 18:59.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
makes jokes about each other.

18:59.171 --> 19:03.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Daily fantasy sports essentially
blows up that model and says you
can bet today on stuff

19:03.909 --> 19:09.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that happens today and you can
get paid today. A lot of what
the New York officials are
saying

19:09.348 --> 19:15.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, look, this is instant
gratification, which is
gambling, and that's a problem.
That's

19:15.488 --> 19:18.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why in some ways it's a huge
threat to the companies far
beyond the borders of New York

19:18.791 --> 19:20.760 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
state.

19:20.760 --> 19:24.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: These
companies have vehemently
rejected these accusations. They
said in a

19:24.764 --> 19:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
call today that they made with
reporters that they are going to
going to fight this in court.

19:27.633 --> 19:30.436 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
They have hired
lawyers to do this.

19:30.436 --> 19:35.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, in a statement,
FanDuel said -- quote --
"Fantasy sports is a game of
skill and

19:35.441 --> 19:39.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
legal under New York state law.
This is a politician telling
hundreds of thousands of

19:39.745 --> 19:42.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New Yorkers that they are not
allowed to play a game that they
love and share with friends,

19:42.848 --> 19:46.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
family, co-workers and
players across the country."

19:46.352 --> 19:49.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You hear this a lot from these
companies, that these are games
of skill and not chance.

19:49.321 --> 19:50.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DEVLIN BARRETT: Right.

19:50.489 --> 19:53.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Why do those
particular words matter? Do they
keep coming up?

19:53.359 --> 19:58.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT: They matter
because under the federal law,
if it's a game of skill,

19:58.064 --> 20:03.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it may not be illegal. If it's a
game of chance, it almost
certainly is illegal.

20:03.202 --> 20:08.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, that argument also failed
in the online poker case that
happened about four years

20:08.474 --> 20:13.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ago. So, just because they say
it's so doesn't make it so. I
think the other issue you have

20:13.412 --> 20:19.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to look at when you look at
their defense is, if they can't
beat the New York attorney

20:19.251 --> 20:24.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
general on this, if that legal
analysis holds, you know, that
could threaten their entire

20:24.123 --> 20:26.492 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
business model.

20:26.492 --> 20:29.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: How much money
are we really talking about
here? How much is circulating

20:29.228 --> 20:31.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in these fantasy game markets?

20:31.764 --> 20:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT: It's essentially
billions of dollars.

20:34.366 --> 20:40.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both of these companies are
valued at more than $1 billion,
and their growth rate is

20:40.906 --> 20:47.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
astronomical. You can argue
about their valuations. I think
that's kind of a fun exercise at
times,

20:47.313 --> 20:49.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
especially -- I think their
valuations might change quite a
bit after what's happened in

20:49.482 --> 20:52.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the last 24 hours.

20:52.618 --> 20:57.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's essentially billions of
dollars moving around. And for
that reason, it's drawn an

20:57.823 --> 21:01.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
incredible amount of scrutiny
just recently from regulators
and law enforcement officials.

21:01.927 --> 21:06.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And how much
of this is about the involvement
of the major leagues?

21:06.932 --> 21:10.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some of the major, the biggest
names in sports, professional
leagues, are directly involved

21:10.503 --> 21:11.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in a financial way
with these sites.

21:11.670 --> 21:13.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT: That's right.

21:13.606 --> 21:20.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They have a degree of
institutional buy-in for daily
fantasy sports that you haven't

21:20.012 --> 21:27.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seen before, or at least to this
degree, with other forms of
gaming like online poker. It

21:27.353 --> 21:32.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a huge advantage for them.
But I don't think that just the
institutional support

21:32.758 --> 21:36.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alone can protect them if, for
example, the Justice Department
decides that the New York

21:36.562 --> 21:39.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
attorney general is right.

21:39.131 --> 21:42.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: One of the
other arguments the attorney
general made was that these
firms

21:42.201 --> 21:43.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are fleecing their customers.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is he arguing there?

21:46.238 --> 21:47.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT: That's one of
the most interesting debates
about daily fantasy sports,
which

21:47.573 --> 21:51.277 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is, is it fair?

21:51.277 --> 21:54.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one of the things he says in
the letter is the vast majority
of the winnings go to

21:54.847 --> 21:58.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
less than 1 percent of the
players. One of the things that
we haven't really had a good

21:58.918 --> 22:04.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
explanation of, as all the sort
of regulatory attention has come
to them, is, who are the

22:04.890 --> 22:06.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whales? Whales is a term
for the big winners.

22:06.792 --> 22:08.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Right, the big fish.

22:08.861 --> 22:13.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT: Who are they?
Are they company employees? If
there's a significant number

22:13.432 --> 22:18.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of company employees among the
whales, that raises huge issues
about not only is it legal,

22:18.837 --> 22:23.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but is it actually fair, or is
this just a scam on some level
for the smart, sharp people

22:23.943 --> 22:27.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to take advantage
of the less sharp?

22:27.346 --> 22:30.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, that's obviously a dynamic
that you have in poker as well.
It's another point where

22:30.916 --> 22:35.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the online poker analogy comes
in. But I think that's one of
the great unanswered questions

22:35.754 --> 22:39.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so far. The attorney general
seems to be signaling that, from
what he's seen, it's not fair.

22:39.959 --> 22:42.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All
right. Fascinating stuff.

22:42.761 --> 22:43.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Devlin Barrett from The Wall
Street Journal, thank you very
much.

22:43.762 --> 22:48.534 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT: Thank you.

22:48.534 --> 22:59.578 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

22:59.578 --> 23:05.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": why
more young women are living with
their parents; Kareem

of fallen soldiers.

23:12.725 --> 23:17.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EVONNE WILLIAMS, Organizer: We
see the veterans that come back
that are wounded, but we don't

23:17.863 --> 23:22.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really see the widows and the
children. And I think it gives
people a chance to say, we're

23:22.568 --> 23:25.471 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
here for you.

23:25.471 --> 23:32.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Since January 2013,
journalist Paul Salopek has
tracked ancient man's path

23:32.411 --> 23:37.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out of Africa, what he calls
the Out of Eden Walk.

23:37.549 --> 23:40.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last night, Hari Sreenivasan
showed you the project that
Salopek will spend much of the

23:40.252 --> 23:43.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
next decade completing.

23:43.389 --> 23:48.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, Hari walks in the
footsteps with Paul of early man
to one point of real meaning

23:48.227 --> 23:50.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on his global trek.

23:50.863 --> 23:55.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
fog-shrouded fields and rolling
hills of Southern Georgia are

23:55.401 --> 23:59.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much more than a waypoint for
Paul Salopek. We were nearing
the ancient city and
archaeological

23:59.405 --> 24:01.774 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
site of Dmanisi.

24:01.774 --> 24:04.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK, Fellow, National
Geographic: So, Dmanisi is
finally in sight and this is

24:04.777 --> 24:10.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
probably one of the most
important human migration sites
outside of Africa proper.

24:10.549 --> 24:14.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Salopek is
following the path humans took
after the Ice Age, 70,000

24:14.820 --> 24:20.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to 100,000 years ago. But here
in Dmanisi, that path is much
older.

24:20.526 --> 24:25.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Along these green and jagged
river gorges, we have walked in
one form or another for

24:25.698 --> 24:31.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nearly two million years. The
history here is stacked high,
part of what Salopek calls

24:31.437 --> 24:36.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the layer cake effect of the
Caucasus. With a happy dog
welcoming us, we passed what was

24:36.542 --> 24:40.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
likely an outer defensive tower
of the 1,400-year-old city of
Dmanisi.

24:40.813 --> 24:43.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This has been a crossroads
for a long time.

24:43.615 --> 24:46.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: From day one. And
pretty much everybody invaded
it.

24:46.852 --> 24:48.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And was
this a trading route?

24:48.954 --> 24:53.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: This was a silk
road trading route city, a big
shining city on the hill,

24:53.525 --> 24:58.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very rich, until the Mongols
came and plundered it. And then
they were here a few hundred

24:58.364 --> 25:01.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years until the Georgians and
Armenians pushed them out.

25:01.967 --> 25:06.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It's an
archaeological gold mine. With
the summer digging season
finished,

25:06.772 --> 25:10.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we arrived at a sort of bunk
house for archaeologists to rest
for the night.

25:10.976 --> 25:13.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: If we did, by some
miracle, get a clear sky, it
really will change everything

25:13.679 --> 25:16.115 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
completely.

25:16.115 --> 25:23.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The next
morning, a miracle had indeed
swept away the fog. Within what

25:23.522 --> 25:28.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you're seeing is nearly two
million years of history, the
medieval city, whose walls

25:28.527 --> 25:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still stand, built on top of a
Bronze Age settlement that's
5,000 years old, and still

25:34.666 --> 25:40.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
beneath that, the 1.8
million-year-old remains of one
of modern human's earliest
ancestors.

25:40.806 --> 25:46.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Salopek, Dima Bit-Suleiman, his
walking partner in Georgia, and
I were joined by the director

25:46.678 --> 25:52.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Georgia's National Museum,
David Lordkipanidze, for the
walk up to the hilltop dig site.

25:52.684 --> 25:55.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID LORDKIPANIDZE, Director,
Georgia National Museum: What we
found here, it changed our

25:55.120 --> 26:04.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
understanding about early traces
of human evolution, about first
dispersal of our ancestors.

26:04.430 --> 26:11.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, also, it's completely
changed our views about who,
when left Africa and how they
were

26:11.637 --> 26:14.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
looking and what they
were doing also.

26:14.072 --> 26:16.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What
were these guys doing?

26:16.175 --> 26:18.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID LORDKIPANIDZE: These
guys were enjoying life here.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.779 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

26:20.779 --> 26:25.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Enjoying life
in a place much more lush and
temperate 1.8 million years

26:25.818 --> 26:31.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ago. Thanks to bones discovered
here at the same latitude as
Boston, we know this was

26:31.156 --> 26:35.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a land with game-like elephant,
giraffe, and rhinoceros, but
also large predators like

26:35.694 --> 26:38.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
saber-toothed cats.

26:38.096 --> 26:42.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, when they
come here, are they the predator
or are they the prey?

26:42.201 --> 26:46.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID LORDKIPANIDZE: I think
they were both. On the bones of
the humans, you can sometimes

26:46.171 --> 26:51.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see cut marks, so it shows that
they were prey. But, you see,
it's lucky for archaeology,

26:51.610 --> 26:52.377 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right?

26:52.377 --> 26:53.979 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

26:53.979 --> 26:56.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Bad day
for them, good day for you.

26:56.482 --> 26:59.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID LORDKIPANIDZE:
Yes. We are very lucky.

26:59.551 --> 27:04.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And that lucky
day came 10 years ago, with the
discovery of a skull,

27:04.122 --> 27:09.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the last of five found that is
the remarkably complete skull of
an ancient ancestor of modern

27:09.261 --> 27:11.930 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
man.

27:11.930 --> 27:15.834 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So this is it?

27:15.834 --> 27:20.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David took us to the National
Museum in the capital city of
Tbilisi to see the actual

27:20.739 --> 27:25.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
skulls kept in a vault and
handled with kid gloves, because
they are indeed national
treasures.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.145 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
This is how old?

27:27.145 --> 27:30.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID LORDKIPANIDZE: This
is 1.8 million years old.

27:30.949 --> 27:35.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The brain
capacity was about 40 percent of
ours, and they stood about 5

27:35.787 --> 27:41.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
feet tall. The skull has
features of three different
species, a possible snapshot in

27:41.660 --> 27:47.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time of evolution. An older
adult, probably a male, was
among those found. And the
toothless,

27:47.599 --> 27:52.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
worn jawbone might tell us
more than just size and age.

27:52.037 --> 27:58.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID LORDKIPANIDZE: It means it
was weak individual who could
survive only with help

27:58.210 --> 28:03.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of others. And I think that
Dmanisi shows also the first
traces of compassions and
solidarity

28:03.448 --> 28:06.018 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Homo erectus.

28:06.018 --> 28:11.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, Homo
erectus, even though they had a
brain that was a third our size,

28:11.023 --> 28:13.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they still cared for somebody
other than themselves.

28:13.559 --> 28:17.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID LORDKIPANIDZE: One of the
human characters could be taking
on others.

28:17.963 --> 28:20.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
Taking care of others.

28:20.499 --> 28:23.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How did these guys get to
Dmanisi? Why did they leave?

28:23.035 --> 28:27.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID LORDKIPANIDZE: See, I
don't think there was just one
reason of it. They were able

28:27.673 --> 28:33.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do it. They wanted to do it.
I think main human character is
the curiosity.

28:33.378 --> 28:36.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So this is the
same instinct that we have
today, to look around the next

28:36.915 --> 28:38.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
corner, over the next hill.

28:38.483 --> 28:40.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID LORDKIPANIDZE:
Paul is doing the same.

28:40.118 --> 28:42.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
As these guys did.

28:42.020 --> 28:45.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID LORDKIPANIDZE: As these
guys did. Paul is follower of
Homo erectus.

28:45.290 --> 28:47.125 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:47.125 --> 28:50.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, in a
sense, so are we all. But for
Salopek, their ancient journey

28:50.996 --> 28:54.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to this point has
particular meaning.

28:54.132 --> 28:57.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: These are the
first pioneer wanderers. These
are kind of like the dawn

28:57.469 --> 29:03.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people who first left our
collective home in Africa. So
being here is a terrific echo

29:03.241 --> 29:08.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of my own project. I'm following
people who came much later, but
these were the trailblazers.

29:08.480 --> 29:12.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Only 10
percent of this sprawling site
has been excavated. That layered

29:12.551 --> 29:13.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
effect was evident everywhere.

29:13.819 --> 29:17.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, where are you taking me?

29:17.089 --> 29:21.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a deep pit, David showed us
where an ancient wine maker had
sunk his vat.

29:21.593 --> 29:24.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID LORDKIPANIDZE: You can
see 1.8 million years old.

29:24.262 --> 29:26.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The bone
is 1.8 million years old.

29:26.999 --> 29:31.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in the process, that person
had tossed aside some of the
much older bones.

29:31.570 --> 29:33.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This wine jar is how old?

29:33.071 --> 29:36.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID LORDKIPANIDZE:
It's a 1,000 years old.

29:36.274 --> 29:38.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You know,
finding a 1,000-year wine jar
would be kind of a big deal for
anybody

29:38.377 --> 29:39.277 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
else.

29:39.277 --> 29:40.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID LORDKIPANIDZE: Not
for a paleontologist.

29:40.379 --> 29:42.314 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

29:42.314 --> 29:47.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But there are
few better places for a writer
gauging the crosscurrents

29:47.285 --> 29:52.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of history. So, with sunset not
far off, Paul and I walked to
the top of the citadel that

29:52.758 --> 29:58.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has stood here for 1,000 years,
a relative blink of an eye
geologically speaking, the

29:58.430 --> 30:02.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
majesty of this place clear,
spread out before us, and
perhaps a key to its fraught and
important

30:02.701 --> 30:04.469 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
past.

30:04.469 --> 30:07.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, why is this place
such a crossroads?

30:07.973 --> 30:13.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: Well, it's an
antique bridge between Asia and
Europe and has been for
millennia.

30:13.145 --> 30:20.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there has been migration
routes through here going back
before memory.

30:20.018 --> 30:25.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The silk road passes through
here. But it also is the
epicenter where three major
empires

30:25.557 --> 30:32.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
meet. And they have always
contested this area. From the
south, the Persians, from the

30:32.397 --> 30:37.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
West, the Ottoman Empire, which
is today Turkey, and from the
north, more recently, Russia.

30:37.969 --> 30:42.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They have overlapped and
contested and fought over this
corner of the world for
centuries.

30:42.207 --> 30:44.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, if they
have lived here, they have also
died here.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: A lot of people
have died here over the years. I
think we're standing on

30:47.112 --> 30:50.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one of the oldest
boneyards in the world.

30:50.315 --> 30:52.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Atop the
boneyard in Dmanisi, Georgia,
I'm Hari Sreenivasan for the
"PBS

30:52.951 --> 30:54.920 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
NewsHour."

30:54.920 --> 30:59.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Paul Salopek has
continued walking since Hari
caught up with him in Georgia.

30:59.825 --> 31:03.228 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
He's now crossed
into Azerbaijan.

31:03.228 --> 31:06.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Salopek's work is supported in
part by the Pulitzer Center for
Crisis Reporting, which

31:06.998 --> 31:10.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
also partners with
the "NewsHour."

31:10.102 --> 31:13.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more on Salopek's walk,
including some of Hari's photos
and thoughts, head online

31:13.705 --> 31:21.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to our site at PBS.org/NewsHour.

31:21.580 --> 31:36.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Parents and
plenty of 20- and 30-somethings
are well aware that many young

31:36.895 --> 31:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
adults move back home these
days after they finish school.

31:41.266 --> 31:46.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But a new analysis of census
data out today from the Pew
Research Center underlines the

31:46.471 --> 31:52.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
extent to which this is
happening. It finds that 36
percent of women between the
ages

31:52.110 --> 31:59.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of 18 and 34 are living at home
with parents or relatives.
That's higher than at any time

31:59.151 --> 32:05.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since 1940. An earlier analysis
also found that nearly 43
percent of young men lived

32:05.290 --> 32:08.927 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
in a similar
arrangement last year.

32:08.927 --> 32:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's break down some of these
findings with Richard Fry. He
wrote today's analysis for

32:14.366 --> 32:18.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pew. And Gillian White, she is
with "The Atlantic" and writes
frequently about the lives of
millennials.

32:18.470 --> 32:21.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we welcome you
both to the program.

32:21.940 --> 32:27.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Richard Fry, 36 percent,
more than 36 percent, the
biggest percentage we have seen

32:27.345 --> 32:30.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
since the Great Depression,
what's behind this?

32:30.482 --> 32:32.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD FRY, Pew Research
Center: I would then point to
sort of three factors sort of

32:32.951 --> 32:36.588 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
through the long-run sweep.

32:36.588 --> 32:43.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's -- the low point was about
1960, where about 24 percent. So
it's been on the rise

32:43.094 --> 32:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
slowly, markedly picked up in
the new century. Three factors.
Number one, young adults are

32:48.033 --> 32:53.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much less likely to be married
than was the case 50, 60 years
ago.

32:53.505 --> 32:59.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When young couples get married,
they don't live with their
parents. So that delayed
marriage

32:59.611 --> 33:04.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
has sort of reduced the
incentive to leave the nest.
Secondly, particularly among
young

33:04.649 --> 33:09.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women, many more of them are
college students. College
enrollment by young women has
gone

33:09.154 --> 33:13.658 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
up about five-fold since 1960.

33:13.658 --> 33:17.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
College students, if you think
about community college
students, students going to
local

33:17.596 --> 33:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
universities, much more likely
to be living at home. And then,
finally, particularly since

33:21.600 --> 33:26.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the 1970s, young adults have
become more racially and
ethnically diverse as a result
of increased

33:26.638 --> 33:28.907 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
immigration.

33:28.907 --> 33:35.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we know is that young
adults from minority backgrounds
are more likely to live with
parents

33:35.680 --> 33:41.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than white young adults. And so
as young adults have become more
diverse, more of them are

33:41.219 --> 33:43.622 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
living at home.

33:43.622 --> 33:46.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Family patterns,
more multigenerational
households.

33:46.758 --> 33:50.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And just quickly, for young
men, some of the same reasons?

33:50.595 --> 33:54.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD FRY: Yes, yes. And they
-- young men have followed a
very similar trend.

33:54.032 --> 33:58.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me --
before I turned to you, Gillian
White, let me -- we put out

33:58.737 --> 34:04.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a call out on social media today
asking young people, if you're
living at home with family

34:04.876 --> 34:08.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or relatives, tell us about the
factors that led you to do this.

34:08.980 --> 34:12.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And here are two quick comments,
one from Facebook. Now, this
comes from a woman named

34:12.550 --> 34:17.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Janis Smith. She says: "My
college-educated 30-year-old
daughter lives at home with her

34:17.322 --> 34:22.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
parents because her public
school salary is too low for her
to fully support herself and

34:22.127 --> 34:24.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her 1-year-old son."

34:24.696 --> 34:30.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then from Twitter, we got
this comment from Steffanie
Ybanez. She tweeted: "I'm 25,

34:30.669 --> 34:35.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
living at home, still in
college, plan to stay at home
after graduation to save money

34:35.106 --> 34:38.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and pay off loans."

34:38.543 --> 34:45.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Angela -- I mean, so,
Gillian -- I'm sorry -- do these
sound like common reasons?
You're

34:45.750 --> 34:47.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
hearing -- you have been
reporting on this generation for
some time.

34:47.319 --> 34:48.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GILLIAN WHITE, "The
Atlantic": Yes.

34:48.720 --> 34:53.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think these two comments
really illustrate a lot that we
hear when it comes to finance

34:53.024 --> 34:57.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and economics and why people are
staying at home. The first piece
is that wages have not

34:57.228 --> 35:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seen a ton of growth, especially
for young people, since the end
of the recession. The

35:01.733 --> 35:05.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
economy is getting better, but
wages haven't really
skyrocketed.

35:05.537 --> 35:11.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if you still feel like you
might have a difficult time
paying rent, paying utilities,

35:11.142 --> 35:15.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
paying for all these other
things, it might feel safer to
just go ahead and stay home.

35:15.480 --> 35:20.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In addition to that, we know
that student loan debt loads are
rising, so a lot of people

35:20.685 --> 35:25.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are saying, until I can get a
handle on my finances, until I
can pay down these debts,

35:25.190 --> 35:28.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
maybe I should just stay at home
with my parents, where I can
either pay a nominal amount or

35:28.326 --> 35:32.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pay nothing and really
catch up on my finances.

35:32.430 --> 35:38.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what about,
Richard Fry, in your looking at
the data, does it back

35:38.269 --> 35:40.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this up? Because the economy, if
you step back and look at the
economics, it's supposed

35:40.338 --> 35:41.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to have gotten better.

35:41.373 --> 35:43.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RICHARD FRY: Yes.

35:43.775 --> 35:47.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I did a report about three
months ago where I very much
just sort of focused on
recently,

35:47.746 --> 35:54.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since the great recession, and
what's been happening. And from
2007 to 2010, when the

35:54.819 --> 35:59.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
economy was sinking, more young
adults lived at home. The
expectation -- and it was my

35:59.858 --> 36:05.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
expectation and others'
expectations -- that after 2010,
as the job market started to
improve

36:05.430 --> 36:10.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and unemployment rates came
down, that young adults would
start leaving the nest.

36:10.869 --> 36:14.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Young adult employment rates
have come down. More of them do
have jobs. There is even some

36:14.606 --> 36:17.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
evidence that their earnings are
starting to rise, at least a
little bit. And yet more

36:17.976 --> 36:22.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of them are living at home than
was the case five years ago.

36:22.514 --> 36:26.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it's not altogether clear
how much the job market and
what's going on in the

36:26.418 --> 36:29.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
job market for young
adults is driving this.

36:29.487 --> 36:32.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Gillian
White, in your reporting -- and,
again, you have been looking

36:32.023 --> 36:34.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at this for some time -- what
do you think is going on here?

36:34.092 --> 36:37.395 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GILLIAN WHITE: I mean, I
think it's two pieces.

36:37.395 --> 36:41.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, even if things get
better, I think people really
have it in their heads,
especially

36:41.399 --> 36:47.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
young people, that finances are
a problem, that maybe jobs
aren't as secure as they once

36:47.005 --> 36:51.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were. So they are a little
hesitant to maybe move out on
their own in case something
happens.

36:51.409 --> 36:56.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, other than that -- and
this is anecdotal largely, but
it could be that cultural norms

36:56.181 --> 37:01.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have changed. A few years ago, a
few decades ago, having a
30-year-old who lived at home

37:01.586 --> 37:07.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
might have raised some eyebrows,
but now not as much, because we
have that excuse of the

37:07.258 --> 37:10.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
great recession, we have that
excuse of student loan debt, we
have that excuse of the economy.

37:10.995 --> 37:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I did some
reporting on millennials eight
or nine years ago, and at

37:15.600 --> 37:20.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that point, and this was the --
this cohort, but younger, and
what we found then is, they

37:20.205 --> 37:24.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were closer to their parents
than any young generation had
been in history.

37:24.909 --> 37:27.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, are you picking up, Gillian,
any of that in what you're...

37:27.812 --> 37:28.279 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

37:28.279 --> 37:30.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GILLIAN WHITE: Yes, absolutely.

37:30.315 --> 37:35.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think the feeling of a
cultural shift occurs both for
millennials and for their boomer

37:35.920 --> 37:40.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
parents, where a lot of those
parents aren't really trying to
push them out. They are happy

37:40.291 --> 37:45.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to have them home. They are
happy to kind of feel young and
have somebody around to

37:45.463 --> 37:50.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
teach them about new technology,
and kids aren't feeling as
alienated from their parents.

37:50.068 --> 37:53.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So the idea of staying home with
them doesn't feel as awful.

37:53.972 --> 37:58.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Richard Fry,
looking -- I know how this is --
it's hard to project into the

37:58.743 --> 38:03.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
future, but can you see any
patterns in the past when
something like this has
happened?

38:03.348 --> 38:07.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How long does it take before it
shifts, or does it shift? I
mean, could this be the way

38:07.085 --> 38:08.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it's going to be?

38:08.920 --> 38:16.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD FRY: I think that there
is some sense that this may be,
in some ways, a new normal.

38:16.761 --> 38:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what I mean by that is, we
know, for example, that the
racial ethnic diversification is

38:21.633 --> 38:29.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
likely to continue, OK? We also
know that the job market cannot
get a whole lot better

38:29.374 --> 38:34.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than sort of where we're at. I
mean, the national unemployment
rate is now down to 5 percent.

38:34.045 --> 38:37.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So if you think it's all about
the job market, it's not clear
that the job market can get

38:37.382 --> 38:43.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a whole lot better. No one
really knows. But I do think
that a return to the levels of

38:43.421 --> 38:47.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the early '60s is probably not
in the cards anytime soon.

38:47.525 --> 38:50.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The new normal.
All right, we are going to get
used to this.

38:50.929 --> 38:56.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Richard Fry, Gillian
White, thank you.

38:56.501 --> 39:02.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GILLIAN WHITE: Thanks.

39:02.874 --> 39:10.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: He is the elusive
older brother, who even Sherlock
Holmes claimed was smarter

39:10.915 --> 39:13.384 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
than he.

39:13.384 --> 39:17.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Mycroft Holmes" is the title of
the latest addition to the
"NewsHour" Bookshelf. Its

39:17.922 --> 39:24.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
co-author is former basketball
great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, an
Arthur Conan Doyle devotee

39:24.562 --> 39:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who says he applied Holmesian
deduction and reasoning while he
was playing pro ball.

39:29.033 --> 39:31.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He recently talked with Jeffrey
Brown here in Washington.

39:31.869 --> 39:34.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, welcome to you.

39:34.639 --> 39:36.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR, Author,
"Mycroft Holmes": Well, thank
you so much.

39:36.307 --> 39:39.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's interesting.
Reading this book, you're taking
one fiction, right, the

39:39.344 --> 39:42.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sherlock Holmes books, and
creating another, a new one.

39:42.413 --> 39:43.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Yes.

39:43.648 --> 39:45.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Tell me how you
thought about it. What you were
doing?

39:45.516 --> 39:50.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Mycroft has
never been really explored as a
subject.

39:50.755 --> 39:57.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's the one person in all
of these stories that is the
closest to Sherlock. So I was

39:57.562 --> 39:59.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just curious about him.

39:59.931 --> 40:02.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He's the older
and even by Sherlock's terms the
smarter brother. Right?

40:02.734 --> 40:03.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: The
smarter brother, yes.

40:03.735 --> 40:05.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But we don't
know that much about him.

40:05.136 --> 40:07.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You had fun filling
in the character.

40:07.772 --> 40:12.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Filling in
his backstory and how he got to
be who he was, because by

40:12.310 --> 40:17.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the time he's in the Sherlock
Holmes stories, he's
middle-aged, overweight, and
just really

40:17.548 --> 40:21.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has withdrawn from the world.

40:21.352 --> 40:27.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He only goes to his offices, his
club and his apartment. And he
doesn't go any other

40:27.859 --> 40:32.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
place. We wanted to explain how
he got to be like that, because,
probably, as a younger

40:32.330 --> 40:36.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
man, he probably had a
much different life.

40:36.067 --> 40:39.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In filling in the
story, though, you get to look
at a lot of bigger issues,

40:39.137 --> 40:41.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because you're seeing Britain
as a colonial power.

40:41.673 --> 40:43.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Yes.

40:43.141 --> 40:49.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You're taking us
to Trinidad. The Dr. Watson
character is a black man, so

40:49.247 --> 40:53.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you're taking this into racial
issues. Slavery is in the story.

40:53.251 --> 40:59.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: And just
what it was like in England
after slavery has been
abolished,

40:59.490 --> 41:05.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and how people relate to the
colonies, because every time you
see Victorian England depicted,

41:05.897 --> 41:09.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they only look at London.

41:09.734 --> 41:14.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, London was attached to all
of its colonies, so that
attachment really hasn't been
explored.

41:14.172 --> 41:19.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What explains the
fascination with Sherlock Holmes
that continues, the books,

41:19.844 --> 41:25.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the movies, the popular PBS
television, and now you? What
explains that?

41:25.083 --> 41:29.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: People want
to see crime detection done in a
way where we get it right.

41:29.654 --> 41:30.755 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's too many times...

41:30.755 --> 41:33.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Where
we get it right?

41:33.124 --> 41:37.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Where we
get it correct. We identify the
bad guys and either incarcerate

41:37.061 --> 41:40.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and punish them or get
them out of the picture.

41:40.798 --> 41:43.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we want the innocent people
to go free. And Sherlock is the
only person that gets

41:43.768 --> 41:44.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it right every time.

41:44.569 --> 41:46.537 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:46.537 --> 41:53.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: So, I think
we all want a Sherlock in our
lives in terms of the way

41:53.211 --> 41:58.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that our police and crime
detection people work, that they
get it right, and not --
understand

41:58.149 --> 42:01.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who the criminals are and
don't punish the innocent.

42:01.452 --> 42:04.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And he does it,
of course, through mental
deduction.

42:04.489 --> 42:09.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Yes,
through deduction and a careful
analysis of the facts.

42:09.994 --> 42:16.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Sherlock is a genius,
literally, at understanding the
facts, and relating them in a
way that

42:16.834 --> 42:20.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he figures out what's going on.

42:20.004 --> 42:24.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What about your
own fascination with Sherlock
Holmes? There is a fascinating

42:24.041 --> 42:28.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
author's note at the end of the
novel in which you say that you
first read the Sherlock Holmes

42:28.679 --> 42:34.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stories early in your basketball
career and adapted Holmes'
powers of observation to the

42:34.419 --> 42:38.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
game in order to gain an
edge over your opponents.

42:38.189 --> 42:39.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Explain that to me.

42:39.924 --> 42:45.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: By being
able to see into everything in
depth, Sherlock always

42:45.062 --> 42:48.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has an advantage over
the people around him.

42:48.166 --> 42:52.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I always use this example. It
is the best one I have. We used
to play the Detroit Pistons.

42:52.970 --> 42:59.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They had a very great center.
His name is Bob Lanier. But he
had a bad habit. He was

42:59.777 --> 43:02.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a nicotine fiend. And at
halftime, he had -- he smoked
cigarettes.

43:02.847 --> 43:04.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

43:04.916 --> 43:08.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: And I
overheard the ball boys talking
about it one time. They said

43:08.186 --> 43:13.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they don't like going into the
shower room because Bob had been
in there smoking cigarettes.

43:13.825 --> 43:18.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I realized that, if Bob
smoked cigarettes at halftime,
if I could get him to run a lot

43:18.362 --> 43:20.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the second half,
he would be in pain.

43:20.431 --> 43:21.332 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

43:21.332 --> 43:23.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: That was
your Sherlock moment.

43:23.835 --> 43:27.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Yes, and I
would gain an advantage at that
point.

43:27.772 --> 43:32.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, things like that, I would
just try to pay attention to
what's going on and use my

43:32.510 --> 43:38.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
powers of observation. But, you
know, Sherlock is much more in
depth because of all the
different

43:38.816 --> 43:45.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
facts that he can correlate.
He's into so many arcane bits of
knowledge that help him

43:45.690 --> 43:49.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see things. I always describe it
as Sherlock sees in technicolor
and we see everything

43:49.827 --> 43:52.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in black and white.

43:52.230 --> 43:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I saw you play so
many times. I saw you destroy my
team, the Celtics, many

43:55.766 --> 43:56.267 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
times.

43:56.267 --> 43:58.002 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

43:58.002 --> 44:03.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I never imagined
that Sherlock was -- Sherlock
Holmes was somehow playing

44:03.174 --> 44:05.243 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into all that.

44:05.243 --> 44:11.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Well, just
for anyone who has to figure out
things, if they read

44:11.949 --> 44:15.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Arthur Conan Doyle, they will
get an idea about how keen your
powers of observation

44:15.720 --> 44:18.055 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
can be.

44:18.055 --> 44:21.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: You are
publishing books. You're writing
a column for "TIME" magazine.
There's

44:21.626 --> 44:25.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a documentary coming out.

44:25.162 --> 44:29.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You also, earlier this year, had
-- it was quadruple coronary
bypass surgery. Right?

44:29.834 --> 44:30.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
Yes, scary time.

44:30.868 --> 44:31.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Scary time.

44:31.769 --> 44:32.503 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Yes.

44:32.503 --> 44:35.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sort of a
real brush with mortality.

44:35.106 --> 44:38.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: A very
close brush with mortality.

44:38.643 --> 44:45.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I had massive blockages that
I wasn't aware of. I only became
aware of it when I

44:45.950 --> 44:50.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
started to exercise one day, and
things didn't feel right inside
my chest, and I knew something

44:50.688 --> 44:55.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was up. But I still postponed
going to see the cardiologist
for a couple of months.

44:55.226 --> 44:57.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I suppose that's
hard for a man who's been an
athlete all his life and

44:57.795 --> 45:00.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in good shape, right?

45:00.364 --> 45:04.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: My son,
who's a physician, said, geez,
dad, don't worry about it. You

45:04.869 --> 45:08.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
might need a stent, but you're
in good shape, you eat right,
you exercise. It probably won't

45:08.306 --> 45:11.175 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be a big deal.

45:11.175 --> 45:16.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as soon as I went in for the
angiogram, the doctor said, we
have got to do surgery.

45:16.614 --> 45:20.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're scheduled for a quadruple
bypass in two days, which ended
up being on my birthday.

45:20.718 --> 45:21.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Wow.

45:21.519 --> 45:22.086 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

45:22.086 --> 45:24.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: What a day.

45:24.188 --> 45:25.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Happy
birthday, right. Wow.

45:25.790 --> 45:28.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: Yes.

45:28.893 --> 45:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, thank you for
talking with us.

45:35.266 --> 45:39.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR:
It was a pleasure.

45:39.670 --> 45:45.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the day when
we recognize the service to our
country by veterans, a

45:45.176 --> 45:50.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
story about those who have lost
a family member due to the
casualties of war.

45:50.114 --> 45:55.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the Nebraska-Michigan State
football game this past weekend,
a special tribute was paid

45:55.886 --> 45:59.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the family members of the
more than 60 Nebraskans who gave
their lives in the global

45:59.624 --> 46:02.827 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
war on terror.

46:02.827 --> 46:08.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
From our PBS station in
Nebraska, Dennis Kellogg reports
on one organization's efforts to
support

46:08.466 --> 46:14.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gold Star Families who are
still coping with their loss.

46:14.372 --> 46:23.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENNIS KELLOGG: Nebraska's
Memorial Stadium is packed with
90,000 fans to watch this
college

46:23.014 --> 46:29.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
football game. In this sea of
red, 55 women and children stand
out, and not just because

46:29.153 --> 46:32.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of what they're wearing.
They're Gold Star Families.

46:32.189 --> 46:35.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RHONDA ROBINSON, Widow of Fallen
Soldier: It's a unique group.
Like, I have been told

46:35.192 --> 46:41.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's not a group that you want
to be a part of, but you are a
part of because things happen.

46:41.999 --> 46:47.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENNIS KELLOGG: Four years ago,
Rhonda Robinson learned her
husband, Josh, had been shot and

46:47.138 --> 46:50.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
killed while on patrol
in Southern Afghanistan.

46:50.541 --> 46:53.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RHONDA ROBINSON: I think of it
every day, and I think the boys,
too.

46:53.544 --> 46:57.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENNIS KELLOGG: Those boys,
9-year-old Kody and 8-year-old
Wyatt, work hard to hold onto

46:57.615 --> 47:00.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the memories they
have of their dad.

47:00.518 --> 47:07.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WYATT ROBINSON, Son of Fallen
Soldier: Everybody says I look
like him. I do stuff dirty -- I,

47:07.191 --> 47:12.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like, get dirty a lot. And
I'm just really rough.

47:12.263 --> 47:16.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KODY ROBINSON, Son of Fallen
Soldier: When I was younger I
always wished, maybe someday

47:16.967 --> 47:22.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he will come back. Maybe someday
he will come back. But, like, as
I got older, it started

47:22.339 --> 47:28.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get to me. And I started to
realize he's not coming back,
and it's going to be a long

47:28.946 --> 47:32.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
time until we see
each other again.

47:32.983 --> 47:38.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENNIS KELLOGG: The football
game was the culmination of the
first-of-its-kind Gold

47:38.723 --> 47:42.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Star Honor Flight Weekend,
honoring families who lost
someone serving their country
since

47:42.560 --> 47:45.062 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
9/11.

47:45.062 --> 47:50.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, the families were given
the royal treatment, massages,
manicures, and pedicures for the

47:50.401 --> 47:55.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
moms, handmade quilts with
special messages for the kids.

Organizers Bill and Evonne
Williams don't want anyone to
forget the sacrifice of these

47:58.409 --> 48:01.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
soldiers and these families.

48:01.378 --> 48:06.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why is it so important
for you to do this?

48:06.150 --> 48:13.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL WILLIAMS, Organizer:
Because every fallen family's
feeling is the same, is that
they're

48:13.357 --> 48:17.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
loved ones are going to be
forgotten. So that's our
mission, is that they not be.

48:17.661 --> 48:21.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EVONNE WILLIAMS, Organizer: We
see the veterans that come back
that are wounded, but we don't

48:21.699 --> 48:26.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really see the widows and the
children. And I think it gives
people a chance to say, we're

48:26.704 --> 48:31.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
here for you. Thank you.

48:31.208 --> 48:38.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DENNIS KELLOGG: As these
families arrive at the Omaha
Airport for their Honor Flight,

48:38.582 --> 48:41.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hundreds of people line the
terminal to show their support.

48:41.852 --> 48:43.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: I thought it would be
kind of fun. And we have gotten
a couple of hugs already.

48:43.521 --> 48:44.255 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:44.255 --> 48:46.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BOY: This is my first
time riding on a plane.

48:46.924 --> 48:53.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENNIS KELLOGG: Less than a
half-hour after take-off, they
land in Lincoln, where the

48:53.230 --> 49:01.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
airport is packed with even more
people to greet them, including
Iraq veteran Robert

49:01.539 --> 49:05.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kugler. He served with his
brother, who was killed in the
war.

49:05.276 --> 49:09.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT KUGLER, U.S. Military
Veteran: I think it's really
important for them to know that

49:09.380 --> 49:14.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there are people that are still
hurting on -- with our own pain,
but we're still here

49:14.718 --> 49:18.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to support them, because
we're all in this together.

49:18.355 --> 49:22.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENNIS KELLOGG: One of the most
difficult and memorable parts of
the day comes when

49:22.660 --> 49:27.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the families place a rose next
to photos of their loved ones.
The Williams are creating

49:27.364 --> 49:32.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
similar displays remembering
the fallen from each state.

49:32.036 --> 49:36.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wyatt Robinson reads the note
his mom wrote that's posted next
to his dad's photo.

49:36.006 --> 49:39.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WYATT ROBINSON: "Josh, so proud
of you and thank you for all
your memories. Kody and

49:39.844 --> 49:49.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Wyatt and me will keep your
story alive. Your wife, Rhonda."

49:49.954 --> 49:58.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENNIS KELLOGG: It's just a
short walk from the quiet of the
photo display to the noisy

49:58.062 --> 50:02.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
football stadium. But it's long
enough for these fans to let
these families know that,

50:02.032 --> 50:06.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on this day, they're cheering
for more than the home team.

50:06.537 --> 50:15.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Once inside, the families
receive special recognition and
a standing ovation. They wait

50:15.946 --> 50:21.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the final notes of the
national anthem. That's when
they release gold balloons, each

50:21.285 --> 50:25.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
carrying a very personal message
they have written to their
soldier, their husband, their

50:25.089 --> 50:26.657 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
dad.

50:26.657 --> 50:31.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WYATT ROBINSON: I wrote, "Dear
father, I miss you so much."

50:31.829 --> 50:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KODY ROBINSON: "Miss you. Love
you. Want you. Your son, always,
Kody. XO, XO."

50:36.533 --> 50:38.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RHONDA ROBINSON: "Your memory
will always live strong through
your little girl. Always

50:38.435 --> 50:38.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and forever, love, Mama Bear."

50:38.936 --> 50:43.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHILD: Hey dad, I love you
and I hope to see you.

50:43.707 --> 50:51.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHILD: "I love you dad, and
I know you love me too."

50:51.615 --> 50:57.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DENNIS KELLOGG: Powerful
messages from the family of
those who made the ultimate
sacrifice.

50:57.454 --> 51:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm

Nebraska.

51:09.066 --> 51:22.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

51:27.084 --> 51:30.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

thank you, and good night.
