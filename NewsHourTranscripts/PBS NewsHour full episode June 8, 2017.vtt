JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:

00:06.272 --> 00:09.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JAMES COMEY, Former FBI
Director: Those were
lies, plain and simple.

00:09.676 --> 00:15.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: James Comey
speaks publicly
for the first time since being
fired as FBI

00:15.115 --> 00:19.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
director, telling the Senate
Intelligence
Committee President Trump could
not be trusted.

00:19.719 --> 00:21.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: I have seen the
tweet about tapes.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lordy, I hope there are tapes.

00:23.957 --> 00:28.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We analyze the
biggest moments
from the hearing and what they
mean for President

00:28.361 --> 00:31.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Trump and the Russia
investigation moving
forward.

00:31.431 --> 00:35.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plus: The United Kingdom votes
in a critical
election.

00:35.902 --> 00:41.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At stake is the approach to
leading Britain
into a new era marked by Brexit
and terror

00:41.107 --> 00:42.075 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
threats.

00:42.108 --> 00:49.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:49.349 --> 00:52.152 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:52.185 --> 01:01.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: From James Comey
today, a raft
of revelations.

01:01.161 --> 01:06.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With the nation watching in his
first public
experience since being fired,
the former FBI

01:06.533 --> 01:11.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
director told the Senate
Intelligence Committee
that he made notes to guard
against President

01:11.738 --> 01:17.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump lying right after each of
their discussions,
and leaked some of those memos
after he was

01:17.744 --> 01:19.212 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fired.

01:19.245 --> 01:23.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He assured the president several
times that
he wasn't under investigation.

01:23.983 --> 01:29.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he concluded that Mr. Trump
wanted to
pressure him to end the FBI
probe of former

01:29.456 --> 01:34.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
National Security Adviser
Michael Flynn and
his Russian contacts.

01:34.327 --> 01:39.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Comey told Committee Vice
Chairman Senator
John (sic) Warner that he began
writing everything

01:39.065 --> 01:41.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
down after an initial meeting
last January.

01:41.801 --> 01:43.636 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:43.670 --> 01:46.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK WARNER (D), Virginia:
You've had extensive
experience at the Department of
Justice and

01:46.172 --> 01:48.141 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at the FBI.

01:48.174 --> 01:51.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You've worked under presidents
of both parties.

01:51.611 --> 01:56.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What was it about that meeting
that led you
to determine that you needed to
start putting

01:56.816 --> 01:58.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
down a written record?

01:58.618 --> 02:01.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAMES COMEY, Former FBI
Director: A combination
of things, I think the
circumstances, the

02:01.588 --> 02:05.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
subject matter, and the person I
was interacting
with.

02:05.091 --> 02:10.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Circumstances, first, I was
alone with the
president of the United States,
or the president-elect,

02:10.063 --> 02:11.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
soon to be president.

02:11.965 --> 02:16.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The subject matter, I was
talking about matters
that touch on the FBI's core
responsibility,

02:16.669 --> 02:22.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and that relate to the
president, president-elect
personally, and then the nature
of the person.

02:22.275 --> 02:25.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was honestly concerned that he
might lie
about the nature of our meeting,
and so I

02:25.778 --> 02:27.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thought it really important to
document.

02:27.680 --> 02:31.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That combination of things, I
had never experienced
before, but it led me to believe
I got to

02:31.684 --> 02:34.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
write it down and I got to write
it down in
a very detailed way.

02:34.387 --> 02:35.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Apologies.

02:35.588 --> 02:38.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was, of course, Senator
Mark Warner of
Virginia.

02:38.124 --> 02:43.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, the men also met on
Valentine's Day, when,
Comey says, the president asked
him about

02:43.830 --> 02:45.999 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Michael Flynn investigation.

02:46.032 --> 02:49.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He told Senator James Risch the
intent was
clear to him.

02:49.502 --> 02:50.870 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:50.904 --> 02:52.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES RISCH (R), Idaho: There's
28 words there
that are in quotes.

02:52.639 --> 02:56.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it says -- quote -- "I hope"
-- this is
the president speaking -- "I
hope you can

02:56.543 --> 02:59.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see your way clear to letting
this go, to
letting Flynn go.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.347 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He is good guy.

03:01.381 --> 03:04.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I hope you can let this go."

03:04.184 --> 03:06.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, those are his exact words,
is that correct?

03:06.486 --> 03:07.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES COMEY: Correct.

03:07.487 --> 03:08.821 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:08.855 --> 03:09.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES RISCH: And you wrote them
here and you
put them in quotes.

03:09.455 --> 03:10.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES COMEY: Correct.

03:10.456 --> 03:11.424 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:11.457 --> 03:12.425 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JAMES RISCH: OK.

03:12.458 --> 03:13.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you for that.

03:13.459 --> 03:15.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He did not direct you to let it
go?

03:15.195 --> 03:17.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: Not in his words,
no.

03:17.797 --> 03:18.898 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES RISCH: He did not order
you to let it
go?

03:20.400 --> 03:22.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: Again, those words
are not an
order.

03:22.835 --> 03:26.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the reason I keep saying his
words is,
I took it as a direction.

03:26.839 --> 03:27.807 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES RISCH: Right.

03:29.609 --> 03:31.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: I mean, this is a
president of
the United States with me alone
saying, I

03:31.244 --> 03:32.312 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
hope this.

03:32.345 --> 03:34.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I took it as, this is what he
wants me to
do.

03:34.647 --> 03:36.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I didn't obey that, but that's
the way I took
it.

03:36.616 --> 03:38.184 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES RISCH: You may have taken
it as a direction,
but that's not what he said.

03:39.185 --> 03:40.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES COMEY: Correct.

03:40.186 --> 03:41.154 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:41.187 --> 03:43.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES RISCH: He said, I hope.

03:43.089 --> 03:47.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Comey's accounts
of these meetings
first came out in the press last
month, after

03:47.427 --> 03:50.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Trump dismissed him as
FBI director.

03:50.597 --> 03:55.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Comey confirmed in
answering a question
from Senator Susan Collins that
the leak came

03:55.702 --> 03:56.669 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from him.

03:56.703 --> 03:58.605 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:58.638 --> 04:04.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN COLLINS (R), Maine: Did
you show copies
of your memos to anyone outside
of the Department

04:04.844 --> 04:05.812 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Justice?

04:05.845 --> 04:06.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES COMEY: Yes.

04:06.846 --> 04:07.814 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:07.847 --> 04:09.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUSAN COLLINS: And to whom did
you show copies?

04:09.649 --> 04:15.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: I asked -- the
president tweeted
on Friday after I got fired that
I better

04:15.221 --> 04:17.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hope there's not tapes.

04:17.090 --> 04:20.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I woke up in the middle of the
night on Monday
night, because it didn't dawn on
me originally,

04:20.893 --> 04:23.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that there might be
corroboration for our
conversation.

04:23.429 --> 04:24.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There might a tape.

04:24.831 --> 04:28.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And my judgment was, I need to
get that out
into the public square.

04:28.334 --> 04:33.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I asked a friend of mine
to share the
content of the memo with a
reporter.

04:33.306 --> 04:35.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Didn't do it myself for a
variety of reasons.

04:35.108 --> 04:39.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I asked him to, because I
thought that
might prompt the appointment of
a special

04:39.112 --> 04:40.813 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
counsel.

04:40.847 --> 04:43.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, let's dig
into some of
these main headlines from
today's hearing

04:43.249 --> 04:44.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
now with our own Lisa
Desjardins.

04:44.951 --> 04:47.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She was in the hearing room
today.

04:47.654 --> 04:49.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our John Yang was at the White
House.

04:49.155 --> 04:51.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in a moment, we will be
joined by Matt
Apuzzo.

04:51.457 --> 04:55.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's been reporting all this --
on all this
for The New York Times.

04:55.194 --> 04:57.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Yang, I'm going to come to
you first.

04:57.196 --> 05:02.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The president's personal
attorney was out
today with the president's
response.

05:02.335 --> 05:04.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tell us about that and about
what the White
House is saying.

05:04.671 --> 05:06.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That's right, Judy.

05:06.472 --> 05:09.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, we didn't hear from
the president
himself or from any White House
official.

05:09.275 --> 05:13.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have delegated that task of
responding
to all these inquiries to the
president's

05:13.746 --> 05:16.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
personal attorney, as you say,
Marc Kasowitz.

05:16.349 --> 05:21.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He flatly denied that the
president asked
Comey either for his loyalty or
to drop the

05:21.888 --> 05:23.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Flynn investigation.

05:23.723 --> 05:27.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then he said something that
I'm told we're
going to be hearing a lot more
of over the

05:27.260 --> 05:30.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
coming days from supporters of
the president.

05:30.663 --> 05:36.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He used Comey's admission that
he got his
version of events into the
press, he used

05:36.402 --> 05:41.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that to try to undermine Comey,
to try to
portray Comey as part of what
Mr. Trump supporters

05:41.941 --> 05:49.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see as a conspiracy among
Washington, entrenched
Washington insiders, what they
call the deep

05:49.182 --> 05:53.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
state, a conspiracy to try to
get Mr. Trump
out of the White House.

05:53.419 --> 05:58.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ÑMD-BO ÑMARC KASOWITZ, Attorney
for Donald
Trump: Contrary to numerous
false press accounts

05:58.324 --> 06:05.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leading up to today's hearing,
Mr. Comey has
now finally confirmed publicly
what he repeatedly

06:05.998 --> 06:14.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
told President Trump privately,
that is that
the president was not under
investigation

06:14.340 --> 06:17.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as part of any probe into
Russian interference.

06:17.410 --> 06:24.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is overwhelmingly clear that
there have
been and continue to be those in
government

06:25.017 --> 06:32.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are actively attempting to
undermine this
administration with selective
and illegal

06:32.992 --> 06:38.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leaks of classified information
and privileged
communications.

06:38.765 --> 06:43.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Comey has now admitted that
he is one
of these leakers.

06:44.003 --> 06:49.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, John, you're
saying that
the president's attorney is
suggesting that

06:49.842 --> 06:52.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this is part of a much larger
effort?

06:52.078 --> 06:57.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: This is something
that the president's
supporters have been talking
about, and the

06:57.550 --> 07:01.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president's -- and inside the
White House,
people like Steve Bannon have
been talking

07:01.087 --> 07:06.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about -- that entrenched
Washington bureaucrats,
as they say, what they call the
deep state,

07:06.926 --> 07:12.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is trying to get the president
out with these
leaks, not only on this case,
but on other

07:12.398 --> 07:15.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things about -- involving
intelligence throughout
the government.

07:16.002 --> 07:21.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a matter of fact, just this
afternoon,
another fund-raising appeal went
out to the

07:21.307 --> 07:27.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president's supporters from his
campaign asking
for money using not the specific
Comey testimony,

07:27.580 --> 07:33.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but using this idea of the deep
state trying
to get the president out to --
as part of

07:33.653 --> 07:35.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their fund-raising appeal.

07:35.388 --> 07:38.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we know there
were ads
being run by some of the
president's supporters

07:38.825 --> 07:43.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in advance of this hearing
critical of Director
Comey.

07:43.362 --> 07:45.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins at the Capitol,
let me turn
to you now.

07:45.698 --> 07:47.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You had a chance -- you were in
the hearing
room.

07:47.500 --> 07:51.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have had a chance to talk to
some of the
senators after the public
hearing.

07:51.404 --> 07:54.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, of course, that was
followed by a closed
hearing.

07:54.340 --> 07:57.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are they telling you about
their reaction
to what they heard today?

07:57.043 --> 07:59.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, Judy,
this was an extraordinary
hearing.

07:59.078 --> 08:06.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I counted 259 questions in just
over two-and-a-half-hours
to Mr. Comey, and after all of
that, in the

08:06.352 --> 08:10.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
end, Judy, I have to say,
overall, I came
away with a feeling from
senators that they

08:10.923 --> 08:14.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are moving in a more bipartisan
direction
than they were a couple weeks
ago.

08:14.527 --> 08:19.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were very few senators who
were willing
to take sides on this debate
between Mr. Comey

08:19.332 --> 08:23.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and President Trump and his
attorney, not
willing to say yet who they
believe in that

08:23.603 --> 08:25.371 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fight.

08:25.404 --> 08:28.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mostly, they're deferring to Mr.
Mueller and
the upcoming -- his special
investigation.

08:28.641 --> 08:30.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There were a few partisan hits.

08:30.476 --> 08:34.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chuck Schumer, Democratic leader
in the Senate,
took to the floor and said the
clouds over

08:34.580 --> 08:36.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the White House have become
darker.

08:36.616 --> 08:42.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, we have Roy
Blunt of Missouri,
Republican, who said he felt
that today the

08:42.488 --> 08:44.757 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
president did better than worse.

08:44.790 --> 08:51.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And another sign of that, Judy,
talking to
Ron Wyden, Democrat, who is one
of the president's

08:51.430 --> 08:55.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sharpest critics, when asked
about the idea
of obstruction of justice and
what he thought

08:55.434 --> 08:59.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
came from this hearing today on
that front,
he said, to him, obstruction of
justice is

08:59.906 --> 09:01.541 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a lawyer's term.

09:01.574 --> 09:04.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He thought there was instead a
pattern of
abuse of power.

09:04.477 --> 09:08.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What that told me, Judy, was
that they didn't
feel that they made any ground
on that case

09:08.781 --> 09:10.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for obstruction of justice.

09:10.650 --> 09:14.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Lisa, just
to follow up,
when you say your sense is that
the senators,

09:14.120 --> 09:17.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
members of Congress may be
moving in a more
bipartisan fashion, why?

09:17.890 --> 09:23.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Senator after
senator, including
Republicans like Marco Rubio,
Democrats like

09:23.195 --> 09:29.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark Warner, who about a month
ago seemed
to be at odds with each other
even about direction,

09:29.268 --> 09:33.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and including Chairman Burr --
there were
accusations even within the
Intelligence Committee,

09:33.906 --> 09:36.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even on the Senate side -- I
don't hear that
anymore.

09:36.375 --> 09:40.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, I hear all these
senators in a more
unified voice saying they want
to answer these

09:40.513 --> 09:41.480 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
questions later.

09:41.514 --> 09:43.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're not going to make
conclusions yet.

09:43.449 --> 09:45.184 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're withholding judgment.

09:45.217 --> 09:48.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're also unified on the idea
that they
need more information from the
intelligence

09:48.421 --> 09:50.189 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
chief.

09:50.222 --> 09:52.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for news on that, Judy, I'm
told by the
chairman of the Intelligence
Committee, Mr.

09:52.758 --> 09:58.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Burr, that they are planning to
have a hearing,
probably next week he says,
closed-doors,

09:58.531 --> 10:01.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with those intelligence chiefs,
who they feel
didn't answer their questions
yesterday.

10:01.968 --> 10:03.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, Lisa.

10:03.803 --> 10:09.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we are also joined by Matt
Apuzzo, reporter
for The New York Times who broke
many of the

10:09.108 --> 10:13.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stories that frankly led up to
what we have
seen today.

10:13.412 --> 10:18.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Matt, you have done -- you have
spent so much
time looking into all of this.

10:18.217 --> 10:23.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How did what Director Comey,
former Director
Comey, had to say today square
with what you

10:23.756 --> 10:25.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
had learned beforehand?

10:25.458 --> 10:29.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT APUZZO, The New York Times:
Well, we
had known obviously a lot of
these individual

10:29.795 --> 10:36.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meanings that Comey and Trump
had been having
in the several months that
Trump's been in

10:36.302 --> 10:38.004 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
office.

10:38.037 --> 10:40.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have known about those, but
hearing it
from the FBI director, who
frankly has been

10:40.940 --> 10:46.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really good in Senate testimony
over the years
-- some of the Senate staff
jokingly call

10:46.178 --> 10:50.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him Senator Comey, because he's
really -- he
does a really good job.

10:50.850 --> 10:53.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But this was a an unusual bit
for Comey.

10:53.285 --> 11:00.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was obviously untethered and
unrestrained
by the limitations of a
bureaucratic job now

11:00.526 --> 11:02.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that he's a private citizen.

11:02.261 --> 11:09.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we saw him more -- we saw a
more emotional,
frankly, blunt former FBI
director.

11:09.101 --> 11:14.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Any time somebody in Washington
says the word
lie, you know they're taking the
gloves off,

11:14.840 --> 11:17.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because everybody likes to
soft-pedal that
word around here.

11:17.143 --> 11:19.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Matt, one
other thing
I want to ask you about quickly.

11:19.612 --> 11:22.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that is, there was a
reference during
the hearing.

11:22.848 --> 11:27.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Director Comey was asked about a
piece that
you and two other The New York
Times reporters

11:27.453 --> 11:28.521 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wrote.

11:28.554 --> 11:30.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It appeared back in February, on
February
the 14th.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT APUZZO: Yes.

11:32.425 --> 11:36.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It was really the
first report
of extensive contacts between
the people around

11:36.896 --> 11:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then-candidate Donald Trump and
Russian officials.

11:41.133 --> 11:47.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We heard James Comey today say
that he didn't
think that there was much
accurate in the

11:47.573 --> 11:48.541 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
article.

11:48.574 --> 11:50.409 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's your version of that?

11:50.443 --> 11:53.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT APUZZO: Yes, it's obviously
very hard
to sort of get in a
back-and-forth on classified

11:53.713 --> 11:59.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
information with a former FBI
director, especially
when he won't say what's
inaccurate.

11:59.151 --> 12:04.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The main point of the story, as
you said,
was that there were repeated
contacts between

12:04.223 --> 12:08.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
members of Trump's campaign and
people tied
to Russian intelligence.

12:08.994 --> 12:11.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, frankly, we only know more
about that
now.

12:11.964 --> 12:13.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We know Carter Page.

12:13.733 --> 12:19.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know Jared Kushner was
meeting with, you
know, Sergey Gorkov from VEB.

12:19.138 --> 12:22.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know about a meeting in the
Seychelles.

12:22.675 --> 12:25.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know all of these meetings
that happened.

12:25.111 --> 12:30.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know Stone is talking to
Guccifer 2.0,
who is a front for Russian
intelligence.

12:30.883 --> 12:34.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it's hard -- that part, we
know is true.

12:34.120 --> 12:38.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's hard to say what he's --
what he is taking
an issue with, whether he's
splitting hair

12:38.657 --> 12:43.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on whether it's a Russian
intelligence officer
or Russian intelligence agent,
or whether

12:43.262 --> 12:48.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's saying the -- we said -- we
attributed
this to intercepts and call
logs, whether

12:48.701 --> 12:51.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he is saying, no, no, no, it
wasn't intercepts
and call logs, it was human
intelligence.

12:51.570 --> 12:54.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it's hard to get into that
back-and-forth.

12:54.073 --> 12:55.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're going to continue
reporting.

12:55.307 --> 12:58.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We did a story on this today.

12:58.177 --> 13:02.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And doing this stuff, you want
to try to be
as transparent as possible.

13:02.848 --> 13:04.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For sure.

13:05.017 --> 13:09.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Matt Apuzzo with The New York
Times, thank
you for that.

13:09.288 --> 13:15.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Yang at the White House,
Lisa Desjardins
at the Capitol, thank you, all
three.

13:15.361 --> 13:19.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now let's get some analysis
from four
people with extensive experience
in government

13:19.732 --> 13:21.467 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and the law.

13:21.500 --> 13:26.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
George Terwilliger served as
deputy attorney
general under President George
H.W. Bush.

13:26.372 --> 13:30.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Greg Craig, former White House
counsel to
President Obama and President
Clinton, where

13:31.010 --> 13:35.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he led the team defending Mr.
Clinton against
impeachment.

13:35.114 --> 13:39.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Carlin served as assistant
attorney general
for national security at the
Department of

13:39.718 --> 13:44.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Justice from 2014 until October
of last year.

13:44.056 --> 13:50.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Carrie Cordero served in the
Justice Department
under Presidents George W. Bush
and Obama,

13:50.229 --> 13:53.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where she worked on matters of
national security.

13:53.299 --> 13:55.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we thank all four of you for
being here.

13:55.601 --> 14:00.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're going to take a closer
look now
at some of the revelations today
from these

14:00.840 --> 14:05.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hearings, beginning -- we have
already a little
bit of what was said.

14:05.044 --> 14:10.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I want to look now at what
Director Comey
said he couldn't talk about
publicly.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this starts with a question
from the committee
chairman, Senator Burr.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.854 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:14.887 --> 14:19.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RICHARD BURR (R), North
Carolina: In the public
domain is this question of the
Steele dossier,

14:19.592 --> 14:25.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a document that has been around
out in for
over a year.

14:25.397 --> 14:29.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not sure when the FBI first
took possession
of it, but the media had it
before you had

14:29.735 --> 14:32.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it and we had it.

14:32.504 --> 14:39.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the time of your departure
from the FBI,
was the FBI able to confirm any
criminal allegations

14:39.845 --> 14:41.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
contained in the steel document?

14:41.680 --> 14:44.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAMES COMEY, Former FBI
Director: Mr. Chairman,
I don't think that's a question
I can answer

14:44.617 --> 14:48.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in an open setting because it
goes into the
details of the investigation.

14:48.153 --> 14:49.922 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:49.955 --> 14:54.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD BURR: And when you read
the dossier,
what was your reaction, given
that it was

14:54.894 --> 14:57.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
100 percent directed at the
president-elect?

14:57.630 --> 15:00.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: Not a question I
can answer in
open setting, Mr. Chairman.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.034 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RON WYDEN (D), Oregon: Let me
turn to the
attorney general.

15:03.836 --> 15:10.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In your statement, you said that
you and the
FBI leadership team decided not
to discuss

15:10.142 --> 15:17.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president's actions with
Attorney General
Sessions, even though he had not
recused himself.

15:17.650 --> 15:24.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What was it about the attorney
general's interactions
with the Russians or his
behavior with regard

15:24.857 --> 15:32.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the investigation that would
have led the
entire leadership of the FBI to
make this

15:32.064 --> 15:33.799 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
decision?

15:33.832 --> 15:38.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: Well, our judgment,
as I recall,
is that he was very close to and
inevitably

15:38.771 --> 15:44.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to recuse himself for a
variety of reasons.

15:44.076 --> 15:48.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We also were aware of facts that
I can't discuss
in an opening setting that would
make his

15:48.714 --> 15:52.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
continued engagement in a
Russia-related investigation
problematic.

15:52.084 --> 15:53.886 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:53.919 --> 15:59.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RON WYDEN: How would you
characterize Attorney
General Sessions's adherence to
his recusal,

15:59.658 --> 16:06.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in particular, with regard to
his involvement
in your firing, which the
president has acknowledged

16:06.432 --> 16:09.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was because of the Russian
investigation?

16:09.068 --> 16:12.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: That's a question I
can't answer.

16:12.237 --> 16:14.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it is a reasonable
question.

16:14.306 --> 16:19.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If, as the president said, I was
fired because
of the Russia investigation, why
was the attorney

16:19.178 --> 16:20.245 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
general involved in that chain?

16:20.279 --> 16:21.313 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

16:21.347 --> 16:22.982 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so I don't have an answer
for the question.

16:23.015 --> 16:24.883 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:24.917 --> 16:27.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM COTTON (R), Arkansas: Let's
turn our attention
to the underlying activity at
issue here.

16:27.686 --> 16:32.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia's hacking of those
e-mails and the
allegation of collusion.

16:32.758 --> 16:35.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you think Donald Trump
colluded with Russia?

16:35.394 --> 16:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: That's a question I
don't think
I should answer in an opening
setting.

16:40.799 --> 16:47.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As I said, when I left, we did
not have an
investigation focused on
President Trump.

16:47.172 --> 16:50.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that's a question that will
be answered
by the investigation, I think.

16:50.242 --> 16:53.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: George
Terwilliger, you have
been hearing all of this.

16:53.479 --> 16:58.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you take away from the
fact that the
former FBI director says he
can't get into

16:58.550 --> 17:00.386 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those areas?

17:00.419 --> 17:03.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE TERWILLIGER, Former U.S.
Deputy Attorney
General: I'm saddened by this
entire spectacle

17:03.288 --> 17:11.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we saw today, and really
going back to
last July, beginning with the
original speech

17:11.096 --> 17:17.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the then-director on the
Hillary Clinton
e-mail case, and up to today.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why?

17:19.171 --> 17:23.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE TERWILLIGER: There is a
thrusting that
results from this of the Justice
Department

17:23.475 --> 17:32.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the FBI into the middle of
political affairs
that seems to follow Mr. Comey
around.

17:32.117 --> 17:42.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's become kind of a one-man
wrecking ball
as to accusations and
recriminations against

17:42.094 --> 17:49.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
several other major government
figures, candidates,
presidents, attorneys general.

17:49.234 --> 17:52.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I hope that all of this will
get dialed
back.

17:52.237 --> 17:58.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would much rather see the
Intelligence Committee
and Bob Mueller continue their
investigations

17:58.243 --> 18:01.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and come to some conclusions,
and then let's
talk publicly.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Greg Craig, a
one-man wrecking
ball?

18:03.382 --> 18:08.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ÑMD-BO ÑGREGORY CRAIG, Former
White House
Counsel: Well, I think, if he'd
had the choice,

18:08.153 --> 18:10.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Director Comey would have
preferred not to
have been fired.

18:10.923 --> 18:16.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think it's hard to blame
his being thrust
into the forefront of this
discussion and

18:16.428 --> 18:19.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this debate because he was
fired.

18:19.331 --> 18:22.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that was the decision of
President Trump.

18:22.301 --> 18:26.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's the core issue of
obstruction,
George, it seems to me, whether
the firing

18:26.772 --> 18:33.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was the product of a decision to
try to end
the investigation by the
president or not.

18:33.812 --> 18:39.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the meaning, Judy,
of what happened
today was, you got testimony
about exchanges

18:39.651 --> 18:46.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between the director of the FBI
and the president
of the United States that give
you flavor

18:46.225 --> 18:53.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and texture and information
about what went
into the decision to fire Mr.
Comey, which

18:53.365 --> 18:55.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is the obstruction in this case.

18:55.100 --> 18:59.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Carrie Cordero,
and what about
just specifically on those three
answers,

18:59.471 --> 19:02.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sets of answers that Mr. Comey
gave?

19:02.841 --> 19:06.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, should we read something
nefarious
into that?

19:06.245 --> 19:08.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ÑMD-BO ÑCARRIE CORDERO, Former
Justice
Department Official: Well, so, I
do have a

19:08.046 --> 19:12.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
slightly different take, which
is that the
number of times that former
Director Comey

19:12.451 --> 19:17.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was referring to items that
could not be discussed
in open session alludes to the
fact that there

19:17.823 --> 19:22.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is an ongoing investigation, and
there's a
whole bunch of classified stuff
and classified

19:22.494 --> 19:25.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investigation that's taking
place that he
could only feel comfortable and
would only

19:25.697 --> 19:28.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be appropriate to discuss in a
closed session.

19:28.667 --> 19:33.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what wasn't part of the
clips, but what
he also said in his testimony
today is that,

19:33.405 --> 19:37.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unequivocally, there was Russian
interference
in the election.

19:37.042 --> 19:42.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with all this soap opera
related back
and forth that we focus on so
much, I feel

19:42.548 --> 19:46.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like that aspect sometimes gets
lost, that
there really was Russian
interference, and

19:46.818 --> 19:50.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
former Director Comey was
absolutely crystal
clear about that fact today.

19:50.589 --> 19:54.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And he -- in
effect, he was
confirming what the president
himself, John

19:54.126 --> 19:56.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Carlin, has been saying in all
this.

19:56.395 --> 20:00.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, again, getting back to
this, and particularly
on the attorney general, when he
was asked

20:00.265 --> 20:03.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the attorney general's
role in this,
he said, there are aspects of
that I can't

20:03.869 --> 20:04.836 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
talk about here.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How are we to read that?

20:06.805 --> 20:09.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CARLIN, Former Justice
Department Official:
Well, there's three, I think,
possibilities,

20:09.174 --> 20:12.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
three areas that he would be
very careful
not to testify about in public.

20:13.011 --> 20:16.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One would be if it's classified
information,
if it's collected through
sensitive sources

20:16.648 --> 20:17.616 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and methods.

20:17.649 --> 20:19.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's what they do in a closed
hearing.

20:19.418 --> 20:23.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Number two, information that was
collected
through the grand jury process.

20:23.522 --> 20:26.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But number three in this
instance would be
if he thought it would interfere
with the

20:26.959 --> 20:32.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ability of the special counsel,
Bob Mueller,
my former boss, to conduct his
investigation.

20:32.598 --> 20:38.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's unclear here which
of the three
buckets that it might fall into,
but any time

20:38.070 --> 20:40.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he says that, that's what I'm
thinking in
my head.

20:40.038 --> 20:41.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's fallen into one of those
three areas.

20:41.673 --> 20:45.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, let's
look now at
another exchange that was
notable.

20:45.477 --> 20:48.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here's Democratic Senator Dianne
Feinstein
of California.

20:48.247 --> 20:53.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She's asking Comey about
President Trump's
request to drop the criminal
investigation

20:53.819 --> 20:56.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
into his former National
Security Adviser
Michael Flynn.

20:56.121 --> 20:57.389 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:57.422 --> 20:58.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D),
California: Now, here's
the question.

20:58.890 --> 21:00.092 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You're big.

21:00.125 --> 21:01.693 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You're strong.

21:01.727 --> 21:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know the Oval Office, and I
know what happens
to people when they walk in.

21:08.166 --> 21:10.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is a certain amount of
intimidation.

21:11.003 --> 21:16.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But why didn't you stop and say,
Mr. President,
this is wrong, I cannot discuss
this with

21:16.842 --> 21:17.809 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you?

21:17.843 --> 21:19.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: It's a great
question.

21:19.044 --> 21:21.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maybe, if I were stronger, I
would have.

21:21.980 --> 21:29.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I was so stunned by the
conversation that
I just took it in.

21:29.888 --> 21:33.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the only thing I could think
to say, because
I was playing in my mind --
because I could

21:33.191 --> 21:38.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remember every word he said -- I
was playing
in my mind, what should my
response be?

21:38.563 --> 21:40.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's why I very carefully
chose the words.

21:40.599 --> 21:42.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Look, I've seen the tweet about
tapes.

21:42.567 --> 21:44.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lordy, I hope there are tapes.

21:45.003 --> 21:50.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I remember saying, "I agree he
is a good guy,"
as a way of saying, I'm not
agreeing with

21:50.942 --> 21:52.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what you just asked me to do."

21:52.944 --> 21:56.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, maybe other people would
be stronger
in that circumstance.

21:56.214 --> 21:59.851 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that was -- that's how I
conducted myself.

21:59.885 --> 22:01.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I hope I'll never have another
opportunity.

22:01.286 --> 22:03.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maybe, if I did it again, I'd do
it better.

22:03.455 --> 22:07.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you --
Carrie Cordero,
listening to that, how did he
handle that?

22:07.993 --> 22:12.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARRIE CORDERO: The difficulty
is that there
really was, at least from the
way that the

22:12.364 --> 22:16.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
former director testified today,
he felt like
there was nobody else that he
could go to

22:16.601 --> 22:19.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the administration to talk to
about this.

22:19.071 --> 22:25.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He had Attorney General
Sessions, who is somehow
implicated in the investigation
in some way,

22:25.477 --> 22:27.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the extent that he would have
to be recused.

22:27.779 --> 22:33.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the president who, as
the FBI director
in his executive capacity, he
does have to

22:33.819 --> 22:38.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
provide him with information if
the president
asks for it.

22:38.190 --> 22:43.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he was in a position, I
think, where there
was nobody else that he could
really discuss

22:43.895 --> 22:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this with, given the lack of
confirmed leadership
positions in the Department of
Justice at

22:48.934 --> 22:55.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the time, and given the fact
that he is directly
reporting to the attorney
general and ultimately

22:55.874 --> 22:57.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the president.

22:57.142 --> 22:59.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: George
Terwilliger, how do
you read this?

22:59.277 --> 23:03.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have the senator saying, why
didn't he
just speak up in the moment?

23:03.548 --> 23:05.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GEORGE TERWILLIGER: Exactly.

23:05.150 --> 23:10.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, frankly, I can't buy the
argument that
there was no one he could go to.

23:10.122 --> 23:16.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dana Boente, a career assistant
United States
attorney and United States
attorney, an Obama

23:16.728 --> 23:17.696 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
appointee...

23:17.729 --> 23:19.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Who was then
acting...

23:19.664 --> 23:22.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE TERWILLIGER: ... was the
acting deputy
attorney general at the time,
and was perfectly

23:22.734 --> 23:25.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
available for Mr. Comey to talk
to.

23:25.203 --> 23:29.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Comey had served with Dana when
Dana was a
United States attorney for
several years.

23:29.708 --> 23:32.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, I don't buy that
explanation.

23:32.944 --> 23:38.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's part of a pattern of
Mr. Comey resorting
to self-help because he feels
like he's the

23:38.884 --> 23:46.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lone ranger who is out there
carrying the
sword of righteousness forward.

23:46.792 --> 23:51.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jim has served this country
honorably for
a very long time, but I really
think, Judy,

23:51.897 --> 23:57.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he made some mistakes last July
when he usurped
the function of the Department
of Justice

23:57.569 --> 24:01.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in deciding about the Hillary
Clinton e-mail
case.

24:01.273 --> 24:05.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He made a major mistake at that
time in, in
essence, indicting Hillary
Clinton in the

24:05.744 --> 24:10.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
court of public opinion, and
everything since
then has flowed the wrong way.

24:10.449 --> 24:13.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
that continuum,
John Carlin?

24:13.151 --> 24:20.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CARLIN: Well, look, if
true, it's hard
to even describe how unusual it
would be for

24:21.026 --> 24:24.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a president of the United
States, whether
it's President Bush or President
Obama, to

24:24.996 --> 24:29.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a meeting, order everyone
out of the
room, leave the FBI director in
the room,

24:29.468 --> 24:36.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a private conversation with
him, and
essentially say, can you end an
investigation

24:36.041 --> 24:38.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into someone who used to work
for me?

24:38.276 --> 24:42.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I can't -- we didn't --
there was no situation
that came even close.

24:42.314 --> 24:47.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If someone from the White House
called over
to the FBI and said that they
wanted the director

24:47.219 --> 24:52.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to come to the White House with
full staff,
that would cause huge
consternation, calls

24:52.591 --> 24:55.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the department, coordination,
lawyers.

24:55.393 --> 25:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I can see in that context
being shell-shocked,
he's described.

25:00.999 --> 25:06.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it's true, I think that that
would be a
serious moment about the
separation between

25:06.738 --> 25:11.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our Department of Justice, the
ability to
conduct investigations free from
political

25:11.142 --> 25:12.410 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
interference.

25:12.444 --> 25:14.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a principle that's been
strongly shared
by both parties.

25:14.579 --> 25:17.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it's important to figure out
whether that
happened.

25:17.382 --> 25:21.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Greg Craig, how
else could
he have handled it, or was there
another way?

25:21.453 --> 25:27.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREGORY CRAIG: Well, I have to
say, it's hard
for me to blame Jim Comey, when
the president

25:27.592 --> 25:29.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
puts him in that situation.

25:29.294 --> 25:33.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's really -- I agree with
you, John, that's
a very unusual situation.

25:33.465 --> 25:38.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The director comes over prepared
to talk about
topics A, B, C, D, and E with a
group of other

25:38.803 --> 25:44.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people, and then suddenly it
turns into a
topic that's really toxic and
dangerous, and

25:44.943 --> 25:46.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's there by himself with the
president.

25:47.012 --> 25:53.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, first of all, I'm
sympathetic, and I'm
willing to be somewhat more
forgiving of Jim

25:53.618 --> 25:57.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Comey because he's in that
situation, which
is unprecedented and unexpected.

25:57.923 --> 26:03.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we can't --
I'm trying
to think of another moment that
we know of

26:03.595 --> 26:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where a president called in an
FBI director
and had this kind of a
conversation.

26:07.799 --> 26:12.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE TERWILLIGER: Judy, I
think one of the
things we have to keep in mind
is the concept

26:12.470 --> 26:18.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the independence of FBI from
the authority
of the attorney general and
indeed from the

26:18.843 --> 26:26.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president is not quite the
premise that some
believe and that perhaps Jim
Comey operated

26:26.518 --> 26:28.320 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

26:28.353 --> 26:32.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you think back to the days of
J. Edgar
Hoover, J. Edgar Hoover had a
lot of independence

26:32.524 --> 26:37.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the Justice Department and
from presidents,
and it resulted in a very
unhealthy situation.

26:37.362 --> 26:40.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, in fact,
Comey raised
the name of J. Edgar Hoover
today.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GEORGE TERWILLIGER: I heard
that.

26:42.334 --> 26:45.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, perhaps the
biggest question,
one of the biggest questions
swirling around,

26:45.870 --> 26:51.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has the president or have other
White House
officials in any way obstructed
justice?

26:51.042 --> 26:53.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have had that question raised
here.

26:53.411 --> 26:56.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's listen to how a couple of
senators pressed
Comey on that point today.

26:56.715 --> 26:58.483 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

26:58.516 --> 27:00.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE MANCHIN (D), West Virginia:
Do you believe
there were any tapes or
recordings of your

27:00.652 --> 27:02.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
conversation with the president?

27:02.287 --> 27:04.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: It never occurred
to me until
the president's tweet.

27:04.756 --> 27:05.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm not being facetious.

27:05.757 --> 27:06.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I hope there are.

27:06.758 --> 27:07.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I will consent to the
release of...

27:07.759 --> 27:09.361 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

27:09.394 --> 27:10.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE MANCHIN: So, both of you are
-- both of
you are in the same findings
here.

27:11.029 --> 27:13.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You both hope there's tapes and
recordings?

27:13.932 --> 27:17.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: Well all I can do
is hope.

27:17.502 --> 27:19.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president surely knows if he
taped me.

27:19.871 --> 27:22.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And if he did, my feelings
aren't hurt.

27:22.173 --> 27:23.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Release the entire -- release
all the tapes.

27:23.742 --> 27:24.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm good with it.

27:24.743 --> 27:26.144 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

27:26.177 --> 27:26.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOE MANCHIN: Do you believe this
will rise
to obstruction of justice?

27:26.811 --> 27:28.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: I don't know.

27:28.546 --> 27:30.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's Bob Mueller's job to sort
that out.

27:30.215 --> 27:31.883 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

27:31.916 --> 27:34.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN HEINRICH (D), New Mexico:
A lot of
this comes down to, who should
we believe?

27:34.185 --> 27:38.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you want to say anything as
to why we should
believe you?

27:38.523 --> 27:44.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: My mother raised me
not to say
things like this about myself,
so I'm not

27:44.996 --> 27:46.798 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going to.

27:46.831 --> 27:50.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think people should look at
the whole body
of my testimony, because, as I
used to say

27:50.268 --> 27:53.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to juries, when I talked about a
witness,
you can't cherry-pick it.

27:53.538 --> 27:58.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can't say, I like these
things he said,
but, on this, he's a dirty,
rotten liar.

27:58.209 --> 27:59.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have got to take it all
together.

27:59.611 --> 28:03.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I've tried to be open and
fair and transparent
and accurate.

28:03.515 --> 28:09.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A really significant fact to me
is, so why
did he kick everybody out of the
Oval Office?

28:09.154 --> 28:14.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why would you kick the attorney
general, the
president, the chief of staff
out to talk

28:14.092 --> 28:17.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to me if it was about something
else?

28:17.629 --> 28:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so that, to me, as an
investigator, is
a very significant fact.

28:22.333 --> 28:26.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Greg Craig,
are we any
closer to knowing whether the
president in

28:26.805 --> 28:29.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
any way committed obstruction of
justice in
here?

28:29.441 --> 28:32.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREGORY CRAIG: I think he's on
very, very
thin ice.

28:32.577 --> 28:38.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, I think you have
got a credible,
plausible, believable witness in
Jim Comey.

28:38.249 --> 28:41.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you were betting between
a swearing
match between the president of
the United

28:41.486 --> 28:43.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States and Jim Comey, my money
would be on
Comey.

28:43.988 --> 28:51.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most jurors, most prosecutors
would give him
a good deal of faith in the
truth of his testimony.

28:51.663 --> 28:58.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secondly, the real issue here
when it comes
to a criminal prosecution is
whether he falls

28:58.970 --> 29:05.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
within a Title 18 United States
Code provision
that almost word for word
describes what some

29:05.744 --> 29:09.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people would think Donald Trump
has engaged
in.

29:09.080 --> 29:14.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And most prosecutors that had
that kind of
evidence against an individual
wouldn't hesitate

29:14.285 --> 29:15.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to bring a prosecution.

29:15.520 --> 29:19.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is, I believe, right now an
indictable
offense.

29:19.357 --> 29:24.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's no way in which you
can bring
that kind of case against a
sitting president,

29:24.129 --> 29:29.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so then you move to the question
of whether
this conduct rises to the level
of an impeachable

29:29.601 --> 29:34.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
offense, because that's the
exclusive way
that the Constitution lays out
for limiting

29:34.773 --> 29:38.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or removing the power of a
president, a sitting
president.

29:38.042 --> 29:39.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is that how
you're thinking
about this, Carrie Cordero?

29:39.811 --> 29:43.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARRIE CORDERO: Well, I think,
certainly,
there is a difference between
the criminal

29:43.281 --> 29:46.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
aspect, and what this is
actually going to
move to is whether or not
obstruction can

29:46.951 --> 29:48.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be found as a political matter.

29:48.753 --> 29:53.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think the other piece is
that I think
observers are looking for what's
the one act

29:53.758 --> 29:55.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that is going to make the
obstruction case?

29:55.660 --> 29:59.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, when they look at
this, what
we're going to find is, there's
a timeline

29:59.063 --> 30:00.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and there's a series of events.

30:00.932 --> 30:02.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was some of the
conversations.

30:02.500 --> 30:04.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was the dinner meeting.

30:04.202 --> 30:09.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was the will you be loyal to
me at the
same time of discussing job
security.

30:09.374 --> 30:13.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was the tweets, some of the
tweets that
exposed the investigation.

30:13.044 --> 30:14.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was the firing.

30:14.479 --> 30:18.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then it was the tweet sort
of threatening
that there are tapes.

30:18.983 --> 30:21.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think when people look
back at this,
they're going to look and
they're going to

30:21.386 --> 30:26.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
find a timeline that will
eventually move
towards the political
consideration of obstruction.

30:26.224 --> 30:28.126 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

30:28.159 --> 30:30.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREGORY CRAIG: Can I just add
that the president
of the United States has also
said that the

30:30.228 --> 30:33.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reason he fired Comey was
because of the Russian...

30:33.164 --> 30:37.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE TERWILLIGER: And that's
perfectly legal,
because the president can't
obstruct justice

30:37.869 --> 30:43.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by telling the director of the
FBI to do or
not do a particular
investigation.

30:43.241 --> 30:44.676 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a unitary executive.

30:44.709 --> 30:46.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president is in charge of
the executive.

30:46.177 --> 30:47.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What does unitary
executive
mean?

30:48.012 --> 30:51.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE TERWILLIGER: It means
that the entire
branch of government is embodied
in one person,

30:51.749 --> 30:53.218 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and that's the president.

30:53.251 --> 30:58.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the president can give
direction as to
what should happen with cases.

30:58.256 --> 31:05.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Carrie raises just the right
point, that
the resolution of the issue of
-- if there

31:05.463 --> 31:08.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
is an issue about the
president's action is
political, not legal.

31:08.833 --> 31:12.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The talk of obstruction of
justice as a legal
matter is meaningless.

31:12.704 --> 31:15.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It might make for an interesting
academic
debate.

31:15.673 --> 31:22.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president cannot obstruct
justice by telling
the director of the FBI, stop
that investigation.

31:22.180 --> 31:26.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There may be grand political
consequences
to doing so, but there's no
legal consequences.

31:26.618 --> 31:30.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Greg -- we
just heard Greg
say you then move on to the
question of impeachment.

31:30.388 --> 31:35.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, John Carlin, what about --
is obstruction
of justice as a question still
on the table?

31:36.027 --> 31:39.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN CARLIN: Look, the -- it's
an important
question.

31:39.664 --> 31:43.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The referral or saying it's in
the hands of
the special counsel in that
sense isn't quite

31:43.902 --> 31:45.770 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right.

31:45.803 --> 31:48.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what the special counsel
could do and
approach it like a prosecutor
and an investigator

31:48.573 --> 31:54.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and say, is there a corrupt
intent when the
act was taken?

31:54.445 --> 31:56.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here, the act would be the
firing.

31:56.214 --> 32:00.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I disagree with George on
whether or not that
would constitute the criminal
offense.

32:00.752 --> 32:05.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The guidance -- the Justice
Department guidance
says not that you can't commit a
crime as

32:05.924 --> 32:08.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president, but that you can't be
indicted
while you're the sitting
president.

32:08.793 --> 32:11.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So they could build out the
facts.

32:11.062 --> 32:13.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They could make out the elements
of the case.

32:13.331 --> 32:18.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then I do agree what there
has been less
focus on is, what happens with
the special

32:18.870 --> 32:20.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
counsel's report?

32:20.672 --> 32:23.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under the old statute, you knew
that would
go to Congress with a referral
if they thought

32:23.341 --> 32:24.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a crime would be committed.

32:24.976 --> 32:27.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Under the current terms, it
actually is not
clear.

32:27.312 --> 32:31.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the end of the day, the
acting attorney
general, which is Rod
Rosenstein, needs to

32:31.616 --> 32:32.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
make a report to Congress.

32:32.750 --> 32:34.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's in that report isn't
clear.

32:34.352 --> 32:35.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: George, you shook
your head.

32:35.353 --> 32:36.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GEORGE TERWILLIGER: Yes.

32:36.354 --> 32:38.056 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

32:38.089 --> 32:39.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE TERWILLIGER: It's not a
matter of Justice
Department guidance or
procedure.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's the Constitution.

32:42.860 --> 32:46.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Constitution places the
president in charge
of the executive branch.

32:46.631 --> 32:51.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not trying to defend the
decision, but
the fact of the matter is, the
president has

32:51.235 --> 32:57.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
complete and utter legal
authority to fire
the director of the FBI,
including for pursuing

32:57.108 --> 32:58.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a particular investigation.

32:58.943 --> 33:03.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, we're
going to leave
it here, as we look at this
final piece of

33:03.648 --> 33:05.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tape from today's hearing.

33:05.550 --> 33:09.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia and the president were
not the only
subject that made news today.

33:09.687 --> 33:14.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senators again questioned
Director -- former
Director Comey about his
handling of the investigation

33:14.592 --> 33:20.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into Hillary Clinton's e-mail
and what pushed
him to take the unusual step to
discuss it

33:20.098 --> 33:22.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
publicly last summer, which you
all have brought
up.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here, again, committee Chair
Senator Richard
Burr.

33:24.135 --> 33:25.870 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

33:25.903 --> 33:35.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD BURR: Let me go back, if
I can, very
briefly to the decision to
publicly go out

33:36.014 --> 33:39.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with your results on the e-mail.

33:39.417 --> 33:45.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Was your decision influenced by
the attorney
general's tarmac meeting with
the former president,

33:45.089 --> 33:46.057 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Bill Clinton?

33:46.090 --> 33:47.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES COMEY: Yes.

33:47.859 --> 33:52.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In, ultimately, a conclusive
way, that was
the thing that capped it for me
that I had

33:52.130 --> 33:56.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do something separately to
protect the
credibility of the
investigation, which meant

33:56.901 --> 33:58.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
both the FBI and the Justice
Department.

33:58.903 --> 34:00.671 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

34:00.705 --> 34:03.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD BURR: Were there other
things that
contributed to that, that you
can describe

34:03.074 --> 34:04.642 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in open session?

34:04.675 --> 34:10.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: There were other
things that
contributed to that.

34:10.415 --> 34:14.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One significant item I can't,
but I know the
committee's been briefed on --
there's been

34:14.052 --> 34:17.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some public accounts of it,
which are nonsense
-- but I understand the
committee has been

34:17.088 --> 34:18.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
briefed on the classified facts.

34:19.023 --> 34:23.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Probably, the only other
consideration that
I guess I can talk about in open
setting is

34:23.361 --> 34:27.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that at one point the attorney
general had
directed me not to call it an
investigation,

34:27.899 --> 34:33.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but instead to call it a matter,
which confused
me and concerned me, but that
was one of the

34:33.171 --> 34:37.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bricks in the load that led me
to conclude
I have to step away from the
department if

34:37.375 --> 34:39.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we're to close this case
credibly.

34:39.210 --> 34:43.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Carrie
Cordero, this is
the one part of today's hearing
that looked

34:43.081 --> 34:49.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back at the Clinton e-mail
story, which, of
course, went on for months and
months.

34:49.921 --> 34:55.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do we read what Director
Comey is saying
here about the former attorney
general, Loretta

34:55.426 --> 34:57.295 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Lynch?

34:57.328 --> 34:59.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARRIE CORDERO: So, I think the
former director
has take a really bad rap on
this July decision

34:59.664 --> 35:03.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to go public with his finding.

35:03.401 --> 35:07.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In my view, the attorney general
at the time,
Loretta Lynch, put him in an
extraordinarily

35:07.205 --> 35:09.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
difficult position.

35:09.040 --> 35:14.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She didn't officially recuse
from the decision,
which she could have done after
the tarmac

35:14.145 --> 35:19.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
meeting, nor did she say, I'm
going to make
the decision and I own it.

35:19.750 --> 35:23.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And because she did neither of
those things,
either said she was going to
make the prosecutorial

35:23.955 --> 35:29.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decision and own that decision,
or officially
recuse and say, Sally Yates is
in charge,

35:29.627 --> 35:32.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she left this sort of middle
ground where
she just said, well, I'm going
to accept the

35:32.830 --> 35:34.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
decision of the prosecutors.

35:34.599 --> 35:38.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, therefore, I think that
what the former
director was saying is, he felt
then that

35:38.503 --> 35:41.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that would have tainted any
future decision.

35:41.839 --> 35:44.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I think some
people -- George
Terwilliger, some people who are
close to

35:44.842 --> 35:49.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the former attorney general are
saying that
this came up more innocuously,
that it wasn't

35:49.747 --> 35:53.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an order, stop using the term
investigation,
call it a matter.

35:53.551 --> 35:59.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Be that as it may, Comey has
left out there
being very critical of the
former attorney

35:59.357 --> 36:01.125 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
general.

36:01.159 --> 36:06.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE TERWILLIGER: Yes, I'm
sort of troubled
by this aspect of that exchange
and what we

36:06.097 --> 36:07.899 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
heard today.

36:07.932 --> 36:14.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can understand the point that
Carrie makes
that Comey felt like the
decision-making process

36:15.006 --> 36:20.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the Justice Department
appeared corrupted
because of the tarmac visit and
so forth.

36:20.478 --> 36:22.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there's other remedies to
that.

36:22.747 --> 36:28.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to point to a discussion
with the attorney
general, I mean, I sat in the
attorney general's

36:28.986 --> 36:29.954 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
office.

36:29.987 --> 36:31.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was the acting attorney
general.

36:31.756 --> 36:35.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm sure I had discussions with
subordinate
officials about whether to call
something

36:35.293 --> 36:37.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a matter or an investigation.

36:37.395 --> 36:40.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm not saying this wasn't
significant.

36:40.998 --> 36:45.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it seems to me it kind of
got blown out
of proportion, if that's the
justification

36:45.069 --> 36:46.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the July proceeding.

36:46.237 --> 36:48.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Carlin, how
do you see
this?

36:48.072 --> 36:52.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CARLIN: I'm going to move
to where Carrie
started, which is, we know the
Russians are

36:52.577 --> 36:54.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to attack us again.

36:54.078 --> 36:58.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They tried to undermine
confidence in the
integrity of our election.

36:58.950 --> 37:00.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was reaffirmed today.

37:00.251 --> 37:02.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been reaffirmed by every
national security
official.

37:02.053 --> 37:04.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they're going to do it as
early as 2018.

37:04.989 --> 37:08.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, when you think about
the decisions
last summer about the Clinton
investigation,

37:08.459 --> 37:14.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the Russian investigation,
it is extraordinarily
difficult for the political
appointees to

37:14.498 --> 37:19.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make a decision calling out
investigations,
particularly when they have to
do with the

37:19.704 --> 37:21.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
interference in an election.

37:21.639 --> 37:26.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I worry about going into
2018 is, we're
in far worse shape right now in
having a credible

37:26.110 --> 37:28.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
official who can call out
Russian meddling
in our elections.

37:28.946 --> 37:35.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think we should think
seriously about
which career -- nonpartisan
career officials

37:35.186 --> 37:39.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do we give the task of calling
out if the
Russians attack our electoral
system again

37:39.790 --> 37:41.525 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 2018?

37:41.559 --> 37:44.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In about 20
seconds, Greg Craig,
you get to weigh in here, final
word.

37:44.295 --> 37:49.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREGORY CRAIG: Well, on the
Comey press conference
in July, I do have views on
that.

37:49.400 --> 37:52.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think he violated guidelines
and practices
in the Justice Department.

37:52.403 --> 37:56.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he went beyond that and
commented on her
conduct.

37:56.907 --> 37:57.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it was unacceptable.

37:57.908 --> 37:59.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it was a mistake, a terrible
mistake.

37:59.877 --> 38:04.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, that one, I
don't think
we're going to resolve as we sit
here this

38:04.181 --> 38:05.149 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
evening.

38:05.182 --> 38:06.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But thank you all for being
here.

38:06.917 --> 38:14.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Greg Craig, Carrie Cordero, John
Carlin, George
Terwilliger, thank you all very
much.

38:14.892 --> 38:25.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now to the
rest of this
day's news.

38:25.169 --> 38:31.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The polls have closed in
Britain, and voters
appear to have delivered a blow
to the ruling

38:31.075 --> 38:32.910 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Conservatives.

38:32.943 --> 38:37.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Exit surveys indicate they are
likely to come
in first, but lose their
majority in Parliament.

38:38.015 --> 38:41.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant reports
from London.

38:41.185 --> 38:46.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: After an
election campaign
punctuated by terrorism, voters
went to the

38:47.024 --> 38:50.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
polls amid tight security.

38:50.361 --> 38:54.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Conservative Prime Minister
Theresa May, who
repeatedly promised strong and
stable leadership,

38:55.032 --> 38:59.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cast her ballot in a village
west of London.

38:59.103 --> 39:04.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Labor Party leader Jeremy Corbyn
campaigned
on reversing public service cuts
and increasing

39:04.575 --> 39:06.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spending on health, schools and
police.

39:06.811 --> 39:11.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEREMY CORBYN, Leader, Labor
Party: It's a
day of our democracy.

39:11.215 --> 39:12.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have just voted.

39:12.216 --> 39:13.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I am very proud of our
campaign.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

39:14.719 --> 39:16.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: May announced
the snap election
seven weeks ago.

39:16.687 --> 39:20.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THERESA MAY, British Prime
Minister: The government
should call a general election
to be held

39:20.891 --> 39:22.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the 8th of June.

39:22.727 --> 39:27.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The Tory leader
sought a
popular mandate to boost her
majority in Parliament

39:27.998 --> 39:33.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and negotiating hand in Brexit
talks about
leaving the European Union.

39:33.170 --> 39:38.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She began with an overwhelming
lead, but then
came a series of campaign
missteps, and a

39:38.509 --> 39:43.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pair of deadly terror attacks,
on a concert
in Manchester last month and
around London

39:43.881 --> 39:45.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Bridge last weekend.

39:45.850 --> 39:50.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some Conservative supporters in
May's constituency
west of London were anxious.

39:50.321 --> 39:56.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Previously to last
weekend, I thought
that she'd be doing quite well,
but I'm not

39:56.127 --> 39:59.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so sure that she shot herself in
the foot
now.

39:59.730 --> 40:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm hoping not, but who knows
which way the
cookie crumbles.

40:01.799 --> 40:05.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Meanwhile,
Borough Market,
where terrorists fatally stabbed
people on

40:05.269 --> 40:09.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Saturday, remained closed as
voters went to
the local polling station.

40:09.573 --> 40:12.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Conservatives were not expected
to do well
here.

40:12.643 --> 40:17.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Labor supporters clung to the
hope that young
voters, energized by Corbyn,
might propel

40:17.615 --> 40:19.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him to an unexpected victory
nationwide.

40:19.784 --> 40:24.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: If you look at him in
comparison with
Theresa May, he's such a
principled person.

40:24.522 --> 40:26.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He does what he believes.

40:26.424 --> 40:32.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He follows the politics of
unification, not
division, and I just prefer so
much that outlook.

40:32.696 --> 40:37.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: According to
the joint British
television exit polls, it looks
as though

40:37.234 --> 40:44.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Conservatives have lost
their overall
majority, down from 330 seats to
314.

40:44.074 --> 40:48.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Labor is projected to have
gained 37 seats,
up to 266 in total.

40:48.813 --> 40:52.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now these numbers could change
as the official
results come in.

40:52.349 --> 40:57.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as it stands right now,
Theresa May's
gamble in calling the election
seems to have

40:57.955 --> 40:59.690 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
failed.

40:59.723 --> 41:02.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And political experts believe
that she may
be much diminished by the end of
the night.

41:02.226 --> 41:05.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's going to be a long and
fascinating night
-- Judy.

41:05.229 --> 41:07.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Malcolm Brabant
in London.

41:07.498 --> 41:10.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we are certainly going to
continue to
follow it.

41:10.267 --> 41:15.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Iran, authorities says five
of the men
who carried out attacks in
Tehran were Islamic

41:15.272 --> 41:18.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
State members who'd fought in
Syria and Iraq.

41:18.476 --> 41:24.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISIS claimed responsibility
yesterday after
gunmen and suicide bombers
struck Parliament

41:24.181 --> 41:26.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the tomb of Ayatollah
Khomeini.

41:26.517 --> 41:29.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They killed 17 people and
wounded 40.

41:29.753 --> 41:35.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Six suspects are in custody, and
Iran's semi-official
news agency reports that
investigators are

41:35.159 --> 41:39.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
examining whether Saudi Arabia
was involved.

41:39.096 --> 41:43.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's word of a new atrocity
by Islamic
State fighters holding out in
the Iraqi city

41:43.968 --> 41:45.669 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Mosul.

41:45.703 --> 41:50.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N. Human Rights Office
reports that
ISIS killed more than 200
civilians trying

41:50.941 --> 41:55.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to flee last week, including
children running
for safety.

41:55.312 --> 42:00.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It also says at least 50 people
died in an
airstrike in Mosul in late May.

42:00.251 --> 42:03.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's unclear who launched the
airstrike.

42:03.821 --> 42:08.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Korea has fired off
another round of
missiles, this time short-range
anti-ship

42:08.926 --> 42:10.728 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weapons.

42:10.761 --> 42:15.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The South Korean military says
that they flew
some 125 miles today before
landing in the

42:15.633 --> 42:18.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
waters between the Korean
Peninsula and Japan.

42:18.602 --> 42:23.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South Korea's new president,
Moon Jae-in,
had called for reaching out to
the North,

42:23.974 --> 42:26.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but, today, he demanded an end
to the provocations.

42:26.744 --> 42:29.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOON JAE-IN, South Korean
President (through
translator): Our government, as
I have already

42:29.980 --> 42:35.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clarified multiple times, will
not back off
at all or compromise regarding
national security

42:35.152 --> 42:37.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and people's safety.

42:37.054 --> 42:41.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, the government will
unwaveringly make
efforts for complete
denuclearization of North

42:41.058 --> 42:44.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Korea's nuclear weapons through
both sanctions
and dialogue.

42:44.295 --> 42:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just yesterday,
Moon postponed
the full deployment of a U.S.
anti-missile

42:49.867 --> 42:50.834 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
system.

42:50.868 --> 42:53.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's meant to be a deterrent to
North Korea.

42:53.404 --> 42:58.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The U.S. House of
Representatives voted today
to dismantle much of the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street

42:58.742 --> 43:00.544 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
reform act.

43:00.578 --> 43:05.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bill would weaken the
Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau and undo many
regulations

43:05.716 --> 43:09.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
imposed after the 2008 financial
collapse.

43:09.186 --> 43:15.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans say it's been a
burden on small
banks and has harmed economic
growth.

43:15.125 --> 43:18.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats said it's discouraged
risky lending
practices.

43:18.062 --> 43:21.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The measure faces an uncertain
future in the
Senate.

43:21.732 --> 43:25.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial
average gained about nine points
to close

43:25.769 --> 43:27.838 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at 21182.

43:27.871 --> 43:33.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 24, and the S&amp;P
500 added
a fraction.

43:33.944 --> 43:37.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will be back shortly with
a report
from our student reporting team.

43:37.748 --> 43:41.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's part of our series
Limitless about people
living with disabilities.

43:41.752 --> 43:46.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, take a moment to
hear from your
local PBS station.

43:46.557 --> 43:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a chance to offer your
support, which
helps programs like ours stay on
the air.

43:56.600 --> 44:03.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a chance to offer your
support, which
helps programs like ours stay on
the air.

44:03.374 --> 44:08.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FOR THOSE STATIONS STILL WITH
US, THE CONTINENT
OF AFRICA DOES NOT NOW HOLD MANY
INTERNATIONALLY

44:08.278 --> 44:10.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WELL-KNOWN UNIVERSITIES.

44:10.347 --> 44:16.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BUT ONE MAN IS TRYING TO CHANGE
THAT, A ONE-TIME
MICROSOFT EXECUTIVE WHO WAS
EDUCATED IN THE

44:16.053 --> 44:18.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNITED STATES, PATRICK AWUAH.

44:18.656 --> 44:24.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AS SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT FRED DE
SAM LAZARO
REPORTS, ONE SPECIAL FOCUS OF
CLASSES IS TO

44:24.328 --> 44:28.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TEACH AFRICA'S NEXT GENERATION
OF LEADERS
ABOUT ETHICS.

44:28.465 --> 44:31.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THIS STORY ORGINALLY AIRED
EARLIER THIS YEAR.

44:31.035 --> 44:36.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: It looks
like a pretty
typical college campus, with
students working

44:36.774 --> 44:41.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in computer labs, studying at
the library,
or hanging out with friends.

44:41.612 --> 44:46.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Ashesi University, in the
West African
nation of Ghana, has embarked on
an experiment

44:46.917 --> 44:52.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which its founder hopes will
help start to
fundamentally change the entire
continent.

44:52.089 --> 44:57.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICK AWUAH, President, Ashesi
University:
In the next three decades or so,
the population

44:57.494 --> 45:03.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Africa is going to double,
and something
like 40 percent of working-age
people are

45:03.634 --> 45:05.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to be Africans in the
world.

45:05.602 --> 45:08.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A lot of jobs need to be
created.

45:08.772 --> 45:12.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we need to be educating
the next bench
in a way that they'’re going to
go create

45:12.443 --> 45:14.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those jobs and create those
opportunities
for people.

45:14.845 --> 45:19.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Patrick
Awuah was born
and raised in Ghana, but came to
the United

45:19.049 --> 45:24.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States on scholarship to get an
undergraduate
degree in engineering from
Swarthmore and

45:24.455 --> 45:27.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an MBA from the University of
California,
Berkeley.

45:27.925 --> 45:33.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He went on to become a program
manager at
Microsoft.

45:33.764 --> 45:38.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When he decided to return to his
homeland,
he assumed he would start a
software company,

45:38.635 --> 45:43.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but quickly realized the system
of higher
education was so poor, there
wasn'’t a competent

45:43.774 --> 45:46.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
work force to hire.

45:46.243 --> 45:50.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Experts say the problem with
education in
Africa is not so much that there
aren'’t

45:50.514 --> 45:54.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enough institutions, but,
rather, it'’s in
what students are taught and how
they'’re

45:54.718 --> 46:00.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taught it, with an emphasis much
more on rote
learning and memorization, much
less on critical

46:00.090 --> 46:02.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thinking, on thinking for
oneself.

46:02.092 --> 46:08.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICK AWUAH: Under colonial
rule, the educational
system was really designed for
that, to educate

46:08.832 --> 46:12.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people to follow instructions
and to do things
in a very consistent way.

46:12.903 --> 46:17.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: So, Awuah
decided he had
to start his own university.

46:17.141 --> 46:22.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
With money from American
friends, colleagues
and foundations, he raised $2.5
million to

46:22.880 --> 46:27.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
open a school with an initial
class of 30
freshman in 2002.

46:27.551 --> 46:32.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ashesi has now grown to a campus
of nearly
800 students.

46:32.489 --> 46:38.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The guiding principle throughout
has been
a laser-like focus on three
principles: ethical

46:38.562 --> 46:40.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leadership, innovation and
entrepreneurship.

46:40.631 --> 46:43.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PATRICK AWUAH: We need a lot of
innovation.

46:43.534 --> 46:46.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need people who are trained
to drive that.

46:46.670 --> 46:51.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we need people who are going
to be working
on the government side, who are
going to create

46:51.842 --> 46:53.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an enabling environment for
that.

46:53.777 --> 46:58.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Ghana, like
most countries
in Africa, has been plagued by
government-related

46:58.515 --> 47:00.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
corruption, which has hampered
job growth.

47:00.818 --> 47:06.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSE DODD, Professor, Ashesi
University: For
the next three to four minutes,
come up with

47:06.523 --> 47:09.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a list of things that a brick
can be used
for.

47:09.726 --> 47:13.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Ashesi'’s
goal is to
teach students to fight against
the temptations

47:13.764 --> 47:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of corruption and think outside
the box.

47:16.733 --> 47:21.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It begins almost from the moment
a freshman
arrives on campus and takes a
mandatory course

47:22.005 --> 47:24.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
called Foundations of Design and
Entrepreneurship.

47:25.008 --> 47:26.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROSE DODD: How many do you have?

47:26.977 --> 47:27.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: Twenty-nine.

47:27.978 --> 47:29.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROSE DODD: Twenty-nine.

47:29.146 --> 47:30.948 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:30.981 --> 47:37.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICK AWUAH: The instructor
says, you go
find a problem that you think is
worth solving,

47:37.588 --> 47:39.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and then come up with an answer
to problem.

47:39.823 --> 47:42.960 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It'’s very open-ended and then &amp;

47:42.993 --> 47:45.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And scary in
part, I imagine.

47:45.562 --> 47:47.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PATRICK AWUAH: Scary.

47:47.397 --> 47:54.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It feels like you have been
thrown into this
kind of weird world, where you
can'’t plant

47:54.304 --> 47:55.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
your feet on the ground.

47:55.706 --> 47:56.807 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

47:56.840 --> 47:58.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It'’s very different way of
approaching education.

47:58.876 --> 48:04.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSE DODD: When you see a
problem, your first
human instinct is to think of
the first, easiest

48:04.748 --> 48:06.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
solution that comes to mind.

48:06.550 --> 48:12.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Professor
Rose Dodd, an
Ashesi alumna herself, says she
hopes the

48:12.356 --> 48:17.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
class will encourage her
students to take
on the entrenched establishments
in Ghana.

48:17.160 --> 48:18.762 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROSE DODD: Don'’t be limited.

48:18.795 --> 48:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Don'’t feel that whatever the
system is limits
you.

48:23.367 --> 48:27.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Think about whatever else could
be and then
try it out.

48:27.638 --> 48:35.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the goal, the end
goal should
be to make life better for
everybody around

48:35.279 --> 48:36.246 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

48:36.280 --> 48:38.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Look at the question on the
board.

48:38.148 --> 48:42.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Indeed, many
Ashesi graduates
have gone on to do some form of
public service,

48:42.653 --> 48:47.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether it'’s teaching in rural
elementary
or secondary schools, or
mentoring the next

48:47.724 --> 48:52.095 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
generation of young women.

48:52.129 --> 49:00.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yawa Hansen-Quao became the
first female student
council president at Ashesi in
2006.

49:00.604 --> 49:05.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While in college, she began
thinking about
a way to help women grow into
leadership positions,

49:05.943 --> 49:09.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a goal that she made a reality
with the founding
of Leading Ladies'’ Network.

49:09.546 --> 49:13.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YAWA HANSEN-QUAO, Leading Ladies
Network:
Our goal as an organization is
to help women

49:13.884 --> 49:18.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get out of themselves and their
problems and
to start thinking of what kind
of change they

49:18.855 --> 49:20.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can bring to the community
around them.

49:20.791 --> 49:26.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: One young
woman that Quao
has mentored is Narkie Agbettor,
another Ashesi

49:26.096 --> 49:27.764 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
grad.

49:27.798 --> 49:31.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has just started her own
small business,
selling virgin coconut oil
products.

49:31.501 --> 49:36.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while she'’s enthusiastic
about her company,
she admits it'’s not always easy
dealing

49:36.039 --> 49:39.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with government bureaucracy and
seeing competitors
resort to bribery.

49:40.010 --> 49:44.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARKIE AGBETTOR, Entrepreneur:
There are solutions
to every problem out there.

49:44.147 --> 49:46.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It requires thinking.

49:46.316 --> 49:51.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you want to be successful
and you want
to be ethical as well.

49:51.254 --> 49:57.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Patrick
Awuah knows that
his young, idealistic graduates,
many who

49:57.961 --> 50:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come from families of modest
means, will be
severely tested out in the real
world.

50:03.166 --> 50:07.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he hopes the lessons they
have learned
at Ashesi will help guide them.

50:07.204 --> 50:11.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PATRICK AWUAH: Are some alumni
probably not
holding the line?

50:11.541 --> 50:13.310 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Probably.

50:13.343 --> 50:19.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I would hope that even those
who are not
holding the line are thinking
twice about

50:19.816 --> 50:21.618 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
doing it.

50:21.651 --> 50:24.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The other
cultural problem
that Awuah hopes to change is
stopping the

50:24.955 --> 50:30.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so-called brain drain, where,
after college,
people leave the continent to
seek careers

50:30.394 --> 50:32.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in developed countries.

50:32.362 --> 50:38.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So far, 90 percent of Ashesi
grads have stayed
and work in Africa.

50:38.035 --> 50:47.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the PBS NewsHour, I'’m Fred
de Sam Lazaro
in Accra, Ghana.

50:47.377 --> 50:58.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now another
in our series
Limitless, stories about living
with disabilities

50:58.155 --> 51:02.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from youth reporters in the
"NewsHour"'s Student
Reporting Labs network.

51:02.225 --> 51:08.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we travel to Norfolk,
Virginia, to
meet Jonathan Atkins, a
19-year-old bodybuilder

51:08.265 --> 51:14.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with down syndrome who competed
in the 2017
Body Sculpting Open.

51:14.171 --> 51:17.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The story was produced by
students at Granby
High School.

51:17.808 --> 51:20.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The student correspondent is
Jamil Aforo (ph).

51:20.577 --> 51:24.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIL AFORO: Professional
bodybuilders are
praised for their ability to
enhance their

51:24.514 --> 51:28.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
external appearance, pushing the
limits of
the human body.

51:28.151 --> 51:33.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But for Jonathan Atkins, the
hobby has transformed
not only his body, but his life.

51:33.490 --> 51:35.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The 19-year-old athlete comes to
this Virginia
Beach gym, called the Houze of
Champions,

51:35.992 --> 51:42.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to work out with his trainer,
Joe Hartfelder,
every week.

51:42.399 --> 51:46.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jonathan was born with Down
syndrome, a genetic
disorder that stems from an
additional chromosome.

51:46.503 --> 51:48.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOE HARTFELDER, Trainer: My name
is Joe Hartfelder.

51:48.638 --> 51:50.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm a WNBF natural pro
bodybuilder.

51:50.407 --> 51:56.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I met Jon over a year ago, and
through his
mother, who I have known since I
was around

51:56.780 --> 51:58.615 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
6, 7 years old.

51:58.648 --> 52:05.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He always showed an interest in
lifting weights
at the house and kind of doing
his own thing.

52:05.188 --> 52:09.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't impose bodybuilding on
anyone, because
it's -- a lot of people don't
get it, and

52:09.326 --> 52:11.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
everyone does it for a different
reason.

52:11.428 --> 52:14.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there is a lot of ego in the
industry.

52:14.231 --> 52:16.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I just don't like that.

52:16.333 --> 52:21.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIL AFORO: After working
together for about
a year, Joe encouraged Jon to
enter a local

52:21.138 --> 52:22.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bodybuilding competition.

52:22.372 --> 52:27.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOE HARTFELDER: I really love
people and helping
people.

52:27.210 --> 52:32.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, with Jon, he was already
flexing, and
he was kind of already doing
that anyway,

52:32.649 --> 52:36.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I guess looking on Facebook
and looking
on different things on social
media.

52:36.253 --> 52:38.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I was just like, hey, he
could do this.

52:38.488 --> 52:44.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DUDLEY, Mother of Jonathan
Atkins: Down
syndrome has low muscle tone, so
for him to

52:44.594 --> 52:50.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have the muscles he does is
pretty impressive,
because he didn't walk until he
was almost

52:50.333 --> 52:52.135 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
6.

52:52.169 --> 52:55.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIL AFORO: Lisa Dudley,
Jonathan's mother,
has seen how bodybuilding has
improved her

52:55.539 --> 52:57.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
son's self-esteem.

52:57.407 --> 53:01.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DUDLEY: Because, a lot of
times, he knows
that he is different and that
he's -- there

53:01.244 --> 53:05.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are certain things that he
cannot do, but
this is one thing that he knows
that he can

53:05.649 --> 53:09.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do, that, for self-confidence, I
think it's
been awesome to him.

53:09.452 --> 53:14.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIL AFORO: With encouragement
from his trainer,
Jon traveled to Phoebus,
Virginia, in February

53:14.591 --> 53:18.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
2017 to compete in the Body
Sculpting Open.

53:18.228 --> 53:21.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had never been on a stage
before, or been
in front of so many strangers.

53:21.965 --> 53:27.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was one of two participants
to compete
in a challenged division section
of the competition.

53:27.237 --> 53:33.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DUDLEY: When I saw him on
stage, I felt
very nervous, but I was proud.

53:33.476 --> 53:38.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was proud that he actually
went out in front
of all these strangers and
hundreds of people.

53:38.782 --> 53:42.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was like he had done this
a hundred
times before.

53:42.285 --> 53:44.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he didn't look the first bit
nervous.

53:44.354 --> 53:45.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he looked good.

53:45.889 --> 53:49.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He looked really good up there.

53:50.026 --> 53:54.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When he did his one-minute
routine, this is
what he -- this is the pose he
did, right

53:54.297 --> 53:56.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at the end, before he walked
off.

53:56.433 --> 53:58.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOE HARTFELDER: Oh, it was
great.

53:58.235 --> 53:59.202 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It was great.

53:59.236 --> 54:01.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He loved getting the trophy.

54:01.137 --> 54:04.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every part of it, he was just a
champ the
whole way through.

54:04.741 --> 54:06.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The beauty in it is, you can
always get better.

54:06.943 --> 54:11.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In lifting, whether it's
bodybuilding, in
life, in anything, you are just
always pursuing

54:11.248 --> 54:12.882 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do better.

54:12.916 --> 54:16.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jonathan Atkins,
you are a
star.

54:16.086 --> 54:19.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you can see more of these
stories from
young journalists across the
country.

54:19.389 --> 54:23.360 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
That's at
studentreportinglabs.org.

54:23.393 --> 54:25.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Before we go, just a quick note.

54:25.228 --> 54:28.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We needed to devote most of
tonight's program
to the Senate hearing with James
Comey, but
