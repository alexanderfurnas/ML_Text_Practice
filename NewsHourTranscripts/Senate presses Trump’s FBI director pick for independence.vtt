JUDY WOODRUFF: As we noted
earlier, the issue of Russian
meddling figured into the Senate

00:04.466 --> 00:09.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
confirmation hearing today for
Christopher Wray, the nominee
to be the next FBI director.

00:10.633 --> 00:13.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But it was not the
only topic of note.

00:13.033 --> 00:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senators were also trying to
get a sense for whether Wray
was the right person to lead

00:16.733 --> 00:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the bureau through the
political crosswinds of the day.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Lisa Desjardins
takes it from there.

00:22.566 --> 00:27.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: He's worked 25
years as both as a top federal
a prosecutor and as defense

00:28.600 --> 00:29.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
attorney.

00:29.600 --> 00:31.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:31.700 --> 00:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLES GRASSLEY (R), Iowa: Do
you affirm that the testimony
you're about to give before

00:33.733 --> 00:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the committee will be the truth,
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you,

00:37.533 --> 00:38.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
God?

00:38.800 --> 00:40.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHRISTOPHER WRAY, FBI
Director Nominee: I do.

00:40.866 --> 00:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But Christopher
Wray faced few questions about
his experience, and instead

00:43.233 --> 00:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a long list of them about
his independence as a
potential FBI chief.

00:47.400 --> 00:49.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PATRICK LEAHY (D), Vermont: If
the president asked you to do
something unlawful or unethical,

00:51.800 --> 00:53.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what do you say?

00:53.300 --> 00:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER WRAY: First, I
would try to talk him out of it.

00:55.900 --> 00:58.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And if that failed,
I would resign.

00:58.433 --> 01:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It was one of
many references to the last FBI
director, James Comey, fired

01:04.166 --> 01:06.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by President Trump.

01:06.533 --> 01:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Comey claimed the president
asked him to let go of
investigating former
aide Michael Flynn,

01:11.200 --> 01:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and demanded a loyalty oath.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The White House
disputes all of that.

01:14.933 --> 01:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Wray, as the FBI nominee,
was asked about his allegiance.

01:18.833 --> 01:23.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER WRAY: My loyalty is
to the Constitution, to the rule
of law, and to the mission of

01:24.766 --> 01:26.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the FBI.

01:26.833 --> 01:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And no one asked me for any
kind of loyalty oath at any
point during this process, and

01:29.600 --> 01:31.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I sure as heck didn't offer one.

01:31.266 --> 01:33.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: And
about his conviction.

01:33.333 --> 01:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER WRAY: I believe
to my core that there's only
one right way to do this job,

01:39.933 --> 01:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that is with
strict independence,
by the book, playing it
straight, faithful to the

01:45.866 --> 01:47.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Constitution.

01:47.966 --> 01:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Wray spoke
about his 2004 pledge to leave
the Justice Department over

01:51.433 --> 01:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Bush administration's use
of warrantless wiretaps, which
he believed were illegal.

01:58.400 --> 02:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was following the lead of
Comey, then the deputy attorney
general, and Robert Mueller,

02:03.633 --> 02:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then the FBI director, and
now the man in charge of the
special Russia investigation.

02:09.100 --> 02:12.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER WRAY: I view him as
the consummate straight-shooter,
and somebody I have enormous

02:12.766 --> 02:14.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
respect for.

02:14.766 --> 02:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would be pleased to
do what I can to support
him in his mission.

02:17.500 --> 02:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Wray also
worked on counterterrorism
at the Justice Department,
and was asked today

02:23.100 --> 02:24.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about torture.

02:24.633 --> 02:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER WRAY: My view
is that torture is wrong.

02:28.166 --> 02:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's unacceptable, it's illegal,
and I think it's ineffective.

02:29.833 --> 02:33.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: And
about protecting Muslim
Americans from backlash.

02:33.233 --> 02:37.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER WRAY: I think
the FBI director and the FBI
needs to be -- the FBI and the

02:37.700 --> 02:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FBI director for all Americans,
including Muslim Americans.

02:42.066 --> 02:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And my experience in terrorism
investigations has been that
some of the best leads we ever

02:48.233 --> 02:52.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
got were from members
of that community.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: He stressed
the need to fight terrorism,
including cyber-terrorism, and

02:57.900 --> 02:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
protect classified information.

02:59.400 --> 03:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In the end, senators of
both parties seemed assured.

03:02.100 --> 03:04.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:04.066 --> 03:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AL FRANKEN (D), Minnesota:
Looking around, I'm feeling
that you have had a good hearing

03:06.733 --> 03:07.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

03:07.733 --> 03:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And best of luck to you, sir.

03:09.933 --> 03:10.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHRISTOPHER WRAY:
Thank you, Senator.

03:10.933 --> 03:13.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That means a lot.

03:13.033 --> 03:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: If approved,
Wray would be the eighth FBI
director confirmed by the U.S.

03:17.833 --> 03:19.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Senate.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Lisa Desjardins.
