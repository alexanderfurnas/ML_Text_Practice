HARI SREENIVASAN: Moving and
shaking today in the White
House communications staff.

00:04.066 --> 00:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sean Spicer resigned as press
secretary after just six months,
saying the president needs

00:08.300 --> 00:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a -- quote -- "clean slate."

00:10.333 --> 00:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it was widely reported that
he objected to the naming of
Wall Street financier Anthony

00:14.133 --> 00:16.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Scaramucci as
communications director.

00:16.766 --> 00:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At a White House briefing,
Scaramucci sought to play
down talk of any discord.

00:20.866 --> 00:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, Incoming
White House Communications
Director: For me, as
it relates to Sean, it

00:23.800 --> 00:27.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
speaks volumes to who he
is as a human being, who
he is as a team player.

00:27.733 --> 00:29.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

00:29.766 --> 00:31.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So his attitude is, if
Anthony's coming in, let me
clear the slate for Anthony.

00:31.800 --> 00:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I do appreciate that about
Sean, and I love him for it.

00:34.866 --> 00:37.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I don't have any
friction with Sean.

00:37.266 --> 00:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
Scaramucci also named
Spicer's deputy, Sarah
Huckabee Sanders, to be the

00:41.333 --> 00:43.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
new press secretary.

00:43.466 --> 00:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a statement, President Trump
praised Spicer's work, and said
-- quote -- "Just look at his

00:46.133 --> 00:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
great television ratings."

00:48.133 --> 00:51.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The spokesman for the
president's legal team, Mark
Corallo, also resigned today.

00:51.700 --> 00:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That came amid reports that the
lawyers are hunting possible
conflicts of interest by

00:55.966 --> 00:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
special counsel Robert Mueller.

00:58.133 --> 01:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mueller is investigating Russian
meddling in the 2016 election.

01:01.566 --> 01:05.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The White House would neither
confirm nor deny the reports.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president's lead lawyer did
deny a Washington Post account
that they're examining whether

01:09.700 --> 01:13.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Mr. Trump could pardon
relatives, aides
and even himself.

01:13.666 --> 01:18.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We will take a closer
look at all of this
after the news summary.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Israeli-Palestinian
tensions erupted into
street battles today between
police and protesters

01:21.933 --> 01:23.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in Jerusalem and the West Bank.

01:23.866 --> 01:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At least three Palestinians were
killed, and nearly 400 hurt.

01:28.700 --> 01:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Exploding stun grenades
drowned out Friday prayers in
Jerusalem, as ambulance sirens

01:34.166 --> 01:36.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wailed.

01:36.300 --> 01:40.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Palestinians called it a
day of rage, protesting
Israel's installation
of metal detectors at

01:40.366 --> 01:43.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a holy site revered by
both Muslims and Jews.

01:43.466 --> 01:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
This place is made
for worshipping God.

01:46.833 --> 01:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They cannot prevent Muslims
from entering to pray.

01:48.966 --> 01:51.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They are acting against God.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Israelis
put up the metal detectors
after Arab-Israeli gunmen

01:54.200 --> 01:57.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
killed two police
officers last Friday.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It happened at the complex known
as the Temple Mount to Jews and
the Noble Sanctuary to Muslims.

02:03.966 --> 02:07.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Inside, Al-Aqsa Mosque, the
third holiest site in Islam, and
the Dome of the Rock, they're

02:07.366 --> 02:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bordered by the Western Wall,
the holiest site in Judaism.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tensions have been building
ever since the shooting.

02:14.233 --> 02:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Overnight, the streets of
Jerusalem's Old City were
filled with protesters throwing

02:18.566 --> 02:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stones and security forces
firing back with grenades.

02:22.300 --> 02:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, police refused to
remove the metal detectors, and
barred Muslim men younger than

02:27.133 --> 02:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
50 from entering the holy site.

02:30.300 --> 02:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Security checkpoints also
blocked busloads of Muslims
traveling to Jerusalem.

02:34.300 --> 02:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICKY ROSENFELD, Israeli
Police Spokesman: The security
measures will continue in and

02:36.400 --> 02:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around the area of the Old City
and the Temple Mount, in order
to prevent any further terrorist

02:40.800 --> 02:43.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
attacks.

02:43.366 --> 02:46.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But the
grand mufti of Jerusalem
rallied thousands of
Muslims to pray outside

02:46.200 --> 02:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the gates of the old city, under
the watch of Israeli forces.

02:49.733 --> 02:52.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He predicted a
long test of wills.

02:52.033 --> 02:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMIN AL-HUSSEINI, Grand Mufti of
Jerusalem (through translator):
We do accept any restrictions

02:55.366 --> 02:57.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on the door of the
Al-Aqsa Mosque.

02:57.466 --> 03:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Therefore, all the Palestinian
people reject these gates
and refuse to accept or enter

03:02.200 --> 03:04.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
through them.

03:04.266 --> 03:07.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The violence
broke out after prayers, and
spilled over to towns across

03:07.966 --> 03:10.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the West Bank.

03:10.500 --> 03:13.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later, the day of rage
turned to grief, as
mourners held a funeral
for one of the Palestinian

03:14.433 --> 03:16.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
dead.

03:16.533 --> 03:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a Palestinian stabbed
three Israelis to death
in a West Bank settlement.

03:18.933 --> 03:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, Palestinian President
Mahmoud Abbas announced he's
freezing contacts with Israel

03:23.700 --> 03:25.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on all levels.

03:25.766 --> 03:29.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Afghanistan, the
U.S. military confirms
that a NATO airstrike
mistakenly killed Afghan

03:29.533 --> 03:31.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
troops today.

03:31.533 --> 03:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officials say it happened during
an operation against Taliban
fighters in Helmand Province

03:34.566 --> 03:36.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the south.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The provincial governor
says at least two
Afghan commanders died.

03:38.700 --> 03:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson
is urging Gulf nations to
lift their economic blockade

03:43.533 --> 03:45.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Qatar.

03:45.500 --> 03:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and
the UAE have imposed sanctions
on Qatar over charges of

03:49.433 --> 03:51.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
financing terror groups.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, Tillerson met with
the Omani foreign minister.

03:53.833 --> 03:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He commended the oil
state's efforts to comply
with an agreement on
curbing terror financing.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary
of State: They have been very
aggressive in implementing

04:00.600 --> 04:02.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that agreement.

04:02.700 --> 04:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we are -- I think we're
satisfied with the effort
they are putting forth.

04:05.200 --> 04:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think they also have indicated
a willingness to sit with the
four parties and negotiate,

04:10.033 --> 04:12.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
discuss the demands.

04:12.066 --> 04:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Meanwhile,
Qatar's emir denounced the
blockade as a smear campaign,

04:16.900 --> 04:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but said he's open to dialogue.

04:18.900 --> 04:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump is demanding
that Iran release the American
citizens it is holding.

04:23.133 --> 04:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a statement this evening,
the White House warned of new
and serious consequences unless

04:27.700 --> 04:31.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tehran frees all unjustly
imprisoned Americans.

04:31.166 --> 04:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At least three U.S. citizens

least two people.

04:40.833 --> 04:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The quake was centered near the
Greek island of Kos, and the
Turkish tourist hub of Bodrum.

04:46.800 --> 04:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nearly 500 people were injured,

damage to buildings, roads and

04:51.366 --> 04:52.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
historical sites.

04:52.900 --> 04:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thousands of tourists were
forced to sleep outdoors.

04:54.766 --> 04:57.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Some tried to leave,
but got stranded.

04:57.600 --> 05:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
We were woken up at
1:30 in the morning.

05:03.466 --> 05:04.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We were wondering what happened.

05:04.466 --> 05:05.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everything was shaking.

05:05.833 --> 05:08.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We panicked and didn't
know what was going on.

05:08.033 --> 05:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we quickly gathered our
stuff and went out of the hotel,
because, as it was several

05:12.533 --> 05:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
floors high, we didn't want
it to fall on our heads.

05:15.733 --> 05:16.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Everyone was out in the street.

05:16.966 --> 05:18.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was a massive panic.

05:18.733 --> 05:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In the hotel lobby, vases
and lamps were upside down.

05:21.600 --> 05:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The two

05:38.866 --> 05:43.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%

05:44.033 --> 05:44.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in a coma.

05:44.833 --> 05:46.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
