WHERE DID HE GO?

05:27.733 --> 05:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> HE ARRIVED AT THE AIRPORT

05:29.100 --> 05:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:44.400 --> 05:46.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE HE MET WITH SOME OF THE

05:46.167 --> 05:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESIDENTS AND HE JUST FINISHED

05:48.033 --> 05:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CELEBRATING MASS AT THE

CHRISTIANS IN THE COUNTRY.

05:53.367 --> 05:55.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT DID THE POPE SAY TO EACH

05:55.767 --> 05:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROUP?

05:56.933 --> 05:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, HE HAD A MAJORITY

05:59.233 --> 06:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTIAN AUDIENCE TODAY SO FAR.

06:01.433 --> 06:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE MESSAGE IS THE SAME TO

06:04.033 --> 06:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOTH.

06:04.733 --> 06:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAY DOWN YOUR WEAPONS.

06:07.933 --> 06:09.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEACE, RECONCILIATION.

06:09.667 --> 06:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE JUST NOW IN HIS HOMILY HAS

06:13.400 --> 06:15.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOLD THE FAITHFUL GATHERED IN

06:15.067 --> 06:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CATHEDRAL THAT PARDONING AND

06:18.133 --> 06:19.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORGIVING ONE ANOTHER IS HARD.

06:19.667 --> 06:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S THE HARDEST THING TO DO.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT CHRISTIANS AT LEAST ARE

06:23.733 --> 06:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CALLED TO LOVE THEIR ENEMIES AND

06:25.433 --> 06:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THAT IS WHAT IS NECESSARY

06:27.200 --> 06:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW.

06:28.033 --> 06:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: AND HOW HAS HE

06:29.000 --> 06:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN RECEIVED?

06:30.400 --> 06:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE ENTHUSIASM HAS BEEN

06:32.800 --> 06:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCREDIBLE.

06:33.300 --> 06:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS A COUNTRY THAT HAS BEEN

06:37.233 --> 06:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS THE PRESIDENT SAID, IT'S

06:39.733 --> 06:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DESCENDED INTO HELL OVER THE

06:40.933 --> 06:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAST TWO YEARS.

06:42.533 --> 06:45.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK FOR THE RESIDENTS,

06:45.267 --> 06:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST THE FACT THAT HE CAME WAS

06:48.733 --> 06:49.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REMARKABLE.

06:49.667 --> 06:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I DON'T THINK ANYONE REALLY

06:51.633 --> 06:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPECTED THAT HE WOULD.

06:52.833 --> 06:54.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WERE SUCH SERIOUS SECURITY

06:54.967 --> 06:57.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THREATS IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS

06:57.467 --> 06:58.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEADING UP TO THIS TRIP THAT

06:58.567 --> 07:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WERE CONCERNS HE WOULD

07:00.600 --> 07:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNCIL, OR AT LEAST TRIM IT

07:01.900 --> 07:02.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BACK.

07:02.567 --> 07:04.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE FACT THAT HE ARRIVED AND

07:04.100 --> 07:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FACT THAT HE WENT FIEF

07:07.200 --> 07:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KILOMETERS IN AN OPEN POPE

07:08.600 --> 07:10.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOBILE SHOWED THAT HE'S NOT

07:10.600 --> 07:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFRAID.

07:11.433 --> 07:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT HE WANTED TO-- JUST HIS

07:14.400 --> 07:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESENCE TO BE HERE.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: GIVE US SOME

07:17.800 --> 07:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERSPECTIVE ON HOW SIGNIFICANT

07:19.100 --> 07:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS FIGHTING HAS BEEN.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS PRETTY MUCH AN EXODUS

07:22.300 --> 07:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF MUSLIMS LEAVING THAT COUNTRY.

07:24.700 --> 07:25.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE MUSLIMS WHO HAVE

07:27.900 --> 07:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REMAINED THERE ITSELF ARE

07:30.133 --> 07:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ESSENTIALLY ENCIRCLED

07:32.400 --> 07:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN A QUARTER.

07:33.233 --> 07:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE THE KM-5 NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE

07:36.300 --> 07:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAPITOL AND THEY BASICALLY CAN'T

07:37.733 --> 07:39.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEAVE BECAUSE THE CHRISTIAN

07:39.467 --> 07:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITIA IS ESSENTIALLY

07:41.400 --> 07:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SURROUNDED IT FOR THEIR OWN

07:43.000 --> 07:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAFETY.

07:43.533 --> 07:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE MUSLIMS HERE WHO HAVE

07:45.233 --> 07:47.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STAYED HERE ARE VERY MUCH A

07:47.067 --> 07:47.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BESIEGED PEOPLE.

07:47.767 --> 07:49.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE HOPING ALSO TO HEAR

07:49.567 --> 07:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME WORDS FROM THE POPE, SOME

07:52.100 --> 07:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT FOR THEM.

07:54.633 --> 07:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY MIGHT GET IT TOMORROW

07:56.600 --> 07:58.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN HE GOES INTO THAT QUARTER.

SCHIFRIN IN THE STUDIO.

13:07.100 --> 13:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT THIS PIECE, WHAT IS THE

13:08.333 --> 13:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE.

13:09.100 --> 13:10.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE GOVERNMENT IS TAKING THIS

13:10.067 --> 13:11.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY SERIOUSLY.

13:11.067 --> 13:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NEW GOVERNMENT IS TAKING

13:11.933 --> 13:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS VERY SERIOUSLY.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A SENIOR ADVISOR ON CORRUPTION

13:15.067 --> 13:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISSUES PUTS IT THIS WAY.

13:16.233 --> 13:17.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EITHER WE KILL CORRUPTION OR

13:17.667 --> 13:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CORRUPTION KILLS THE COUNTRY.

13:19.800 --> 13:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NEW PRESIDENT HAS COMMITTEES

13:23.800 --> 13:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOKING, ESPECIALLY AT HIGH

13:24.900 --> 13:26.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEVEL CORRUPTION.

13:26.067 --> 13:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE FOCUS IS ON 20 BILLION

13:29.033 --> 13:30.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOLLARS, THAT'S THE ACCUSATION

13:30.567 --> 13:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HAS BEEN STOLEN BY OIL

13:33.200 --> 13:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFFICIALS BECAUSE MOST OF

13:34.833 --> 13:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NIGERIA'S MONEY COMES FROM THAT

13:36.433 --> 13:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OIL.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT ALSO MONEY STOLEN FROM THE

13:38.633 --> 13:39.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITARY.

13:39.567 --> 13:41.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MONEY THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TO

13:41.767 --> 13:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIGHT BOKO HARAM INSTEAD GOT

13:43.100 --> 13:43.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIVERTED.

13:43.867 --> 13:45.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THAT IS THE FOCUS OF THIS NEW

13:45.633 --> 13:46.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNMENT AND THEY HOPE IF THEY

13:46.867 --> 13:48.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN GET SOME HIGH LEVEL

13:48.567 --> 13:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROSECUTIONS, SOME HIGH PROFILE

13:50.433 --> 13:51.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROSECUTIONS, THAT WILL SEND A

13:51.700 --> 13:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MESSAGE THAT THE DAYS OF

13:54.400 --> 13:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPUNITY ARE OVER AND THEN YOU

13:55.600 --> 13:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL SEE A DIFFERENCE OR AT

13:57.133 --> 13:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEAST A LITTLE LESS LOW LEVEL

13:58.833 --> 13:59.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CORRUPTION BECAUSE THOSE

13:59.567 --> 14:01.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFFICERS YOU SAW WILL FEEL LIKE

14:01.067 --> 14:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELL, IF THE BIG PEOPLE CAN'T

14:03.433 --> 14:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GET AWAY FROM IT, NEITHER CAN

14:04.533 --> 14:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE.

14:05.733 --> 14:06.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: YOU ALSO HAVE

14:06.767 --> 14:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A STORY ABOUT THE ECONOMY, WHAT

14:08.033 --> 14:08.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DID YOU FIND.

14:08.567 --> 14:09.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> AS YOU MENTIONED AT THE TOP

14:09.767 --> 14:12.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THIS SEGMENT, IT'S A NATION

14:12.700 --> 14:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF SUPERLATIVES, RICHEST COUNTRY

14:14.733 --> 14:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN AFRICAN, BIGGEST OIL PRODUCER

14:16.500 --> 14:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FASTEST GROWING ECONOMY.

14:17.533 --> 14:19.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BY 2015 THERE WILL BE MORE

14:19.567 --> 14:20.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NIGERIANS THAN AMERICANS.

14:20.833 --> 14:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MIDDLE CLASS WILL GROW BY

14:22.700 --> 14:24.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EIGHT, THE MORE ULTRA RICH

14:24.000 --> 14:26.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROWING IN NIGERIA THAN THE

14:26.967 --> 14:28.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S.

14:28.167 --> 14:29.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ALSO A HUNDRED MILLION

14:29.567 --> 14:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE IN POVERTY.

14:30.500 --> 14:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THOSE

14:31.400 --> 14:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE OUT SO LONG AS YOU HAVE A

14:32.833 --> 14:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE, A LACK

14:34.933 --> 14:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF ELECTRICITY AND A LACK OF

14:37.033 --> 14:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INVESTMENT AND AGRICULTURE.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE ARE THE THREE AREAS THAT

14:39.400 --> 14:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NEW GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO

14:40.833 --> 14:42.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOCUS ON BUT AGAIN AFTER DECADES

14:42.467 --> 14:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF NEGLECT AND SOME OF THAT

14:44.400 --> 14:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CORRUPTION, IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

14:45.400 --> 14:46.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO LIFT SO MANY PEOPLE OUT OF

14:46.767 --> 14:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POVERTY.

14:47.400 --> 14:48.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: MOST OF THE

14:48.967 --> 14:49.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEADLINES FROM NIGERIA ARE

14:49.967 --> 14:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMING FROM BOKO HARAM AND YOU

14:51.833 --> 14:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE ANOTHER PIECE ON THAT.

14:54.033 --> 14:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> 6600 PEOPLE KILLED BY BOKO

14:55.633 --> 14:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARAM LAST YEAR.

14:56.233 --> 14:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS MORE THAN THE ISLAMIC

14:57.200 --> 14:57.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATE.

14:57.867 --> 14:59.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WILL GIVE YOU A SENSE OF

14:59.200 --> 15:01.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW DEADLY THAT GROUP HAS BEEN.

15:01.567 --> 15:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME GAINS IN

15:02.833 --> 15:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LAST NINE MONTHS ESPECIALLY

15:05.433 --> 15:06.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAINST BOKO HARAM.

15:06.067 --> 15:07.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NIGERIAN MILITARY MADE

15:07.567 --> 15:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GAINS.

15:07.933 --> 15:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EARLIER THEY BROUGHT IN

15:08.900 --> 15:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MERCENARIES FROM SOUTH AFRICA

15:10.433 --> 15:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES,

15:12.033 --> 15:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MILITARIES FROM CHAD, NIGER

15:16.200 --> 15:17.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND CAMAROON HAVE COME IN AND

15:17.367 --> 15:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN DOING THAT FIGHTING EARLIER

15:18.533 --> 15:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS YEAR.

15:19.100 --> 15:20.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT NOW WE ARE SEEING A LOT OF

15:20.967 --> 15:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUICIDE ATTACKS.

15:22.833 --> 15:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOKO HARAM CAN'T SEIZE AND HOLD

15:24.400 --> 15:25.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAND LIKE THEY USED TO, BUT

15:25.967 --> 15:27.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GIRLS MOSTLY ARE GOING INTO

15:27.767 --> 15:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARKETS, INTO MOSQUES AND

15:29.433 --> 15:30.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BLOWING THEMSELVES UP.

15:30.067 --> 15:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS WHY WE SEE SO MANY

15:31.900 --> 15:32.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEADLINES

15:32.567 --> 15:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEADLINES FROM OUT OF THERE.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT THE COUNTRY IS DOING IS NOT

15:35.033 --> 15:36.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONLY TRYING TO GO IN WITH THE

15:36.467 --> 15:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITARY BUT ALSO CREATE A

15:37.933 --> 15:39.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MULTINATIONAL COALITION WITH

15:39.867 --> 15:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE NEIGHBORS TO GO IN, BUT

15:41.933 --> 15:43.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT, YOU

15:43.367 --> 15:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW.

15:43.933 --> 15:45.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LOT OF THESE FIGHTERS BLEND

15:45.567 --> 15:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BACK INTO THE POPULATION AND

15:46.833 --> 15:48.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT A WHY WE ARE SEEING THESE

15:48.867 --> 15:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOMBS.

15:49.400 --> 15:50.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INITIALLY THE COUNTRY SET A

15:50.667 --> 15:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECEMBER DEADLINE TO DEFEAT BOKO

15:52.133 --> 15:53.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARAM.

15:53.067 --> 15:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MILITARY NOW ADMITS IT WON'T

15:54.900 --> 15:56.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE ABLE TO MATCH THAT EVENTUALLY

15:56.667 --> 15:57.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT THE

15:57.967 --> 15:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BATTLE AGAINST BOKO HARAM WILL

15:59.733 --> 16:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE WON BUT THE WAR AGAINST ALL

16:00.900 --> 16:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THESE OTHER THINGS, THE

16:02.833 --> 16:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POVERTY, CORRUPTION, THAT IS

16:04.200 --> 16:04.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT, THAT

16:04.967 --> 16:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL BE THE MOST DIFFICULT FOR

16:06.933 --> 16:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NIGERIA TO WIN.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YOU ALSO FOUND A POPULATION

16:09.400 --> 16:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

HARAM AND EVERYTHING ELSE, THEY

16:12.433 --> 16:14.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE WORRIED FOR THEIR LIVES JUST

16:14.067 --> 16:14.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THEY ARE GAY.

16:14.967 --> 16:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> ABSOLUTELY.

16:15.733 --> 16:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SAME SEX MARRIAGE

16:17.200 --> 16:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROHIBITION ACT WAS PASSED LAST

16:18.333 --> 16:18.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JANUARY.

16:18.967 --> 16:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS NOT ONLY GOES AFTER SAME

16:21.100 --> 16:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

NOBODY HAS BEEN PROSECUTED UNDER
