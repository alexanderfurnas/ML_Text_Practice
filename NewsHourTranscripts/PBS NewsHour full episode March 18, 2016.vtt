JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.640 --> 00:11.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: The
most wanted
fugitive from November's Paris
terrorist attack

00:11.879 --> 00:13.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is captured in a Brussels
shoot-out.

00:13.847 --> 00:20.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: The European Union reaches
a deal with
Turkey to stem the flow of
refugees coming

00:20.754 --> 00:23.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in by the thousands each day.

00:23.724 --> 00:28.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks
are here to
analyze a full week of political
news.

00:28.629 --> 00:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And how a new feature film
grapples with the
moral dilemmas of drone warfare.

00:33.300 --> 00:37.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAVIN HOOD, Director, "Eye in
the Sky": The
tiny drone flies through the
window or a door,

00:37.471 --> 00:42.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and detonates right by your
temple, or it
blows a little dose of anthrax
in your nose

00:42.643 --> 00:47.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
as it flies by. It's very
creepy, but there's
no stopping it.

00:47.681 --> 00:53.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:53.587 --> 00:55.355 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:55.455 --> 01:09.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A raid, a
shoot-out, and five
people in custody, including the
main suspect

01:09.369 --> 01:15.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Paris attacks, that chain
of events
played out late today in
Brussels, Belgium.

01:15.108 --> 01:21.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when it was over, police
proclaimed success
after a four-month manhunt.

01:21.281 --> 01:27.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The crack of gunfire in the
city's Molenbeek
neighborhood ended in the arrest
that police

01:27.854 --> 01:34.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had long sought; 26-year-old
Salah Abdeslam
was captured alive, but wounded
in the leg

01:34.962 --> 01:37.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
during the shoot-out with
police.

01:37.597 --> 01:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Belgium's prime minister made
the formal announcement.

01:39.900 --> 01:43.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES MICHEL, Belgian Prime
Minister (through
translator): I can tell you that
we have arrested

01:43.870 --> 01:48.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Abdeslam as part of an operation
linked to
an investigation on the attacks
in Paris.

01:48.742 --> 01:51.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I want to warmly thank our
security forces.

01:51.878 --> 01:59.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile,
helmeted police
with riot shields cordoned off
the area. And,

01:59.553 --> 02:05.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as darkness fell, at least one
explosion lit
up the site.

02:05.792 --> 02:11.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
French investigators say
Abdeslam was one
of several attackers who carried
out the Paris

02:11.231 --> 02:19.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rampage last November, targeting
a rock concert,
cafes, and a stadium; 130 people
died that

02:19.506 --> 02:26.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night, and hundreds more were
wounded. It
is believed that Abdeslam fled
Paris, slipped

02:26.113 --> 02:30.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through a dragnet and escaped
back to Brussels,
where the attacks had been
planned.

02:31.084 --> 02:37.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Islamic State group claimed
responsibility
for the massacre. Most of the
other suspects,

02:37.391 --> 02:43.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including one of Abdeslam's
brothers, died
that night or were killed later
by police.

02:43.897 --> 02:49.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today's raid gained momentum
after Belgian
authorities raided this
apartment in another

02:49.136 --> 02:53.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brussels neighborhood on Tuesday
and found
Abdeslam's fingerprints.

02:53.440 --> 03:00.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A man believed to be one of his
accomplices
was killed there. Two others
fled the scene,

03:00.514 --> 03:05.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of whom now appears to have
been Abdeslam
himself.

03:05.485 --> 03:09.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
French President Francois
Hollande said this
evening that the investigation
of the Paris

03:10.023 --> 03:14.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attacks is not over. He said
there will be
more arrests. We will get the
White House

03:14.127 --> 03:17.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
perspective on all of this right
after the
news summary.

03:17.731 --> 03:22.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The day's other major story also
comes from
Brussels, where European leaders
sealed a

03:22.669 --> 03:28.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deal with Turkey to stem the
tide of migrants.
It calls for sending back
thousands who reach

03:28.675 --> 03:35.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Greece. The Turkish coast guard
also moved
aggressively today to block
migrant sailings,

03:35.182 --> 03:42.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nearly swamping one boat on the
Aegean Sea.
In all, some 1,700 people were
detained. We

03:42.189 --> 03:45.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will have a full report later in
the program.

03:46.093 --> 03:51.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The corruption crisis that has
engulfed Brazil's
government deepened again today.
Riot police

03:51.765 --> 03:58.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Sao Paulo used water cannon
and pepper
spray to roust protesters ahead
of a planned

03:58.138 --> 04:04.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rally by government supporters.
The protesters
are demanding the ouster of
President Dilma

04:04.244 --> 04:06.012 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Rousseff.

04:06.113 --> 04:10.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in Iraq, thousands marched
on Baghdad's
government center, demanding
reforms to end

04:11.084 --> 04:16.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
corruption there. Riot police
stood aside
and let the demonstrators cut
through a razor

04:16.790 --> 04:22.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wire fence to get closer to the
fortified
Green Zone. There, they put up
tents and began

04:22.896 --> 04:24.698 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a sit-in.

04:24.798 --> 04:29.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PROTESTER (through translator):
We are staying
here and will not pull back. We
will stay

04:29.569 --> 04:33.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here, leaving our families and
mothers until
the corrupters leave. Are you
listening to

04:33.273 --> 04:35.008 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
me? That's it.

04:35.108 --> 04:39.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The protesters
are responding
to a call for action from
Muqtada al-Sadr,

04:39.379 --> 04:42.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an influential Shiite cleric.

04:42.182 --> 04:46.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, a crack
appeared in
Senate Republican opposition to
voting on

04:46.920 --> 04:52.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Merrick Garland, the president's
Supreme Court
nominee. Illinois Senator Mark
Kirk said today

04:52.692 --> 04:58.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he's breaking with his
party leaders.
In his words, "It's just man up
and vote."

04:58.498 --> 05:03.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Kirk faces a difficult
reelection fight in
a Democratic-leaning state.

05:03.737 --> 05:09.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street kept its rally going
today. The
Dow Jones industrial average
gained 120 points

05:09.876 --> 05:18.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to close above 17600. The Nasdaq
rose 20 points,
and the S&amp;P 500 added nine. The
Dow and the

05:18.752 --> 05:23.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
S&amp;P are now back in positive
territory for
the year.

05:23.490 --> 05:29.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for the first time, a woman
has been tapped
to lead a U.S. military combat
command. The

05:29.462 --> 05:35.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pentagon says that President
Obama will nominate
Air Force General Lori Robinson
to lead the

05:35.969 --> 05:43.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
U.S. Northern Command. It
oversees all military
activities in North America.
Robinson is currently

05:43.143 --> 05:46.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
head of U.S. air forces in the
Pacific.

05:46.179 --> 05:53.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, finally, if you had
Michigan State winning
it all in college basketball's
march madness,

05:53.253 --> 05:59.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your bracket is toast. A 15th
seed, Middle
Tennessee State, shocked the
second-seeded

05:59.793 --> 06:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Spartans today 90-81, and that
was in the
first round. It's one of the
biggest upsets

06:06.533 --> 06:10.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
since they started seeding teams
in 1985.

06:10.770 --> 06:15.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
White House
National Security Adviser Susan
Rice on the

06:15.642 --> 06:21.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Paris attacker and the
president's upcoming
visit to Cuba; what the European
Union migrant

06:21.715 --> 06:27.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deal means for the migrants
themselves; Mark
Shields and David Brooks analyze
the stop

06:27.454 --> 06:46.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump movement; a new movie on
the complications
of drone warfare; and much more.

06:46.273 --> 06:50.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama was briefed on
today's arrests
in Brussels and spoke with the
French and

06:50.744 --> 06:52.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Belgian leaders by phone.

06:53.013 --> 06:57.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We get the latest on that and
look ahead to
the president's historic trip to
Cuba with

06:57.851 --> 07:01.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
National Security Adviser Susan
Rice.

07:01.321 --> 07:03.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome back to the program.

07:03.623 --> 07:08.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Susan Rice, first of all, tell
us about the
U.S. role in helping the French
and Belgian

07:08.662 --> 07:10.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
authorities locate these people
in Brussels.

07:10.864 --> 07:14.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN RICE, U.S. National
Security Adviser:
Well, Judy, it needs to be said,
as the president

07:14.634 --> 07:20.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did to the prime minister of
Belgium and the
president of France, it's really
the services

07:20.674 --> 07:26.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Belgium and France that
deserve the lion's
share of the credit here. And
congratulations

07:26.146 --> 07:30.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on a well-executed operation.
This is their
day.

07:30.617 --> 07:36.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, indeed, since the Paris
attacks, actually,
well before the Paris attacks,
but especially

07:36.756 --> 07:42.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after the Paris attacks, the
United States
has stepped up its intelligence
and law enforcement

07:43.063 --> 07:48.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cooperation with our European
partners, the
French in particular, but many
other Europeans

07:48.401 --> 07:50.203 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as well.

07:50.303 --> 07:55.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we are sharing information
and supporting
each other in ways that are
unprecedented.

07:55.842 --> 08:01.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I can't get into think any
specifics about
this operation, and it's an
ongoing investigation,

08:01.581 --> 08:03.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as you understand.

08:03.416 --> 08:07.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do think it's important to
give the
Belgian authorities and the
French authorities

08:07.620 --> 08:09.389 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their due today.

08:09.489 --> 08:13.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How much of a
threat from the
Islamic State does this take off
the table?

08:13.159 --> 08:18.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What does the U.S. now have less
to worry
about as a result of this, would
you say?

08:18.365 --> 08:23.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN RICE: Well, Judy,
obviously, this is
a good development, but it is
far from a turning

08:23.737 --> 08:25.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
point in the fight against ISIL.

08:25.905 --> 08:32.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We are engaged in a
multifaceted, comprehensive
campaign to degrade and defeat
ISIL, and we

08:32.545 --> 08:36.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have seen important progress,
but by no means
can we look at today and say we
have turned

08:36.783 --> 08:38.618 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a corner.

08:38.718 --> 08:41.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I want to
ask you about
that, because the president told
Jeffrey Goldberg

08:41.221 --> 08:47.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a series of interviews with
"The Atlantic"
that he doesn't see ISIS, or
ISIL, as an existential

08:47.193 --> 08:49.095 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
threat to the United States.

08:49.195 --> 08:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Jeffrey Goldberg reported
that the president
has said to the White House
staff that more

08:52.966 --> 08:58.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people have to worry about falls
in bathtubs
and car accidents and gun
shootings than they

08:58.905 --> 09:03.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do terrorists. So, how much
should Americans
fear ISIS?

09:03.343 --> 09:07.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN RICE: Well, what is an
existential threat,
Judy? That's something that can
literally

09:07.414 --> 09:15.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
destroy our nation as we know
it, physically
and otherwise. So, I think
that's a very valid

09:15.288 --> 09:17.123 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
statement.

09:17.223 --> 09:22.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that doesn't mean ISIL can't
conduct attacks
and do Americans harm, whether
abroad or at

09:22.395 --> 09:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
home. And, obviously, we have
every interest
and the president is fully
committed to doing

09:27.700 --> 09:35.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all that we possibly can to
defeat ISIL, because,
like al-Qaida, it is a threat
that we must

09:35.708 --> 09:43.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
guard against and that it can do
real harm
to Americans and our allies, not
to mention

09:43.249 --> 09:45.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the countries in which it is
rampaging.

09:45.585 --> 09:52.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have every interest in
putting all
of our efforts and that of our
coalition partners

09:52.392 --> 09:57.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
behind the fight against ISIL.
And Americans
should take that threat
seriously, but we

09:57.230 --> 10:04.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also shouldn't overblow it and
turn ISIL into
the equivalent of the Soviet
Union at the

10:04.904 --> 10:08.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
height of the Cold War. That is
not a fair
comparison.

10:08.274 --> 10:11.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me turn the
corner to Cuba.

10:11.277 --> 10:16.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president is going to make
this historic
visit this weekend, the first
visit by an

10:16.249 --> 10:22.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American president there since
Calvin Coolidge.
How close does President Obama
want relations

10:22.188 --> 10:24.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be between the U.S. and Cuba?

10:24.357 --> 10:27.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN RICE: Well, Judy, it's not
about how
close.

10:27.227 --> 10:33.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, obviously, this is a
very new diplomatic
relationship. It's just begun in
the last

10:33.500 --> 10:38.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
several months. Normalization is
at the early
stages, and it's going to take
time. There

10:38.705 --> 10:42.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are real differences that remain
between our
governments and our systems.

10:43.076 --> 10:46.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we're not going to be
best friends.
That's not what we're talking
about here.

10:46.746 --> 10:54.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it is about moving out of a
50-year failed
policy that yielded no change
towards an era

10:54.821 --> 10:59.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of engagement, which we're
confident, over
time, will open up society in
Cuba.

10:59.225 --> 11:04.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But at the people-to-people
level, we think
that there is a natural affinity
between the

11:04.364 --> 11:06.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people of Cuba and the people of
the United
States.

11:06.165 --> 11:10.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking of
what you
just mentioned, what do you say
who oppose

11:10.203 --> 11:15.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this kind of normalization with
Cuba who say
what's happened here is that the
U.S. has

11:15.542 --> 11:20.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
given in, has made concessions
on things like
travel and trade, while the
Cubans have done

11:20.613 --> 11:24.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
almost nothing when it comes to
human rights
and democracy, in other words,
that the U.S.

11:24.617 --> 11:26.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has done more giving than the
Cubans?

11:27.020 --> 11:30.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN RICE: Well, Judy, what we
would say
is, first of all, it is not a
concession to

11:31.057 --> 11:35.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allow U.S. businesses to operate
and compete
in Cuba, when our partners have
been doing

11:35.995 --> 11:37.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
so for many years.

11:37.931 --> 11:42.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's not a concession for
Americans to travel.
That is in our interest. Our
view is, rather

11:42.769 --> 11:47.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than continue to do the same
failed thing
over and over again and hope for
a different

11:47.740 --> 11:52.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
result, instead, we should do
what has worked
in so many other contexts around
the world,

11:52.979 --> 11:58.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is to give the Cuban
people the opportunity
to engage with American
ingenuity, American

11:58.284 --> 12:06.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
entrepreneurs, American civil
society leaders,
and to see through that
engagement a future

12:07.060 --> 12:12.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that they only -- only
themselves can bring
to Cuba over the long term.

12:12.932 --> 12:16.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama's
national
security adviser, Susan Rice, we
thank you.

12:16.669 --> 12:18.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUSAN RICE: It's good to be with
you, Judy.

12:18.738 --> 12:33.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We return to the
major European-Turkish
agreement on how to cope with
the refugee

12:33.353 --> 12:34.187 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
crisis.

12:34.287 --> 12:36.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

12:36.155 --> 12:40.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Under the deal
agreed to today,
Turkey will take back Syrian
refugees now

12:40.460 --> 12:45.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Greece, Europe will accept
some refugees
now in Turkey, and Turkey will
get financial

12:45.832 --> 12:48.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and closer travel and political
ties to Europe.

12:48.901 --> 12:54.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Joining us from Brussels,
Matthew Karnitschnig,
chief Europe correspondent for
Politico, and

12:54.807 --> 12:57.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Copenhagen, the "NewsHour"'s
Malcolm Brabant.

12:57.744 --> 12:58.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to both of you.

12:58.645 --> 13:00.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Matthew, let me start with you.

13:00.580 --> 13:05.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for Europe, the idea is
fewer refugees
and a more orderly process. How
is this supposed

13:05.752 --> 13:07.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to work? Fill in the details a
bit.

13:07.654 --> 13:10.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW KARNITSCHNIG, Politico:
Well, at the
core of this deal is this
mechanism that you

13:10.356 --> 13:17.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mentioned whereby the Turks will
take back
all Syrian refugees who arrive
in Greece,

13:17.230 --> 13:24.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, in return, the Europeans
would take a
certain number, one to one,
essentially, of

13:24.103 --> 13:27.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Syrian refugees now in
Turkey.

13:27.306 --> 13:33.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The idea is this would undermine
the smugglers'
trade, which is responsible for
bringing all

13:33.279 --> 13:39.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of these refugees in rubber
rafts and so forth
to Greece at the moment, and
Angela Merkel

13:39.619 --> 13:45.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the other European leaders
hope that this
will convince Syrians and other
migrants not

13:45.825 --> 13:49.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to come to Europe in the first
place, that
they will see that it's
pointless to try to

13:50.063 --> 13:53.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
come with the smugglers because
they will
automatically be sent back.

13:53.232 --> 13:57.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But, Malcolm, of
course, sending
these back, all those people
stranded in Greece,

13:57.704 --> 14:01.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
raises enormous logistical and
legal challenges,
right?

14:01.174 --> 14:05.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have already had a lot of
criticism on
the legal side from Amnesty
International,

14:05.978 --> 14:09.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees. How
hard will this be to do?

14:09.148 --> 14:12.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This is going
to be extremely
difficult to implement. It's
going to be a

14:12.919 --> 14:14.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
logistical nightmare.

14:14.821 --> 14:18.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trying to deport thousands of
people is going
to be a huge task that is going
to create

14:18.758 --> 14:22.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some really ugly scenes, because
you have
got these people who have spent
thousands

14:23.029 --> 14:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of dollars getting to Greece
suddenly facing
the prospect of being sent back.

14:26.966 --> 14:30.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're not going to meekly and
mildly. There
are going to be fights and
struggles going

14:31.003 --> 14:35.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on in these various places. Now,
what's supposed
to also happen is that these
people are supposed

14:35.208 --> 14:39.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to also have their appeals for
asylum being
fast-tracked.

14:39.145 --> 14:43.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Greece has got a dreadful
reputation for
trying to fast-track anything.
Trying to determine

14:43.649 --> 14:50.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether or not somebody is a
serious asylum-seeker,
a justified asylum-seeker, is
something that's

14:50.223 --> 14:54.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
supposed to happen almost
instantly, especially
as the UNHCR, for example, is
saying that

14:54.827 --> 14:57.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
everybody needs to have the
right to appeal.

14:57.663 --> 14:59.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I foresee chaos in the Greek
islands.

14:59.866 --> 15:05.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so,
Matthew, are there
any plans in the details what
more Europe

15:05.404 --> 15:10.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is planning to do to make the
process work
better? And also explain to what
is -- from

15:10.343 --> 15:12.645 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Turkish side, what's in it
for them?

15:12.745 --> 15:15.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW KARNITSCHNIG: Well, the
Europeans
are saying now they recognize,
of course,

15:15.915 --> 15:20.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Greece, which is in the
midst of this
economic crisis, really an
economic depression,

15:20.920 --> 15:25.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not going to be able to
handle this problem
alone. They don't have the
administration

15:25.491 --> 15:27.460 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to deal with this many refugees.

15:27.560 --> 15:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the Brussels bureaucrats, if
you will,
are saying they will send down
to up to 4,000

15:34.333 --> 15:40.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officials, judges, interpreters,
and so forth
to deal with these processes
that they need

15:40.873 --> 15:49.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to introduce here in terms of
dealing with
the asylum applicants and
ensuring that they

15:49.649 --> 15:55.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
get a fair review of their case.

15:55.555 --> 15:59.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But to think that this is going
to happen
within 48 hours, because they're
also saying

15:59.325 --> 16:05.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they want to introduce this
program starting
on Sunday, is somewhat
ambitious, to put it

16:05.731 --> 16:11.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mildly. So, there is a lot of
skepticism here
in Brussels and elsewhere in
Europe about

16:11.137 --> 16:16.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether this plan is going to be
dead on arrival,
essentially.

16:16.309 --> 16:21.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's in it for the Turks is
that the Turks
get visa liberalization, as
they're calling

16:21.747 --> 16:26.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it, which means that Turkish
citizens, if
they meet a number of -- if
Turkey meets a

16:26.385 --> 16:32.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
number of requirements in the
coming months,
will be able to travel into the
E.U. without

16:32.124 --> 16:38.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
visas, which would be a huge
political win
for Turkish President Erdogan,
who has really

16:38.764 --> 16:46.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been trying to show to his
people that, despite
all of the criticism of Turkey
and his rule

16:46.172 --> 16:51.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Turkey, his increasingly
authoritarian
rule, many people say, that they
are still

16:51.744 --> 16:54.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
part of the West, that the West
still accepts
them and takes them seriously.

16:55.081 --> 17:00.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, Malcolm,
you have reported
from Turkey. You have been
talking to people

17:00.620 --> 17:06.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there. Well, is it likely that
this would
discourage people from making
the trip at

17:06.525 --> 17:08.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this point, and what are you
hearing from
Turkey now?

17:08.494 --> 17:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Well, I was
talking to a
refugee organization boss in
Izmir, which

17:13.766 --> 17:17.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is -- used to be the main
smuggling zone.

17:17.270 --> 17:21.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is a town that was
normally thriving
with smugglers and with Syrians
and other

17:21.674 --> 17:26.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
refugees coming to try to get a
deal to try
to get across the Aegean. But in
the past

17:26.112 --> 17:30.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
couple of weeks, the Turks have
cracked town,
the smugglers have all gone, and
all of the

17:30.816 --> 17:35.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would-be asylum seekers are
hiding in forests
along the coast or in safe
houses.

17:35.154 --> 17:39.358 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
Now, this is a
multibillion-dollar business.
The smugglers aren't going to
take this lying

17:39.458 --> 17:42.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down. They want to make that
sort of money.
And so they're going to be
looking for other

17:42.528 --> 17:45.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
routes, possibly land routes,
through to Europe.

17:45.898 --> 17:50.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I have been talking to other
people, for
example, refugees who are stuck
in Greece.

17:50.770 --> 17:55.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one man in particular,
Edriss Bayat, that
we have looked at, we have met
before on the

17:55.374 --> 18:02.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"NewsHour," he's a former NATO
employee from
Afghanistan, now, he's at the
former Athens

18:02.548 --> 18:04.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
airport, where -- along with
lots of other
refugees.

18:04.383 --> 18:08.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The one thing that he's been
worried about
more than anything else is
deportation. But,

18:08.587 --> 18:13.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
under this deal, he's not going
to be deported,
but he, along with about 50,000
other people

18:13.359 --> 18:16.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are currently stranded in
Greece, nobody's
really certain what is going to
happen to

18:16.796 --> 18:18.564 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

18:18.664 --> 18:21.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Greece could become a
detention camp for
these people, although Europe is
saying, for

18:21.100 --> 18:25.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
example, that some of these
people will be
shared around other European
countries. But

18:25.438 --> 18:27.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so far, that is something that
has not happened.

18:28.007 --> 18:32.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Malcolm Brabant
in Copenhagen
and Matthew Karnitschnig in
Brussels, thank

18:32.945 --> 18:45.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you both very much.

18:45.891 --> 18:47.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And now to politics.

18:47.760 --> 18:53.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The rift in the Republican Party
over Donald
Trump shows no signs of mending.
Just today,

18:53.132 --> 18:57.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
former Republican presidential
nominee Mitt
Romney announced on social media
that he will

18:57.803 --> 19:01.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vote for Senator Ted Cruz in the
Utah caucuses
next Tuesday.

19:01.974 --> 19:07.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, as Trump marches
closer to the
1,200-plus delegates he needs to
secure the

19:07.580 --> 19:13.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
party's nomination, some party
operatives
are scrambling for an
alternative. On Thursday,

19:13.419 --> 19:18.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a group of conservative GOP
activists held
a closed-door meeting here in
Washington to

19:18.858 --> 19:21.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
discuss how to block Trump from
the nomination.

19:21.660 --> 19:26.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here's Erick Erickson, who was
one of the
meeting's organizers, on FOX
Business News

19:26.265 --> 19:28.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Thursday:

19:28.200 --> 19:29.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERICK ERICKSON, Editor in Chief,
RedState.Com:
The Republicans, if they
nominate Donald Trump,

19:30.069 --> 19:33.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are going to nominate the only
politician
in America more unpopular and
less trustworthy

19:33.973 --> 19:37.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than Hillary Clinton. That's not
where you
start when you want to beat
Hillary Clinton.

19:37.576 --> 19:40.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that's the reality of that
with him, and
I'm not going to play a part of
it.

19:40.579 --> 19:45.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For his part, a
Trump policy
adviser pushed back today with a
warning for

19:45.785 --> 19:47.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Republican Party.

19:47.319 --> 19:50.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here is what Sam Clovis had to
say on CNN's
"NEW DAY":

19:50.790 --> 19:53.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SAM CLOVIS, Donald Trump
National Campaign
Co-Chair: I will tell you this.
If the Republican

19:53.926 --> 19:59.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Party comes into that
convention, and jimmies
with the rules and takes away
the will of

19:59.598 --> 20:04.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the people, the will of the
Republicans and
the Democrats and independents
who voted for

20:04.970 --> 20:10.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump, I will take off my
credentials,
I will leave the floor of that
convention,

20:10.109 --> 20:12.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and I will leave the Republican
Party forever.

20:12.611 --> 20:17.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that brings
us to the analysis
of Shields and Brooks. That's
syndicated columnist

20:17.917 --> 20:21.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and New York Times
columnist
David Brooks.

20:21.120 --> 20:27.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, gentlemen, with that gentle
note to end
this week, David, where does the
Republican

20:27.560 --> 20:28.994 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
contest stand?

20:29.095 --> 20:31.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I'm trembling at
the loss of
Sam Clovis from the ranks.

20:31.630 --> 20:33.365 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

20:33.466 --> 20:36.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Trump is looking
like the nominee.
I mean, he had this great night.
He -- if

20:36.836 --> 20:41.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he continues as he has been
going right now
-- and my paper reported -- our
Upshot department

20:41.474 --> 20:45.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reported he will get the -- what
he needs.
So he's looking like he can get
it.

20:45.911 --> 20:51.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are two ways he cannot get
it. One,
maybe if Kasich drops out, there
are some

20:51.183 --> 20:55.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
polls that show if Cruz is one
on one, he
could make some inroads into
Trump. And then

20:55.287 --> 20:59.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something behind the scenes or
something -- fiddling
with the rules. I, of course,
think they should

20:59.725 --> 21:01.527 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do it.

21:01.627 --> 21:04.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But one of the features of this
year is that
Donald Trump has a monopoly on
audacity and

21:05.064 --> 21:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's the only one who takes
action. So, what's
interesting to me about the
Republicans right

21:08.033 --> 21:13.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now is, with the exception of
Florida Governor
Rick Scott and Chris Christie,
they're not

21:13.372 --> 21:16.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
flocking to Trump. They do not
like the guy.
They're terrorized of the guy.
They're repulsed

21:16.942 --> 21:18.777 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by the guy.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they're not flocking to him,
but they're
not doing anything against him
either. They're

21:20.679 --> 21:23.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
just sitting there like a
psychologically
depleted party.

21:23.516 --> 21:29.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, where does
that leave -- so
that, Mark, he just marches on
to Cleveland

21:29.755 --> 21:30.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and the nomination.

21:30.389 --> 21:32.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: He does.

21:32.424 --> 21:38.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What conservative philosopher
and columnist
George Will called the most
gifted and diversified

21:38.164 --> 21:45.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
field of Republican candidates
since 1865
is now down essentially to two,
to Donald

21:45.304 --> 21:54.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Trump and Ted Cruz, the
quintessential conservative
who cannot be nominated and
cannot win. And

21:54.246 --> 21:56.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's where the Republicans
are.

21:56.115 --> 22:00.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump, let it be said in
his behalf,
has won this nomination. I mean,
the people

22:01.086 --> 22:06.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are trying to take it away
from him have
won nothing. I mean, John Kasich
has won one

22:06.192 --> 22:10.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
primary, half as many as Marco
Rubio won,
I think, contests.

22:10.362 --> 22:16.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I mean, you know, but he's
won, and he's
won everywhere. I mean, it's
been across the

22:16.268 --> 22:21.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
board. I mean, this is a -- it's
been an open
assault upon the establishment,
and he has

22:21.874 --> 22:23.709 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
captured it.

22:23.809 --> 22:30.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I just think that, you know,
Lindsey Graham,
a man occasionally known for
spreading the

22:30.349 --> 22:35.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ugly truth, said it's -- a
choice between
Cruz and Trump is the choice
between being

22:35.988 --> 22:40.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
poisoned and being shot. And I
think that's
where sort of the paralysis that
David...

22:40.459 --> 22:41.260 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

22:41.360 --> 22:42.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And he chose
poison.

22:42.595 --> 22:43.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And then he went
on to choose
Cruz.

22:43.829 --> 22:44.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: He did. He chose
arsenic over
-- yes.

22:44.697 --> 22:45.331 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

22:45.431 --> 22:47.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: That's right.

22:47.399 --> 22:51.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But if Trump has
won it, then,
David, is there any sign of
Republican -- I

22:51.203 --> 22:56.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know you said he's not getting
the big endorsements,
but is it that Republicans are
not listening

22:56.242 --> 22:58.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to the voters? What's the
disconnect here?

22:59.011 --> 23:00.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

23:00.946 --> 23:04.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, first of all, in the big
Tuesday states,
40 percent of voters in most of
the states

23:04.250 --> 23:08.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said, if Trump were the nominee,
they'd consider
a third party. And so that's
some serious

23:08.153 --> 23:11.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disaffection. You do not see
that. Usually,
people are rallying around at
this point.

23:11.790 --> 23:16.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, secondly, there are a lot
of Republicans,
including myself, who find him
morally repulsive.

23:16.428 --> 23:19.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's just not -- there are
some things
more important things than
winning an election.

23:19.598 --> 23:23.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And supporting a guy who tears
at the social
fabric, who insults the office
of the presidency

23:23.969 --> 23:29.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by completely unprepared for it,
who plays
on bigotry and fear, who is the
sort of demagogue

23:29.241 --> 23:33.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our founders feared would upset
the American
experiment in self-government,
well, that

23:33.679 --> 23:35.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kind of guy, you just can't
support, even
if it means a defeat.

23:35.881 --> 23:39.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think a lot of Republicans
feel that
way, which is why you get those
40 percent

23:39.118 --> 23:40.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
numbers of defectors.

23:41.020 --> 23:44.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Mark, are
the two of you
saying that literally there is
no -- I know

23:44.923 --> 23:46.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
David said, if something
happened and...

23:47.059 --> 23:48.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Sure.

23:48.927 --> 23:51.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, I mean, are
you saying
the odds are just very much
against any...

23:51.330 --> 23:52.998 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

23:53.098 --> 23:55.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Oh, no, I think
the momentum
is with him. I think the numbers
are with

23:55.167 --> 23:57.069 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
him, Judy.

23:57.169 --> 24:01.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy, probably it hasn't been
totaled up yet,
but a good bet is there was $20
million spent

24:01.206 --> 24:09.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against Donald Trump in Florida,
$20 million
in negative campaign ads that
went from calling

24:09.348 --> 24:14.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him -- one group, secretive
group associated
with the Koch brothers called
him a wealthy

24:14.653 --> 24:16.388 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
draft dodger.

24:16.488 --> 24:20.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have never mentioned --
they never used
that term about Dick Cheney, but
then they

24:20.626 --> 24:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
called Trump University a scam
and accused
him of being just a scurrilous,
unprincipled

24:27.833 --> 24:34.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
person. And all this, and it
apparently -- you
know, if anything, it didn't lay
a glove on

24:34.506 --> 24:36.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him, and, if anything, increased
his numbers.

24:36.875 --> 24:45.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, he has a constituency
that is indifferent
to such charges. So, I don't
know what would

24:45.250 --> 24:50.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be revealed. I mean, there has
been enough
already revealed about him and
understood

24:50.189 --> 24:52.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that would kill any other
candidate.

24:52.257 --> 24:52.725 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

24:52.825 --> 24:54.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

24:54.693 --> 24:56.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, with that
and with the
talk about a whether you call it
a contested

24:56.829 --> 25:02.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
convention or an open
convention, is there
a scenario under which the
people who voted

25:02.735 --> 25:09.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for Donald Trump or his
delegates would go
along with some other plan, some
other result

25:09.341 --> 25:11.243 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at a convention?

25:11.343 --> 25:13.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: It's hard to
imagine, unless
there was something -- again,
he's like Rasputin.

25:13.979 --> 25:17.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As Mark said, he just doesn't go
away. He
doesn't die.

25:17.383 --> 25:21.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unless somehow something came up
that we don't
know about that -- where they
lost faith,

25:21.320 --> 25:25.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where they lost heart. But at
this point,
it's hard to see it. He looks
very much like

25:25.891 --> 25:30.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the nominee. And, as Mark said,
we have treated
this -- everyone says, oh, what
a crazy year.

25:30.162 --> 25:32.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's so unexpected. He's been
ahead for eight
months.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.932 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sure.

25:34.032 --> 25:35.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And only it's
because of the
ignorance of people like me, who
didn't see

25:35.901 --> 25:38.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that he's ahead for eight
months, so it's
a very simple storyline. He's
been ahead for

25:38.370 --> 25:40.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
eight months. He's still ahead.

25:40.272 --> 25:44.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that's been very stable.
We all expected
him to explode. The only
surprise is, this

25:44.910 --> 25:47.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has been so linear for him.

25:47.346 --> 25:54.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes. No, there is
always the
blockbuster, the screenplay that
reveals something

25:54.887 --> 25:58.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about him, that he's got eight
secret families
or something of the sort.

25:58.223 --> 25:59.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Somebody steps
out from behind
a curtain.

26:00.025 --> 26:04.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes. No, but I
just think everything
is headed in his direction.

26:04.296 --> 26:07.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's turn
to the Democrats.

26:07.199 --> 26:12.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton is way ahead,
David, in terms
of delegates, but Bernie Sanders
-- and Bernie

26:12.271 --> 26:16.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders didn't win any primaries
this week,
but he's campaigning hard and he
says he's

26:16.608 --> 26:20.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
going all the way to
Philadelphia, to the
Democratic Convention.

26:20.712 --> 26:23.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is that -- I mean, what do
we have here
on the Democratic side?

26:23.882 --> 26:27.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I think the
Democratic
side is even more ironed shut
down than the

26:27.719 --> 26:29.455 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Republican side.

26:29.555 --> 26:31.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think she's on a march. And
she got has
nearly twice the number of
delegates he has

26:32.057 --> 26:36.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got. And she's just been very
solid in her
demographics. Now, she's
amazingly weak outside

26:37.095 --> 26:40.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of her demographics. Among young
people, he's
getting like 80 percent in some
states. It's

26:40.899 --> 26:41.567 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
amazing.

26:41.667 --> 26:43.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right. Yes.

26:43.569 --> 26:48.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: And among
minorities, she's
very solid. Among middle class,
among moderate

26:48.207 --> 26:51.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democratic voters, she's very
solid and she's
holding her people.

26:51.243 --> 26:54.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that is what is
frustrating for
Sanders. She's a fox, and he's a
hedgehog.

26:54.913 --> 26:59.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She knows a lot of things. He
knows one thing
and he keeps repeating it and
repeating it.

26:59.117 --> 27:02.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He doesn't adjust tactics. He
doesn't shift.
He's just doing that thing.

27:02.955 --> 27:07.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that thing wins over a
certain demographic,
young people and the left, but
there just

27:07.326 --> 27:10.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aren't enough of those people to
knock her
off. And so I think she's
looking -- she's

27:10.629 --> 27:11.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sitting very pretty now.

27:11.897 --> 27:13.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You see any way
he could pull
this off?

27:13.732 --> 27:17.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, again, when
you have two
candidates in a race, yes, there
is always

27:17.703 --> 27:22.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a possibility. I recall rather
vividly eight
years ago, when she was asked if
she was going

27:22.975 --> 27:29.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get out, and she said, no,
anything can
happen in a race when there is
two people.

27:29.515 --> 27:36.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Bernie Sanders has run an
absolutely exceptional
campaign, and continues to do.
He has dominated

27:36.855 --> 27:40.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- as Donald Trump has dominated
the dialogue
and the debate on the Republican
side and

27:41.059 --> 27:44.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gotten the attention, he has
totally dominated
the debate on the Democratic
side. He has

27:44.696 --> 27:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
moved her on trade, on the TPP.

27:48.333 --> 27:53.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has moved her on preserving
Social Security.
She's now pledged to not
touching a single

27:53.872 --> 27:57.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hair on the gray hair on the
beautiful head
of Social Security. That had
been a traditional

27:58.010 --> 28:03.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democratic sort of moderate
position, or new
Democrats, that you had to limit
entitlements.

28:03.682 --> 28:08.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I mean, Bernie, he is -- he
has really
been the driving force in this
campaign. David's

28:08.887 --> 28:13.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right; 80 percent of voters
under the age
of 30 supported him in several
states. And

28:13.725 --> 28:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he came back. You know, I was
thinking of
Massachusetts, where, in 2008,
Barack Obama

28:21.500 --> 28:26.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had the support of Governor
Deval Patrick
and Ted Kennedy, and he still
lost by 15 points

28:26.738 --> 28:28.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to Hillary Clinton.

28:28.674 --> 28:32.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He almost beat her there. And
he's won a number
of states. And what lies ahead,
he's quite

28:33.011 --> 28:40.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
confident. So I just -- he has
four million
individual contributions. So,
he's given the

28:40.252 --> 28:43.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
party a lot of energy. I don't
think he's
got dreams that he's going to be
the nominee

28:43.755 --> 28:47.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at this point, but I think he's
got -- he's
leading a cause.

28:47.693 --> 28:53.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama's
nominee to
the Supreme Court to take the
spot that Justice

28:53.332 --> 28:57.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scalia, the late Justice Scalia
had, David,
Merrick Garland, what do make of
the choice,

28:58.003 --> 29:00.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and what does it say about what
the president
wants on the court?

29:00.739 --> 29:04.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, frankly, I
think it's
an excellent choice. He's a guy
with apparently

29:04.176 --> 29:07.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an amazing temperament. He is
the model of
judicial restraint.

29:07.813 --> 29:13.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He seems to be a man of both
amazing integrity
and capacity to be emotionally
moved. And

29:13.185 --> 29:14.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so everything I hear about him
is superlative.

29:14.953 --> 29:19.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, if I'm a Republican,
frankly, running
the Senate, I'm thinking, this
is the best

29:19.257 --> 29:24.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm going to get. And if Donald
Trump is down
15 points in the summer or fall,
I would confirm

29:24.663 --> 29:28.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
this guy, because Hillary
Clinton, if she
gets elected, who knows what the
Senate will

29:28.400 --> 29:31.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
look like. It will be, from a
Republican point
of view, a lot worse.

29:31.403 --> 29:36.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think Republicans should
say, OK, we
will take this guy, because he's
-- from their

29:36.375 --> 29:38.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
point of view, he's a model of
restraint.

29:38.410 --> 29:39.878 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

29:39.978 --> 29:43.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I agree and echo
what David
has said about Judge Garland.

29:43.849 --> 29:51.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, Judy, the knocks on him
from the liberal
side is, A, he's a white male.
And, you know,

29:51.957 --> 29:57.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you have to have somebody who's,
I don't know
what, biracial or something
else.

29:57.462 --> 29:59.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But he's too much
of a centrist.

29:59.297 --> 30:03.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That he -- and
he's 63 years
old, which doesn't seem old at
all to me.

30:03.568 --> 30:05.337 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

30:05.437 --> 30:08.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: But -- no, but the
irony here
is, I think the Republicans have
put themselves

30:08.573 --> 30:10.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a terrible position. I really
do.

30:10.776 --> 30:15.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, before the body was cold
of Judge
Scalia, before his family had
been told, Mitch

30:15.580 --> 30:21.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
McConnell tried to head off a
charge from
the conservative insurgents
against the establishment

30:21.119 --> 30:25.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they weren't sufficiently
conservative
enough, so they are going to
earn that.

30:25.490 --> 30:30.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have taken a position
basically that
comes down to this. Barack Obama
is the only

30:30.762 --> 30:36.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president since World War II
other than Dwight
Eisenhower to twice win 51
percent of the

30:36.468 --> 30:40.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
popular vote. And what they want
to say is,
he's got a three-year term for
his second

30:40.472 --> 30:42.107 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
term.

30:42.207 --> 30:46.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, by that logic, that logic,
the people
should decide. The 24 Republican
senators

30:46.111 --> 30:50.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are up for reelection this
year shouldn't
vote on anything between now and
November,

30:50.749 --> 30:55.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
until the people have spoken. I
mean, so I
just really think they have
taken a terrible

30:55.987 --> 31:00.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
political position, and I think
it's increasingly
unpopular and eventually
unsustainable.

31:00.358 --> 31:03.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, their
defense -- in their
defense, the Republicans, David,
are saying,

31:04.096 --> 31:11.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well, but this is to replace
Antonin Scalia,
who was standard-bearer,
conservative for,

31:11.236 --> 31:14.106 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what, 25 years on the court.

31:14.206 --> 31:18.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, but I agree
with Mark philosophically.
You are elected for four years
and you get

31:18.744 --> 31:20.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to nominate for four years.

31:20.645 --> 31:23.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some people -- Justice Marshall
in the old
days, under John Adams, I think
it was, was

31:24.082 --> 31:25.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
nominated in a lame-duck
section.

31:25.283 --> 31:27.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.

31:27.152 --> 31:29.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And so that's the
constitutional
historical precedent. So,
philosophically,

31:29.387 --> 31:31.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think Mark is right.

31:31.289 --> 31:34.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Politically, I can't imagine
Republicans will
pay a price for it. I do not
think there are

31:34.593 --> 31:38.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a lot of voters out there
thinking, oh, you
have got to give this guy a
hearing. I just

31:38.296 --> 31:42.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't think it's a voting issue.
So I do not
think Republicans will be
compelled to fold

31:42.734 --> 31:44.636 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on this one.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does it matter
for the court
that it sits with eight members
until whenever?

31:47.038 --> 31:49.407 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, of course.

31:49.508 --> 31:50.776 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

31:50.876 --> 31:56.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: A closed mind is a
terrible
thing to tamper with.

31:56.281 --> 31:58.049 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

31:58.150 --> 32:01.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, I mean, I
think it will
-- it puts people like Kelly
Ayotte in New

32:01.720 --> 32:08.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hampshire on the defensive. It
puts Rob Portman
on the defensive. Already, Mark
Kirk has changed.

32:08.827 --> 32:12.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just think that states like
that -- I mean,
Chuck Grassley is looking like a
tower of

32:12.898 --> 32:13.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jell-O at this point.

32:14.099 --> 32:15.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

32:15.700 --> 32:26.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On that note,
Mark Shields,
David Brooks, thank you both.

32:26.978 --> 32:36.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A movie thriller being released
nationally
today delves into the practical,
legal and

32:36.488 --> 32:39.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
moral issues surrounding drone
warfare.

32:40.091 --> 32:41.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown is back with that.

32:41.693 --> 32:44.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTOR: What's the plan, Captain?

32:44.496 --> 32:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HELEN MIRREN, Actress: We need
to put a Hellfire
through that roof right now.

32:48.166 --> 32:53.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's a new kind
of warfare,
advanced technology that tracks,
identifies,

32:53.572 --> 32:58.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and has the power to destroy
enemies by remote
control from thousands of miles
away.

32:58.310 --> 33:01.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HELEN MIRREN: We have two
suicide vests with
explosives inside that house.

33:01.813 --> 33:07.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But as the film
"Eye in the
Sky" asks, should it be used? If
so, when,

33:07.419 --> 33:09.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
especially if innocent lives may
also be taken?

33:09.821 --> 33:13.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HELEN MIRREN: Harold, this is a
very time-sensitive
target. Do I have authority to
strike?

33:13.625 --> 33:17.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACTOR: The rules of engagement
you're operating
under only allow for a low
collateral damage

33:17.162 --> 33:17.629 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
estimate.

33:17.729 --> 33:19.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ACTRESS: Yes. Yes.

33:19.698 --> 33:22.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The film follows
British military
commanders, including Helen
Mirren as Colonel

33:22.500 --> 33:28.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Katherine Powell, as they debate
with Cabinet
officers and politicians over a
strike against

33:28.340 --> 33:33.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Al-Shabaab terrorists in
Nairobi, Kenya, who
appear to be on the verge of a
suicide bombing.

33:33.311 --> 33:35.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACTOR: I told you, they came to
witness a
capture, not a kill. Give me a
capture option.

33:36.014 --> 33:41.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HELEN MIRREN: We no longer have
a capture
option. Any action on the ground
will lead

33:41.386 --> 33:44.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to an armed confrontation, which
we will not
be able to contain.

33:44.856 --> 33:49.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Director Gavin
Hood, who joined
us recently at the E Street
Cinema in Washington,

33:50.028 --> 33:51.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has the action play out in real
time.

33:52.097 --> 33:56.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAVIN HOOD, Director, "Eye in
the Sky": We
wanted to immerse the audience
in a real operation.

33:56.368 --> 34:04.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we wanted the audience to
feel as if they
were participating in that
operation.

34:04.910 --> 34:08.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a very strange world that
we're moving
into, this world of drone
warfare, automated

34:08.813 --> 34:12.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
warfare, where our soldiers,
we're trying
to take them off the battlefield
in order

34:12.617 --> 34:18.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to minimize our casualties. And
yet the battlefield
is still a very real place for
those we target.

34:18.423 --> 34:24.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the questions of when to
target, who
to target, what might the
fallout, blowback

34:24.863 --> 34:27.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
are not theoretical or
touchy-feely. They
matter.

34:27.799 --> 34:33.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The film presents
a dramatic
complication. A young girl who

AARON PAUL, Actor: Ma'am, I need
you to run
the collateral damage estimate
again with

34:50.622 --> 34:52.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this girl out front.

not changed,
Lieutenant. You are cleared to
engage.

GAVIN HOOD: If we're going to
confront this
question, let's take it to the
wire. I'm not

34:59.097 --> 35:05.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to let you off the hook.
If the question
is, will you take an innocent
life in order

35:05.437 --> 35:09.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to save potentially more lives,
let's really
go to that place.

35:09.808 --> 35:14.746 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: The Obama
administration has
embraced the use of drones as an
effective

35:14.846 --> 35:16.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
anti-terror weapon.

35:16.748 --> 35:21.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Somalia, the
Islamist group
Al-Shabaab confirms the U.S.
bombed one of

35:21.286 --> 35:23.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
its camps on Saturday.

35:23.288 --> 35:27.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Just this month,
the Pentagon,
citing self-defense and the
defense of African

35:27.192 --> 35:33.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allies, said it used drones and
other aircraft
to hit an Al-Shabaab training
camp in Somalia,

35:33.164 --> 35:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
killing about 150 fighters.

35:35.200 --> 35:39.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pentagon officials said they
didn't believe
there were any civilian
casualties, but the

35:39.938 --> 35:45.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
claim could not be independently
verified.
We asked two drone warfare
experts from opposing

35:45.377 --> 35:48.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sides to watch the film and
discuss it with
us.

Naureen Shah heads the security
and human
rights program of Amnesty
International USA.

35:54.185 --> 35:58.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Matt Olsen has been in
situations like those
in the film as former director
of the National

35:58.957 --> 36:01.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Counterterrorism Center in the
Obama administration.

36:01.760 --> 36:07.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were two thumbs-up for the
film as a
tense, mostly realistic
thriller, but continuing

36:07.732 --> 36:09.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
disagreement on the use of
drones.

36:09.601 --> 36:13.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NAUREEN SHAH, Amnesty
International USA: What
the film shows is the best-case
scenario,

36:14.005 --> 36:19.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
potentially, for the government,
where we
know who is inside a house
that's being targeted.

36:19.611 --> 36:23.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in the cases that Amnesty
International
has documented, we would have
real questions

36:23.548 --> 36:27.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about whether the U.S.
government had the
advantage of the kind of
facial-recognition

36:27.852 --> 36:31.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
technology that appears to be in
the film,
the eyes on the ground, the
ability to try

36:31.489 --> 36:36.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get an individual who might
be killed,
to get her away from the target
strike area.

36:36.194 --> 36:40.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's part of the problem,
actually,
is that there are -- there's a
novel technology

36:40.799 --> 36:44.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out there, and we as a public
are swayed by
that technology to think, well,
this is going

36:45.070 --> 36:48.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be a precise killing, this is
going to
be a clean kind of warfare, a
kind of warfare

36:48.973 --> 36:53.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that can be taken into cities,
like we're
seeing here in Nairobi, and as
though that

36:53.144 --> 36:58.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
excuses it from the kinds of
laws and kind
of rules that we would
ordinarily apply to

36:58.516 --> 37:00.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
any kind of use of lethal force.

37:00.385 --> 37:03.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Shrouded in
secrecy by necessity
or -- I mean, what's the
response to that?

37:03.888 --> 37:07.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW OLSEN, Former Director,
National Counterterrorism
Center: The principal response
is that the

37:07.125 --> 37:12.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president and the administration
has been
quite open about the standards
that apply

37:12.831 --> 37:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to this type of lethal force.

37:15.133 --> 37:20.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, no strike can take place,
as the president
has said, unless several
specific criteria

37:20.171 --> 37:24.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are met, first, that it's
lawful, consistent
with the laws of war, consistent
with U.S.

37:24.342 --> 37:30.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
domestic law, that there is a
basis to believe
that the targets present an
imminent threat

37:30.982 --> 37:35.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the lives of Americans, and
that capture
is not possible, and then, last,
that no strike

37:35.954 --> 37:40.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can take place unless there's
near certainty
that no innocent person will be
harmed.

37:40.758 --> 37:45.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As the president has
acknowledged, innocent
people have been killed in this
war, as in

37:45.396 --> 37:50.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any war. But those standards are
above and
beyond what would be legally
required under

37:50.235 --> 37:51.970 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the laws of war.

37:52.070 --> 37:55.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NAUREEN SHAH: We have never seen
the U.S.
government acknowledge the
killing of a Yemeni

37:55.240 --> 38:00.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
or a Pakistani or Somali
civilian, innocent
life.

38:00.245 --> 38:05.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is zero acknowledgement of
specific
individuals. And so if we're to
say that it's

38:05.683 --> 38:11.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OK to kill people outside who
are selling
bread in Nairobi, Kenya, we're
also saying

38:11.556 --> 38:16.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's OK to kill us right here in
Washington,
D.C., if there's people in a
neighboring building

38:16.761 --> 38:18.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who potentially pose some kind
of threat.

38:18.863 --> 38:22.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW OLSEN: I think that's
quite exaggerated,
the idea that we would be at
risk here in

38:22.567 --> 38:24.335 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Washington, D.C.

38:24.435 --> 38:28.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president has been very
clear where the
types of strikes that have been
approved,

38:28.373 --> 38:32.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outside of areas of hostile
battlefields,
outside of areas of active
hostility, those

38:32.577 --> 38:38.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been approved under very
circumscribed
circumstances, where, again,
we're at war

38:38.683 --> 38:40.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with al-Qaida and associated
forces.

38:40.852 --> 38:46.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In "Eye in the
Sky," we see
tiny camera drones, some already
on the market,

38:46.324 --> 38:51.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says director Gavin Hood, others
close behind.
And soon, he adds, they will do
more than

38:51.930 --> 38:53.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just capture high-definition
images.

38:53.865 --> 38:57.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAVIN HOOD: Instead of putting a
Hellfire
missile through the roof of a
house in which

38:57.335 --> 39:03.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the terrorists are holed up, the
tiny drone
flies through the window or a
door, and detonates

39:03.875 --> 39:08.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right by your temple, or it
blows a little
dose of anthrax in your nose as
it flies by.

39:08.980 --> 39:12.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's very creepy, but there's no
stopping
it.

39:13.051 --> 39:17.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Such
technological advances
will no doubt only raise new
challenges and

39:17.855 --> 39:18.790 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
debates.

39:18.890 --> 39:25.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jeffrey Brown.

39:25.863 --> 39:37.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now a "NewsHour"
Essay.

39:37.909 --> 39:42.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This month, many high school
seniors have
either just learned, or are
anxiously waiting

39:42.947 --> 39:46.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to hear, what colleges they
might have gotten
into.

39:46.484 --> 39:51.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Education advocate Keith Frome
has worked
with students across the
country, and believes

39:51.356 --> 39:55.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the key to getting more kids to
apply to college
is peer pressure.

39:55.560 --> 39:58.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEITH FROME, Author, "How's My
Kid Doing?":
One summer weekend, I taught a
small group

39:58.730 --> 40:02.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of students from a low-income
community how
to write their personal
statements for their

40:02.967 --> 40:05.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
college applications.

40:05.236 --> 40:09.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Each student would be the first
in their family
to apply to college, and their
ability to

40:09.841 --> 40:13.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tell their stories was going to
be critical
to their success.

40:13.478 --> 40:18.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During the three-day retreat, we
used a variety
of writing techniques to produce
memorable,

40:18.783 --> 40:23.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
compelling and utterly authentic
essays that
I knew would stick in the minds
of college

40:23.454 --> 40:25.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
admission officers.

40:25.890 --> 40:30.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Returning home, I felt quite
satisfied, perhaps
a little smugly so, with a job
well done,

40:30.495 --> 40:34.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and I proudly shared the
compositions with
my friends and family.

40:34.565 --> 40:38.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the students, though, who
wrote about
his attempts to extricate
himself from a neighborhood

40:38.569 --> 40:44.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gang, didn't share my sense of
completion.
Though he had completed his
college applications,

40:44.442 --> 40:47.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his work was just beginning. He
was on a mission.

40:47.578 --> 40:52.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When he returned to school, he
asked his principal
to gather the entire senior
class in the auditorium.

40:53.051 --> 40:56.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He proceeded to read his
personal statement
to them and said that, if he
could write this

40:56.821 --> 40:58.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
well, everyone else could do the
same.

40:58.790 --> 41:03.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He then led every senior, step
by step, through
the composition of their
personal statements

41:03.995 --> 41:07.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
using the techniques he had
learned in our
weekend together.

41:07.165 --> 41:10.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They started with a free-write.
They read
these aloud. They listened to
each other,

41:10.968 --> 41:15.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
noting moments of beauty and
probing for more
details and explanations.

41:15.473 --> 41:19.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The principal called me later
that week, astonished
at what he had witnessed. My
colleagues and

41:20.011 --> 41:25.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I began to hear similar stories
from other
schools around the country. We
began to understand

41:25.116 --> 41:28.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the most influential person
to a 17-year-old
is another 17-year-old.

41:28.886 --> 41:33.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it struck us that this might
be a key
to solving a big problem. Every
year, there

41:33.958 --> 41:38.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are 1.1 million low-income
eighth graders
in America's schools; 95 percent
say they

41:38.363 --> 41:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to go to college, but only
9 percent
of them will graduate by the
time they are

41:42.900 --> 41:47.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
24. In 1970, that figure was 6
percent. We
have clearly not made much
progress.

41:47.905 --> 41:52.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many think that the solution is
to bring complex
and expensive interventions into
schools.

41:52.543 --> 41:57.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I say the students themselves,
with some training
and coaching, can be organized
into teams

41:57.482 --> 41:59.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to work on behalf of the rest of
their classmates.

41:59.450 --> 42:04.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: The only thing about
your personal
essay is, like, it's really
good. So, I would

42:05.022 --> 42:06.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say type it up just as it is,
right?

42:06.924 --> 42:10.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEITH FROME: There are hundreds
of urban or
rural high schools around the
country where

42:10.395 --> 42:14.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I am privileged to watch
students leading
their classmates to college.

42:14.866 --> 42:20.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have seen students lock their
fellow seniors
in a gym until they have
completed their college

42:20.304 --> 42:24.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
applications. When college
representatives
refused to come to a high
school, I saw a

42:25.076 --> 42:29.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
group of students themselves
represent the
colleges for the rest of the
school in the

42:29.213 --> 42:31.082 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cafeteria.

42:31.182 --> 42:35.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In rural Florida, I watched a
team of juniors
and seniors lead an assembly for
1,500 students

42:35.853 --> 42:40.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like it was a revival meeting,
exhorting the
entire school to commit to going
to college.

42:40.992 --> 42:45.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Peer leadership is a powerful
force to behold,
and it gets measurable results.

42:45.596 --> 42:50.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In high schools, where peer
leader teams are
deployed, we have seen students
get more than

42:50.501 --> 42:55.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
70 percent of their classmates
to apply to
college, resulting in increases
of 20 percent

42:55.373 --> 42:59.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or more in actual college
enrollment rates.

42:59.143 --> 43:04.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We are entering an era in
education reform
that is calling for more
collaboration among

43:04.949 --> 43:10.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
schools, unions and businesses,
so that all
students succeed. That sounds
good, but we

43:10.655 --> 43:15.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
will only witness more
lackluster results
unless we understand that
students are partners,

43:15.593 --> 43:18.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
too, who can help their peers
achieve.

43:18.429 --> 43:22.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm reminded of a high school
senior named
Cornelius Williams, who had no
intention of

43:22.467 --> 43:27.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to college. He had no
adult role models
who ever attended college and he
didn't see

43:27.138 --> 43:32.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the value in it. One day, he met
Ashley Daniels
who had just been trained to be
a peer leader.

43:32.410 --> 43:36.881 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She nurtured and nagged
Cornelius through
the entire application process.

43:36.981 --> 43:41.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Not only did he get into
college. After he
graduated, he volunteered with
College Summit,

43:41.719 --> 43:46.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
paying Ashley's coaching forward
to a new
generation of students.

JUDY WOODRUFF: We will be back
in just a moment.

43:59.403 --> 44:04.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, take this time to
hear from your
local PBS station. It's a chance
to offer

44:04.141 --> 44:11.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your support, which helps keep
programs like
ours on the air.

44:11.883 --> 44:16.020 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

JUDY WOODRUFF: And now for our
"NewsHour"
Shares, something that caught
our eye that

44:37.775 --> 45:43.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we thought might be
of interest to you too.

45:43.407 --> 45:58.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a pair of bald eagles nesting at
the National
Arboretum in Washington, D.C. A
Web camera

45:58.356 --> 46:05.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
captured the first of possibly
two eaglets
fully emerging from its egg this
morning.

46:06.030 --> 46:17.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Biologists say the baby bald
eagle known for
now as DC2 appears to be doing
well and is

46:17.241 --> 46:28.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
already being fed. The second
egg, which was
laid a few days after its
sibling, could hatch

46:28.986 --> 46:33.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the weekend. The two adult
bald eagles
are the first pair to nest at
the National

46:33.891 --> 46:37.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Arboretum since 1947. They
successfully raised
their first eaglet last summer.

46:37.695 --> 46:39.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What can you say but aww?

Here's a preview.

52:32.983 --> 52:38.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: What's not to like
about Merrick
Garland? Senate Republicans say
it's not personal,

52:38.689 --> 52:44.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but still they will not confirm
this president's
Supreme Court nominee. Plus, why
do John Kasich,

52:44.361 --> 52:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders
think they still
have a chance? We explain the
delegate math

52:49.366 --> 52:53.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for both Democrats and
Republicans, and what
it means for the nominating
conventions, or

52:53.704 --> 52:55.406 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we will try to.

52:55.506 --> 52:57.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
