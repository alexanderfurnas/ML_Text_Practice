JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.833 --> 00:07.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.500 --> 00:10.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
On the "NewsHour"
tonight: a turn in the
Russia investigation.

00:10.466 --> 00:15.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special counsel Robert Mueller
moves beyond the 2016 election,
investigating possible

00:17.433 --> 00:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
obstruction of justice
by the president since he
took office in January.

00:23.633 --> 00:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead: Twelve Turkish
security agents are
charged after a violent
clash with protesters

00:28.833 --> 00:33.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
outside Turkey's embassy in
D.C., testing already shaky
diplomatic relations between

00:33.933 --> 00:36.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the two countries.

00:36.500 --> 00:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: a look at companies,
including one owned by
Jared Kushner's family,
that take advantage

00:42.133 --> 00:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of tax breaks to create jobs in
high unemployment areas, but do
those jobs end up going to those

00:48.133 --> 00:49.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who need them?

00:49.400 --> 00:51.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: Several of us tried
to get a job downtown.

00:51.733 --> 00:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But they're not hiring us.

00:53.733 --> 00:57.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know no one at all
who has no type of job from
downtown at Trump Towers or who

00:58.900 --> 01:00.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
informed anyone
else about the jobs.

01:00.466 --> 01:05.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:08.033 --> 01:10.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:10.900 --> 01:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
is now under scrutiny for
possible obstruction of justice,

01:20.733 --> 01:22.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and he's fighting back.

01:22.800 --> 01:27.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This follows news reports that
special counsel Bob Mueller has
broadened his probe originally

01:28.700 --> 01:30.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
focused on Russia
meddling in the election.

01:30.766 --> 01:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Twitter today, the president
complained - - quote -- "They
made up a phony collusion

01:35.266 --> 01:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the Russians story, found
zero proof, so now they go
for obstruction of justice.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Nice."

01:42.933 --> 01:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Later, Mr. Trump charged that
Hillary Clinton committed a list
of infractions, and was cleared

01:47.300 --> 01:49.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
anyway.

01:49.433 --> 01:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's also word that Vice
President Mike Pence has hired
outside legal counsel to deal

01:53.966 --> 01:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with the Russia investigations.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His office tells The Washington
Post that former U.S. attorney
Richard Cullen will handle

02:00.600 --> 02:04.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
inquiries from
congressional committees
and the special counsel.

02:04.600 --> 02:07.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president hired his own
private lawyer last month.

02:07.366 --> 02:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will examine all of this, and
talk to the vice chairman of the
Senate Intelligence Committee,

02:11.733 --> 02:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senator Mark Warner, right
after the news summary.

02:15.100 --> 02:20.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The U.S. Senate today
overwhelmingly approved
new sanctions against
both Iran and Russia.

02:21.566 --> 02:24.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The overall bill is aimed
at Iran's missile program.

02:24.466 --> 02:29.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An amendment expands sanctions
on Russia for meddling
in last year's election.

02:31.466 --> 02:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senate Minority Leader Chuck
Schumer said today it sends a
message to Russian President

02:33.966 --> 02:36.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Vladimir Putin and
to President Trump.

02:36.366 --> 02:38.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:38.466 --> 02:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: Not only did we pass
a new round of tough sanctions

02:39.933 --> 02:42.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for Russia's meddling
in our election.

02:42.300 --> 02:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We codified existing
sanctions into law, making
them harder to lift.

02:49.300 --> 02:52.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Any idea of the president's
that he can lift sanctions on
his own for whatever reason are

02:52.300 --> 02:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dashed by this legislation.

02:54.900 --> 02:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Putin fired
back during a national
call-in show in Moscow,
and said the sanctions

03:01.166 --> 03:03.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
say more about the
U.S. than about Russia.

03:03.666 --> 03:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through translator):
Why have they started to talk

03:07.233 --> 03:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about introducing these
sanctions with no grounds?

03:10.000 --> 03:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course it is evidence of
continuing internal political
struggle in the United States.

03:14.866 --> 03:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If there weren't other problems,
they would have thought up
something else to hold Russia

03:18.633 --> 03:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back, as it has always been, a
policy of holding Russia back.

03:22.433 --> 03:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will take
a closer look at the Senate's
sanctions bill a little later

03:26.233 --> 03:28.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the program.

03:28.800 --> 03:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A leading Republican in the
House of Representatives,
Majority Whip Steve
Scalise, remains in critical

03:34.166 --> 03:38.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
condition tonight after a
gunman shot him during a
congressional baseball practice.

03:38.266 --> 03:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A lobbyist who was wounded is
also in critical condition.

03:42.933 --> 03:46.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
President Trump visited
Scalise in a Washington
hospital last night.

03:46.733 --> 03:51.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, at the White House, he
said Scalise's recovery will
be more difficult than people

03:52.200 --> 03:53.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
thought.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP, President
of the United States:
He's in some trouble.

03:56.900 --> 03:59.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's a great fighter and
he's going to be OK, we hope.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Steve in his own way may
have brought some unity to
our long divided country.

04:05.366 --> 04:10.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have a feeling that Steve
has made a great sacrifice,
but there could be some unity

04:12.366 --> 04:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
being brought to our country.

04:14.100 --> 04:16.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Let's hope so.

04:16.100 --> 04:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The gunman, James
Hodgkinson of Illinois, died
after being shot by police.

04:22.466 --> 04:26.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, the annual
congressional baseball
game is being played
tonight, raising money

04:26.166 --> 04:28.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for charity.

04:28.233 --> 04:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The American college student
released from North Korea, and
now in a coma, has a massive

04:33.300 --> 04:35.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
loss of brain tissue.

04:35.833 --> 04:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Doctors at the University
of Cincinnati Medical
Center said today that
Otto Warmbier suffered

04:40.700 --> 04:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a severe neurological injury.

04:42.766 --> 04:45.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They could not say
if he was beaten.

04:45.633 --> 04:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Warmbier's father condemned
the North Koreans, but said
the family wants to move on.

04:49.933 --> 04:53.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED WARMBIER, Father of Otto
Warmbier: What I would say
to the North Korean regime, I

04:53.300 --> 04:58.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would say I'm so proud of
Otto, my son, who has been in
a pariah regime for the last 18

05:03.566 --> 05:06.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
months, brutalized
and terrorized.

05:06.066 --> 05:08.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And he's now home
with his family.

05:08.966 --> 05:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm just tremendously
proud of Otto.

05:11.966 --> 05:13.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
His spirit is with us.

05:13.966 --> 05:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The State
Department now says that a U.S.
diplomat who went to North Korea

05:18.633 --> 05:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to secure Warmbier's release
also contacted three other
Americans being held.

05:25.033 --> 05:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The department wouldn't
comment on their conditions.

05:27.133 --> 05:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In London, rescue crews have
pulled more bodies from a
burned-out apartment tower.

05:33.600 --> 05:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The death toll in Wednesday's
fire reached at least 17
today, amid rising outrage.

05:38.600 --> 05:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Paul Davies of Independent
Television News has this report.

05:41.233 --> 05:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL DAVIES: A second dawn
brought no end to the agony.

05:45.733 --> 05:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are no flames now, but
this smoldering shell that was
once home to so many families

05:51.900 --> 05:55.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
still holds an unknown
number of their bodies.

05:55.900 --> 06:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fire crews believe, in flats
not yet safe to enter, there are
a whole families who couldn't

06:02.066 --> 06:04.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
get out or obeyed the
instruction to stay put.

06:04.766 --> 06:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Many, many remain missing.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it could take weeks
to confirm their fate.

06:09.700 --> 06:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANY COTTON, London Fire
Brigade: It's the upper floors
that will be more challenging

06:12.233 --> 06:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and will need some
additional shoring for us
to be able to get in there.

06:16.100 --> 06:18.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The size of this building,
it could take weeks.

06:18.166 --> 06:19.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I want to be realistic.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a very long process.

06:21.566 --> 06:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL DAVIES: These images
show the destruction on the
ground floor of Grenfell Tower.

06:29.633 --> 06:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is the area least affected
by that all-consuming fire.

06:36.066 --> 06:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As this photograph shows,
it gets worse as you go up.

06:39.933 --> 06:42.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Very few escaped
the higher floors.

06:42.900 --> 06:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the initial response to
this tragedy was horror, as the
hours have passed, there have

06:47.233 --> 06:49.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been mounting questions
and mounting anger.

06:49.700 --> 06:50.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN: There is a
system in place.

06:50.700 --> 06:51.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is the product.

06:51.700 --> 06:52.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That is it.

06:52.833 --> 06:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: There's nothing at all.

06:55.166 --> 06:57.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Yes, but they're lying.

06:57.266 --> 07:02.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL DAVIES: Labor's
leader visiting the area
heard the concerns of
residents who say fears

07:03.466 --> 07:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they'd expressed about the
tower's safety were ignored.

07:05.966 --> 07:07.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: Someone has to
be held accountable.

07:07.833 --> 07:09.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Someone has to be
held responsible.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We don't want it kicked
to the long grass.

07:11.866 --> 07:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't want the government to
sort of hide with some hollow
platitude about lessons being

07:15.833 --> 07:17.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
learned.

07:17.866 --> 07:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL DAVIES: The prime minister
paid her own private visit to
Grenfell Tower this morning

07:20.700 --> 07:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and was criticized for meeting
only the emergency teams,
and not the local community.

07:25.533 --> 07:28.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AFAF BADR, London:
People are very angry.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People are crying.

07:29.333 --> 07:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
People are lost, missing.

07:31.133 --> 07:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She's the prime minister.

07:33.266 --> 07:35.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Where is she?

07:35.300 --> 07:38.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL DAVIES: London's mayor
visiting the scene said
anger was understandable.

07:38.966 --> 07:43.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SADIQ KHAN, Mayor of
London: We can see the
anger in the community,
justifiably so, because

07:43.933 --> 07:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
many members of the
community have been saying...

07:45.533 --> 07:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Not just the community.

07:46.533 --> 07:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's everyone outside as well.

07:48.133 --> 07:50.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: Fed up with
these politicians.

07:50.633 --> 07:51.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No handshakes.

07:51.633 --> 07:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We want action, not handshakes.

07:53.666 --> 07:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL DAVIES: Sadiq Khan said
the inquiry should be immediate
and that no one should have to

07:59.800 --> 08:02.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wait two years to find
out why this happened.

08:02.433 --> 08:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Both Britain's
national government and
local police have now
opened investigations

08:08.066 --> 08:10.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into the fire.

08:10.100 --> 08:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Islamist fighters in Somalia
attacked a popular restaurant
overnight and killed at least 31

08:15.133 --> 08:17.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

08:17.100 --> 08:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It happened in the country's
capital, Mogadishu, and
involved five gunmen.

08:19.833 --> 08:24.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Al-Shabaab militants
detonated a car bomb, and then
stormed inside, taking hostages.

08:26.200 --> 08:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Witnesses said they shot
victims at point-blank range.

08:30.200 --> 08:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Somali security forces
finally killed the gunmen
early this morning.

08:34.166 --> 08:39.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in this country, jurors in
the Bill Cosby sexual assault
trial deliberated into the

08:40.533 --> 08:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
evening again, after reporting
that they're deadlocked.

08:43.300 --> 08:46.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The judge in Norristown,
Pennsylvania, told
them to keep at it.

08:46.700 --> 08:51.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The 79-year-old Cosby is
accused of drugging and
molesting a woman in 2004.

08:53.666 --> 08:58.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial average lost
14 points to close below 21360.

08:58.066 --> 09:03.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 29, and
the S&amp;P 500 slipped five.

09:04.900 --> 09:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the vice chair of the Senate
Intelligence Committee

09:08.233 --> 09:13.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on revelations that
President Trump is under
scrutiny for potentially
obstructing the Russia

09:15.233 --> 09:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investigation; arrest warrants
issued after a violent clash
outside the Turkish Embassy;

09:21.133 --> 09:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a government visa
program receives renewed
criticism; and much more.

09:35.566 --> 09:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now for more on the special
counsel's investigation into
the president for possible

09:40.000 --> 09:42.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
obstruction of justice, we
are joined by Carrie Johnson.

09:42.966 --> 09:46.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She's the justice
correspondent for NPR.

09:46.066 --> 09:47.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Carrie, welcome
back to the program.

09:47.300 --> 09:49.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CARRIE JOHNSON, NPR:
Happy to be here.

09:49.366 --> 09:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: First of
all, define for us, what
is obstruction of justice?

09:52.100 --> 09:56.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CARRIE JOHNSON: There's
a bunch of obstruction
of justice statutes on
the books, Judy, but,

09:56.200 --> 10:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in plain language, it
means trying to interfere
with or impede an official
proceeding, something

10:01.000 --> 10:05.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like a grand jury investigation,
a congressional investigation.

10:05.100 --> 10:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And prosecutors would have
to prove some kind of bad
intent by the person involved.

10:09.433 --> 10:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so tell us
what you have been able to learn
about how the special counsel

10:15.600 --> 10:17.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is looking into this.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, by the way, we know it's
been reported that they're also
looking into potential financial

10:20.800 --> 10:22.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
misdeeds.

10:22.933 --> 10:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: Yes, the special
counsel investigation appears to
be running on three tracks now,

10:26.733 --> 10:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one probing any Russian
interference in the
election, two, probing
any financial misdealings

10:34.333 --> 10:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in connection with that
interference by associates
of the Trump campaign
and Russians, and, three,

10:39.166 --> 10:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
probing obstruction of justice
by the president himself in
the firing of James Comey, the

10:45.166 --> 10:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FBI director he ousted last
month because, he later said,
to take some pressure off the

10:48.066 --> 10:50.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Russia thing.

10:50.166 --> 10:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, this is
clearly, Carrie, an expansion
of what it was originally said

10:55.233 --> 10:56.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the special counsel's
mission was here.

10:56.466 --> 10:58.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CARRIE JOHNSON: I think
it's another layer.

10:58.600 --> 11:02.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We knew at the time
that the deputy attorney
general, Rod Rosenstein,
appointed Bob Mueller

11:02.733 --> 11:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
special counsel that his mandate
included crimes that arose or
may have arisen in connection

11:08.466 --> 11:10.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with the investigation.

11:10.500 --> 11:14.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Of course, obstruction
of justice may have
arisen in connection
with this investigation

11:14.633 --> 11:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the president and his
leaning on Comey allegedly to
go light on Michael Flynn, the

11:19.633 --> 11:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
national security adviser.

11:21.633 --> 11:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We have also
been hearing in the last few
days, Carrie, about some of the

11:25.533 --> 11:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
professionals that the special
counsel, Bob Mueller, has
hired, brought on board for his

11:31.000 --> 11:31.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
team.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tell us about them.

11:33.900 --> 11:36.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CARRIE JOHNSON: It's a
breathtaking array of
prosecutorial talent,
Judy, from a man

11:36.500 --> 11:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who had experience prosecuting
the Watergate scandal, a former
FBI agent, Andrew Weissmann,

11:43.400 --> 11:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who led the Justice Department's
fraud and money-laundering
section, Jeannie Rhee, who

11:46.333 --> 11:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had been a top lawyer in
the Obama administration's
DOJ, finally, Michael
Dreeben, the deputy

11:53.333 --> 11:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
solicitor general, the man
many lawyers in Justice think
is the most respected guy in

11:56.833 --> 11:58.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the whole department.

11:58.866 --> 12:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what does
that tell you about what Mr.
Mueller and they will be -- and

12:03.700 --> 12:05.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his team will be looking for?

12:05.700 --> 12:09.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: Well, it signals
that special counsel Mueller
knows there are a number of

12:11.966 --> 12:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thorny legal issues involved
here, everything from financial
dealings and tracking the money,

12:17.633 --> 12:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to complicated questions of
executive privilege with respect
to the president, his aides,

12:20.633 --> 12:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and conversations he might
have had with people outside
the government as well.

12:24.800 --> 12:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Michael Dreeben, the
deputy solicitor general, is
well-known for making criminal

12:29.066 --> 12:31.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
convictions stick
in appeals courts.

12:31.100 --> 12:33.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So they're settling in
for the long haul here.

12:33.633 --> 12:38.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is it
your understanding,
from what you have been
able to learn, that Mr.

12:38.333 --> 12:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mueller is now finished, that
the team is done, or that
he's continuing to hire, bring

12:42.066 --> 12:43.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
people on?

12:43.533 --> 12:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: They have
not given us a formal update.

12:45.233 --> 12:47.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He's not yet submitted
a formal budget to the
Justice Department.

12:47.766 --> 12:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm hearing from sources
in and outside the government
that more people are clamoring

12:51.833 --> 12:53.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to join this team.

12:53.300 --> 12:55.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They view it as a
major public service.

12:55.866 --> 13:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And working with Bob
Mueller, who had been
the FBI director for 12
years, with his reputation

13:00.266 --> 13:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for integrity, is something
that a lot of people inside the
government want to do still.

13:03.733 --> 13:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally,
what are you hearing about
how long this could go on?

13:07.233 --> 13:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How long is it going to take?

13:08.733 --> 13:10.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: There is no
prediction at this point.

13:10.666 --> 13:14.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, all these
investigators could dig and
dig and dig and find nothing.

13:14.466 --> 13:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the end of that time, they
may want to do a report that
becomes public, or they may

13:19.333 --> 13:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
find something they want to
charge with a grand jury.

13:22.633 --> 13:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's unpredictable right
now who they might charge,
if anyone, and whether that

13:27.300 --> 13:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
person might want to
fight it out in court for
months or years to come.

13:30.800 --> 13:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Finally, Judy, with respect
to the president himself, no
evidence yet he will face any

13:35.333 --> 13:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
charges whatsoever, but there
is a complicated legal question
of whether you can actually

13:39.433 --> 13:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
indict a sitting president of
the United States or turn that
evidence over to Congress for

13:44.233 --> 13:45.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
possible impeachment.

13:45.566 --> 13:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A
complicated legal question.

13:48.166 --> 13:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we can assume some
folks are looking into that.

13:50.400 --> 13:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: I think a lot
of folks are looking into that.

13:53.033 --> 13:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It arose during Watergate,
of course, and was
never fully answered.

13:56.800 --> 14:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We may yet get an answer in this
investigation before it's over.

14:00.533 --> 14:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Carrie
Johnson of NPR, we thank you.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: Thank you.

14:05.166 --> 14:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence
met behind closed doors this

14:09.433 --> 14:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
week with three key
figures in their expanding
Russia investigation,
National Security Director

14:17.000 --> 14:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mike Rogers, the director
of national intelligence,
Dan Coats, and special
counsel Robert Mueller.

14:21.966 --> 14:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And with us now, the committee's
top Democrat, its vice chairman,
Virginia Senator Mark Warner.

14:28.333 --> 14:32.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Senator, first off, you
-- we have been hearing,
been discussing with
NPR's Carrie Johnson

14:34.900 --> 14:38.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fact that the special
counsel has expanded his
investigation to include
potential obstruction

14:41.066 --> 14:42.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of justice.

14:42.500 --> 14:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that something your
committee is doing as well?

14:44.400 --> 14:46.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
®MD-BSEN.

14:46.866 --> 14:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK WARNER (D), Virginia:
Well, Judy, I'm not
going to comment on
the expanse of special

14:51.500 --> 14:53.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
counselor Mueller's
investigation.

14:53.566 --> 14:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do think it's an indication
of how serious it is that he
is obviously recruiting some

15:00.566 --> 15:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the top talent from
around the country to
assist him in this effort.

15:03.400 --> 15:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It shows how seriously
he's taking this effort,
and, frankly, how
seriously the vast majority

15:10.866 --> 15:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of elected officials, Democrats
and Republicans, who realize
that the Russian intervention

15:16.733 --> 15:17.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was massive in our elections.

15:17.966 --> 15:19.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have got to get
to the bottom of it.

15:19.233 --> 15:21.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have got to make sure
it doesn't happen again.

15:21.766 --> 15:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It really appears that
the only elected official
maybe in Washington
that doesn't accept the

15:28.766 --> 15:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
potential dangerousness of
the Russian intervention
is actually the president
of the United States.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, that's
what I wanted to ask you about.

15:35.333 --> 15:37.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The president has been
actively tweeting today.

15:37.400 --> 15:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Among other things, he said
they went after a -- he said
they made up a phony collusion

15:44.033 --> 15:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the Russians story,
they found zero proof,
and now, he said, they're
going after obstruction

15:46.466 --> 15:48.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of justice because
they found nothing.

15:48.266 --> 15:49.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:49.766 --> 15:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK WARNER: That's, you know,
just factually not appropriate.

15:53.433 --> 15:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, we are still early on
into particularly some of the
individuals that were affiliated

16:00.500 --> 16:05.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the Trump campaign and
their potential contacts or
communications with Russians.

16:07.266 --> 16:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We thought we would be further
along, but for the fact that the
president, in an unprecedented

16:11.900 --> 16:15.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
way, fired the FBI
director, Jim Comey.

16:15.633 --> 16:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have had obviously a pattern
here where there are at least
reports of other individuals

16:22.033 --> 16:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that were at least
contacted by the president.

16:24.333 --> 16:27.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I'm not going to comment
on the specifics of
the individuals we saw.

16:27.466 --> 16:30.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's -- we need
to keep confidential.

16:30.766 --> 16:35.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But we do have the
former National Security
Adviser General Flynn
who was fired because

16:37.166 --> 16:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he didn't come forward with
his contacts with the Russians.

16:39.233 --> 16:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have had the attorney general
recuse himself because he didn't
fully disclose his contacts

16:44.466 --> 16:46.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with the Russians.

16:46.466 --> 16:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the president's rendition
is true, you know, that there's
no there there, why wouldn't

16:53.600 --> 16:58.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
he collaborate with
the investigation to
get this cleared up, as
opposed to his constant

17:00.133 --> 17:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tweetage saying that this is
a witch-hunt and fake news?

17:02.766 --> 17:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think there's any member
of the Senate that believes this
is fake news that the Russians

17:10.200 --> 17:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interfered, just as they
interfered in France,
just as they will
probably interfere in the

17:11.633 --> 17:13.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
German elections coming
up later this year.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it's a national
security threat.

17:15.766 --> 17:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, while we're
talking about the question of
whether there is obstruction

17:18.533 --> 17:23.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or not, I know your committee
met this week, as we have
just reported, with Dan Coats,

17:23.466 --> 17:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the director of national
intelligence, and
also with the National
Security Agency director,

17:27.733 --> 17:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mike Rogers, in both cases,
presumably asking questions
that they wouldn't -- they were

17:33.833 --> 17:36.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not willing the answer
in open session.

17:36.500 --> 17:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Were they able to shed any
more light on this question of
whether they -- go ahead, yes.

17:39.800 --> 17:40.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

17:40.800 --> 17:42.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

17:42.800 --> 17:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER: I'm not going
to get into the content
of their testimony.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will say that it's very
important that sources
and methods in terms
of how we discovered

17:54.500 --> 17:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian intervention, that that
is maintained and preserved,
and there's an appropriate

18:00.300 --> 18:02.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
classified portion.

18:02.300 --> 18:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do think there are questions
that still need to be
explored about, if a president

18:08.666 --> 18:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was calling on these subjects,
how much of that is classified.

18:12.466 --> 18:17.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not going to comment again
on any specifics, but these are
all -- and what I worry about

18:18.533 --> 18:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is, is there a pattern emerging?

18:20.800 --> 18:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's something, again,
that time will tell and,
obviously, the special counsel,

18:26.866 --> 18:29.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mueller, will
continue to look into.

18:29.433 --> 18:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You met
with the special counsel,
as we said, yesterday,
you and Chairman Richard

18:33.100 --> 18:35.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Burr.

18:35.633 --> 18:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can you explain for us
the difference between
the mission of what you're
doing, your committee,

18:40.566 --> 18:43.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the House Intelligence
Committee, vs. what
Mr. Mueller is doing?

18:43.666 --> 18:44.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

18:44.666 --> 18:46.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK WARNER: Sure.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, special counsel Mueller
has got a criminal standard.

18:48.766 --> 18:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In many cases, that criminal
standard is quite high.

18:52.233 --> 18:56.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He will have to -- if he
chooses to bring charges against
anyone, they will have to

18:56.666 --> 18:58.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
meet those legal standards.

18:58.966 --> 19:03.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:66.67% size:87.5%
We're leading a
counterintelligence
investigation that
started with looking
at Russian interference

19:05.833 --> 19:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in our election, was broadened
to include any potential
communication or collaboration

19:12.800 --> 19:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between officials in part of
either campaign, and the focus
is generally on folks affiliated

19:17.533 --> 19:19.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with the Trump campaign,
and the Russians.

19:19.600 --> 19:24.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have actually not
had a chance to get to
many of the witnesses
that have been at least

19:26.333 --> 19:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bandied about because, again,
this -- we have been superseded
in a way by the firing of

19:33.366 --> 19:38.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Director Comey, then President
Trump disparages Director Comey
in front of the Russians, saying

19:40.533 --> 19:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on national television that he
fired him because of the Russia
investigation, all things that,

19:47.500 --> 19:50.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at least for this senator, raise
a lot of questions that I'm
still trying to sort through.

19:50.766 --> 19:54.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, no concern
you're going to get in each
other's way, that what your

19:54.300 --> 19:55.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
committee...

19:55.300 --> 19:56.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

19:56.300 --> 19:58.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

19:58.900 --> 20:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK WARNER: I think
that's something that we
have to make sure there's
appropriate deconfliction.

20:00.933 --> 20:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the end of the day, you know,
the criminal investigation, we
can't do anything that would

20:05.933 --> 20:08.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
interfere with that
criminal investigation.

20:08.033 --> 20:12.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, you know, I'm not
going to, again, comment
about our conversations
with special counsel

20:15.433 --> 20:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mueller, but I think it was
a good first step, and I
think we will have to have
ongoing communications.

20:17.933 --> 20:20.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just one
final quick question.

20:20.000 --> 20:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Vice President Mike Pence, it
was announced today, has hired
his own private counsel to

20:24.733 --> 20:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
address any issues arising out
of the Russia investigation.

20:28.300 --> 20:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you have a comment on that?

20:29.366 --> 20:31.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:31.466 --> 20:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER: No, I don't have
a comment, but I just -- other
than the fact that it would

20:34.666 --> 20:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be helpful if the administration
actually collaborated and
cooperated with all of us.

20:41.700 --> 20:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What the Russians did in 2016
in the United States, the
Russians have also done in the

20:47.433 --> 20:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
French elections, they will
do in the German elections.

20:49.533 --> 20:53.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, as a state that
has statewide elections
this year, I'm concerned
about their ongoing

20:55.400 --> 20:58.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
efforts to try to, frankly, sow
chaos in our democratic process.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And let me be clear.

21:00.166 --> 21:01.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is not about
relitigating 2016.

21:01.233 --> 21:02.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

21:02.233 --> 21:04.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:04.233 --> 21:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER: It's not about
the Russians being for
Republicans or Democrats.

21:05.500 --> 21:06.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Russians are for
their own interests.

21:06.933 --> 21:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we have to be careful about
this new form of conflict.

21:09.533 --> 21:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But just
very quickly, Senator,
so I understand, you're
saying the administration

21:13.566 --> 21:15.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is not collaborating
right now with you?

21:15.133 --> 21:16.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:16.633 --> 21:18.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK WARNER: I wish there
was closer cooperation.

21:18.666 --> 21:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are a number of members
of the administration who
volunteered to come forward.

21:21.800 --> 21:24.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There are a number of
individuals that work
on the Trump campaign.

21:24.933 --> 21:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I don't see what
value is added by the
president's constant
dismissal of the seriousness

21:32.666 --> 21:34.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of this threat.

21:34.733 --> 21:37.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Mark
Warner, the vice chairman of
the Senate Select Committee on

21:37.666 --> 21:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Intelligence, we thank you.

21:39.633 --> 21:40.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:40.733 --> 21:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK WARNER: Thank you, Judy.

21:48.233 --> 21:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As we
reported earlier in the
program, the Senate today
overwhelmingly passed

21:53.633 --> 21:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
new sanctions against Iran.

21:55.766 --> 21:58.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But a key amendment makes
that bill even broader.

21:58.466 --> 22:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It now includes sanctions
aimed at Russia.

22:00.833 --> 22:05.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is five months after U.S.
intelligence agencies made
public that Russian President

22:05.566 --> 22:10.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Vladimir Putin ordered
cyber-interference
in the 2016 election.

22:10.300 --> 22:13.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Lisa Desjardins has
been following the vote,
and she joins me now.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Lisa, tell us what
these Russia sanctions are.

22:15.833 --> 22:17.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: These are
not just symbolic, Judy.

22:17.666 --> 22:18.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
These are significant sanctions.

22:18.966 --> 22:20.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's take a quick look.

22:20.866 --> 22:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First of all, they target
Russian industries,
especially the energy sector.

22:24.066 --> 22:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those sanctions would include
things limiting U.S. companies,
prohibiting them from working

22:28.633 --> 22:30.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with Russian firms, say,
exploring the Arctic.

22:30.766 --> 22:32.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's a big deal.

22:32.866 --> 22:36.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Also, this would target
individuals working in
defense or intelligence,
individual Russians.

22:36.866 --> 22:38.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There are some new
powers in here.

22:38.800 --> 22:42.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Treasury would get
access to U.S. bank records
of Russian oligarchs.

22:42.166 --> 22:47.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, $250 million for
a countering Russia
influence fund that would
focus on cyber-security,

22:48.333 --> 22:50.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but also could be
some U.S. propaganda.

22:50.333 --> 22:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, separately,
the Senate passed an amendment
to this that affects the

22:55.666 --> 22:56.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

22:56.500 --> 22:57.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tell us about that.

22:57.766 --> 22:59.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: This
is remarkable, Judy.

22:59.733 --> 23:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a Republican Congress
asserting power with a
Republican president in office.

23:04.500 --> 23:06.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let's look at exactly
how that would work.

23:06.400 --> 23:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If this president wanted
to roll back any of these
sanctions, he would have to give

23:09.200 --> 23:12.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Congress 30-day notice
under this amendment.

23:12.866 --> 23:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congress could then
disapprove and ultimately
block the president from
rolling back sanctions

23:17.366 --> 23:19.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with a two-thirds vote.

23:19.366 --> 23:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Essentially, Judy, what the
Senate is saying here is, we
think Congress should set Russia

23:22.733 --> 23:24.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
policy now, not the president.

23:24.766 --> 23:27.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
what is the White House
saying about all this?

23:27.266 --> 23:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The White
House today said it's
reviewing these sanctions.

23:30.033 --> 23:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No secret the president is in
a very tricky position here,
not just because of this Russia

23:34.100 --> 23:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investigation, but because he
and his secretary of state have
said they don't think this is

23:38.400 --> 23:40.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a good time to increase
sanctions on Russia.

23:40.666 --> 23:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They think it could backfire.

23:42.700 --> 23:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's interesting, Judy, the
Senate attached these Russia
sanctions to an Iran sanctions

23:47.333 --> 23:50.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bill that the president
wants to sign.

23:50.133 --> 23:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, Democrats are worried
about the Iran sanctions,
worried that that could cause

23:54.266 --> 23:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
problems with the Iran deal,
which leaves the president
deciding, does he swallow these

23:59.133 --> 24:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia sanctions that go with
an Iran deal he likes at a time
of the Russia investigation?

24:03.500 --> 24:05.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have to wait and see.

24:05.533 --> 24:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in two
seconds, if the president were
to veto this, the assumption

24:07.833 --> 24:08.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is, it would be overridden?

24:08.866 --> 24:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's correct.

24:10.266 --> 24:11.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It passed with 98
votes in the Senate.

24:11.933 --> 24:13.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Absolutely, they would
override that veto.

24:13.600 --> 24:16.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa
Desjardins, thank you.

24:16.900 --> 24:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: My pleasure.

24:24.333 --> 24:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A new
flash point in the tense
and fraying alliance
between the United States

24:30.633 --> 24:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Turkey, after Turkish
security forces attacked
protesters during
President Erdogan's

24:36.333 --> 24:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
recent visit to Washington, D.C.

24:38.800 --> 24:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has our report.

24:40.466 --> 24:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And a warning: Images in this
report may disturb some viewers.

24:44.733 --> 24:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It's been
one month since attackers
launched into protesters outside

24:50.933 --> 24:53.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Turkish ambassador's
residence in Washington.

24:53.566 --> 24:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now D.C. officials have issued
warrants on assault charges.

24:58.433 --> 25:00.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Police Chief Peter Newsham:

25:00.866 --> 25:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER NEWSHAM, Acting
Washington, D.C., Police
Chief: We all saw the
violence that was perpetrated

25:03.200 --> 25:06.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against peaceful demonstrators
here in Washington,
D.C., and it's just
something we're not going

25:06.200 --> 25:08.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to tolerate.

25:08.733 --> 25:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
demonstrators had gathered
at a park shortly after
Turkey's president,

25:10.833 --> 25:13.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Recep Tayyip Erdogan,
met with President Trump
at the White House.

25:13.900 --> 25:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, as Erdogan arrived
at the ambassador's
residence, trouble started.

25:20.766 --> 25:23.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Video showed security
guards and supporters teeing
off on the protesters.

25:23.066 --> 25:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
D.C. police officers tried to
separate and calm the crowd,
but nine people were hurt.

25:30.100 --> 25:33.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Two people were arrested
that day, and two more
were apprehended by
U.S. Marshals yesterday.

25:34.833 --> 25:37.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now there are 12 new warrants
for Turkish security officers.

25:37.166 --> 25:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Most, if not all, returned
home after the attack.

25:40.233 --> 25:42.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Two Canadians are
also being sought.

25:42.566 --> 25:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's unclear why they
allegedly joined the melee.

25:45.133 --> 25:48.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chief Newsham is calling for
the suspects to surrender
and not fight extradition.

25:48.800 --> 25:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER NEWSHAM: If you
are a law-abiding person,
and you feel like you
didn't do anything wrong,

25:57.733 --> 26:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then please present yourself
here to answer to these charges.

26:01.133 --> 26:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
Erdogan responded to the
charges, and said the
demonstrators were associated

26:04.900 --> 26:09.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with Kurdish militants
who've been engaged in a
long insurgency against
the Turkish government.

26:11.933 --> 26:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, Turkish
President (through translator):
Of course we're going the fight

26:14.033 --> 26:16.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this on legal and
political grounds.

26:16.300 --> 26:18.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What kind of law is this?

26:18.366 --> 26:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If my security guards are not
going to protect me, why would
I bring them with me to America?

26:21.666 --> 26:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Meanwhile,
Erdogan's role in all of
this remains a question.

26:25.866 --> 26:30.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After the incident, The
New York Times examined
the video and spotted
Erdogan's head of security

26:32.800 --> 26:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leaning into the president's
car, and then speaking into
his earpiece, just before three

26:35.933 --> 26:38.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
guards ran toward
the protesters.

26:38.500 --> 26:42.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At the time, the State
Department said it
communicated -- quote
-- "concerns" to Turkey

26:42.300 --> 26:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the confrontation, and
today said -- quote - - "We
will weigh additional actions."

26:46.666 --> 26:51.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVEN COOK, Council on Foreign
Relations: President Erdogan's
security team irresponsible,

26:52.533 --> 26:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
unprofessional and violent.

26:54.600 --> 26:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Steven Cook
is a senior fellow with the
Council on Foreign Relations

26:56.266 --> 26:58.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Washington.

26:58.366 --> 27:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says relations between
Washington and Ankara are as
bad as they have ever been.

27:01.500 --> 27:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVEN COOK: Charging President
Erdogan's security team
with crimes is going to add

27:08.266 --> 27:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
another element of tension
between the two countries.

27:12.000 --> 27:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This tension will no doubt be
used by the Turkish leadership
to advance their own political

27:17.000 --> 27:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agenda, which is only
going to cause raw feelings
here in Washington.

27:21.100 --> 27:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The U.S.
and Turkey are already at odds
over Kurdish forces fighting

27:25.200 --> 27:27.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Syria.

27:27.233 --> 27:31.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Turks have demanded the
U.S. extradite exiled cleric
Fethullah Gulen for allegedly

27:31.166 --> 27:33.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
organizing last
summer's failed coup.

27:33.666 --> 27:38.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

27:38.500 --> 27:43.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

27:46.000 --> 27:51.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Race Matters - - how a couple's

Cavett gives a Brief But
Spectacular take on his life.

28:06.033 --> 28:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: how a
little-known program
designed to attract foreign
investment is increasingly

28:08.800 --> 28:13.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
under the microscope,
for economic reasons
and political ones.

28:13.033 --> 28:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thousands of investors apply
and participate annually, and
one real estate business in

28:20.000 --> 28:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
particular has put it back in
the spotlight in recent months:
the family of Jared Kushner,

28:24.033 --> 28:26.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the president's son-in-law.

28:26.166 --> 28:30.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Our economics reporter,
Paul Solman, has covered
the controversies around
the program before.

28:31.700 --> 28:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Here's his latest update.

28:32.900 --> 28:35.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's part of our weekly
series Making Sense.

28:35.866 --> 28:40.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The soaring real
estate market in Jersey City,
New Jersey, due south of Wall

28:42.900 --> 28:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Street, a city becoming famous
for its many murals and its
wave of emigres from Manhattan

28:49.033 --> 28:52.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and Brooklyn fleeing
sky-high rents.

28:52.466 --> 28:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One neighborhood that's on the
rise, Journal Square, named
after the 150-year Journal News.

28:58.800 --> 29:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One of its latter-day
reporters, Terrence McDonald.

29:01.433 --> 29:03.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TERRENCE MCDONALD, The
Jersey Journal: This was
our old headquarters.

29:03.933 --> 29:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Jared Kushner's
company bought that and
bought the office building
next door and bought

29:09.833 --> 29:11.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this whole vacant
lot right here.

29:11.833 --> 29:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Jared Kushner
is, of course, President
Trump's son-in-law.

29:14.566 --> 29:16.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And what are they
going to build?

29:16.600 --> 29:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TERRENCE MCDONALD: The plan
is to build two towers on this
vacant lot and one tower across

29:22.433 --> 29:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the street, 72 stories,
mostly residential and also
commercial retail on the bottom.

29:25.200 --> 29:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Now, you may have
heard about this development
last month, when Jared Kushner's

29:28.733 --> 29:31.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sister pitched it to
investors in China.

29:31.300 --> 29:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: CNN found out about this
event because of this ad.

29:34.700 --> 29:38.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was actually posted
in the elevator of our
building here in Beijing.

29:38.300 --> 29:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, reporters
went, including CNN's Matt
Rivers, and most were promptly

29:43.200 --> 29:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shown the door, which only
provoked more coverage.

29:47.133 --> 29:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why the selective secrecy?

29:49.500 --> 29:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For one thing, Nicole Kushner
Meyer may have thought twice
about the optics or my-optics

29:56.433 --> 29:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of trading on her family
connection to the president,
though Kushner companies later

29:59.400 --> 30:04.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said Meyer -- quote
-- "apologizes if that
mention of her brother
was in any way interpreted

30:05.766 --> 30:09.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as an attempt to lure
investors" -- unquote.

30:09.033 --> 30:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But also iffy, the investment
itself, criticized for selling
U.S. citizenship for cash, the

30:16.000 --> 30:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
embattled EB-5 visa program, in
which foreigners who ante up a
million dollars to create 10

30:22.633 --> 30:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. jobs are granted permanent
residency, and eventual U.S.
citizenship, for themselves

30:29.100 --> 30:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and for all immediate
family members under age 21.

30:33.800 --> 30:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, the Kushners, who declined
to comment for this story,
have used EB-5 investments

30:40.066 --> 30:42.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
before, also here
in Jersey City.

30:42.400 --> 30:45.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JARED KUSHNER, Senior
Presidential Adviser:
As a company, we have
done a lot of projects,

30:45.133 --> 30:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but I have actually never
done a groundbreaking before.

30:47.666 --> 30:51.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Fifty
million dollars of Chinese
cash for visas helped
build Trump Bay Street,

30:53.666 --> 30:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president licensing his name
to his son-in-law's company, the
financing at below-market rates.

30:59.733 --> 31:03.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TERRENCE MCDONALD: This
is one of the newer luxury
high-rises here in Jersey City.

31:03.366 --> 31:05.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The highest price I saw
was on the 48th floor.

31:05.800 --> 31:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a 50-story building.

31:07.566 --> 31:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was about $5,000 a month
for a two-bedroom/two-bathroom
apartment.

31:11.733 --> 31:16.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Luxury apartments,
just a few minutes by
subway from Manhattan.

31:16.066 --> 31:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, hey, Congress decided,
during a recession in 1990,
that a million dollars to create

31:22.700 --> 31:27.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
10 jobs is a good deal
for the U.S. economy, no
matter what the project.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It turns out, however, that the
investors in Kushner's project
only had to put up $500,000,

31:34.800 --> 31:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
half-price tickets to
citizenship for themselves
and their entire families,
thanks to a clause

31:41.800 --> 31:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that takes 50 percent off if you
create the jobs in a -- quote
-- "high-unemployment area"

31:46.800 --> 31:47.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
- - unquote.

31:47.766 --> 31:50.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But wait a minute.

31:50.100 --> 31:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The unemployment rate around
Trump Bay Street was very low.

31:53.333 --> 31:56.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NORMAN ODER, Journalist:
There is an essential
dodge here going on.

31:56.100 --> 31:58.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's something
really fake going on.

31:58.233 --> 32:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Journalist Norman
Oder was the first to report on
the loophole that the Kushners,

32:01.700 --> 32:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and pretty much all urban
developers who use the
EB-5 program, exploit.

32:06.133 --> 32:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NORMAN ODER: EB-5 investments
are supposed to be a million
dollars unless it's in a rural

32:10.900 --> 32:13.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
area or an area of
high unemployment.

32:13.766 --> 32:15.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's called a targeted
employment area.

32:15.733 --> 32:17.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Then it's $500,000.

32:17.533 --> 32:19.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Guess what?

32:19.000 --> 32:22.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Every project is finagled
into a high-unemployment area.

32:22.566 --> 32:24.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: So
how do you do that?

32:24.200 --> 32:26.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NORMAN ODER: You have to
connect census tracts.

32:26.200 --> 32:30.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, let's walk
you through the process that
played out here in Jersey City.

32:30.166 --> 32:32.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TERRENCE MCDONALD: We're
about one mile away
from Trump Bay Street.

32:32.933 --> 32:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But we're
still in the EB-5 district.

32:34.866 --> 32:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERRENCE MCDONALD: Yes, we are.

32:37.333 --> 32:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: EB-5 visa
investors can pay half-price
if they're investing in
an area with a jobless

32:42.566 --> 32:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rate one-and-a-half times
the national average.

32:46.233 --> 32:51.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I can see that we're
gradually getting into
dicier territory here.

32:53.300 --> 32:56.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TERRENCE MCDONALD: We're about
two miles away from Trump Bay
Street now in an area of the

32:56.466 --> 33:00.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
city that has struggled
with violence and with
crime and with poverty.

33:00.333 --> 33:05.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In 2014, when the
Kushners and their partners
were pitching Chinese visa

33:06.900 --> 33:10.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
seekers, the national
unemployment rate was
just over 6 percent.

33:12.133 --> 33:15.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So now we're how far
away from downtown?

33:15.100 --> 33:18.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TERRENCE MCDONALD: We're about
three, a little more than
three miles away from Trump Bay

33:18.166 --> 33:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Street now, on Ocean Avenue.

33:19.766 --> 33:24.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: And we're
in a substantially
worse neighborhood now.

33:26.200 --> 33:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TERRENCE MCDONALD: Yes, yes,
businesses that are closed.

33:28.266 --> 33:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this area does struggle
with violence even more than
the neighborhood we were just

33:32.433 --> 33:34.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

33:34.966 --> 33:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: We're walking
the so-called targeted
employment area the
developers created, with

33:38.333 --> 33:41.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an average jobless rate
of more than 9 percent.

33:41.666 --> 33:46.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TERRENCE MCDONALD: The
unemployment rate where
Trump Bay Street is,
about four miles away,

33:48.733 --> 33:51.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is so low that they have to
include a huge swathe of the
inner city and lower half of

33:53.033 --> 33:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the city to make the rate work.

33:56.333 --> 34:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The only
requirement, the employment
area has to be made up
of neighborhoods that

34:01.066 --> 34:02.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
border each other.

34:02.733 --> 34:04.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TERRENCE MCDONALD:
So, we're about at the
end of the line here.

34:04.233 --> 34:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's Bayonne on the other
side of the train tracks.

34:06.300 --> 34:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: About five miles
and a whole lot of shoe leather
south of Trump Bay Street,

34:11.100 --> 34:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a gerrymandered, but legal
district made up of 16 different
census tracts, with an overall

34:18.166 --> 34:23.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
unemployment rate of
9.8 percent, when the
national average was 6.

34:24.700 --> 34:28.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The claim is that Trump
Bay Street created
more than 1,280 jobs.

34:28.433 --> 34:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But did it actually help the
poor parts of town that made
its financing attractive?

34:34.300 --> 34:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, you work in construction.

34:35.533 --> 34:36.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Absolutely.

34:36.766 --> 34:39.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Did you try
to get a job downtown?

34:39.133 --> 34:42.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: Several of us tried
to get a job downtown.

34:42.133 --> 34:44.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But they're not hiring us.

34:44.100 --> 34:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know no one at all
who has no type of job from
downtown at Trump Towers or who

34:49.266 --> 34:51.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
informed anyone
else about the jobs.

34:51.833 --> 34:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TERRENCE MCDONALD: Do you
think that the construction
of these luxury high-rises
downtown has benefited

34:54.533 --> 34:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this area of the city at all?

34:55.900 --> 34:56.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
MAN: No.

34:56.900 --> 34:58.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Look around.

34:58.366 --> 35:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People -- a lot of people
need help around here.

35:00.166 --> 35:01.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Any of
the contractors you
know work downtown?

35:01.066 --> 35:02.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: No.

35:02.066 --> 35:03.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

35:03.066 --> 35:04.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: You either?

35:04.066 --> 35:06.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: No.

35:06.133 --> 35:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: What do you think
of the idea, though, of you
being included in this area

35:09.266 --> 35:14.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that then allows them
to get the foreign money
to build the towers?

35:14.266 --> 35:16.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN: I don't
think that's fair.

35:16.866 --> 35:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN FULOP, Mayor of
Jersey City, New Jersey:
The intention of the EB-5
program are to subsidize

35:19.333 --> 35:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
areas in a city or community
that are lower-income,
in needs of jobs, and
don't have development.

35:24.133 --> 35:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Not to subsidize
areas that don't need it, says
Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop.

35:28.633 --> 35:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVEN FULOP: The media scrutiny
on this stuff has brought a
lot of that to light, and there

35:32.766 --> 35:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will probably be policy changes
in Washington as a result of it.

35:35.533 --> 35:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Well, there's
been legislation to try
to reform EB-5 for years.

35:39.833 --> 35:44.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVEN FULOP: I think now you're
in a unique moment in time
where there's more scrutiny

35:44.766 --> 35:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and more awareness around it.

35:46.800 --> 35:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Mayor Fulop, a
Democrat up for reelection
this fall, is also more aware.

35:53.466 --> 35:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The day after the story broke
about Nicole Kushner Meyer's
efforts in China, he withdrew

35:56.200 --> 36:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his support for a usually
standard 30-year tax abatement
and $30 million municipal bond

36:03.233 --> 36:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the Kushners and their
partners had applied for to
build one Journal Square.

36:07.633 --> 36:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, where's the mayor right now?

36:09.233 --> 36:11.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STEVEN FULOP: We're
not giving the subsidy.

36:11.300 --> 36:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have clearly said that,
and they say they can't
move forward without it.

36:14.766 --> 36:16.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So we will see where
it goes from here.

36:16.900 --> 36:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Where it's gone
is that, just yesterday, the
Kushner consortium withdrew

36:20.933 --> 36:22.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
its tax break request.

36:22.933 --> 36:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
According to the private company
helping raise $150 million
in EB-5 money, 6,600 new jobs

36:31.033 --> 36:33.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are now on hold.

36:33.000 --> 36:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they would be in a
prospering part of town with
just a 4 percent jobless rate.

36:38.066 --> 36:41.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The poorer neighborhoods
to the south?

36:41.300 --> 36:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their job was to boost the
average unemployment rate high
enough to qualify investors for

36:47.233 --> 36:49.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the half-price visas.

JUDY WOODRUFF: This week
marks the 50th anniversary
of the landmark Supreme
Court decision Loving

37:12.700 --> 37:14.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
vs. Virginia.

37:14.600 --> 37:19.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 1967, the justices struck
down Virginia's laws prohibiting
interracial marriage.

37:21.533 --> 37:25.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In her latest book, "Loving:
Interracial Intimacy in
America and the Threat
to White Supremacy,"

37:27.800 --> 37:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Georgetown University
law Professor Sheryll
Cashin explores the
history of white supremacy

37:33.766 --> 37:36.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this country and how
relationships between different
races challenge that ideology.

37:36.966 --> 37:41.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As part of our Race
Matters series, I sat down
with Cashin yesterday.

37:43.433 --> 37:45.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sheryll Cashin, thank you
very much for joining us.

37:45.633 --> 37:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the title of the book refers
to the Virginia couple, Richard
Loving, his wife, Mildred,

37:52.566 --> 37:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who were arrested, thrown in
jail for the crime of marrying
each other in the state

37:58.400 --> 38:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Virginia in the 1950s,
and then, in 1967, the
Supreme Court decision.

38:03.733 --> 38:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But your story, your telling
of this story, the book, goes
much earlier than that, to

38:09.700 --> 38:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the -- before the
beginning of this country.

38:11.800 --> 38:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

38:13.866 --> 38:18.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Supremacy": The
anti-miscegenation law
was created as part
of the law of slavery.

38:20.466 --> 38:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the 1600s, you had
white indentured servants
and black indentured
servants and slaves working

38:24.933 --> 38:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
together, fraternizing together.

38:27.700 --> 38:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when slave owners wanted
to transition to black chattel
slavery, they had this problem.

38:34.600 --> 38:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so they put in slave
codes laws that penalized
interracial sex and marriage.

38:40.866 --> 38:43.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that was --
began in the 1660s.

38:43.466 --> 38:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, for the next 300
years, you had the state of
Virginia and other states trying

38:49.866 --> 38:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to separate people like
Mildred and Richard Loving.

38:53.033 --> 38:57.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Going back to the
beginning, was this something
that was just bred in the

38:57.900 --> 39:00.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
psyche of the people who
lived in this country?

39:00.400 --> 39:02.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where did it come from?

39:02.400 --> 39:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHERYLL CASHIN: Well, in the
elite capitalist class, the
landed gentry that could afford

39:09.000 --> 39:14.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to buy big estates and
own people, this idea
of the supremacy of the
white Christian goes

39:17.266 --> 39:19.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
back to the Crusades.

39:19.266 --> 39:24.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there is much evidence that,
in colonial Virginia, in the
colonies, the working bonded

39:27.033 --> 39:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people didn't have a
concept of whiteness or
supremacy or race at all.

39:33.433 --> 39:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They related to each other
as struggling people.

39:36.333 --> 39:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's only when the slave owning
class needs to teach people to
treat each other differently

39:43.533 --> 39:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
based on race for utilitarian
reasons that that begins.

39:47.000 --> 39:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What were the
forces along the way in the
history of this country that

39:54.500 --> 39:58.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were pushing against
people coming together,
that were working against,
not just intermarriage,

40:01.666 --> 40:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but friendships, any kind of
connections between the races?

40:04.700 --> 40:07.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHERYLL CASHIN: Right.

40:07.366 --> 40:10.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wherever you have a regime
of the color line, whether
it's slavery or Jim Crow
or a divide-and-conquer

40:13.133 --> 40:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kind of politics, there's
an economic story there.

40:16.633 --> 40:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What the elites most
feared was that struggling
whites and people of
color would come together

40:23.733 --> 40:28.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in politics to demand
more of economic elites.

40:28.233 --> 40:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, along
the way, as you point out
throughout the book, there were

40:31.633 --> 40:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also forces at work to bring
the two -- not just the two,
but to bring all races together.

40:38.700 --> 40:43.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SHERYLL CASHIN: America
has been in this dance
from the beginning.

40:43.000 --> 40:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There have been two ideas,
the beautiful, egalitarian,
fundamental idea of universal

40:51.466 --> 40:56.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
human dignity in Thomas
Jefferson's words in
the Declaration of
Independence, but also

40:58.366 --> 41:03.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this regime of white supremacy
that is really designed
to help with capitalism.

41:05.966 --> 41:10.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And throughout this period,
there have always been a small
cadre of people that crossed

41:13.900 --> 41:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lines for alliance or for love.

41:16.333 --> 41:18.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I feature some
of those people.

41:18.433 --> 41:22.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Some of my favorites are
Frederick Douglass and
Thaddeus Stevens, who
not only were radical

41:24.900 --> 41:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in their politics, but were
radical enough to have women
of a different race as their

41:29.833 --> 41:31.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lovers or common law
wives or -- or wives.

41:31.633 --> 41:35.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why were
they able to prevail
in some instances?

41:35.800 --> 41:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERYLL CASHIN: The
radical Republicans behind
Reconstruction prevailed
with the idea that

41:42.900 --> 41:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people of color and progressive
open-minded whites would
come together in politics for

41:49.333 --> 41:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the common good and create
things like public education.

41:52.233 --> 41:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My bottom line point is that the
class of what I call culturally
dexterous person that's

41:59.233 --> 42:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
open to difference in
this country and wants to
make it work is growing.

42:02.166 --> 42:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's what
I wanted to ask you, because
you do use the term cultural

42:05.400 --> 42:06.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
dexterity throughout.

42:06.400 --> 42:07.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHERYLL CASHIN: Right.

42:07.666 --> 42:09.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What
do you mean by that?

42:09.800 --> 42:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHERYLL CASHIN: So, cultural
dexterity is the ability to
enter a situation where you

42:15.633 --> 42:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are outnumbered by a
different group and
experience that with comfort,
even wonder, an enhanced

42:24.100 --> 42:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
capacity for dealing with
people of a different group.

42:27.100 --> 42:29.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's the opposite
of colorblindness.

42:29.666 --> 42:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the ability to see
and understand difference
and accept it, rather
than sort of demanding

42:36.800 --> 42:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that someone else assimilate
to your cultural norms.

42:40.033 --> 42:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why do
you think it's spreading?

42:42.033 --> 42:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know there are people who
look at the racial divide in
this country today and say, yes,

42:45.800 --> 42:48.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we have made progress, but we
have such a long way to go.

42:48.800 --> 42:50.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SHERYLL CASHIN:
Yes, I will agree.

42:50.333 --> 42:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I acknowledge that we're in
a state of toxic polarity.

42:54.966 --> 42:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But all I'm saying is that I
believe we're going to get to
a point where a critical mass

43:01.966 --> 43:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of folks, particularly white
people in this country, have
accepted the loss of centrality

43:06.533 --> 43:08.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of whiteness.

43:08.566 --> 43:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when you combine those folks
with growing populations of
people of color, you're going

43:14.933 --> 43:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get a majority coalition
that will fight together
for the common good.

43:21.700 --> 43:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Even if, along
the way, you may always have
a group of people who fiercely

43:26.500 --> 43:27.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
believe something different.

43:27.766 --> 43:29.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHERYLL CASHIN: Yes.

43:29.866 --> 43:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not saying that interracial
relationships are going to make
racism go away, or -- nothing

43:33.133 --> 43:34.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like that.

43:34.900 --> 43:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There will always
probably be some people,
unfortunately, that are racist.

43:40.266 --> 43:42.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I think they're
a minority now.

43:42.533 --> 43:47.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think they
will continue to be a
minority in this country.

43:47.466 --> 43:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what gives me hope is that
there is a growing population
of folks who like diversity

43:54.633 --> 43:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and want to make it work and
want to be part of the coalition
for bringing everybody along.

44:01.833 --> 44:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sheryll Cashin,
the book is "Loving: Interracial
Intimacy in America and

44:06.266 --> 44:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Threat to White Supremacy,"

44:08.833 --> 44:11.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

44:11.500 --> 44:16.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SHERYLL CASHIN:
Thank you so much.

44:19.033 --> 44:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: When the death
camps and ghettos of Europe were
liberated at the end of World

44:26.400 --> 44:30.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
War II, a psychologist
from Chicago visited former
prisoners and recorded
dozens of interviews.

44:32.300 --> 44:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Boder's recordings are
among the earliest testimonies
from Holocaust survivors.

44:37.033 --> 44:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And long-missing reels of
songs from this collection
were recently discovered at the

44:41.433 --> 44:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
University of Akron, Ohio.

44:44.133 --> 44:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From PBS station WVIZ
ideastream in Cleveland,
David C. Barnett reports.

44:48.266 --> 44:53.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID C. BARNETT: Jon Endres
gingerly threads a thin silver
strand of wire through a machine

44:55.733 --> 44:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that will reproduce some
sounds unheard for decades.

44:59.633 --> 45:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON ENDRES, University of Akron:
It runs much like a reel-to-reel
tape player, if you remember

45:07.566 --> 45:09.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
those.

45:09.300 --> 45:11.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVID C. BARNETT: Endres
is a media specialist at
the University of Akron.

45:11.900 --> 45:16.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His colleague James Newhall
spent three years building this
playback machine from spare

45:16.766 --> 45:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
parts scrounged from
electronic stores and eBay.

45:20.333 --> 45:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The goal was to play some
mysterious recordings
made by psychologist
David Boder over 70 years

45:26.433 --> 45:28.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ago on a wire recorder.

45:28.466 --> 45:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BAKER, Cummings Center
for the History of Psychology:
One of Boder's areas of interest

45:31.733 --> 45:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and an important area of
his work was his work on
the measurement of trauma.

45:38.766 --> 45:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was the basis of his grant
in 1946 to travel to Europe to
interview a group of traumatized

45:47.433 --> 45:48.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

45:48.866 --> 45:52.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this included many
survivors of the Holocaust.

45:52.933 --> 45:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A collection of Boder material
was deposited here in 1967.

45:56.900 --> 46:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it included some
instruments and apparatus,
documents, and it included
a box of wire recordings.

46:03.666 --> 46:07.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: One, two, three,
one two, three.

46:07.066 --> 46:10.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BAKER: Scholars
were telling us that
there was a missing reel.

46:10.800 --> 46:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a reel of songs
that were sung to Boder by
Holocaust survivors in a camp in

46:17.533 --> 46:19.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
France after the war.

46:19.633 --> 46:23.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had a box of reels, and
scholars would ask from time
to time, do you know what's

46:23.000 --> 46:24.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on those?

46:24.333 --> 46:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we had to say, no, we don't.

46:26.366 --> 46:29.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID C. BARNETT:
But now they do.

46:29.033 --> 46:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: We are reproducing on this
spool a set of songs that have
been recorded 50 kilometers

46:39.200 --> 46:42.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Paris at a colony
of displaced persons.

46:42.433 --> 46:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID C. BARNETT: Baker
says the recent discovery
of this long-missing
reel of songs in the

46:48.900 --> 46:52.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cummings Center archives has
sparked worldwide interest.

46:52.933 --> 46:57.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVID BAKER: Two of the
songs were sung by a
woman named Guta Frank.

47:00.433 --> 47:05.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Guta Frank had survived
a number of the ghettos
in Poland, eventually
ending up in a -- doing

47:12.533 --> 47:17.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
forced labor at a
munitions factory.

47:22.366 --> 47:27.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One song they translated for
us: "Our village is burning."

47:29.266 --> 47:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In singing the song, she changed
the lyric from, "Our village
is burning" to "The Jewish

47:37.266 --> 47:39.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people are burning."

47:39.400 --> 47:44.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In introducing the song, Guta
Frank discussed the fact that
the composer's daughter would

47:46.200 --> 47:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sing this song in basements in
the Krakow ghetto, inspiring
people to rebel against

47:53.233 --> 47:55.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Nazis.

47:55.733 --> 47:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID C. BARNETT: For
concentration camp prisoners
who had no means of
writing down and preserving

48:04.500 --> 48:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what was happening to them,
they could sing songs about
it to each other and pass the

48:09.166 --> 48:11.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stories down in
an oral tradition.

48:11.900 --> 48:16.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Australian researcher
Joseph Toltz focuses the
music of the Holocaust.

48:16.200 --> 48:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, in this specialized
field, he's heard it all.

48:19.333 --> 48:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH TOLTZ, Researcher:
This was a beloved song
that traveled around the
entire Yiddish-speaking

48:24.300 --> 48:27.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
world, even to America
and other places.

48:27.033 --> 48:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID C. BARNETT: Toltz is
particularly impressed with the
clarity of the Akron recordings.

48:31.133 --> 48:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSEPH TOLTZ: This is a
technology that is 60, 70 years
old and completely outdated.

48:35.900 --> 48:40.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And they have done it
in such a way that has
brought a completely
new quality to the sound

48:42.333 --> 48:44.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that is sort of trapped
in these wire recordings.

48:44.666 --> 48:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID C. BARNETT: Jon
Endres was the one who
made the digital transfer.

48:48.133 --> 48:50.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JON ENDRES: I remember
hearing Krakow.

48:50.766 --> 48:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I remember recognizing
some of the more German words
in Yiddish, and knowing full

48:57.766 --> 49:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well they were saying things
along the lines of burning and
dying, and it was extremely

49:03.100 --> 49:04.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
intense.

49:04.600 --> 49:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BAKER: It's a bit like
hearing the voice of a ghost.

49:10.400 --> 49:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here are voices that have
been silent for 70 years.

49:13.500 --> 49:18.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, all of a sudden,
they're singing.

49:19.366 --> 49:22.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they're singing to us.

49:22.266 --> 49:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to another
in our Brief But Spectacular
series, where we ask people

49:48.833 --> 49:50.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to describe their passions.

49:50.800 --> 49:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from legendary
talk show host Dick Cavett,
whose in-depth discussions

49:55.533 --> 50:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kept American television
audiences entertained and
intellectually engaged
for more than five

50:01.066 --> 50:03.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
decades.

50:03.100 --> 50:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His latest book is "Brief
Encounters: Conversations, Magic
Moments, and Assorted Hijinks."

50:09.533 --> 50:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DICK CAVETT, Author, "Brief
Encounters: Conversations,
Magic Moments, and
Assorted Hijinks": Somebody

50:11.600 --> 50:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said once, what's the secret
of doing a successful, what's
the Brits call a chat show?

50:15.933 --> 50:20.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
If there is a secret,
it was enunciated by
the great Jack Paar.

50:20.200 --> 50:21.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He said, "Kid, don't
do interviews."

50:21.800 --> 50:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I said, "Well, what do
I do Jack, read to them?"

50:25.133 --> 50:30.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He said, "Make it
a conversation."

50:33.666 --> 50:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People ask me, what kind of
show did you decide to do or how
would you describe your show?

50:40.700 --> 50:44.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have never been able
to come up with an answer for
that, because of the fact that

50:45.200 --> 50:47.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I never had any plan.

50:47.233 --> 50:51.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All I knew was I was being
thrown into and responsible for
90 minutes of live television.

50:53.233 --> 50:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I had the advantage of
having seen great examples of
what I would be doing by Jack

50:59.633 --> 51:03.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Paar, Merv Griffin, Johnny
Carson, all of whom I wrote for.

51:03.166 --> 51:06.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHNNY CARSON, "The Tonight
Show": Would you welcome,
please, Mr. Dick Cavett?

51:06.200 --> 51:08.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

51:08.300 --> 51:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DICK CAVETT: With Johnny, of
course, you could turn him on
in your head, how he will word

51:15.100 --> 51:17.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it, how many
syllables he will use.

51:17.166 --> 51:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of that comes together to
make you able to write a line
that they can come out and

51:21.600 --> 51:23.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
say and sound like themselves.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Will you welcome, please,
Mr. Marlon Brando?

51:26.066 --> 51:27.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

51:27.766 --> 51:30.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DICK CAVETT: I was just
slap-happy delirious to
have Marlon Brando on

51:30.733 --> 51:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And my director admitted later
that he said, when Brando
threw that million-dollar grin

51:36.933 --> 51:40.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in a close-up shot,
I couldn't cut away.

51:40.433 --> 51:44.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My wife's favorite line from
that show is when I said:

51:44.366 --> 51:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Were you happy with the way
"The Godfather" came out?

51:47.100 --> 51:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARLON BRANDO, Actor: I would
rather not talk about movies.

51:50.033 --> 51:51.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't think they're...

51:51.200 --> 51:53.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

51:53.233 --> 51:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DICK CAVETT: I had the luck
of meeting and sitting with
Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis,

51:59.100 --> 52:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Orson Welles, Fred Astaire,
Groucho Marx, Alfred Hitchcock,
Robert Mitchum, oh, and

52:05.633 --> 52:07.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the great John Huston.

52:07.833 --> 52:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Somebody semi-humorously warned
me, "You're becoming the poster
boy for depression," because

52:14.833 --> 52:18.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would -- chose to talk about
it, because I found that,
when I did, it helped people.

52:20.333 --> 52:23.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I did shows with it, a thing
that is an ungodly task, as you
stand there sing merrily with

52:27.866 --> 52:32.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Ethel Merman, and you
feel like roadkill.

52:36.233 --> 52:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And people will say to Robin
Williams, you have the thrill
of going out on stage and

52:43.266 --> 52:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
getting an audience screaming
with happiness in their life.

52:46.133 --> 52:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, incidentally, I saw Robin
come off one night after doing
that and saying: "I could

52:51.900 --> 52:53.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
make those people happy.

52:53.133 --> 52:56.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why can't I make
myself that happy?"

52:56.233 --> 52:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's central to the problem.

52:58.633 --> 53:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When people ask me, who's doing
what you did, or is there a
show that is similar to what

53:05.666 --> 53:10.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you were doing, I don't think
there's anything exactly like
it, partly because it's just

53:11.500 --> 53:13.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
- - the medium
has changed a lot.

53:13.566 --> 53:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I might be more like parts
of Jon Stewart and certainly
parts of Stephen Colbert.

53:19.833 --> 53:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But people tell me
nothing is quite like it.

53:22.900 --> 53:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I wish somebody would tell
me exactly what they mean.

53:27.033 --> 53:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My name is Dick Cavett, and
this is my, how shall I say,
Brief But Spectacular take on

53:37.033 --> 53:41.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
my life and
conversation, I guess.

53:41.133 --> 53:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What a life
and a walk down memory lane.

53:48.500 --> 53:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now again to our
honor roll of American
service personnel killed
in Iraq and the Afghanistan

53:52.000 --> 53:53.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
conflict.

53:53.966 --> 53:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We add them as their deaths
are made official and
photographs become available.

53:56.133 --> 54:01.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Here, in silence,
are three more.

54:21.700 --> 54:24.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

54:24.233 --> 54:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Friday, I sit down
with retired Army
General David Petraeus to
discuss the fight against

54:28.433 --> 54:31.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ISIS and the ongoing
war in Afghanistan.

54:31.566 --> 54:33.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:33.633 --> 54:36.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow evening with
Mark Shields and David Brooks.

54:36.466 --> 54:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we leave you with
a view of the bipartisan
congressional baseball
game, which gets under

54:43.066 --> 54:46.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
way tonight, one day
after the shooting at a
baseball practice field.

54:46.133 --> 54:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're all hoping for a
peaceful evening of baseball.

54:50.166 --> 54:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank you,
and we will see you soon.
