05:08.400 --> 05:10.200
DIRECT DEMOCRACY

05:10.200 --> 05:12.800
THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT CRAZY ABOUT

05:12.800 --> 05:14.833
THEIR REFERENDUMS.

05:14.833 --> 05:18.033
IT'S SWITZERLAND'S UNIQUE POLICY

05:18.033 --> 05:19.600
OF POPULAR RULE.

05:19.600 --> 05:20.767
100,000 SIGNATURES TO GET IT O

05:20.767 --> 05:21.600
THE BALLOT

05:21.600 --> 05:23.000

05:23.000 --> 05:24.367
TO GET IT TO A VOTE.

05:24.367 --> 05:26.900
BUT THE TRADE UNION GOT THIS

05:26.900 --> 05:27.067
APPROVED

05:27.067 --> 05:28.600
THEY GOT ENOUGH BALLOT

05:28.600 --> 05:29.333
SIGNATURES IN 2012

05:29.333 --> 05:30.467

NEIGHBORHOOD AFFECT THE SWIS

05:36.833 --> 05:37.167

05:37.167 --> 05:39.000
>> SWITZERLAND HAS NO MINIMU

05:39.000 --> 05:39.233
WAGE

05:39.233 --> 05:40.433
BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO BEAR I

05:40.433 --> 05:43.867
MIND IS THAT THE OECD WHIC

05:43.867 --> 05:45.500
ADJUSTS FIGURES FOR SPENDING

05:45.500 --> 05:48.200
POWER LISTS THE HIGHEST MINIMU

06:06.767 --> 06:07.000
$7.25.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.600
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE

06:08.600 --> 06:11.433
SWISS MINIMUM WAGE WOULD HAV

06:11.433 --> 06:15.100
WORKED OUT TO ABOUT $14 IN
