NEWSROOMS LED BY WOMEN?

00:23.523 --> 00:25.359

GROWING NUMBER OF JEWS ARE

LEAVING FRANCE.

00:30.430 --> 00:31.398
>> DURING ISRAEL'S WAR WITH

00:31.398 --> 00:32.566
HAMAS, THE SYNAGOGUE WAS

ISLAMIC STATE EXTREMISTS OF

00:55.522 --> 00:57.624
BRITISH AID WORKER DAVID HAINES.

00:57.624 --> 00:58.625
>> THEY CLAIM TO DO THIS IN THE

00:58.625 --> 01:00.260
NAME OF ISLAM.

01:00.260 --> 01:02.362
THAT IS NONSENSE.

01:02.362 --> 01:05.132
ISLAM IS A RELIGION OF PEACE.

01:05.132 --> 01:07.601
THEY ARE NOT MUSLIMS, THEY ARE

01:07.601 --> 01:08.835
MONSTERS.

01:08.835 --> 01:10.537
>> Sreenivasan: APPEARING ON THE

01:14.574 --> 01:15.876
ITS KIND DOCUMENTED ON VIDEOTAPE

01:15.876 --> 01:16.977
IN RECENT WEEKS, ILLUSTRATES THE

01:16.977 --> 01:19.346
BRUTALITY OF THE GROUP.

01:19.346 --> 01:21.448
>> WE WERE OBVIOUSLY PAINFULLY

01:21.448 --> 01:24.017
AWARE OF THEIR BARBARITY AND

01:24.017 --> 01:26.119
THEIR NEFARIOUSNESS EVEN BEFORE

01:26.119 --> 01:27.988
THIS VIDEO, BUT THIS OBVIOUSLY

01:27.988 --> 01:30.624
UNDERSCORES IT YET AGAIN.

01:30.624 --> 01:31.992
>> Sreenivasan: ADMINISTRATION

01:31.992 --> 01:33.493
OFFICIALS SAID TODAY THAT

01:33.493 --> 01:34.928
AMERICAN ALLIES HAVE OFFERED TO

PARTICIPATE IN AIRSTRIKES

01:36.163 --> 01:37.364
AGAINST ISLAMIC STATE FIGHTERS

01:37.364 --> 01:38.532

01:38.532 --> 01:39.199
VOLUNTEER GROUND TROOPS TO FIGHT

01:39.199 --> 01:42.669
SOON.

01:42.669 --> 01:43.370
THOSE COUNTRIES WERE NOT

01:43.370 --> 01:44.671
IDENTIFIED.

01:44.671 --> 01:46.273
BUT SOUTH CAROLINA REPUBLICAN

01:46.273 --> 01:48.675
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM EXPRESSED

01:48.675 --> 01:49.710
STRONG DOUBT THE

01:49.710 --> 01:51.345
ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN WILL WORK.

01:51.345 --> 01:53.113
>> THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL YOU

01:53.113 --> 01:54.481
CAN FORM AN ARMY ON THE GROUND

01:54.481 --> 01:55.582
TO GO INTO SYRIA, TO DESTROY

01:55.582 --> 01:56.717
ISIL WITHOUT A SUBSTANTIAL

01:56.717 --> 01:58.719
AMERICAN COMPONENT.

01:58.719 --> 01:59.686
OUR STRATEGY WILL FAIL YET

01:59.686 --> 02:01.355
AGAIN.

02:01.355 --> 02:02.789
THIS PRESIDENT NEEDS TO RISE TO

02:02.789 --> 02:03.890
THE OCCASION BEFORE WE ALL GET

02:03.890 --> 02:06.626
KILLED BACK HERE AT HOME.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.014
AFRICA HAS CLAIMED THE LIFE OF

03:01.014 --> 03:02.449
ANOTHER DOCTOR, HOURS AFTER THE

03:02.449 --> 03:03.817
WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION SAID

03:03.817 --> 03:05.619
IT COULD NOT MEDICALLY EVACUATE

03:05.619 --> 03:07.120
HER FROM SIERRA LEONE TO

03:07.120 --> 03:08.822
GERMANY.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.290
MORE THAN 300 HEALTH WORKERS

03:10.290 --> 03:11.992
HAVE BECOME INFECTED WITH EBOLA

03:11.992 --> 03:14.061
IN GUINEA, LIBERIA AND SIERRA

03:14.061 --> 03:15.195
LEONE AND NEARLY HALF OF THEM

03:15.195 --> 03:16.530
HAVE DIED.

03:16.530 --> 03:17.731
THERE WAS A SHORTAGE OF DOCTORS

03:17.731 --> 03:18.999
IN THOSE COUNTRIES EVEN BEFORE

03:18.999 --> 03:19.833
THE EBOLA OUTBREAK BEGAN.

03:19.833 --> 03:20.901
SO FAR, ONLY FOREIGN HEALTH AND

03:20.901 --> 03:21.968
AID WORKERS HAVE BEEN MEDICALLY

03:21.968 --> 03:23.070
EVACUATED FROM THE AFFECTED

03:23.070 --> 03:25.439
NATIONS.

03:25.439 --> 03:26.473
AN UNUSUAL CEREMONY AT THE

03:26.473 --> 03:27.841
VATICAN TODAY.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.876

03:31.311 --> 03:32.846
WHO HAVE BEEN LIVING TOGETHER

03:32.846 --> 03:34.448
AND HAVE HAD CHILDREN.

03:34.448 --> 03:35.916
THE EVENT IS BEING INTERPRETED

03:35.916 --> 03:37.184
AS THE LATEST SIGN OF THE POPE'S

03:37.184 --> 03:38.618
WILLINGNESS TO MAKE THE CHURCH

03:38.618 --> 03:40.153
MORE INCLUSIVE.

03:40.153 --> 03:41.621
THE POPE OFFERED A TIP TO ALL

03:41.621 --> 03:44.925
THE NEWLYWEDS:

03:44.925 --> 03:47.127

IT'S NORMAL.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.800

03:53.800 --> 03:55.001
THE DAY WITHOUT MAKING PEACE,

03:55.001 --> 04:00.006
NEVER.

04:00.006 --> 04:01.641
>> Sreenivasan: IN INDIANOLA

04:01.641 --> 04:03.143
IOWA TODAY, AN IMPORTANT

04:03.143 --> 04:04.611
POLITICAL GATHERING: THE HARKIN

ATTENDED BY SEVERAL THOUSAND

04:08.648 --> 04:10.083
PEOPLE THAT HAS ACTED AS A

04:10.083 --> 04:11.284

04:11.284 --> 04:12.652
DEMOCRAT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES

04:14.121 --> 04:15.722
THE HEADLINERS TODAY WERE BILL

04:17.390 --> 04:18.692
A POLL PUBLISHED FRIDAY AMONG

04:18.692 --> 04:19.960
REGISTERED DEMOCRATS IN IOWA

04:19.960 --> 04:21.461
GAVE HILLARY CLINTON 53% MORE

04:21.461 --> 04:22.662
THAN TRIPLE ANY OTHER POSSIBLE

04:22.662 --> 04:25.232
DEMOCRAT CONTENDERS.

04:25.232 --> 04:27.000
AND FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,

04:27.000 --> 04:28.635
WORD OF AN UNUSUAL PLAN TO TRY

04:28.635 --> 04:30.203
TO STOP PANHANDLING AND FIGHT

04:30.203 --> 04:31.938
HOMELESSNESS.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.807
THE CITY OF PASADENA WILL BE

04:33.807 --> 04:35.742
USING 14 PARKING METERS TO

04:35.742 --> 04:37.444
COLLECT CHANGE THAT WILL BE

04:37.444 --> 04:38.712
DONATED TO GROUPS SERVING THE

04:38.712 --> 04:40.280
HOMELESS.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.882
IT'S ADVERTISED AS, "THE REAL

04:41.882 --> 04:42.883
CHANGE MOVEMENT."

04:42.883 --> 04:43.750
DENVER AND ORLANDO HAVE TRIED

04:43.750 --> 04:44.918
SIMILAR PLANS WITH MIXED

04:44.918 --> 04:46.086
RESULTS.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.287
ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS,

04:47.287 --> 04:48.388
DENVER HAS RAISED MORE THAN

04:48.388 --> 04:49.656
$30,000 A YEAR ANNUALLY.

04:49.656 --> 04:51.091
BUT ORLANDO REPORTEDLY COLLECTED

04:51.091 --> 04:52.592
LITTLE MORE THAN $2,000 IN THREE

04:52.592 --> 04:54.027
YEARS, BARELY MORE THAN WHAT IT

04:54.027 --> 05:08.675
COST TO INSTALL THE METERS.

05:08.675 --> 05:10.443
>> Sreenivasan: FOR MORE ABOUT

05:10.443 --> 05:11.745
THE TACTIC OF BEHEADINGS ADOPTED

05:11.745 --> 05:13.180
BY ISLAMIC STATE FIGHTERS, WE

05:13.180 --> 05:14.614
ARE JOINED NOW FROM WASHINGTON

05:14.614 --> 05:15.815
D.C. BY TOM SANDERSON.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.150
HE IS CO-DIRECTOR OF THE

05:17.150 --> 05:18.118
TRANSNATIONAL THREATS PROJECT AT

05:18.118 --> 05:19.119
THE CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND

05:19.119 --> 05:22.622
INTERNATIONAL STUDIES.

05:22.622 --> 05:24.424
SO WHAT PURPOSES DO THESE

05:24.424 --> 05:26.126
VIDEOS SERVE?

05:26.126 --> 05:28.395
>> WELL MANY-- WELL, MANY

05:28.395 --> 05:29.496
PURPOSE, ONE, IT CERTAINLY

05:29.496 --> 05:31.831
IS DESIGNED TO TERRORIZE THE

05:31.831 --> 05:34.968
WEST, THE POPULATIONS, THE

05:34.968 --> 05:36.336
PUBLIC IS REPRESENTING THAT

05:36.336 --> 05:39.172
PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL

05:39.172 --> 05:42.209
POTENTIALLY IN THE HOPE THAT

05:42.209 --> 05:43.910
ISIS DETER FURTHER ACTION.

05:43.910 --> 05:44.744
THESE GROUPS KNOW,

05:44.744 --> 05:45.545
ESPECIALLY ISIS KNOW THAT

05:45.545 --> 05:48.181
SOME NATIONS PAY RANSOMS TO

05:48.181 --> 05:49.082
RELEASE THEIR INDIVIDUAL,

05:49.082 --> 05:50.617
AND THEY KNOW THAT IF THEY

05:50.617 --> 05:51.651
PRESENT THIS AS THE OPTION

05:51.651 --> 05:53.353
FOR NOT PAYING A RANSOM THAT

05:53.353 --> 05:55.121
PERHAPS THEY COULD SPLIT THE

05:55.121 --> 05:56.823
COALITION, THE PARTNERS THAT

05:56.823 --> 05:58.158
HAVE SIGNED UP TO CONFRONT

05:58.158 --> 05:59.926
ISIS, SO THAT'S ONE REASON,

05:59.926 --> 06:00.994
TERRORIZING AND POTENTIALLY

06:00.994 --> 06:01.995
SPLITTING.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.263
THE OTHER CERTAINLY ABOUT

06:03.263 --> 06:04.631
EMPOWERMENT, BOTH FOR

06:04.631 --> 06:05.465
THEMSELVES AND FOR THOSE

06:05.465 --> 06:06.833
YOUNG MEN THAT THEY TRY TO

06:06.833 --> 06:07.834
RECRUIT.

06:07.834 --> 06:09.603
AT THIS POINT IN THE CURRENT

06:09.603 --> 06:11.304
STATE OF THE BATTLE THE U.S.

06:11.304 --> 06:13.773
CAN HIT ISIS WITH IMPUNITY,

06:13.773 --> 06:14.674
WILL HAVE DRONES IN THE

06:14.674 --> 06:15.475
BATTLE.

06:15.475 --> 06:16.509
WE HAVE AIRCRAFT NOW.

06:16.509 --> 06:17.677
WE DON'T HAVE BOOTS ON THE

06:17.677 --> 06:18.745
GROUND.

06:18.745 --> 06:20.247
SO ISIS CAN'T HIT BACK AND

06:20.247 --> 06:21.014
BLEED US.

06:21.014 --> 06:24.017
BUT THEY CAN THROUGH OUR

06:24.017 --> 06:25.051
CIVILIANS, THROUGH THE

06:25.051 --> 06:27.287
REPORTERS, NGO WORKERS,

06:27.287 --> 06:28.188
HUMANITARIAN WORKERS

06:28.188 --> 06:28.855
ORGANIZE WHATEVER.

06:28.855 --> 06:30.557
SO THIS TO THEM LEVELS THE

06:30.557 --> 06:31.458
PLAYING FIELD TO SOME

06:31.458 --> 06:32.225
DEGREE.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.159
IT'S ALSO ABOUT REVENGE,

06:33.159 --> 06:34.227
CLEARLY.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.695
THE ORANGE GITMO JUMP SUIT

06:35.695 --> 06:36.963
IS ABOUT HITTING BACK AND

06:36.963 --> 06:37.631
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

06:37.631 --> 06:38.331
STRIKE THE U.S.

06:38.331 --> 06:40.767
SO THIS GIVES THEM THAT

06:40.767 --> 06:42.135
OPPORTUNITY TO SATISFY THAT

06:42.135 --> 06:43.503
NEED OF ACTUALLY INFLICTING

06:43.503 --> 06:45.538
PAIN ON THE WEST.

06:45.538 --> 06:47.240
THAT BRINGS ME TO THE THIRD

06:47.240 --> 06:48.975
PART, THAT'S THE RECRUITMENT

06:48.975 --> 06:50.310
ELEMENT, THE PROPAGANDA TOOL

06:50.310 --> 06:51.378
THIS IS VERY SATISFYING TO

06:51.378 --> 06:52.646
YOUNG MEN WHO COME FROM

06:52.646 --> 06:54.347
COUNTRIES WHERE THEY'RE

06:54.347 --> 06:56.816
MARGINALIZE-- MARGINALIZED,

06:56.816 --> 06:57.851
WHERE THEY ARE SUBJECT TO

06:57.851 --> 06:59.552
HARSH TREATMENT, WHERE THEY

06:59.552 --> 07:00.954
FEEL DENUDED AND IMPOTENT.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.389
AND THIS GIVES THEM A SENSE

07:02.389 --> 07:03.757
OF POWER THAT THEY ARE

07:03.757 --> 07:05.191
PROBABLY NEVER HAD BEFORE.

07:05.191 --> 07:06.159
>> ON THE FIRST POINT WHEN

07:06.159 --> 07:07.260
YOU SAID THAT THIS IS MAYBE

07:07.260 --> 07:08.528
A WAY TO FRACTURE DIFFERENT

07:08.528 --> 07:09.896
PARTS OF THE COALITION T

07:09.896 --> 07:11.064
SEEMS TO BE GALVANIZING THE

07:11.064 --> 07:11.831
WEST AGAINST THEM.

07:11.831 --> 07:12.699
>> YEAH.

07:12.699 --> 07:13.633
>> YEAH.

07:13.633 --> 07:15.368
RIGHT NOW AND THE PEOPLE

07:15.368 --> 07:17.103
THAT THEY HIT ARE THE U.K.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.171
AND THE U.S.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.539
AND QUESTION HAVE BEEN VERY

07:19.539 --> 07:21.574
RESOLUTE IN OUR ACT, IN OUR

07:21.574 --> 07:22.942
DISPOSITION TOWARDS ISIS.

07:22.942 --> 07:24.644
BUT I THINK THAT IN THE

07:24.644 --> 07:26.079
FUTURE YOU COULD SEE MORE OF

07:26.079 --> 07:29.115
THESE ATTACKS, MORE OF THESE

07:29.115 --> 07:30.150
BEHEADINGS AGAINST CITIZENS

07:30.150 --> 07:31.785
FROM COALITION COUNTRIES AS

07:31.785 --> 07:33.620
AN EFFORT TO SPLIT THEM, TO

07:33.620 --> 07:34.921
SPLIT THE PARTNERSHIP,

07:34.921 --> 07:37.290
WHETHER THIS WORKS NOT I

07:37.290 --> 07:38.024
DON'T KNOW BUT IT

07:38.024 --> 07:40.093
CERTAINLY IS ONE OF THE FEW

07:40.093 --> 07:41.127
TOOLS THAT ISIS WILL BE ABLE

07:41.127 --> 07:41.961
TO USE AGAINST THAT

07:41.961 --> 07:42.696
COALITION.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.597
SO I WOULD EXPECT TO SEE

07:44.597 --> 07:45.598
THIS AS AN EFFORT IN THE

07:45.598 --> 07:46.466
FUTURE.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.667
>> IS IT WORKING ON THE

07:47.667 --> 07:49.035
RECRUITING FRONT?

07:49.035 --> 07:50.370
>> I THINK SO.

07:50.370 --> 07:52.439
I CERTAINLY THINK THAT AGAIN,

07:52.439 --> 07:54.808
THESE YOUNG MEN, 10,000 OR

07:54.808 --> 07:56.509
MORE, UPWARDS OF MAYBE

07:56.509 --> 07:58.545
15,000 WHO HAVE COME.

07:58.545 --> 08:00.980
>> SEE THIS AS ONE OF THE

08:00.980 --> 08:02.415
FEW METHODS THAT ISIS AND

08:02.415 --> 08:05.118
THEMSELVES BY EXTENSION CAN

08:05.118 --> 08:05.819
TAKE AGAINST THE WEDNESDAY.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.187
AND AGAIN IT'S NOT

08:07.187 --> 08:08.254
COINCIDENTAL THAT THE ORANGE

08:08.254 --> 08:09.956
JUMP SUIT IS BEING USED HERE

08:09.956 --> 08:12.359
SO I DO THINK IT SERVES AS

08:12.359 --> 08:14.961
AN EFFECTIVE PROPAGATION,

08:14.961 --> 08:16.129
PROPAGANDA TOOL FOR THESE

08:16.129 --> 08:17.130
YOUNG MEN WHO AGAIN ARE

08:17.130 --> 08:18.131
COMING FROM PLACES WHERE

08:18.131 --> 08:20.667
THEY ARE MARGINALIZE.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.268
>> IS THERE A POINT OF

08:22.268 --> 08:23.436
DIMINISHING RETURNS FOR THE

08:23.436 --> 08:24.237
ISLAMIC STATE WITH THESE

08:24.237 --> 08:24.971
VIDEOS?

08:24.971 --> 08:25.839
>> WELL, IT'S DIFFICULT TO

08:25.839 --> 08:26.673
SAY.

08:26.673 --> 08:27.974
I THINK THERE ARE

08:27.974 --> 08:29.776
DIMINISHING RETURNS FOR THE

08:29.776 --> 08:30.844
BEHEADING VIDEOS.

08:30.844 --> 08:31.845
IT COULD BE THAT SIMPLY THE

08:31.845 --> 08:33.646
FIRST ONE TO COME OUT WITH

08:33.646 --> 08:35.615
JAMES FOLEY REALLY SHOCKED

08:35.615 --> 08:36.483
AMERICANS AND SHOCKED THE

08:36.483 --> 08:37.484
WEST.

08:37.484 --> 08:38.318
BUT AS THEY CONTINUE, IF

08:38.318 --> 08:39.686
THEY DO CONTINUE, AND I HOPE

08:39.686 --> 08:42.422
THEY DON'T, IT COULD BE A

08:42.422 --> 08:44.457
DIMINISHING EFFECT FOR ISIS

08:44.457 --> 08:45.291
AS THEY CONDUCT THESE.

08:45.291 --> 08:46.826
I THINK THE BACKS OF

08:46.826 --> 08:48.194
AMERICANS WILL CONTINUE TO

08:48.194 --> 08:49.963
STIFFEN, RESOLVE IS STRONG

08:49.963 --> 08:50.730
RIGHT NOW.

08:50.730 --> 08:52.265
SO I THINK THAT ISIS COULD

08:52.265 --> 08:53.099
FIND THAT THEY DON'T HAVE

08:53.099 --> 08:55.101
THE SAME KIND OF EFFECT.

08:55.101 --> 08:57.871
BUT IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN

08:57.871 --> 08:59.205
WHAT SORT OF IMPACT IT HAS

08:59.205 --> 09:00.974
ON THE U.S. PUBLIC, THE

09:00.974 --> 09:03.710
PUBLIC OF OUR PARTNERS, BOTH

09:03.710 --> 09:05.211
LOCALLY IN THE REGION AS

09:05.211 --> 09:06.413
WELL AS IN EUROPE.

09:06.413 --> 09:07.514
AND AMONG THOSE RECRUITS.

09:07.514 --> 09:08.815
SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

09:08.815 --> 09:09.516
DETERMINE THE LONG-TERM

09:09.516 --> 09:10.216
EFFECT.

09:10.216 --> 09:11.251
>> AND WHAT ABOUT THE

09:11.251 --> 09:11.918
MEDIA'S ROLE OR

09:11.918 --> 09:13.353
RESPONSIBILITY IN HOW THESE

09:13.353 --> 09:14.621
IMAGES ARE REPEATED OVER AND

09:14.621 --> 09:15.321
OVER AGAIN.

09:15.321 --> 09:16.022
>> YEAH.

09:16.022 --> 09:18.792
WELL, I THINK WE'VE SEEN A

09:18.792 --> 09:20.193
CLEAR CHANGE WHERE MEDIA IS

09:20.193 --> 09:21.861
TRYING TO CONDUCT A BLACKOUT

09:21.861 --> 09:22.729
OF THESE VIDEOS.

09:22.729 --> 09:23.563
AND I THINK THAT'S VERY

09:23.563 --> 09:24.297
GOOD.

09:24.297 --> 09:24.998
WHICH POINTS IT TO THE FACT

09:24.998 --> 09:26.966
THAT THERE IS A PROPAGANDA

09:26.966 --> 09:28.334
VALUE HERE FOR THE VIDEOS.

09:28.334 --> 09:30.036
SO I THINK IT'S BEEN GOOD

09:30.036 --> 09:32.472
THAT TWITTER AND OTHER MEDIA

09:32.472 --> 09:34.207
FORUMS INCLUDING VISUAL

09:34.207 --> 09:35.542
MEDIA HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SHUT

09:35.542 --> 09:37.544
DOWN AND REDUCE THE

09:37.544 --> 09:38.978
INCIDENCES OF THE VIDEOS

09:38.978 --> 09:40.346
BEING SHOWN.

09:40.346 --> 09:41.381

09:41.381 --> 09:42.749
BUT I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS A

09:42.749 --> 09:43.750
WAY AROUND THAT AND I THINK

09:43.750 --> 09:44.784
ISIS IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO

09:44.784 --> 09:46.219
FIND THOSE WAYS AND REACH

09:46.219 --> 09:46.986
THE PEOPLE THAT THEY WANT TO

09:46.986 --> 09:47.887

14:27.266 --> 14:28.601
NOT TO LEAVE.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.403

14:30.403 --> 14:32.672
BUT ITS NOT THE SAME AT THAT

14:32.672 --> 14:34.574
TIME THE GOVERNMENTS WERE ANTI-

14:34.574 --> 14:38.578
SEMITIC.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.847
TODAY, YOU ONLY HAVE SMALL

14:40.847 --> 14:42.048

14:42.048 --> 14:44.684
SEMITIC.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.660
LARGELY DRIVEN BY RADICAL ISLAM.

14:54.660 --> 14:55.862
THOSE KILLINGS IN TOULOUSE AND

15:08.775 --> 15:10.443
GUISE THIS NEW ANTI-SEMITISM

15:10.443 --> 15:11.978
THIS ANTI-ISRAEL.

15:11.978 --> 15:13.346
ANTI-ISRAEL IS THE NEW ANTI-

15:13.346 --> 15:21.921
SEMITISM HERE.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.790

15:23.790 --> 15:25.291
PALESTINIAN FEELINGS ARE STRONG

15:25.291 --> 15:26.559
AMONG FRENCH MUSLIMS.

15:26.559 --> 15:27.927
THE MAJORITY COME FROM NORTH

15:27.927 --> 15:29.295
AFRICAN COUNTRIES, LIKE ALGERIA

15:29.295 --> 15:31.697
AND MOROCCO.

MUSLIMS ACCOUNT FOR AS MUCH AS

15:33.299 --> 15:40.773
10% OF THE FRENCH POPULATION.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.241
THOSE DEMONSTRATIONS WERE TO

15:42.241 --> 15:43.509
SHOW SUPPORT FOR OUR PALESTINIAN

15:43.509 --> 15:44.343
BROTHERS HE SAYS, BECAUSE OF THE

15:44.343 --> 15:45.378
BOMBS AND BECAUSE THEY ARE BEING

15:45.378 --> 15:46.546
KILLED.

15:46.546 --> 15:47.647
BUT ACCORDING TO PUBLISH REPORTS

15:47.647 --> 15:48.748
IT IS ESTIMATED THAT ONLY A

15:48.748 --> 15:50.850
SMALL PERCENTAGE OF FRANCES

15:50.850 --> 15:53.152
ESTIMATED 6.5 MILLION MUSLIMS

HARBOUR EXTREMIST VIEWS.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.289

15:56.289 --> 15:57.857
THIS PREDOMINANTLY MUSLIM AREA

15:57.857 --> 16:01.394
OF PARIS SAID THERE IS A

16:01.394 --> 16:05.031
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING

16:05.031 --> 16:06.799
CRITICAL OF ISRAEL'S ACTION AND

16:06.799 --> 16:08.334
BEING ANTI-SEMITIC.

16:08.334 --> 16:09.936
>> I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST THE

16:09.936 --> 16:11.237
JEWISH COMMUNITY HE SAYS BECAUSE

16:11.237 --> 16:12.305
EVERYONE HAS THEIR RELIGION BUT

16:12.305 --> 16:13.840
WHAT'S HAPPENED IN GAZA IS

16:13.840 --> 16:16.642
APPALLING.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.244
>> Reporter: EASY TO SEE THEN

16:18.244 --> 16:20.146
HOW THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN

16:20.146 --> 16:21.948
CONFLICT STOKED TENSIONS OVER

16:21.948 --> 16:23.182
THE SUMMER.

16:23.182 --> 16:24.483
THAT PARIS SUBURB OF SARCELLES

16:24.483 --> 16:26.419
IS STILL TRYING TO COME TO TERMS

16:26.419 --> 16:28.721

16:28.721 --> 16:30.323
SARCELLES HAS ALWAYS BEEN

DEFINED BY PEACEFUL CO-EXISTENCE

16:34.760 --> 16:36.262
BETWEEN JEWS AND MUSLIMS.

16:36.262 --> 16:37.129

SARCELLES MAYOR, FRANCOIS

SAYS, IF JEWS LEAVE IT'S A SIGN

16:53.579 --> 16:54.714
OF THE REPUBLICS FAILURE.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.115

BUT HOW MANY ARE THERE?

17:12.565 --> 17:15.835
THE GOOD PEOPLE?

17:15.835 --> 17:17.703

17:33.152 --> 17:34.320
THERE ARE TOUGH LAWS FORBIDDING

17:34.320 --> 17:35.421
ANY KIND OF COMMUNICATION THAT

17:35.421 --> 17:36.589
MIGHT INCITE HATRED OR

17:36.589 --> 17:45.364
DISCRIMINATION.

17:45.364 --> 17:46.799
>> THE LAW ON FREEDOM OF SPEECH

17:46.799 --> 17:47.633

17:47.633 --> 17:48.501
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS YOU

17:48.501 --> 17:49.969
CANNOT SAY

17:49.969 --> 17:51.037
>> Reporter: THE GOVERNMENT

17:51.037 --> 17:52.071
WANTS TO REASSURE THE JEWS OF

17:52.071 --> 17:53.339
FRANCE THAT THEY ARE SAFE HERE.

17:53.339 --> 17:57.743

17:58.544 --> 18:00.212

18:03.282 --> 18:04.383
AND SEE, WAIT AND SEE BECAUSE

18:04.383 --> 18:06.218
ITS NOT EASY TO LEAVE ITS VERY

18:06.218 --> 18:10.323
BRAVE TO LEAVE.

18:13.292 --> 18:15.127
THEY WENT AHEAD WITH THEIR PLAN

18:15.127 --> 18:17.930

18:17.930 --> 18:19.365

18:19.365 --> 18:21.500
NO, I'M NOT SAD.

AUTHORITY IN NEWSROOMS ACROSS

THE UNITED STATES.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.039
THIS ACCORDING TO A NIEMAN

19:00.039 --> 19:01.574
REPORT PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY BY

19:01.574 --> 19:02.775
THE NIEMAN FOUNDATION FOR

19:02.775 --> 19:04.010
JOURNALISM AT HARVARD.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.378
FOR MORE ABOUT THIS, WE ARE

19:05.378 --> 19:06.479
JOINED NOW FROM PORTLAND OREGON,

19:06.479 --> 19:07.413
BY ANNA GRIFFIN.

19:07.413 --> 19:08.347
SHE IS A REPORTER AND EDITOR AT

19:08.347 --> 19:09.782
THE OREGONIAN AND IS THE AUTHOR

19:09.782 --> 19:12.718
OF THE REPORT.

19:12.718 --> 19:14.153
IS SO HOW SIGNIFICANT ARE

19:14.153 --> 19:14.887
THE DISPARITIES BETWEEN MEN

19:14.887 --> 19:16.322
AND WOMEN WHEN IT COMES TO

19:16.322 --> 19:17.189
LEADERSHIP POSITIONS IN

19:17.189 --> 19:18.124
NEWSROOMS?

19:18.124 --> 19:18.958
>> THEY ARE REALLY, REALLY

19:18.958 --> 19:19.658
STARK.

19:19.658 --> 19:20.593
WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES

19:20.593 --> 19:22.561
MAKE UP SOMETHING LIKE 35%

19:22.561 --> 19:25.398
OF ALL NEWSPAPER SUPERVISORS.

19:25.398 --> 19:28.968
THEY RUN THREE OF THE TOP 25

19:28.968 --> 19:30.236
CIRCULATION NEWSPAPERS.

19:30.236 --> 19:32.304
AND THE NUMBERS TRANSLATE

19:32.304 --> 19:32.972
INTERNATIONALLY TOO.

19:32.972 --> 19:35.608
WOMEN RUN ONE OF THE TOP 25

19:35.608 --> 19:37.810
CIRCULATIONS INTERNATIONALLY

19:37.810 --> 19:40.012
OF NEWSPAPERS, SO IT IS AN

19:40.012 --> 19:40.846
INDUSTRYWIDE PROBLEM.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.548
>> Sreenivasan: THIS ISN'T A

19:42.548 --> 19:43.582
PIPELINE ISSUE, THERE ARE AS

19:43.582 --> 19:44.683
MANY WOMEN COMING OUT OF

19:44.683 --> 19:45.618
JOURNALISM OR COMMUNICATION

19:45.618 --> 19:46.652
PROGRAMS IN COLLEGES SO,

19:46.652 --> 19:47.319
WHAT'S HAPPENED.

19:47.319 --> 19:48.320
WHAT'S BEHIND THIS?

19:48.320 --> 19:49.822
>> IT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

19:49.822 --> 19:50.790
THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE TRY

19:50.790 --> 19:51.624
TO GET INTO.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.159
AND I THINK ANSWERING IT IS

19:53.159 --> 19:55.494
REALLY COMPLICATED BECAUSE

19:55.494 --> 19:56.228
AS YOU MENTIONED WITH WHAT

19:56.228 --> 19:57.997
WE SEE IS COMING OUT OF

19:57.997 --> 19:58.864
JOURNALISM SCHOOLS WOMEN

19:58.864 --> 20:00.666
MAKE UP HALF THE POPULATION

20:00.666 --> 20:02.068
OF YOUNG JOURNALISTS.

20:02.068 --> 20:03.436
AND OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS

20:03.436 --> 20:05.838
OR SO EVERY TIME YOU TAKE A

20:05.838 --> 20:07.506
FIVE YEAR SNAPSHOT THE

20:07.506 --> 20:08.441
PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN HAS

20:08.441 --> 20:09.175
DROPPED.

20:09.175 --> 20:10.643
AND TO GET INTO THOSE

20:10.643 --> 20:11.677
LEADERSHIP ROLES

20:11.677 --> 20:12.611
PARTICULARLY OLD SCHOOL

20:12.611 --> 20:13.879
MAINSTREAM NEWS

20:13.879 --> 20:14.747
ORGANIZATIONS YOU HAVE TO

20:14.747 --> 20:15.414
STICK AROUND.

20:15.414 --> 20:16.515
EXPERIENCE PLAYS A LARGE

20:16.515 --> 20:18.451
PART IN WHO GETS PROMOTED,

20:18.451 --> 20:19.552
ESPECIALLY WHO GETS PICKED

20:19.552 --> 20:20.252
FOR TOP JOBS.

20:20.252 --> 20:21.620
WOMEN ARE OPTING OUT.

20:21.620 --> 20:22.988
THEY'RE OPTING OUT EARLIER

20:22.988 --> 20:23.656
AND EARLIER.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.691
IN SOME CASES IT'S THE

20:25.691 --> 20:26.392
ANSWERS WOULD YOU EXPECT,

20:26.392 --> 20:27.393
ITS ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO

20:27.393 --> 20:28.861
HAVE A FAMILY HAS TO MAKE A

20:28.861 --> 20:30.863
REALLY HARD CHOICE BECAUSE

20:30.863 --> 20:32.198
JOURNALISM IS A HARD JOB.

20:32.198 --> 20:33.899
IT'S A LOW-PAYING JOB.

20:33.899 --> 20:34.934
IT'S A JOB THAT REQUIRES A

20:34.934 --> 20:35.968
LOT OF FLEXIBILITY IN YOUR

20:35.968 --> 20:36.969
SCHEDULE.

20:36.969 --> 20:39.271
BUT IT'S NOT JUST THAT.

20:39.271 --> 20:41.640
EVEN IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE

20:41.640 --> 20:43.275
REALLY FAMILY-FRIENDLY

20:43.275 --> 20:45.077
POLICIES, THAT LET WOMEN AND

20:45.077 --> 20:46.412
MEN GO SPEND A LOT OF TIME

20:46.412 --> 20:48.114
WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND THEN

20:48.114 --> 20:49.215
GUARANTEE THEM THEIR JOBS BY

20:49.215 --> 20:51.183
LAW WHEN THEY COME BACK, THE

20:51.183 --> 20:52.218
PERCENTAGES ARE REALLY

20:52.218 --> 20:53.319
SIMILAR.

20:53.319 --> 20:54.920
SO IT'S NOT-- IT'S NOT JUST

20:54.920 --> 20:55.988
WHAT YOU THINK IT IS.

20:55.988 --> 20:58.357
IT IS SOMETHING SYSTEMIC

20:58.357 --> 21:00.426
THAT WE'RE REALLY AS AN

21:00.426 --> 21:02.194
INDUSTRY STRUGGLING TO PUT

21:02.194 --> 21:03.195
OUR FINGERS AROUND.

21:03.195 --> 21:04.063
>> WHAT ARE SOME OF THE

21:04.063 --> 21:05.297
CONSEQUENCES EDITORIALLY, IS

21:05.297 --> 21:08.634
THE NEWS THAT WE CONSUME

21:08.634 --> 21:10.002
DIFFERENT WHEN WOMEN ARE IN

21:10.002 --> 21:11.036
POSITIONS OF LEADERSHIP?

21:11.036 --> 21:12.338
>> THE ACADEMIC STUDIES ARE

21:12.338 --> 21:13.305
REALLY MIXED ON WHETHER

21:13.305 --> 21:16.242
THERE IS A TANGIBLE TODAY'S

21:16.242 --> 21:18.310
NEWSPAPER LOOKS DIFFERENT.

21:18.310 --> 21:20.913
BUT WHAT WE KNOW AN I THINK

21:20.913 --> 21:23.048
YOU CAN DRAW SOME

21:23.048 --> 21:23.716
CONCLUSIONS FROM THIS IS

21:23.716 --> 21:24.683
THAT ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE

21:24.683 --> 21:26.051
RUN BY WOMEN TEND TO QUOTE

21:26.051 --> 21:27.486
MORE WOMEN, TEND TO REVOW

21:27.486 --> 21:29.155
MORE BOOKS BY WOMEN.

21:29.155 --> 21:31.457
TEND TO HAVE WOMEN COVERING

21:31.457 --> 21:32.725
HARDER NEWS BEATS.

21:32.725 --> 21:35.628
AND SO YEAH, EVERY EDITOR

21:35.628 --> 21:37.163
MALE AND FEMALE HAS THEIR

21:37.163 --> 21:38.964
OWN PERSONAL STYLE, THEIR

21:38.964 --> 21:39.999
OWN PREFERENCE IN THE KINDS

21:39.999 --> 21:41.200
OF STORIES THAT THEY LIKE

21:41.200 --> 21:42.468
THEIR PEOPLE TO CORPORATE

21:42.468 --> 21:43.903
YOU BY THINK THE BROAD

21:43.903 --> 21:46.438
ANSWER TO THAT IS WOMEN AND

21:46.438 --> 21:47.873
MEN DO THINK DIFFERENTLY AND

21:47.873 --> 21:48.874
DIFFERENT WOMEN AND MEN

21:48.874 --> 21:49.542
THINK DIFFERENTLY.

21:49.542 --> 21:50.476
AND PARTICULARLY IN

21:50.476 --> 21:52.545
MAINSTREAM MEDIA, OUR JOB IS

21:52.545 --> 21:54.580
TO REFLECT THE ENTIRE

21:54.580 --> 21:56.682
COMMUNITY THAT WE COVER, ANY

21:56.682 --> 21:57.716
GIVEN ORGANIZATION, YOU NEED

21:57.716 --> 21:58.751
AS BROAD A RANGE OF VOICES

21:58.751 --> 21:59.518
AS POSSIBLE.

21:59.518 --> 22:01.120
AND THAT'S JUST NOT
