more on the
president-elect's newest

how they may shape domestic and
foreign policies;
reflections on possible changes
in immigration

05:07.474 --> 05:21.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

Trump's latest picks for his top
jobs in his

administration.

05:29.596 --> 05:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We start with Senator Jeff
Sessions, one of
the most conservative U.S.
lawmakers, and

05:33.200 --> 05:37.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
potentially the nation's next
top law enforcement
official.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang begins.

05:39.005 --> 05:43.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

Sessions
became the first senator to back
candidate

05:43.577 --> 05:44.544 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.313 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

the United States.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

05:49.316 --> 05:57.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Today,
president-elect Trump picked
him to be attorney general.

05:57.157 --> 06:02.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jefferson Beauregard Sessions
III was first
elected to the Senate in 1996,
and is known

06:02.862 --> 06:06.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to have good relations across
party lines.

06:06.199 --> 06:12.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the 1980s, as a
Reagan-appointed U.S. attorney
in Alabama, he had made his name
as a tough,

06:12.038 --> 06:13.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
aggressive prosecutor.

06:13.440 --> 06:18.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In 1994, he was elected Alabama
attorney general.

06:18.545 --> 06:22.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the Senate, Sessions became a
member of
the Judiciary Committee, the
same panel that

06:23.016 --> 06:29.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rejected his nomination to be a
federal judge
in 1986 over accusations he had
made racially

06:29.956 --> 06:30.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
insensitive comments.

06:30.957 --> 06:31.925 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:31.958 --> 06:32.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS: I am not a
racist.

06:32.959 --> 06:34.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I am not insensitive to blacks.

06:34.728 --> 06:38.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Sessions denied
making some of
the comments and said others
were taken out

06:38.598 --> 06:40.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of context.

06:40.100 --> 06:44.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's been a leading voice
against illegal
immigration.

06:44.904 --> 06:50.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2007, he dealt President
George W. Bush
a painful blow, helping defeat a
bipartisan

06:50.510 --> 06:54.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bill that would have created a
guest-worker
program for undocumented
immigrants.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.448 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:55.482 --> 06:56.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS: You have got to
have this amnesty.

06:56.616 --> 07:00.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have got to give up, and we
will have
amnesty.

07:00.754 --> 07:05.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in exchange for that, you
guys, we will
have a legal system that will
work in the

07:05.158 --> 07:06.693 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
future.

07:06.726 --> 07:08.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But it won't work.

07:08.528 --> 07:12.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Last year, he opposed
the nomination
of Loretta Lynch, whom he would
replace as

07:12.932 --> 07:18.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attorney general, over her
support for President
Obama's executive orders on
immigration.

07:18.405 --> 07:21.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

07:21.541 --> 07:25.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For more on the
president-elect's
pick for attorney general, we

Carrie Johnson.

07:26.813 --> 07:29.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She is the justice correspondent
for NPR.

07:29.316 --> 07:30.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Carrie, welcome back to the
program.

07:30.517 --> 07:32.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON, NPR: Thank you,
Judy.

07:32.085 --> 07:34.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what is
Senator Jeff Sessions'
reputation in Washington?

07:34.788 --> 07:36.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CARRIE JOHNSON: He's a
69-year-old senator.

07:36.956 --> 07:39.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's been a member of the Senate
for more
than -- about 20 years now,
Judy.

07:39.693 --> 07:42.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he's pretty well-liked
across the aisle.

07:42.662 --> 07:47.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also has a significant law
enforcement
background, serving as U.S.
attorney in Alabama

07:47.767 --> 07:50.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for about 15 years earlier in
his career.

07:50.603 --> 07:55.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But he's very tough on
immigration, as your
setup piece mentioned, and
pretty tough as

07:55.275 --> 07:59.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well on law and order, the kind
of message
we have been hearing from Donald
Trump on

07:59.479 --> 08:00.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the campaign trail.

08:00.580 --> 08:02.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, fill out the
picture a
little.

08:02.282 --> 08:05.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Who are some of the groups who
are saying
nice things about him, who
support him?

08:05.518 --> 08:10.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: The Heritage
Foundation, very
conservative think tanks here in
Washington,

08:10.190 --> 08:15.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and people who oppose
immigration and opening
up the immigration system.

08:15.562 --> 08:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand -- and also
Donald Trump's
team, I should say that they
point out that

08:20.367 --> 08:24.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he has been a close ally of
president-elect
Trump for a long time, and they
call him a

08:24.871 --> 08:26.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
great legal mind.

08:26.606 --> 08:30.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And he is -- as
we should point
out, and I think we have, he was
is first

08:30.043 --> 08:33.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S. senator to come out for
Donald Trump.

08:33.380 --> 08:38.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But talk about now some of the
groups, civil
rights organizations,
pro-immigration reform

08:38.284 --> 08:40.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
groups that have come out
against him.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are they saying?

08:41.788 --> 08:46.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: So, the NAACP
Legal Defense
Fund, the ACLU all have come out
and said

08:46.659 --> 08:51.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that this is a very inflammatory
pick at a
time when racial tensions are
already high

08:51.931 --> 08:57.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the country because of
police-involved
shootings of unarmed
African-Americans, that

08:57.070 --> 09:02.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to pick somebody with this
record of making
racially insensitive statements
is going backward,

09:02.842 --> 09:04.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not moving forward.

09:04.611 --> 09:09.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, Judy, the Human Rights
Campaign, the
biggest LGBT advocacy in the
country, has

09:09.749 --> 09:13.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
given him a zero for his voting
rights record
on those issues in the Senate.

09:13.787 --> 09:18.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Carrie, how
unusual was it
for the Senate to reject his
nomination to

09:18.992 --> 09:23.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the federal -- there was a
federal court appointment
back in 1986, 30 years ago.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.031 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was rejected for that.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How unusual was that?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: Breathtaking.

09:28.501 --> 09:31.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you know more than anyone,
the Senate usually
takes care of its own.

09:31.538 --> 09:34.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it has a strong record of
backing picks
from the president.

09:34.808 --> 09:39.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was a Republican-controlled
Senate Judiciary
Committee that voted him down.

09:39.512 --> 09:44.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The irony is, Jeff Sessions now
sat on that
committee, including as its top
Republican.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about since
then?

09:45.952 --> 09:48.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's -- over the years, he's had
time.

09:48.054 --> 09:49.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He served in public life.

09:49.489 --> 09:54.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He went on to serve in the
United States for,
what, almost 20 years.

09:54.627 --> 09:56.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What has he done?

09:56.496 --> 10:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How has he voted that would help
us understand
what his position is today on
civil rights?

10:00.767 --> 10:04.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: Well, the Trump
team today
on a call with reporters pointed
out that

10:04.604 --> 10:09.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
he helped sponsor a
congressional medal for
civil rights hero Rosa Parks.

10:09.075 --> 10:13.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They point out he did vote in
favor of Attorney
General Eric Holder under
President Obama,

10:13.980 --> 10:17.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the first black man to serve as
the nation's
top law enforcement officer.

10:17.517 --> 10:22.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they say he has voted to
authorize the
Voting Rights Act in the past.

10:22.455 --> 10:26.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, civil rights groups
would tell you
what, when the Supreme Court, in
their view,

10:26.159 --> 10:29.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gutted the act three years ago,
Jeff Sessions
celebrated that.

10:29.295 --> 10:32.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is the worry
in the civil
rights community about him?

10:32.065 --> 10:36.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: The worry is
that the voice
of the Justice Department over
the last eight

10:36.503 --> 10:41.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years in trying to calm the
nerves of the
country and very aggressively
investigate

10:41.508 --> 10:45.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
police departments for excessive
force and
racial discrimination, the worry
is, under

10:45.879 --> 10:50.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeff Sessions, the Justice
Department Civil
Rights Division would stop doing
that work,

10:50.617 --> 10:56.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it would stop doing work to
protect voters,
and instead perhaps focus on
disability cases,

10:56.890 --> 11:01.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
religious freedom cases and the
like, and
move away from what their view
is as the center

11:01.828 --> 11:03.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the lane for civil rights in
this country.

11:03.963 --> 11:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Carrie, what
about with
regard to immigration?

11:06.299 --> 11:08.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's the concern there on the
part of the
immigration reform people?

11:09.002 --> 11:12.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: So, Donald Trump
and Jeff
Sessions have both been
anti-immigration for

11:12.605 --> 11:14.407 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a long time.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The difference is, the White
House and the
attorney general have a lot of
power in this

11:17.977 --> 11:19.646 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
regard.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if Donald Trump gets his way
and Jeff
Sessions is confirmed, Jeff
Sessions will

11:22.882 --> 11:27.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
control the immigration courts
in this country,
which hear deportation
proceedings, decide

11:27.954 --> 11:32.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether people can be granted
asylum and whether
they have to remain detained
while their cases

11:32.492 --> 11:34.260 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are pending.

11:34.294 --> 11:36.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You have said
several times
the president and the attorney
general have

11:36.296 --> 11:41.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the power without the
involvement of Congress
to undo, to make a lot of
decisions that potentially

11:41.601 --> 11:44.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could undo what we have seen
coming out of
this administration.

11:44.437 --> 11:49.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is there a speculation about
what could happen
quickly in this administration,
the new administration?

11:49.676 --> 11:51.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: Yes, absolutely.

11:51.544 --> 11:56.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among the things, Judy, that
civil rights
groups are talking about now is
sort of assertive

11:56.816 --> 12:03.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interpretation of laws that the
Justice Department
and the Education Department in
this administration

12:03.056 --> 12:07.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
use to extend protections to
transgender students
in schools.

12:07.260 --> 12:10.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That could be wiped away with
the change of
power in the White House and the
Justice Department.

12:10.863 --> 12:13.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you mentioned
it with regard
to civil rights.

12:13.533 --> 12:19.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we were talking to
you also about
with regard to police use of
force and the

12:19.806 --> 12:23.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
steps that have been taken by
this administration
to work with police departments
to do more

12:23.776 --> 12:25.578 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
community policing, for example.

12:25.612 --> 12:29.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: Well, my sense
is that Senator
Sessions and president-elect
Trump will want

12:29.716 --> 12:34.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to partners with local police,
not overseers
or investigators of them.

12:34.787 --> 12:38.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that means some of these
investigations
and potentially some criminal
charges go away

12:38.691 --> 12:40.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the federal system.

12:40.360 --> 12:44.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Carrie Johnson,
justice correspondent
for NPR, thank you so much.

12:44.130 --> 12:45.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: Thank you.

12:45.932 --> 12:49.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we turn now
to the other
major appointments Donald Trump
made today.

12:49.702 --> 12:51.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Again, John Yang brings us some
background.

12:52.005 --> 12:56.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It's a plum job for
an ardent loyalist.

12:56.142 --> 13:00.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michael Flynn was one of the
highest ranking
former military officers to
endorse candidate

13:00.580 --> 13:02.215 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump.

13:02.248 --> 13:05.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The retired army lieutenant
general was outspoken
in condemning Hillary Clinton.

13:05.918 --> 13:06.886 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

13:06.919 --> 13:09.022 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

13:09.055 --> 13:11.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL FLYNN (RET.), National
Security Adviser-Designee:
We do not need a reckless
president who believes

13:11.157 --> 13:13.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
she is above the law.

13:13.192 --> 13:15.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her
up!

13:15.528 --> 13:16.496 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

13:16.529 --> 13:17.497 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

13:17.530 --> 13:18.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL FLYNN: Lock her up,
that's right.

13:18.498 --> 13:19.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Yes, that's right.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.267 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Lock her up.

13:21.301 --> 13:26.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He held a variety of
senior posts
during the Afghan war and became
the top U.S.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
military intelligence officer
there.

13:28.708 --> 13:34.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2012, he became the head of
the Defense
Intelligence Agency, only to be
forced out

13:34.047 --> 13:40.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two years later, amid reports
he'd been fired
over his combative style,
reports he disputed.

13:40.920 --> 13:46.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After that, Flynn became hotly
critical of
the Obama administration's
pursuit of Islamic

13:46.059 --> 13:47.794 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
radicals.

13:47.827 --> 13:52.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last February, he went even
further, tweeting
that: "Fear of Muslims is
rational."

13:52.398 --> 13:57.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, Republican
Congressman Mike Pompeo
of Kansas is president-elect
Trump's choice

13:57.970 --> 13:59.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be CIA director.

13:59.772 --> 14:05.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A graduate of West Point and
Harvard Law School,
he was elected to the House in
2010.

14:05.378 --> 14:10.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He gained prominence as a sharp
Clinton critic
on the House Select Committee on
Benghazi.

14:10.416 --> 14:13.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he's an opponent of the Iran
nuclear deal.

14:13.319 --> 14:19.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition, Pompeo has said
that Muslim leaders
who don't denounce terror
attacks are potentially

14:19.492 --> 14:20.460 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
complicit.

14:20.493 --> 14:23.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

14:23.096 --> 14:28.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We look now at
the choices
with Democratic Congressman Adam
Schiff of

14:28.401 --> 14:33.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
California, the ranking member
of the House
Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence,

14:33.406 --> 14:39.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Michael Ledeen, a scholar at
the Foundation
for Defense of Democracies, a
nonprofit organization

14:39.378 --> 14:41.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
here in Washington.

14:41.180 --> 14:46.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's also co-author with retired
General Michael
Flynn of the book "The Field of
Fight: How

14:46.486 --> 14:51.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We Can Win the Global War
Against Radical
Islam and Its Allies."

14:51.324 --> 14:53.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you back
to the program.

14:53.259 --> 14:54.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you for being here.

14:54.660 --> 14:56.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michael Ledeen, you wrote that
book together
with General Flynn.

14:56.996 --> 14:59.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You know him very well.

14:59.532 --> 15:01.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you think of this pick?

15:01.267 --> 15:04.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL LEDEEN, Foundation for
Defense of
Democracies: I think it's a
great pick.

15:04.403 --> 15:08.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has various qualities that
you really want
in that job.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Number one, he's very
straightforward.

15:10.476 --> 15:12.578 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's not tricky.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's not guileful.

15:14.347 --> 15:17.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's not afraid to give bad news
to his superiors.

15:17.717 --> 15:18.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's proven that.

15:18.985 --> 15:22.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, secondly, really, it's
unusual for a
military man.

15:22.822 --> 15:25.291 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He doesn't care about rank.

15:25.324 --> 15:32.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His career is, if he finds some
2nd lieutenant
who's good at something, he will
stick with

15:32.632 --> 15:36.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that guy, rather than look for
some full colonel
or something.

15:36.202 --> 15:41.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman
Schiff, what's
your thought on Michael Flynn
for the national

15:41.274 --> 15:42.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
security adviser?

15:42.241 --> 15:44.110 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

15:44.143 --> 15:45.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF (D), California:
Profoundly concerned,
both for reasons of temperament,
as well as

15:45.878 --> 15:48.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his view on a number of key
policy issues.

15:48.981 --> 15:53.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chief among them, he's made some
very incendiary
remarks about the entire
religion of Islam,

15:53.719 --> 15:59.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at times failing to distinguish
between the
practitioners of that faith and
al-Qaida and

15:59.759 --> 16:01.561 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ISIS.

16:01.594 --> 16:05.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a narrative that ISIS
likes to play
into, that there is a clash of
civilization,

16:05.798 --> 16:07.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that it's the West against all
of Islam.

16:07.900 --> 16:11.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, unfortunately, a lot of
things that General
Flynn has said over the years
play into that

16:11.971 --> 16:13.639 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
narrative.

16:13.673 --> 16:16.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm also concerned, though, that
you have
someone with a temperament that,
when he was

16:16.876 --> 16:20.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
running the Defense Intelligence
Agency, was
volatile, was often erratic.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He had severe management
problems.

16:23.349 --> 16:25.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need a steady hand in the
national security
adviser.

16:25.585 --> 16:28.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael Ledeen,
let's take
those one at a time.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.957 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Temperament.

16:30.990 --> 16:34.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does General Flynn have the
temperament necessary
to be in this job, national
security adviser,

16:34.794 --> 16:37.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where you have to weigh so many
different
competing interests?

16:37.730 --> 16:39.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL LEDEEN: Well, I think
so.

16:39.465 --> 16:43.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, he totally transformed
the way we
do intelligence on the
battlefield, first

16:44.003 --> 16:46.005 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in Iraq, then in Afghanistan.

16:46.038 --> 16:48.341 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Those were big organizations.

16:48.374 --> 16:53.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The methods that he inherited
had been in
place for a long time, and he
transformed

16:53.713 --> 16:55.548 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

16:55.581 --> 17:03.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As for Islam, if you will read
the book "The
Field of Fight," you will find
that he doesn't

17:03.956 --> 17:11.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
condemn Islam in its entirety,
that he condemns
radical Muslims, that he has a
lot of supportive

17:11.197 --> 17:19.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
words both for groups,
individuals and countries
that are moderately Islamic,
like Indonesia,

17:19.205 --> 17:20.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like Singapore and so forth.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he goes on at great length
about that.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's
unpack those one
at a time.

17:24.810 --> 17:31.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congressman Schiff, let's pick
up on the comment
you made that he had made
remarks about Islam,

17:31.150 --> 17:37.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
essentially saying the entire
religion is
what we need to worry about.

17:37.323 --> 17:40.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we hear Michael Ledeen
saying that's just
not the case.

17:41.027 --> 17:42.762 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

17:42.795 --> 17:44.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: Well, Michael must
have written
those chapters in the book that
express a

17:44.697 --> 17:48.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
different view, because, if you
look at what
comes directly from General
Flynn in his tweets

17:48.100 --> 17:54.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and other comments, that we
should rationally
fear all Muslims, that -- those
are very damaging

17:54.807 --> 17:56.475 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
statements.

17:56.509 --> 17:59.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, coupled with a
president-elect
who has talked about banning all
Muslims,

17:59.879 --> 18:06.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is deeply destructive to
the country,
to our work with our Muslim
allies, and plays

18:06.519 --> 18:10.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
into this narrative that
al-Qaida wants to
tell that it's us or them, that
Muslims don't

18:10.623 --> 18:12.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have a home in the West.

18:12.325 --> 18:18.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, beyond that, if you look at
his coziness
with the Kremlin, he shares that
with the

18:18.230 --> 18:19.198 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president-elect.

18:19.231 --> 18:21.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Putin is not our friend.

18:21.233 --> 18:25.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I want someone, a national
security adviser
who's willing to tell the
president, notwithstanding

18:25.738 --> 18:30.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your predisposition to want to
get along with
this guy, he is invading his
neighbors, he

18:30.042 --> 18:34.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is bombing civilians in Syria,
and he is not
your friend.

18:34.213 --> 18:38.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, coziness
with the Kremlin,
coziness with Vladimir Putin,
Michael Ledeen,

18:38.150 --> 18:39.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what is the truth of that?

18:39.385 --> 18:40.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is the story?

18:40.386 --> 18:41.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, how close is he to the
Russians?

18:41.954 --> 18:45.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know he gave a speech, was
paid by a Russian
entity for that.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL LEDEEN: Well, he was
brought to a
conference.

18:48.661 --> 18:53.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's normal, if you go to a
conference, that
your expenses get covered.

18:53.232 --> 18:57.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They hired him through a
speakers bureau,
so he got a normal speaking fee.

18:57.870 --> 19:00.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, there's nothing untoward
about that.

19:00.072 --> 19:04.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And to his face, he called Putin
an enemy.

19:04.110 --> 19:10.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, all this talk about Flynn
being soft on
the Kremlin and so forth is
nonsense.

19:10.416 --> 19:15.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the people who say it -- I'm
sorry to
say it hurts me personally --
haven't read

19:15.321 --> 19:21.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the book, because the book calls
Putin an
enemy of the United States, in
those words.

19:22.028 --> 19:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is, to my way of
thinking, just a
misunderstanding of Flynn, as
the Muslim thing

19:28.134 --> 19:29.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is a misunderstanding.

19:29.135 --> 19:30.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Short answer.

19:30.136 --> 19:31.837 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ADAM SCHIFF: Well,
notwithstanding the book,
that's not the way General Flynn
has been

19:33.406 --> 19:35.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
talking during the last year.

19:35.207 --> 19:39.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, when General Flynn
was asked,
as indeed the president-elect
was asked, about

19:39.979 --> 19:44.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russians hacking into Democratic
institutions,
something the director of
national intelligence

19:44.617 --> 19:49.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has confirmed was ordered at the
highest levels
of the Kremlin, both the
president-elect,

19:49.388 --> 19:53.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the support of General
Flynn, basically
disavowed that intelligence and
said, we don't

19:53.459 --> 19:56.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really know, it could be Russia,
could be
China, could be a 400-pound man.

19:56.962 --> 20:02.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If General Flynn is willing to
disregard good
intelligence when it's counter
to the interests,

20:02.068 --> 20:04.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
political interests of the
president-elect,
that is a real problem.

20:04.503 --> 20:07.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, we
need to move
on in a little bit of time left
to talk Congressman

20:07.973 --> 20:12.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mike Pompeo, chosen to be in
charge of the
CIA.

20:12.611 --> 20:14.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Michael Ledeen, do you know him
well?

20:14.346 --> 20:15.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you think of him?

20:15.347 --> 20:16.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL LEDEEN: Kansas.

20:16.348 --> 20:19.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's what we used to call a real
American.

20:19.585 --> 20:20.619 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's heartland.

20:20.653 --> 20:21.787 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's very smart.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's extremely hardworking.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's been terrific on Iran.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He and Senator...

20:27.560 --> 20:30.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Terrific on Iran,
meaning -- we
know that he's been very
critical of the Iran

20:30.229 --> 20:31.997 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nuclear deal.

20:32.031 --> 20:35.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL LEDEEN: Well, but he's
one of the
members of Congress that
uncovered the Iranian

20:35.167 --> 20:41.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cheating and some of the secret
deals that
were made that Congress hadn't
been told about.

20:41.474 --> 20:44.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They uncovered that in Vienna at
IAEA.

20:44.944 --> 20:47.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is your
comment on him?

20:47.246 --> 20:48.347 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

20:48.380 --> 20:49.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: I know Mike very
well and I like
him.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think he's a very bright guy,
a very hardworking
guy.

20:52.184 --> 20:55.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think he will do a good
job at the CIA.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He can be very partisan.

20:56.489 --> 21:00.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, on Benghazi, we had very
strong differences.

21:00.192 --> 21:05.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was even beyond the point
where the majority
of -- the majority was, and
issued a separate

21:05.931 --> 21:09.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opinion, not thinking the
majority opinion
was harsh enough on the
secretary.

21:09.468 --> 21:11.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, he can be very partisan.

21:11.203 --> 21:14.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, at the same time, I am
confident that
he will set that aside.

21:14.406 --> 21:15.808 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He will have to.

21:15.841 --> 21:21.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The CIA requires somebody to be
just vehemently
apolitical, nonpartisan.

21:21.213 --> 21:23.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But I think he has the
capability of doing
that.

21:23.048 --> 21:25.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we will be
learning much
more about these two gentlemen
in the days

21:25.985 --> 21:27.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and weeks to come.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, we want to thank both
of you, Congressman
Adam Schiff, Michael Ledeen.

21:30.422 --> 21:31.390 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

21:31.423 --> 21:32.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL LEDEEN: Thank you.

21:32.424 --> 21:33.392 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

21:33.425 --> 21:34.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ADAM SCHIFF: Thank you.

21:34.426 --> 21:36.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

21:36.195 --> 21:37.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, online, we take a closer
look at the
relationship between Trump chief
strategist

21:37.663 --> 21:47.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Stephen Bannon and the
controversial media
outlet Breitbart News.

21:47.706 --> 21:52.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Stephen Bannon and the
controversial media
outlet Breitbart News.

21:53.012 --> 21:54.747 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Stay with us.

21:54.780 --> 21:58.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
David Brooks
and Ruth Marcus take on the
week's news; and

21:59.018 --> 22:04.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a personal "NewsHour" tribute to
Gwen Ifill.

22:04.790 --> 22:10.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: our coverage of the
agenda of president-elect
Trump and the potential impact
of some big

22:10.829 --> 22:12.598 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
changes.

22:12.631 --> 22:16.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the major themes of his
campaign was
cracking down on immigration,
not just of

22:16.368 --> 22:22.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those who are undocumented, but
also hundreds
of thousands of people who've
obtained temporary

22:22.274 --> 22:25.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
legal status during the Obama
years.

22:25.344 --> 22:30.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now those young adults are
uncertain and anxious
about what's to come.

22:30.449 --> 22:33.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

22:34.019 --> 22:37.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was 11 years old when I
immigrated to the
United States.

22:37.623 --> 22:39.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I didn't know what being
undocumented was.

22:39.959 --> 22:44.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I didn't even know that a piece
of paper can
actually determine my whole
future.

22:44.063 --> 22:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANA CHACON, College Student: I
thought that
working really hard throughout
high school

22:47.633 --> 22:51.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
would give me the same
opportunities that
most have, ones that graduated.

22:51.737 --> 22:56.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, you can go apply to any
college you
want, go study upstate.

22:56.375 --> 23:01.313 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
JEFFREY BROWN:
Twenty-one-year-old Diana Chacon
has come a long way from her
birth in Lima,

23:01.347 --> 23:02.848 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Peru.

23:02.881 --> 23:06.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's now a student at the John
Jay College
of Criminal Justice in New York.

23:06.452 --> 23:09.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But her path forward could get
much tougher.

23:09.788 --> 23:16.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chacon is a recipient of DACA,
Deferred Action
for Childhood Arrivals, an Obama
administration

23:16.428 --> 23:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policy that allows undocumented
immigrants
who entered the country as
children to work

23:21.734 --> 23:24.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and study here legally on a
temporary basis.

23:24.303 --> 23:27.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
If there is a young person here
who has grown

23:27.039 --> 23:35.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up here and wants to contribute
to this society,
wants to maybe start a business
that will

23:35.114 --> 23:41.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
create jobs for other folks who
are looking
for work, that's the right thing
to do.

23:41.720 --> 23:44.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DIANA CHACON: DACA changed my
life.

23:44.223 --> 23:49.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It allowed me to be involved in
school more,
spend more time doing my class
work assignments,

23:49.995 --> 23:56.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spend more time applying for
programs, and
just get involved in my
community in general.

23:56.702 --> 23:59.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I stopped making excuses for who
I was and
what position I was in.

23:59.872 --> 24:01.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was so encouraged to keep
going.

24:01.907 --> 24:03.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was encouraged to pursue law
school.

24:03.909 --> 24:09.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I knew that all the things I
have been doing
to this point were projecting me
into a better

24:09.782 --> 24:12.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
future, into a better life.

24:12.584 --> 24:18.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all of that's going to
change because,
you know, now Donald Trump is
president.

24:18.257 --> 24:20.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BARACK OBAMA: This is a
temporary stopgap
measure.

24:20.693 --> 24:25.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Unable to get
immigration legislation
passed, President Obama used his
executive

24:25.964 --> 24:27.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
power to create DACA.

24:27.733 --> 24:34.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, just as easily, it could be
undone, with
enormous potential consequences
for Chacon

24:34.707 --> 24:37.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the 800,000 other recipients
known as
dreamers.

24:37.976 --> 24:42.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: Anyone
who has entered the United
States illegally

24:42.314 --> 24:46.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is subject to deportation.

24:46.318 --> 24:49.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is what it means to have
laws and to
have a country.

24:49.955 --> 24:55.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In addition to
building a wall,
Donald Trump as a candidate made
the repeal

24:55.294 --> 24:57.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of DACA a top priority.

24:57.496 --> 25:05.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And since the election, dreamers
and other
immigrants have protested across
the country.

25:05.170 --> 25:10.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Teresa Galindo, who brought her
two sons to
the U.S. from Mexico after her
husband's death,

25:10.442 --> 25:13.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
marched at a Sunday Midtown
Manhattan rally.

25:13.545 --> 25:18.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her youngest, Carlos, now 31,
was just 2 years
old when he entered the country.

25:18.584 --> 25:23.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TERESA GALINDO, Undocumented
Mother (through
translator): It wasn't their
fault and it's

25:23.756 --> 25:25.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
still not their fault.

25:25.057 --> 25:27.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're here because I brought
them when they
were very young.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I did it as a mother to give my
kids the best.

25:29.862 --> 25:32.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wanted to, and I still want to
give them
the best.

25:32.631 --> 25:35.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Back in my country, they
couldn't even get
an education.

25:35.134 --> 25:41.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Carlos got his
education, and
four years ago became a DACA
recipient.

25:41.039 --> 25:46.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He now works at an immigrants
rights organization
in Staten Island helping others
find legal

25:46.044 --> 25:47.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and other resources.

25:47.913 --> 25:51.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His own uncertain future, he
says, now informs
his work and activism.

25:51.717 --> 25:54.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, if DACA is repealed, what
would happen?

25:54.219 --> 25:56.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CARLOS VARGAS, Immigrant
Activist: I don't
know.

25:56.588 --> 25:57.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's the scary part.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.658 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a little bit frightening.

25:59.691 --> 26:00.826 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But we're going to fight.

26:00.859 --> 26:01.960 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

26:01.994 --> 26:03.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they do take it away, we
demand something
better.

26:03.462 --> 26:05.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But what does
that mean?

26:05.097 --> 26:06.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, what would you do?

26:06.498 --> 26:08.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CARLOS VARGAS: Go out.

26:08.300 --> 26:12.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The dreamer movement has been
alive since
2001.

26:12.905 --> 26:18.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DACA wasn't given to us because
the president
woke up one day and said, I
really feel for

26:18.677 --> 26:19.645 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you youth.

26:19.678 --> 26:21.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm going to give you DACA.

26:21.480 --> 26:22.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We fought for it.

26:22.548 --> 26:23.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There was a lot of civil
disobedience.

26:23.715 --> 26:26.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There was a lot of organizing.

26:26.118 --> 26:29.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that just means
we're going to
do that to a bigger scale now.

26:29.888 --> 26:35.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Staten Island is
home to a
fast-growing immigrant
community, many, like

26:36.028 --> 26:38.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Vargas, from Mexico.

26:38.330 --> 26:42.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's also the only one of New
York's five
boroughs to vote for Donald
Trump.

26:42.534 --> 26:48.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's not hard to find Trump
supporters
like Sebastian Demetrio, a
78-year-old veteran,

26:48.807 --> 26:52.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bagel shop worker and himself an
immigrant
from Eastern Europe.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEBASTIAN DEMETRIO, Trump
Supporter: I came
here legal.

26:54.913 --> 26:55.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My father was working here.

26:56.014 --> 27:01.053 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I came as a legal immigrant.

27:01.086 --> 27:03.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A lot of people are sneaking up
in this country.

27:03.222 --> 27:04.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're taking our jobs.

27:05.023 --> 27:08.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I think we need a change.

27:08.193 --> 27:12.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Take care of your own people
first before
you take care of the other
people that don't

27:13.031 --> 27:14.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
belong in this country.

27:14.833 --> 27:18.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Staten Island
City Councilman
Joe Borelli served as a
co-chairman for the

27:18.237 --> 27:20.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Trump campaign here in New York.

27:20.172 --> 27:21.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BORELLI, Co-Chair, Donald
Trump New
York Campaign: It's the
sentiment that we

27:21.640 --> 27:23.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ought to be a nation of laws.

27:23.208 --> 27:26.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, Staten Island is a
place where many
immigrants come to.

27:26.879 --> 27:31.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, New York is broadly
the home of
immigration to this country.

27:31.216 --> 27:35.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The majority of people who come
to New York
as immigrants come here through
a legal process,

27:35.754 --> 27:38.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
just like many people's
ancestors did through
Ellis Island.

27:38.190 --> 27:41.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fifty percent of our small
businesses here
in New York City are owned by
immigrants or

27:41.960 --> 27:44.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people of color or some
combination thereof.

27:44.429 --> 27:46.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They are making New York great.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they are making America
great.

27:47.866 --> 27:49.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As long as you follow the rules,
you should
be welcome here.

27:49.968 --> 27:53.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: His message to
constituents
fearing deportation now?

27:53.438 --> 27:55.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSEPH BORELLI: I would tell
these people
to relax slightly.

27:55.474 --> 27:57.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I understand it's
concerning.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they should wait to see what
the administration
puts forth.

27:59.344 --> 28:01.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We're getting them
out of our
country.

28:01.046 --> 28:02.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're here illegally.

28:02.981 --> 28:06.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In his first
televised interview
as president-elect, Mr. Trump
pledged to focus

28:06.652 --> 28:10.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first on deporting immigrants
with criminal
records.

28:10.188 --> 28:14.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's yet to clarify his position
on DACA.

28:14.927 --> 28:19.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Diana Chacon has no criminal
record, but she's
hardly comforted.

28:19.331 --> 28:27.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANA CHACON: When you're
deporting one undocumented
person, you're basically
deporting everybody

28:27.105 --> 28:30.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
else with that person, not
physically, but
emotionally.

28:30.876 --> 28:35.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Like, it's that baggage that's
left behind.

28:35.113 --> 28:37.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not just me, just not you.

28:37.649 --> 28:40.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's everybody who is going to
be affected
indirectly.

28:40.385 --> 28:47.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And separating families,
separating friendships,
separating communities, in my
eyes, it's a

28:47.726 --> 28:48.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
form of violence.

28:48.994 --> 28:52.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For now, she
remains focused
on her future.

28:52.197 --> 28:57.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANA CHACON: I don't want to
think that because
my life is in somebody else's
hands at the

28:57.202 --> 29:00.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
moment means that I don't have
control over
it anymore.

29:00.639 --> 29:06.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am so much more than the
narratives that
are out there about me, about my
community.

29:06.845 --> 29:09.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know that's something you
can't control.

29:09.348 --> 29:13.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what I can control is how
I'm going to
go about it and how I'm going to
take the

29:13.819 --> 29:15.287 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
few next steps.

29:15.320 --> 29:17.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not going to let one piece
of paper define
me.

29:17.489 --> 29:19.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm not going to let a president
define me.

29:19.891 --> 29:21.927 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I can't.

29:21.960 --> 29:26.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: From New York,
I'm Jeffrey
Brown for the "PBS NewsHour."

29:26.898 --> 29:40.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now to the
analysis of
Brooks and Marcus.

29:40.779 --> 29:45.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's New York Times columnist
David Brooks
and Washington Post columnist
Ruth Marcus.

29:45.651 --> 29:46.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mark Shields is away.

29:46.752 --> 29:49.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And happy Friday to both of you.

29:49.388 --> 29:55.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, president-elect Trump,
David, making these
three big announcements today in
the national

29:55.727 --> 29:58.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
security arena, after we heard
who a couple
of people are going to be around
him in the

29:58.864 --> 30:00.198 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
White House.

30:00.232 --> 30:02.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What do we make of these
choices, starting
with the ones today?

30:02.434 --> 30:04.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, if you
thought Donald
Trump was going to be swallowed
up by the

30:04.936 --> 30:08.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conventional Republican Party or
by Washington,
you were wrong.

30:08.774 --> 30:11.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's governing exactly, it
seems, as he campaigned.

30:11.910 --> 30:15.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the people he selected are
very much in
the spirit of the campaign,
sometimes explicitly

30:15.414 --> 30:17.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
referencing the policies he took
on the campaign.

30:17.649 --> 30:20.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I would say, A, they are
going to be very
different.

30:20.952 --> 30:24.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to have a very
different administration
from a normal Republican
administration, let

30:24.589 --> 30:26.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
alone a Democratic
administration.

30:26.058 --> 30:30.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Second, I have to say, they have
good resumes.

30:30.128 --> 30:35.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pompeo, Flynn, they are -- it's
not like they're
just out of the wilderness.

30:35.967 --> 30:40.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are people who have been
around power
and who probably are not going
to be automatically

30:40.872 --> 30:42.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
incompetent at their jobs.

30:42.774 --> 30:46.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The third thing to that we say
is, they have
Donald Trump's charm, which is
to say they

30:46.812 --> 30:51.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are extremely sharp-elbowed
individuals, to
a person.

30:51.083 --> 30:55.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's like he's taken all the
hard bosses
or bad bosses in the world and
so far he is

30:55.287 --> 30:56.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bringing them all together.

30:57.022 --> 31:00.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, if they work as a team,
maybe they
will be a very tough team, but
they could

31:00.592 --> 31:02.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
work on each other.

31:02.661 --> 31:07.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it could be hard to hire
people under
them, because these are people
famous for

31:07.065 --> 31:09.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
being really hard on those
around them.

31:09.801 --> 31:12.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ruth, what do you
make of these
national security picks?

31:12.604 --> 31:21.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: Disturbing on
General Flynn,
and less disturbing on
Congressman Pompeo.

31:21.346 --> 31:25.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's really important
for us to understand
Donald Trump is the
president-elect, and he

31:25.350 --> 31:30.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is really entitled to -- he has
got the prerogative
to pick people who will
implement his policies

31:30.922 --> 31:33.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and who have his confidence.

31:33.191 --> 31:37.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think -- I don't look at
it just as
the national security team.

31:37.062 --> 31:42.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I look at it as a whole, and I'm
very worried
that he is picking people -- he
talked on

31:42.267 --> 31:45.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
election night about the need to
bind the
wounds of division.

31:45.570 --> 31:49.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think he's picking a series of
people who
are potentially pouring salt
into the wounds

31:49.975 --> 31:55.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of division and who are
reinforcing some of
his worst tendencies, rather
than buttressing

31:55.447 --> 32:01.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him and surrounding himself with
people who
bring to the table both
personality and capabilities

32:01.419 --> 32:04.122 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that he may be lacking in.

32:04.156 --> 32:10.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I would -- the three that
most concern
me are General Flynn, Senator
Sessions, and

32:10.862 --> 32:13.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Steve Bannon at his right hand
in the White
House.

32:13.165 --> 32:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Who comes from
Breitbart News.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RUTH MARCUS: Indeed.

32:16.701 --> 32:19.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which raises -- I
saw some
commentary, David, saying, well,
maybe there

32:19.838 --> 32:24.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is good cop/bad cop thing going
on here in
the White House, where Donald
Trump picks

32:24.442 --> 32:28.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reince Priebus, the chairman of
the Republican
Party, as his chief of staff,
but then he

32:28.914 --> 32:31.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
picks Bannon, Steve Bannon, to
be his counselor.

32:31.183 --> 32:34.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I'm not yet
putting Priebus
in my good cop category...

32:34.386 --> 32:35.353 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

32:35.387 --> 32:36.354 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

32:36.388 --> 32:37.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: ... bad and other
cops.

32:37.656 --> 32:39.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Bannon is the interesting case.

32:39.424 --> 32:43.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is, of course -- I do not
approve of his
news organization or his
judgments, but he

32:44.029 --> 32:49.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is something out of a different
-- he is a
pure populist, pure
anti-establishment.

32:49.301 --> 32:52.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, for example, there was
an article
today, a rare interview that he
gave, where

32:52.838 --> 32:57.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he really talked about having a
trillion-dollar
infrastructure program.

32:57.309 --> 33:00.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That would be a big shift in our
national
debate.

33:00.412 --> 33:02.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think it might be a good
idea.

33:02.447 --> 33:04.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it would get a lot of
Democrats on board.

33:04.349 --> 33:08.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I do think the silver lining
for those
of you who didn't approve of
Donald Trump

33:08.987 --> 33:14.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that there are a lot of
policies in his
canon that do mess with our
categories.

33:14.092 --> 33:17.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that kind of big spending
program would
be one of them.

33:17.429 --> 33:19.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you
think?

33:19.231 --> 33:23.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: I'm kind of having
a hard time
seeing the Steve Bannon silver
lining here,

33:23.268 --> 33:30.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even with a big infrastructure
program, because
his Web site and his own history
has been

33:30.742 --> 33:38.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so divisive, so hurtful to
people of -- minorities,
people of other faiths.

33:38.984 --> 33:45.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think having somebody like
that in the White
House -- I understand, to the
victor go the

33:45.123 --> 33:49.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spoils, but bringing someone
like that inside
the White House who you're going
to be listening

33:49.160 --> 33:50.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to is a bad thing.

33:50.962 --> 33:55.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we're layering on to
that I think
two people who are the wrong
people in the

33:55.934 --> 33:57.702 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wrong jobs.

33:57.736 --> 34:00.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You want somebody who is going
to be your
national security adviser who is
going to

34:00.805 --> 34:04.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be temperate, who is going to be
an honest
broker, who is going to be able
to take in

34:04.209 --> 34:08.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
information and give you sort
of, this is
what everybody is saying.

34:08.947 --> 34:13.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is not, from the people
that I have spoken
to today, what General Flynn is
all about.

34:13.418 --> 34:15.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: No.

34:15.186 --> 34:19.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: And, similarly,
with Senator
Sessions, I was around for his
confirmation

34:19.824 --> 34:20.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hearings as judge.

34:20.825 --> 34:21.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: No.

34:21.826 --> 34:23.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: Both in those -- I
know.

34:23.428 --> 34:24.896 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I look so young.

34:24.930 --> 34:25.897 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

34:25.931 --> 34:27.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: But it's true.

34:27.766 --> 34:32.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Both in those and in his
performance as senator,
taking -- going to the Justice
Department,

34:32.837 --> 34:34.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sort of same idea.

34:34.272 --> 34:38.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If he were up for secretary of
defense, I
might not have this issue.

34:38.243 --> 34:43.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we're at a country that is
facing enormous
racial tensions, really
difficult questions

34:43.248 --> 34:48.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about criminal justice reform
and tensions
between minority communities and
police, and

34:48.119 --> 34:50.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
here he is with a long history.

34:50.255 --> 34:51.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Wrong person, wrong job.

34:51.623 --> 34:52.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How much of a
worry is that,
David?

34:52.958 --> 34:55.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I do think it is a
significant
worry.

34:55.660 --> 35:00.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, this past few weeks,
past few months,
past few years, maybe past few
centuries,

35:00.398 --> 35:03.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have been rife with racial
tension.

35:03.401 --> 35:07.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this seems set to exploit
that and to
exacerbate that.

35:07.405 --> 35:12.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that's going to be one
of the most
likely and one of the ugliest
features of

35:12.043 --> 35:13.645 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the campaign.

35:13.678 --> 35:16.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm trying -- as I said on the
program last
week, I'm trying to give a
pause.

35:16.214 --> 35:17.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The guy was elected.

35:17.716 --> 35:22.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, as I say, he's been
extremely consistent
with his electoral campaign.

35:22.754 --> 35:26.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's being authentic to what he
ran on and
what got elected.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so I agree with Ruth.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think these people deserve to
be confirmed.

35:29.094 --> 35:32.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's nobody who, I don't
think, doesn't
deserve to be confirmed.

35:32.364 --> 35:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One other point, though, and
this is about
the Bannon point.

35:34.866 --> 35:37.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's always had a teeny-tiny
circle of trust.

35:37.702 --> 35:41.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can't imagine that being in
the Trump Cabinet
will be a very important job.

35:41.640 --> 35:45.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think this will be a White
House-run
administration with a teeny-tiny
group of

35:45.543 --> 35:47.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
people surrounding him,
including his family
maybe.

35:47.946 --> 35:51.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and that's
-- I want
to ask about that, because one
thing everybody

35:51.783 --> 35:57.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
noticed is that his family is on
the transition
team, his children, his
son-in-law, Ruth.

35:57.922 --> 36:02.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were -- his daughter Ivanka
and her husband,
Jared Kushner, were in that
meeting yesterday

36:02.494 --> 36:05.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with the Japanese prime
minister.

36:05.730 --> 36:07.732 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is this something -- I mean,
what?

36:07.766 --> 36:09.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are we to make of this?

36:09.200 --> 36:11.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: Well, again, quite
disturbing.

36:11.669 --> 36:16.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do not begrudge anybody
relying on their
family members for advice.

36:16.541 --> 36:17.776 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I do.

36:17.809 --> 36:20.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Politicians regularly rely on
family members
for advice.

36:21.012 --> 36:24.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Donald Trump is in a unique
position here.

36:24.282 --> 36:28.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, he has told us
that he is going
to solve -- and I don't think
it's a good

36:28.486 --> 36:33.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
solution -- his problems of
conflict of interests
in his business by turning over
the management

36:33.358 --> 36:34.459 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to his children.

36:34.492 --> 36:37.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OK, maybe that's adequate from
his point of
view.

36:37.595 --> 36:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now he's simultaneously
turning over the
management to his children and
bringing in

36:41.800 --> 36:47.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his children, first three of
them, to the
transition, and then apparently
tapping his

36:47.572 --> 36:51.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
son-in-law, married to one of
the people who's
going to be managing this
business and dealing

36:51.509 --> 36:55.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the conflict that way, to
bring them
into the White House.

36:55.080 --> 36:56.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's number one.

36:56.881 --> 37:01.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Number two, in this small
circle, you want
a president without governing
experience to

37:01.286 --> 37:04.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be surrounded by people with
experience in
governing.

37:04.255 --> 37:06.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, it's insular Trump
surrounded by
his family.

37:07.025 --> 37:08.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does that bother
you?

37:08.726 --> 37:12.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, what does
bother me is
the intermingling of the
business and the

37:12.230 --> 37:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
public service aspect of this.

37:14.799 --> 37:16.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so I do agree with that.

37:16.668 --> 37:20.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do think, if the family
members choose
one side or the other, I would
have no problem

37:20.839 --> 37:23.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Ivanka serving on the White
House staff,
frankly.

37:23.241 --> 37:27.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's a rule against it
now, in theory,
serving in the Cabinet, at
least, maybe not

37:27.078 --> 37:29.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the White House, that was
passed after
Bobby Kennedy.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I personally think that's a dumb
rule.

37:31.416 --> 37:35.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If a president wants to have a
family member
as -- an executive of a small
business can

37:35.386 --> 37:36.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have a family member.

37:36.521 --> 37:37.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't have a problem with
that.

37:37.956 --> 37:41.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I actually think Ivanka would be
a good influence
on the administration.

37:41.726 --> 37:44.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I do think as long as the --
he's so business-minded.

37:44.796 --> 37:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As long as we're constantly
asking, is he
trying to make a buck off this,
is he trying

37:49.334 --> 37:54.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to promote his hotel with this,
then that's
just a corruption of what we
think of as public

37:54.239 --> 37:55.173 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
service.

37:55.206 --> 37:57.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

37:57.175 --> 37:59.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, I wanted to ask you both
about the Democrats
and where they stand right now,
back on their

37:59.644 --> 38:01.379 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
heels.

38:01.412 --> 38:03.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I really want to leave time
here at the
end for a few minutes to ask you
both about

38:04.015 --> 38:05.150 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our friend.

38:05.183 --> 38:07.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You both knew her well, Gwen.

38:07.352 --> 38:08.853 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
David, you were close friends.

38:08.887 --> 38:11.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ruth, you have worked with her
for so long.

38:11.422 --> 38:15.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ruth, you go back to, what,
early days at
The Washington Post.

38:15.293 --> 38:18.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: So, I can tell you
the exact
day, because it was my first day
at The Washington

38:18.396 --> 38:21.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Post, September 4, 1984.

38:21.199 --> 38:25.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I drove out to Prince George's
County, Upper
Marlboro, Maryland, walked into
the bureau,

38:25.803 --> 38:31.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and there was Gwen Ifill with
this luminous
smile that David wrote so
beautifully about.

38:31.643 --> 38:34.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we have been friends ever
since.

38:34.345 --> 38:38.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think -- thinking, she went to
The New York
Times, so we covered the White
House together.

38:38.950 --> 38:45.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm particularly remembering
one Christmas
Eve in Little Rock in 1992 after
the Clinton

38:45.924 --> 38:47.859 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

38:47.892 --> 38:51.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Gwen's editor had sent
her a bottle
of champagne, which we had to
drink surreptitiously

38:51.963 --> 38:54.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out of teacups, because I think
the restaurant
was dry.

38:54.832 --> 38:56.601 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

38:56.634 --> 39:00.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: And then I have to
say finally
that it's actually thanks to
Gwen that I'm

39:00.171 --> 39:03.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sitting here tonight, because
Mark was going
to be away one day.

39:03.441 --> 39:08.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Jim said, "Hey, who can --
how can we
broaden the circle and bring
people in?"

39:08.112 --> 39:10.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Gwen said, "What about
Ruth?"

39:10.548 --> 39:17.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I know I'm not only person
for whom she
went to bat and said, why don't
we expand

39:17.889 --> 39:19.757 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the field of people that we use?

39:19.791 --> 39:22.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, so, I will miss her, and
I'm thankful
to her.

39:22.293 --> 39:24.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, she had an
eye for talent.

39:24.128 --> 39:25.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we're glad you're here, too.

39:25.830 --> 39:27.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, David, she was so fond of
you.

39:27.532 --> 39:30.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, and, well, I
wrote this
column.

39:30.635 --> 39:34.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the way I ended it, which I
think is a
point that is a true one, is
that nobody reminded

39:34.606 --> 39:35.907 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you of her.

39:35.940 --> 39:38.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You never thought, oh, who's
kind of like
Gwen?

39:38.142 --> 39:39.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Who's the next best Gwen?

39:39.377 --> 39:41.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is no next best Gwen.

39:41.412 --> 39:46.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think what was unique
about her was
this combination of intense
strength with

39:46.951 --> 39:48.720 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
intense warmth.

39:48.753 --> 39:53.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, one of the
toughest hours of
TV I ever had, but maybe the
best, was on

39:53.358 --> 39:54.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
"Meet the Press."

39:54.559 --> 39:57.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I did a show sometimes called
"Imus in the
Morning."

39:57.395 --> 40:00.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Tim Russert did that show
and David Gregory.

40:00.732 --> 40:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he said some racist things.

40:02.467 --> 40:05.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I didn't realize he had
already said some
racist things about her.

40:05.870 --> 40:08.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she was on the show, and she
just was
super tough on us.

40:08.573 --> 40:09.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

40:09.574 --> 40:10.541 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I remember that.

40:10.575 --> 40:12.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But then the
intense warmth.

40:12.410 --> 40:16.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have a photo on my phone of
you and Gwen
doing an exploding fist bump at
the convention.

40:16.981 --> 40:21.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she's laughing and she's
dancing in her
chair, that warmth, that smile.

40:21.152 --> 40:22.887 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the two were so in tandem.

40:22.920 --> 40:27.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, our mutual
friend John
Dickerson over at CBS said you
could read

40:27.792 --> 40:29.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a book by the light of her
smile.

40:29.527 --> 40:31.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think we all agree with
that.

40:31.929 --> 40:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ruth Marcus, David Brooks, we
thank you.

40:35.266 --> 40:40.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, with that, before we go
tonight, we wanted
to let members of our own
"NewsHour" family,

40:40.905 --> 40:45.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
past and present, on camera and
behind the
camera, pay tribute to Gwen.

40:45.943 --> 40:48.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you know, she passed away
earlier this
week.

40:48.946 --> 40:52.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She will be remembered at
services this weekend
here in Washington.

40:52.216 --> 40:57.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Personally, I'm the luckiest
person I know
because I had the privilege of
being Gwen

40:57.055 --> 41:07.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ifill's friend and her sidekick
at work.

41:07.532 --> 41:09.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She was like a magnet.

41:09.400 --> 41:13.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People just wanted to be close
to her because
she instinctively cared about
how they were

41:13.705 --> 41:14.872 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
doing.

41:14.906 --> 41:15.873 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We joked.

41:15.907 --> 41:17.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We were like an old married
couple.

41:17.709 --> 41:21.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We weren't afraid to say the
really important
stuff to each other's faces,
like, you have

41:21.612 --> 41:27.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got salad in your teeth, or,
where did you
find those fabulous earrings?

41:27.685 --> 41:32.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a work partner, she was the
ultimate, holding
me and everyone else here at the
"NewsHour"

41:32.857 --> 41:35.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the highest standards.

41:35.059 --> 41:37.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Her mantra was, "Assume
nothing."

41:37.195 --> 41:38.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
"How do you know?"

41:38.896 --> 41:41.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I can hear her asking.

41:41.265 --> 41:43.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Boy, do we miss her.

41:43.201 --> 41:45.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is an empty place in our
hearts.

41:45.570 --> 41:52.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we will carry on, as Gwen
would want,
with a commitment to being
thorough, being

41:52.076 --> 41:58.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fair and to shedding light,
rather than heat,
on everything we cover.

41:58.950 --> 42:06.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRAVIS DAUB: What I learned from
Gwen as a
journalist is to never accept
the easy answer.

42:06.524 --> 42:08.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is often another layer to
a problem.

42:08.559 --> 42:13.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There is often another
motivation driving
someone behind an issue.

42:13.598 --> 42:15.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's our job to find out
what that is.

42:15.500 --> 42:19.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNY MARDER: For every story,
you need to
think about, what is the
question that's important

42:19.604 --> 42:21.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to ask and why does it matter?

42:21.472 --> 42:26.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSHUA BARAJAS: No matter how
complicated
and how fraught the
conversations I have with

42:26.244 --> 42:29.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people, Gwen taught me how to
listen.

42:29.046 --> 42:38.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There is a
professional
ladder in this business, but, as
a journalist

42:38.556 --> 42:43.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of color, what she impressed
upon me, as a
friend and a mentor, is that
it's not just

42:43.661 --> 42:46.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
enough to climb that ladder.

42:46.264 --> 42:51.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's about making sure that you
pull someone
else up, and then they pull
someone else up

42:51.569 --> 42:53.337 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
along the way.

42:53.371 --> 42:57.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JASMINE WRIGHT: It's no longer
an exception
to see a black woman who looks
just like me

42:57.408 --> 43:02.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anchoring the nightly news,
reporting on foreign
policy and politics, but that
it's the norm.

43:02.213 --> 43:06.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMANDA GOMEZ: Race and gender
doesn't define
my reporting.

43:06.217 --> 43:07.418 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It adds to it.

43:07.452 --> 43:09.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It strengthens it.

43:09.320 --> 43:12.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAMARIA ROBERTS: Determined and
focused, despite
what naysayers may have to say
about you and

43:12.857 --> 43:13.825 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your work.

43:13.858 --> 43:15.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Believe in wonder.

43:15.693 --> 43:17.295 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She taught me to be bold.

43:17.328 --> 43:19.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She taught me that black women
are magical.

43:19.831 --> 43:27.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM LEHRER: We heard that there
was an opportunity
for her to come possibly to PBS
to do "Washington

43:27.405 --> 43:33.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Week," but even possibly be a
correspondent
on the "NewsHour."

43:33.177 --> 43:38.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Linda Winslow, who was then the
executive
producer of the "NewsHour," and
I had dinner

43:38.916 --> 43:43.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Gwen, and we talked about
her coming
aboard as a correspondent.

43:43.120 --> 43:46.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And almost right there, she
accepted.

43:46.824 --> 43:50.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And to our new senior
correspondent, Gwen
Ifill, welcome, Gwen.

43:50.628 --> 43:52.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Thanks, Jim.

43:52.163 --> 43:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JIM LEHRER: And there she was,
one of us.

43:56.167 --> 44:03.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was a superb professional,
somebody who
understood the need to be civil,
understand

44:03.774 --> 44:14.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the need to be honest, the need
to do your
homework, and the need to be
tough when required,

44:14.852 --> 44:23.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be soft when required, and
more importantly,
always to be yourself, which
Gwen always was.

44:24.028 --> 44:30.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAR SILVER: Gwen Ifill was a
class act.

44:30.768 --> 44:36.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everybody who spent any time
with her, both
professionally and outside the
studio, was

44:36.340 --> 44:39.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aware of the fact that she was a
consummate
professional.

44:39.810 --> 44:44.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAM KIRKLAND: Gwen taught me to
keep digging,
that, even when I thought all
the questions

44:44.649 --> 44:48.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had been answered in a story,
that there were
always more questions to ask.

44:48.185 --> 44:50.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LEAH NAGY: To always ask, so
what?

44:50.054 --> 44:52.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How does the story affect people
across the
country?

44:52.356 --> 44:54.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why should they care?

44:54.158 --> 44:57.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE BUCKINGHAM: Was to always
remember the
importance of words, the right
words at the

44:57.528 --> 44:59.263 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right time.

44:59.297 --> 45:03.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: We shared a
journalist's
passion for explaining to our
audience how

45:03.601 --> 45:08.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the world works, but with
honesty and care,
not cynicism.

45:08.139 --> 45:13.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most precious of all was her
wise counsel,
reminding me in tough times to
rely on family,

45:13.711 --> 45:14.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
friends and faith.

45:14.845 --> 45:17.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were the greatest source of
Gwen's gusto
and joy.

45:17.982 --> 45:24.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Gwen taught me, in
the more than
30 years we knew each other, the
value and

45:24.155 --> 45:25.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the power of friendship.

45:25.523 --> 45:27.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAN COONEY: What did I learn
from Gwen?

45:27.658 --> 45:31.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She reinforced in me the
difference a smile
can make in someone's day.

45:31.696 --> 45:37.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE MELIA: Kindness and
curiosity are the
best tools that we have to love
and to live.

45:37.034 --> 45:40.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JIM SCHNEIDER: Live with
integrity and grace
all the time.

45:40.972 --> 45:47.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDA WINSLOW: When her strong,
compassionate
heart stopped beating on Monday,
those of

45:47.244 --> 45:55.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us who knew and loved her, her
friends and
her colleagues and the audience
as well, knew

45:55.286 --> 45:58.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that our own hearts had taken a
direct hit.

45:59.023 --> 46:00.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She was our inspiration.

46:00.458 --> 46:05.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She was the person who told us
that the work
we did really mattered.

46:05.630 --> 46:13.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was a stickler for accuracy,
and she was
also a fun-loving,
life-affirming, deeply

46:13.838 --> 46:16.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
religious friend.

46:16.941 --> 46:21.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm going to miss her very
much.

46:21.445 --> 46:29.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXIS COX: Gwen taught me that,
as a woman
in a challenging profession, I
have a responsibility

46:29.387 --> 46:31.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to help other women succeed.

46:31.656 --> 46:35.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She also taught me to never
underestimate
the power of a great statement
necklace.

46:35.393 --> 46:38.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MEREDITH GARRETSON: That leopard
print is
business casual.

46:38.062 --> 46:42.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN SAGALYN: She always said, "I
like your
haircut," whenever I got a
haircut, and that

46:42.400 --> 46:44.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hair was really important.

46:44.301 --> 46:50.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLIE IDE: I learned a lot
from Gwen professionally
and personally, but I also
learned how to

46:50.875 --> 46:52.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
let off some steam.

46:52.610 --> 46:57.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the best way to do it is to
give a good
uppercut to Bozo.

46:57.581 --> 47:00.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GLYNDA BATES: Gwen taught me
never to call
her Gwennie.

47:01.018 --> 47:05.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT MACNEIL: Many years ago,
at the dawn
of television, some radio
comedian said, it's

47:05.623 --> 47:07.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
easy to make it on TV.

47:07.892 --> 47:09.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All you have to do is fake
sincerity.

47:09.493 --> 47:11.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Gwen Ifill never faked anything.

47:11.962 --> 47:18.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was always entirely herself,
bold, assertive,
confident, professional, and
funny.

47:18.636 --> 47:20.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Do you have an
opening for a backup
singer?

47:20.171 --> 47:21.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MELISSA ETHERIDGE, Musician:
Come on.

47:21.539 --> 47:22.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think you should...

47:22.540 --> 47:23.507 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

47:23.541 --> 47:25.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I'm just saying I
could do it.

47:25.443 --> 47:27.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT MACNEIL: She made her
career, as they
used to say in the commercial,
the old-fashioned

47:27.144 --> 47:28.345 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

47:28.379 --> 47:31.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She earned it on a road made far
tougher by
her being black.

47:31.115 --> 47:32.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A footnote to this
story.

47:32.883 --> 47:36.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT MACNEIL: I feel that the
outpouring
of sympathy for her too-young
death shows

47:36.721 --> 47:39.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how vitally she connected with
the audience.

47:39.690 --> 47:46.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it may also show, in this
time politically,
which feels like a world turned
upside down,

47:46.297 --> 47:51.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that she provides an emotional
outlet for
people who prize the diversity
of American

47:51.569 --> 48:00.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
society and, in her career, a
symbol of the
values they want to hold on to.

48:00.544 --> 48:06.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE DAVENPORT: What Gwen taught
me was grit,
grace and gratitude, what I call
the three

48:06.450 --> 48:08.219 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
G's.

48:08.252 --> 48:13.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were doing her last stand-up
at the African
American Museum, and she
basically motored

48:13.257 --> 48:16.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through it, and she did what I
call, she chose
happy.

48:16.894 --> 48:21.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: This is an amazing
place, chockful
of the expected and the
unexpected.

48:21.632 --> 48:26.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE DAVENPORT: She always saw
the bright
spot, even when she wasn't
feeling well towards

48:26.470 --> 48:27.438 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the end.

48:27.471 --> 48:29.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: I love it.

48:29.340 --> 48:31.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE DAVENPORT: And also a kind
of fun lesson,
on the road, whether it was the
New Hampshire

48:31.642 --> 48:34.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
primary or something else, bring
red wine
and Twizzlers.

48:34.945 --> 48:38.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGE HUBBARD: Gwen taught me,
put hot sauce
on my eggs.

48:38.682 --> 48:40.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EMILY CARPEAUX: Gwen taught me
to pave my
own way.

48:40.885 --> 48:45.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD COOLIDGE: To understand
people, it's
not just having empathy that's
enough, but

48:45.456 --> 48:50.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's really to put yourself
inside their situation,
to understand what they were
going through.

48:50.661 --> 48:54.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LES CRYSTAL: The sweet spot for
Gwen was covering
politics.

48:54.865 --> 49:00.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we know it was very
difficult for her
giving that up as she battled
her illness

49:00.304 --> 49:02.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the last weeks.

49:02.106 --> 49:08.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will also remember Gwen for
that beautiful
wide smile, along with her
devotion to high

49:08.546 --> 49:12.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
standards of journalism, made
her a very special
colleague and friend.

49:12.983 --> 49:15.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Part of what
Gwen taught
me -- and this was from watching
her at the

49:15.920 --> 49:20.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2004 vice presidential debate
that she moderated
with Cheney and Edwards -- and
she raised

49:20.424 --> 49:24.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the question of the startling
high rate of
HIV among black women in
America.

49:24.595 --> 49:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: What should the
government's role
be in helping to end the growth
of this epidemic?

49:29.633 --> 49:32.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Neither of
them had any
idea what she was talking about.

49:32.703 --> 49:38.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what Gwen taught me in that
moment was
that bringing uncomfortable
truths and facts

49:38.075 --> 49:40.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to people in power is what a
journalist is
supposed to do.

49:40.911 --> 49:46.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Gwen taught me that
you can always
find some kind of diversity, a
woman or a

49:46.217 --> 49:50.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
person of color, to speak on
almost any issue,
if you just make enough phone
calls.

49:51.021 --> 49:55.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Gwen taught me
that you shouldn't
only tell a story with a
critical eye; you

49:55.226 --> 49:57.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
should want your audience to
care.

49:57.094 --> 50:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY NEVEL: There could be a
special relationship
between an anchor, reporter and
her crew.

50:02.733 --> 50:07.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And whether it was here at WETA
studios or
whether we were on the road
doing the "Washington

50:07.504 --> 50:11.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Week" show or at the
conventions, she took
care of us, and we took care of
her.

50:11.775 --> 50:14.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARA JUST: Gwen was a huge fan
of the show
"Hamilton."

50:14.445 --> 50:17.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there's a line from
"Hamilton" that I
can't stop thinking about in the
days since

50:17.615 --> 50:18.582 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
her death.

50:18.616 --> 50:20.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It says, "Legacy, what is a
legacy?

50:20.718 --> 50:23.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is planting seeds in a garden
you never
get to see."

50:23.654 --> 50:27.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a huge, gaping hole in
our newsroom
and in the industry of
journalism in general

50:27.958 --> 50:29.293 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
without Gwen.

50:29.326 --> 50:30.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She was one of a kind.

50:30.361 --> 50:33.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But she also planted a lot of
seeds.

50:33.430 --> 50:37.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She was a mentor, a guide, a
friend to a whole
slew of younger journalists.

50:37.167 --> 50:41.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She made time in her busy
schedule to offer
advice, be a sounding board, a
cheerleader,

50:41.705 --> 50:42.806 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
an ally.

50:42.840 --> 50:44.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZABETH SUMMERS: Gwen taught
me to trust
myself.

50:44.541 --> 50:46.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RHANA NATOUR: How to be graceful
under pressure.

50:46.710 --> 50:50.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUSTIN SCUILETTI: Gwen taught me
not only
to strive to be good at your
job, but also

50:50.247 --> 50:51.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to have fun with it.

50:51.248 --> 50:52.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BILL BARBER: She is not going to
be replaced.

50:52.883 --> 50:54.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She will be in our hearts
forever.

50:54.752 --> 50:58.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For years, Gwen
and I had lunch
or dinner nearly every week, a
chance to get

50:58.789 --> 51:00.224 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out of the office and talk.

51:00.257 --> 51:03.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At a certain point, we realized
we had developed
a pattern.

51:03.827 --> 51:08.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of us would start with some
problem or
minor grievance, something at
work or too

51:08.565 --> 51:11.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
much work or something like
that.

51:11.135 --> 51:15.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other would listen, go along
with it a
bit, and point out how petty the
complaint

51:15.940 --> 51:21.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was, and get us to where we
always ended up
in those conversations: how
lucky we are to

51:21.278 --> 51:22.880 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do what we do.

51:22.913 --> 51:24.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We took turns doing that for
each other.

51:24.949 --> 51:26.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I know she did it for me.

51:26.984 --> 51:33.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's my turn here, even in great
sadness,
to say how lucky I am to have
known and worked

51:33.257 --> 51:34.725 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with my friend Gwen Ifill.

51:34.758 --> 51:39.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOE CAMP: I always had this sort
of Eddie
Haskell kind of thing with Gwen.

51:39.430 --> 51:45.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would say, "Good evening, Ms.
Ifill," and,
"Good night, Ms. Ifill."

51:45.469 --> 51:55.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm not going to say,
goodbye, Ms. Ifill.

51:55.512 --> 52:03.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm not going to say,
goodbye, Ms. Ifill.

52:03.287 --> 52:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Gwen lives on
through everyone
you just heard and so many more.

52:15.799 --> 52:18.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we have one more tribute to
Gwen online.

52:18.669 --> 52:24.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our beloved friend and colleague
was such
a force that a full moon, the
supermoon, drew

52:24.041 --> 52:28.645 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
closer to Earth on her last day
of life.

52:28.679 --> 52:32.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Please, tonight, tune in for a
special "Washington
Week."

52:32.883 --> 52:34.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's later on this evening.

52:34.518 --> 52:39.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gwen's dear friend Michele
Norris leads a
panel of those who knew Gwen
well.

52:39.490 --> 52:45.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On "PBS NewsHour" Saturday: As
Iraqi Kurds
continue the fight against ISIS
in Mosul,

52:45.195 --> 52:48.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some on the front lines are also
hoping to
win their independence.

52:48.866 --> 52:54.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, finally, before we go, we
want to take
