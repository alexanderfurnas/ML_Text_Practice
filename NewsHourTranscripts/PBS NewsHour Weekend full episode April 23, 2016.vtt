TOLLS BASED ON THEIR OWN BUDGET?

10:46.513 --> 10:47.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE ANSWER IS NO.

10:47.814 --> 10:50.250 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THAT'S THE REAL RUB.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE PROCESS.

10:51.885 --> 10:55.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

10:55.855 --> 10:58.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

11:03.396 --> 11:05.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
