Gwen Ifill is away.

00:08.375 --> 00:13.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

between Hillary

00:13.480 --> 00:19.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton and Donald Trump, while
we put some
of the biggest moments into
context.

00:19.186 --> 00:25.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Also ahead this Tuesday,
bringing the music

arts education for their
students.

00:27.094 --> 00:32.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MYRAN PARKER-BRASS, Arts
Activist: Our job
is to make sure our students see
art, understand

00:32.099 --> 00:37.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
art, appreciate it, and if they
are passionate
enough, create it.

00:37.070 --> 00:42.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus: explaining
the disconnect
of white working-class Americans
from the

00:42.676 --> 00:45.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rest of the country, and how
it's playing
into this election.

00:45.512 --> 00:47.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
J.D. VANCE, Author, "Hillbilly
Elegy: A Memoir
of a Family and Culture in
Crisis": They feel

00:47.481 --> 00:51.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like their communities have
really been struggling
in a lot of different ways for
20 and 30 years,

00:51.785 --> 00:53.053 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and nobody has really cared.

00:53.086 --> 00:56.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Trump is the first person to
at least
see these communities.

00:56.056 --> 01:03.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:03.530 --> 01:05.899 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:05.933 --> 01:17.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's the debate
day after,
and the two presidential
candidates have decidedly

01:17.544 --> 01:20.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
different takes on how things
went.

01:20.347 --> 01:23.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage
with this report.

01:23.350 --> 01:29.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Twelve hours after
stepping off
the debate stage, Hillary
Clinton was back

01:29.222 --> 01:31.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on her campaign plane sounding
upbeat.

01:31.525 --> 01:35.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Well, we had a great, great time
last night.

01:35.395 --> 01:43.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The real point is about
temperament and fitness
and qualifications to hold the
most important,

01:43.437 --> 01:45.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hardest job in the world.

01:46.006 --> 01:51.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think people saw last
night some very
clear differences between us.

01:51.578 --> 01:56.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Clinton said some of
Donald Trump's
debate statements were
demonstrably untrue

01:56.783 --> 01:59.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and dismissed one of his
grievances about
their face-off.

01:59.720 --> 02:03.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Anybody
who complains
about the microphone is not
having a good

02:03.590 --> 02:05.359 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
night.

02:05.392 --> 02:08.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Trump told reporters
after the
debate that his mic was
defective and suggested

02:08.795 --> 02:10.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it was on purpose.

02:10.630 --> 02:16.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also claimed that moderator
Lester Holt
of NBC News was tougher on him
than on Clinton.

02:16.937 --> 02:19.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump insists he came out ahead
anyway.

02:19.039 --> 02:22.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I was asked about my tax
returns, which I

02:22.843 --> 02:24.711 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have told about 500 times.

02:24.745 --> 02:27.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think I did really well in
answering those
questions, but those questions
are not answerable

02:27.614 --> 02:29.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a positive light.

02:29.950 --> 02:34.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Last night, Clinton
opened up a
new front in the battle for
women's votes.

02:34.588 --> 02:38.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the end of the debate, she
spoke of the
case of a former Miss Universe.

02:38.191 --> 02:43.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: He loves
beauty contests,
supporting them and hanging
around them.

02:43.397 --> 02:47.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he called this woman "Miss
Piggy."

02:47.401 --> 02:51.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Then he called her "Miss
Housekeeping," because
she was Latina.

02:51.405 --> 02:52.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Donald, she has a name.

02:52.606 --> 02:53.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Where did you find
this?

02:53.607 --> 02:54.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where did you find this?

02:54.708 --> 02:55.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Her name
is Alicia
Machado.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Where did you find
this?

02:57.244 --> 02:59.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: And she
has become
a U.S. citizen, and you can
bet...

02:59.246 --> 03:00.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Oh, really?

03:00.614 --> 03:02.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: ...
she's going to
vote this November.

03:02.149 --> 03:03.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: OK, good.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: You are the new Miss
Universe!

03:05.585 --> 03:10.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The Clinton campaign
quickly released
a Web video of Machado, a
Clinton supporter,

03:10.457 --> 03:11.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
criticizing Trump.

03:11.758 --> 03:14.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALICIA MACHADO, Former Miss
Universe: "Hello,
Miss Piggy.

03:14.094 --> 03:15.529 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hello, Miss Housekeeping."

03:15.562 --> 03:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: This morning, the
Republican nominee
fired back on FOX News.

03:19.466 --> 03:21.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: She gained a
massive amount
of weight.

03:21.868 --> 03:25.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was a real problem, not
only that,
her attitude.

03:25.772 --> 03:27.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we had a real problem with
her.

03:27.474 --> 03:29.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Good afternoon, Miami.

03:29.376 --> 03:33.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: This afternoon at a
town hall meeting
with Latinos in Miami, Trump
mentioned the

03:33.346 --> 03:35.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
debate only briefly.

03:35.115 --> 03:39.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: It was an
interesting evening,
certainly, and big league,
definitely big

03:39.386 --> 03:41.121 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
league.

03:41.154 --> 03:47.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In North Carolina, an
energized
Clinton relived a memorable
moment from the

03:47.127 --> 03:48.929 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
debate.

03:48.962 --> 03:52.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: At one
point, he was
kind of digging me for spending
time off the

03:52.365 --> 03:54.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
campaign trail to get prepared.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I said, yes, you know what,
I did prepare.

03:57.504 --> 03:59.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I will tell you something
else I prepared
for.

03:59.739 --> 04:03.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I prepared to be president of
the United States,
and I think that's good.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

04:04.945 --> 04:09.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Early ratings show
that more than
81 million people tuned in last
night, a record

04:09.416 --> 04:11.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for a presidential debate.

04:11.451 --> 04:13.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

04:13.787 --> 04:18.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will take a
closer look
at some of last night's debating
points and

04:18.225 --> 04:23.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hear from a representative of
each campaign
after the news summary.

04:23.196 --> 04:28.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
U.S. Senate failed
to advance a spending bill to
keep the federal

04:28.502 --> 04:33.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government running past Friday,
when the fiscal
year ends.

04:33.039 --> 04:38.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats demanded money to help
Flint, Michigan,
with its lead-contaminated
water, and a dozen

04:38.378 --> 04:40.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
conservative Republicans
defected.

04:40.947 --> 04:44.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Charges of election-year
politics dominated
the debate.

04:44.050 --> 04:45.852 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:45.886 --> 04:48.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: After
Labor Day, it was pretty clear
what the way

04:48.889 --> 04:56.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forward was, but they have sort
of dragged
everybody around here for
multiple weeks,

04:56.963 --> 04:59.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
obviously interested in
producing some kind
of shutdown scenario.

04:59.866 --> 05:01.535 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:01.568 --> 05:03.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARRY REID (D-NV), Minority
Leader: All we
want to do is help the people of
Flint.

05:03.403 --> 05:06.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This shouldn't be hard.

05:06.306 --> 05:10.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We should be able to find a path
forward to
fund the government and help the
people of

05:10.911 --> 05:12.312 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Flint.

05:12.345 --> 05:15.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's no excuse for leaving
the people of
Flint, Michigan, behind.

05:15.882 --> 05:21.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: GOP leaders have
promised to
address the Flint water issue
after the election

05:21.354 --> 05:23.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in a separate piece of
legislation.

05:23.523 --> 05:29.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Syria, the government
offensive to retake
all of the besieged city of
Aleppo shifted

05:29.095 --> 05:31.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into a deadly new gear.

05:31.464 --> 05:37.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ground troops and armor began
moving in, as
we hear from Alex Thomson of
Independent Television

05:37.103 --> 05:39.005 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
News.

05:39.039 --> 05:45.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX THOMSON: Backed by the
relentless airstrikes,
several sources are confirming
tonight that

05:45.312 --> 05:50.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syrian government ground forces
have attacked
into rebel-held east Aleppo from
the north

05:50.350 --> 05:52.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and the south today.

05:52.185 --> 06:01.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The white helmet civil defense
rescue teams
on the streets of the east of
the city, the

06:01.127 --> 06:06.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rebel-held area, to rescue those
caught in
the airstrikes and shell fire,
as they do

06:06.132 --> 06:14.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night and day, and civilians,
250,000 of them,
caught up in the wider effects
of warfare

06:14.107 --> 06:15.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and siege in east Aleppo.

06:15.909 --> 06:19.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): I
don't know what
to say.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Our hearts are full of fear.

06:21.548 --> 06:24.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
May God hold the tyrants
accountable.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My oldest son is 6 years old.

06:26.853 --> 06:33.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wish for security for country,
just like
we had it before, to be able to
move freely.

06:33.260 --> 06:35.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALEX THOMSON: What's at stake is
huge.

06:35.895 --> 06:42.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If government forces, with
Russian support,
take these streets, Syria's
biggest city falls,

06:42.168 --> 06:46.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the West's dream of toppling
President
Assad will be over.

06:46.573 --> 06:51.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But taking this vast urban
warren will need
thousands of soldiers.

06:51.177 --> 06:56.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More likely, Assad's forces will
simply pound
it into submission from afar, as
they did

06:56.049 --> 06:59.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in Homs and parts of Damascus.

06:59.619 --> 07:05.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But civilians in government-held
west Aleppo
are also being attacked,
seemingly indiscriminately,

07:05.659 --> 07:07.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by rebels from the east.

07:07.927 --> 07:12.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

Gunmen fire at
us regularly,.

07:17.637 --> 07:22.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We live like we are in a
tinderbox and pray
every day that the Syrian army
holds the line.

07:22.842 --> 07:28.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALEX THOMSON: Although
pro-government civilians
face the terror of bullets,
mortars and shells,

07:28.748 --> 07:34.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the rebel-held east, they
face the might
of the Russian and Syrian air
force, incendiary

07:34.754 --> 07:41.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bombs, bunker-busting munitions
and barrel
bombs, as well as shells,
mortars and bullets.

07:41.194 --> 07:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The offensive
against Aleppo
has effectively ended any hope
of restoring

07:46.800 --> 07:48.301 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a cease-fire.

07:48.335 --> 07:52.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Taiwan was hit today by its
third typhoon
this month.

07:52.205 --> 07:58.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The storm swept across the
island with winds
topping 100 miles per hour,
heading for a

07:58.044 --> 08:01.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
second landfall in Southeastern
China.

08:01.081 --> 08:06.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The winds and heavy rain tore
down signs,
ripped away parts of buildings,
and knocked

08:06.519 --> 08:08.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a tour bus sideways.

08:08.688 --> 08:13.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Four people died, and three
million homes
lost power.

08:13.193 --> 08:19.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the U.S., Cedar Rapids, Iowa,
appears to
have escaped major flooding,
after a rain-swollen

08:19.632 --> 08:21.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
river finally crested.

08:21.835 --> 08:25.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Temporary barriers kept the
water out for
the most part today.

08:25.739 --> 08:29.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some neighborhoods did flood in
the state's
second largest city.

08:29.743 --> 08:34.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials said it could have
been much worse,
but the crest was well below the
devastating

08:34.481 --> 08:36.416 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
levels in 2008.

08:36.449 --> 08:41.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's word that more than 90
percent of
the world's population now lives
in areas

08:41.821 --> 08:43.757 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with excessive air pollution.

08:43.790 --> 08:49.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's more, the World Health
Organization
reports that it's causing some
6.5 million

08:49.696 --> 08:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deaths every year, from strokes
to heart disease
to lung cancer.

08:54.234 --> 09:00.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: For us, it is extremely
important to
put this data outside, for
politicians to

09:00.173 --> 09:05.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
understand, for citizens to be
aware of this,
for countries to take action,
and for all

09:05.712 --> 09:11.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of us to move into promoting
some interventions
that will cause reduction of air
pollution.

JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.N. agency
says Southeast
Asia, the Eastern Mediterranean
and the Western

09:17.323 --> 09:20.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Pacific regions are the worst
affected.

09:20.160 --> 09:26.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A former al-Qaida rebel in Mali
was convicted
today of destroying historic
tombs.

09:26.366 --> 09:31.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The International Criminal Court
returned
a guilty verdict for Ahmad
al-Faqi al-Mahdi

09:31.638 --> 09:35.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in its first conviction for
attacks on cultural
sites.

09:35.742 --> 09:42.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Al-Mahdi admitted to demolishing
nine mausoleums
during a rebel occupation of
Timbuktu in 2012.

09:42.982 --> 09:46.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Islamists were ultimately
driven out.

09:46.186 --> 09:51.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In economic news, the World
Trade Organization
warned that global trade is
slowing to its

09:51.458 --> 09:53.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
weakest pace since 2009.

09:54.027 --> 09:59.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The group cited a growing
opposition to doing
business across borders, what it
calls creeping

09:59.232 --> 10:00.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
protectionism.

10:00.400 --> 10:04.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meantime, Wall Street recouped
some of Monday's
losses.

10:04.637 --> 10:10.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 133
points to close at 18228.

10:10.076 --> 10:15.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 48 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added nearly 14.

10:15.748 --> 10:21.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
fact-checking
the candidates and putting their
talking points

10:21.387 --> 10:28.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into context; Clinton and Trump
strategists
on last night's debate; bringing
music back

10:28.127 --> 10:42.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Boston schools; and much
more.

10:42.141 --> 10:46.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night's much anticipated
presidential
debate saw record viewership
and, at times,

10:46.779 --> 10:50.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a raucous back-and-forth between
the two candidates.

10:50.884 --> 10:55.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But for all the spectacle, how
factual were
their claims and accusations?

10:55.922 --> 10:59.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins reports, putting
the debate
in context.

10:59.058 --> 11:05.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In 94 minutes
last night,
there were at least 94 needs for
more information.

11:05.532 --> 11:08.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's start with an urgent
headline right
now, crime and race.

11:08.434 --> 11:10.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
You can do stop-and-frisk, which
worked very

11:10.904 --> 11:12.672 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
well.

11:12.705 --> 11:15.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: A reminder,
stop-and-frisk
is a police tactic allowing
officers to pat

11:15.275 --> 11:17.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
down pedestrians as a way to
fight crime.

11:17.944 --> 11:20.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump defended it as
bring order, but:

11:20.313 --> 11:24.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LESTER HOLT, Moderator:
Stop-and-frisk was
ruled unconstitutional in New
York, because

11:24.584 --> 11:28.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it largely singled out black and
Hispanic
young men.

11:28.555 --> 11:30.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: No, you're wrong.

11:30.156 --> 11:36.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It went before a judge who was a
very against-police
judge.

11:36.629 --> 11:38.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was taken away from her.

11:38.231 --> 11:41.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In fact, Trump
was wrong.

11:41.167 --> 11:44.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Stop-and-frisk was ruled
unconstitutional
by one federal judge.

11:44.537 --> 11:48.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Trump also had a point, in
that no higher
courts ever ruled.

11:48.675 --> 11:50.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
New York City leaders dropped
the case.

11:50.743 --> 11:52.545 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
There was more.

11:52.579 --> 11:58.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: When you have
3,000 shootings
in Chicago from January 1, when
you have 4,000

11:58.484 --> 12:05.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people killed in Chicago by guns
from the
beginning of the presidency of
Barack Obama,

12:05.358 --> 12:08.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his hometown, you have to have
stop-and-frisk.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Those are
shocking numbers.

12:10.863 --> 12:15.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, have there been 3,000
shootings in
Chicago this year?

12:15.602 --> 12:17.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Actually, there were more.

12:17.503 --> 12:22.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
According to The Chicago
Tribune's Crime Project,
there have been more than 3,200
shooting victims

12:22.642 --> 12:24.110 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this year.

12:24.143 --> 12:28.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And have 4,000 Chicagoans been
shot dead during
the Obama administration?

12:28.314 --> 12:30.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That one may be high.

12:30.450 --> 12:37.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Tribune has just over 3,100
gun deaths
from 2009 through 2015, and some
400 more

12:37.490 --> 12:39.325 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this year.

12:39.359 --> 12:44.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As for Clinton, she was on
defense on trade
and the massive deal known as
the Trans-Pacific

12:44.197 --> 12:46.165 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Partnership.

12:46.199 --> 12:49.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I was against it once it was
finally negotiated

12:49.502 --> 12:51.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the terms were laid out.

12:51.571 --> 12:52.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I wrote about that in...

12:52.572 --> 12:54.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: You called it the
gold standard.

12:54.907 --> 12:57.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You called it the gold standard
of trade deals.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You said it's the finest deal
you have ever
seen.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: No.

13:01.447 --> 13:02.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And then you heard
what I said
about it, and all of a sudden,
you were against

13:02.982 --> 13:04.684 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

13:04.717 --> 13:07.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In fact, four
years ago,
she did call the TPP the gold
standard.

13:07.820 --> 13:12.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: This TPP
sets the
gold standard in trade
agreements to open

13:12.659 --> 13:19.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
free, transparent, fair trade,
the kind of
environment that has the rule of
law and a

13:19.766 --> 13:21.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
level playing field.

13:21.501 --> 13:25.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Now, the
Trans-Pacific deal
was still in outline form back
then.

13:25.405 --> 13:26.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Clinton stresses that.

13:26.739 --> 13:31.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But her words in 2012 were
unequivocal in
support of the idea.

13:31.277 --> 13:35.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After TPP was fully drafted,
Clinton pulled
that support.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trade is a raw spot for voters
this year.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Enter another controversial
deal, NAFTA.

13:39.886 --> 13:42.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I think
my husband
did a pretty good job in the
1990s.

13:42.822 --> 13:46.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think a lot about what worked
and how we
can make it work again...

13:46.526 --> 13:47.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Well, he approved
NAFTA...

13:47.527 --> 13:48.928 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

13:48.961 --> 13:50.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: ...
million new jobs,
a balanced budget...

13:50.563 --> 13:51.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: He approved NAFTA,
which is
the single worst trade deal ever
approved

13:51.597 --> 13:52.765 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this country.

13:52.799 --> 13:54.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Incomes
went up for
everybody.

13:54.667 --> 13:58.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Manufacturing jobs went up also
in the 1990s,
if we're actually going to look
at the facts.

13:58.137 --> 14:03.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Like the
candidates, economists
disagree over how many jobs were
created or

14:03.609 --> 14:05.211 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lost by NAFTA.

14:05.244 --> 14:10.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One widely cited study found it
wiped out
up to 800,000 U.S. jobs.

14:10.049 --> 14:17.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But a pro-trade analysis
suggested NAFTA had
a role in creating several
million jobs by

14:17.256 --> 14:19.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
boosting trade with Canada and
Mexico.

14:19.358 --> 14:25.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Neither side may be happy, but
the nonpartisan
Congressional Research Service
concluded that

14:25.298 --> 14:29.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NAFTA caused neither huge job
losses nor gains.

14:29.068 --> 14:32.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the debate, Trump gave a
specific example
of jobs he sees going to Mexico.

14:33.005 --> 14:35.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: So Ford is
leaving.

14:35.475 --> 14:38.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You see that, their small car
division leaving.

14:38.478 --> 14:42.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thousands of jobs leaving
Michigan, leaving
Ohio.

14:42.715 --> 14:43.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're all leaving.

14:43.850 --> 14:45.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Ford, itself,
called that
false.

14:45.852 --> 14:50.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The company said U.S. workers
will make two
new cars in the plants that used
to make small

14:50.990 --> 14:55.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cars, tweeting: "There is no
impact on U.S.
jobs."

14:55.561 --> 14:57.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One final thing to discuss:
taxes.

14:57.363 --> 15:02.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: So,
you've got to
ask yourself, why won't he
release his tax

15:02.735 --> 15:04.437 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
returns?

15:04.470 --> 15:07.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe he doesn't want the
American people,
all of you watching tonight, to
know that

15:07.940 --> 15:13.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's paid nothing in federal
taxes, because
the only years that anybody's
ever seen were

15:13.880 --> 15:18.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a couple of years when he had to
turn them
over to state authorities when
he was trying

15:18.050 --> 15:22.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get a casino license, and
they showed he
didn't pay any federal income
tax.

15:22.955 --> 15:24.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: That makes me
smart.

15:24.724 --> 15:27.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Clinton was
referring to
this story from The Washington
Post, which

15:27.760 --> 15:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
found a 1981 casino filing
showing Trump paid
nothing in taxes for two years.

15:34.467 --> 15:40.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More context: While Trump has
railed against
others using tax loopholes, this
was his first

15:40.206 --> 15:44.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
statement indicating he may have
paid nothing
in taxes himself.

15:44.544 --> 15:50.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that is plenty to chew on,
at least until
the next presidential debate in
just under

15:50.082 --> 15:51.350 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two weeks.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

15:53.352 --> 15:57.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will be
talking to two
representatives from the
campaigns.

15:57.790 --> 15:58.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
One of our guests is delayed.

15:58.925 --> 16:02.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to be doing that in
just a moment.

16:02.929 --> 16:14.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We will be right back.

16:14.974 --> 16:20.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight on PBS' "Frontline": an
in-depth look
at the two people who debated
last night,

16:20.379 --> 16:23.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Donald Trump and Hillary
Clinton, and what
drives them.

16:23.449 --> 16:28.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The choice examines their
background, asks
what has shaped them and looks
at why each

16:28.588 --> 16:31.090 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wants to take on the presidency.

16:31.123 --> 16:33.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NARRATOR: Hillary decided to
fight.

16:33.860 --> 16:36.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She took charge of her husband's
political
comeback.

16:36.229 --> 16:40.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT REICH, Former U.S. Labor
Secretary:
Hillary got very involved in the
campaign.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all intents and purposes,
she was the
campaign manager.

16:43.069 --> 16:48.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: One of her first
moves, rebrand
herself and become Mrs. Clinton.

16:48.574 --> 16:50.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBERT REICH: It was symbolic.

16:50.409 --> 16:58.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm sure she had to swallow
hard, but it was
just not worth trying to keep
her last name,

16:58.251 --> 17:00.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the expense of everything
they wanted to
achieve together.

17:00.286 --> 17:03.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
In order to avoid any problem
and to put it

17:03.389 --> 17:08.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to rest, I will forever be known
as Hillary
Rodham Clinton.

17:08.060 --> 17:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: She completely forfeited
her own identity,
at least physically, got rid of
the glasses,

17:14.233 --> 17:21.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got her hair dyed, started
dressing at least
modestly better, wore some
makeup, cultivated

17:21.307 --> 17:23.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a little bit of a drawl.

17:23.042 --> 17:27.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: The road
to being
somebody in this society starts
with education.

17:27.413 --> 17:32.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: The transformation was
a surprise
to some of those who had known
her the longest.

17:32.151 --> 17:37.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: When she had to begin the
change her
appearance, dye her hair, lose a
lot of weight,

17:37.857 --> 17:45.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get rid of her glasses, not
speak up, not
be as much who she was, that
hurt all of us.

17:45.464 --> 17:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We all felt sad about that.

17:47.767 --> 17:48.734 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It was hard.

17:48.768 --> 17:49.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was hard on us.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was hard on her.

17:51.771 --> 17:55.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: She formed an alliance
with a controversial
political consultant from New
York, Dick Morris.

17:55.207 --> 17:59.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DICK MORRIS, Former Clinton
Presidential Adviser:
She has a wonderful instinct for
the jugular.

17:59.946 --> 18:04.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She felt that he had lost it
because he wasn't
tough enough, wasn't strong
enough.

18:04.750 --> 18:09.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she reached out to me
because she felt
that I would be stronger and
tougher.

18:09.488 --> 18:16.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I think it only intensified
and began
a lot of the characteristics
that you saw

18:16.562 --> 18:22.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from then on, that the ends
justify the means,
that we will do what we have to
do to win,

18:22.201 --> 18:25.705 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
turn to the dark arts of
politics to survive.

18:25.738 --> 18:31.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TIMOTHY O'BRIEN, Author,
"TrumpNation": he
was seen for quite a long time
as a punchline,

18:31.677 --> 18:36.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the jokes about the excesses and
the failures
of the 1980s.

18:36.449 --> 18:41.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he had become, you know, a
human shingle
and a punchline.

18:41.253 --> 18:45.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"The Apprentice" turned all that
on its head.

18:45.424 --> 18:48.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
New York, my city, where the
wheels of the

18:48.127 --> 18:50.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
global economy never stop
turning.

18:50.629 --> 18:56.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIMOTHY O'BRIEN: He became seen
as a credible
businessperson with a real track
record, even

18:56.836 --> 18:58.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
though that was at odds with
reality.

18:58.637 --> 19:05.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the guy who became a reality
TV star via
"The Apprentice" learned that he
could become

19:05.511 --> 19:07.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a reality political star.

19:07.446 --> 19:13.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Who will succeed
and who will
fail, and who will be the
apprentice?

19:13.252 --> 19:18.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: For 14 seasons,
millions of Americans
watched a carefully crafted
Donald Trump.

19:18.257 --> 19:21.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROGER STONE, Trump Policy
Adviser: He's perfectly
made up.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's perfectly coiffed.

19:23.529 --> 19:25.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's perfectly lit.

19:25.097 --> 19:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's in a high-back chair making
tough decisions.

19:27.299 --> 19:29.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What does he look like?

19:29.035 --> 19:30.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He looks like a president.

19:30.970 --> 19:33.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OMAROSA MANIGAULT, Former
Contestant on "The
Apprentice": Donald connected
with the American

19:33.139 --> 19:36.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
public because they wanted to be
like him.

19:36.642 --> 19:39.445 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They aspired to be just like
him.

19:39.478 --> 19:43.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They wanted to see all of his
affluence, and
he let them see it.

19:43.215 --> 19:48.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He let them into every aspect of
what it meant
to be successful in America.

19:48.454 --> 19:49.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Good morning.

19:49.688 --> 19:50.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Good morning.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Everybody's saying
I should
run for president.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let me ask you a question.

19:54.260 --> 19:55.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Meatloaf, should I run for
president?

19:55.728 --> 19:57.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL LEE "MEATLOAF" ADAY,
Singer: Absolutely.

19:57.530 --> 20:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: As the show took off,
Trump again
began to discuss a run for the
White House.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Who wouldn't vote
for him?

20:03.102 --> 20:05.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Who wouldn't vote for him?

20:05.638 --> 20:06.639 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
All right.

20:06.672 --> 20:07.640 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Good.

20:07.673 --> 20:09.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Don't raise your hand.

20:09.642 --> 20:14.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I am joined
now by the
producer and the director of the
film, Michael

20:14.180 --> 20:15.147 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Kirk.

20:15.181 --> 20:16.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Good to see you again.

20:16.148 --> 20:17.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL KIRK, Filmmaker: You,
too, Judy.

20:17.983 --> 20:21.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you were
telling me this
is your fourth choice -- look at
the presidential

20:21.220 --> 20:24.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
candidates over the last more
than a decade.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What was different about these
two?

20:25.691 --> 20:27.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL KIRK: Well, almost
everything.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Usually, you have two
politicians.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have got a record to
compare.

20:31.797 --> 20:35.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have got a time frame to
measure up against.

20:35.101 --> 20:40.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What you have here is one of the
most overexposed
political figures in Hillary
Clinton, been

20:40.539 --> 20:46.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the stage a long time, and
one of the most
overexposed celebrities of all
time, Donald

20:46.045 --> 20:47.680 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

20:47.713 --> 20:52.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're side by side in
chronology, but
not in any other way.

20:52.051 --> 20:55.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, when the '60s happened,
she's doing one
thing.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's not doing one thing.

20:57.289 --> 20:59.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's doing something else.

20:59.091 --> 21:05.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there's room for some
comparison, but
mostly it's just so different
because they're

21:05.798 --> 21:07.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
so disliked.

21:07.500 --> 21:14.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You have got the highest
negatives for both
candidates of any campaign I
remember.

21:14.073 --> 21:19.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it changed the nature of the
way people
answered our questions, when we
were interviewing

21:19.111 --> 21:20.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their closest friends and
associates.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you mean?

21:22.481 --> 21:28.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL KIRK: They were just
ready to dish,
and they really came with a kind
of sober

21:28.387 --> 21:30.256 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
reflection.

21:30.289 --> 21:33.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We do two-and-a-half-hour,
three-hour interviews,
as you know, with people.

21:33.425 --> 21:40.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we did 25 for each side, and
got real
close to a lot of people, and
they all sat

21:40.199 --> 21:47.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there through those long
interviews and began
to pour out their anxieties,
their angst,

21:47.273 --> 21:50.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their ambivalences about the two
candidates.

21:50.142 --> 21:54.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, these are two
people we
have heard so much about, each
one of them,

21:54.146 --> 21:55.548 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
by now.

21:55.581 --> 21:58.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We think there couldn't be
anything else out
there we haven't heard.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And yet you think you got some
new material.

22:00.719 --> 22:03.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL KIRK: We went below the
white noise,
which was the first thing I
decided to do.

22:03.923 --> 22:07.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The second thing I decided to do
was just
tell their stories.

22:07.593 --> 22:09.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Don't try to get too political
about it.

22:09.929 --> 22:12.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Don't try to balance things out
too much.

22:12.331 --> 22:17.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just go straightforwardly
through Trump, warts
and all, and through Hillary,
warts and all.

22:17.937 --> 22:23.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It meant in some ways that we
would end up
spending a lot of time in the
troubled dark

22:23.075 --> 22:28.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spaces of things that have
happened to them,
everything from Trump's divorce
from Ivanka

22:28.714 --> 22:35.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the headlines and that
tawdry business
that was around that, Monica,
Gennifer Flowers.

22:35.554 --> 22:40.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of that gets laid out in a
way that I
think fits because it starts
with their stories

22:40.960 --> 22:44.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when they were little children
and moves right
through it.

22:44.730 --> 22:48.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you're left with a sense of
two people,
two warriors.

22:48.901 --> 22:57.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You saw them last night, real
fighters, but
she is much more closed, much
more nicked

22:57.710 --> 23:01.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up, much more beaten up by the
negativity
than he seems to be.

23:01.413 --> 23:04.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What did you --
what surprised
you about the two of them?

23:04.416 --> 23:10.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL KIRK: Well, the thing
that surprised
me the most about him was that
he's very,

23:10.990 --> 23:14.493 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
very, very hungry for all of it.

23:14.526 --> 23:17.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he has been since he was a
little kid.

23:17.096 --> 23:21.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he has failed and he's
dropped and he's
flopped, and he's not the great
businessman

23:21.667 --> 23:23.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that he said he was.

23:23.435 --> 23:29.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's been schooled in the
hardball of business
and life by Roy Cohn, one of the
toughest

23:29.108 --> 23:31.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
characters in recent American
history.

23:32.011 --> 23:33.646 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But he's hungry.

23:33.679 --> 23:35.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He really wants it.

23:35.180 --> 23:37.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he started in 1988.

23:37.716 --> 23:42.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We found speeches that he gave
in 1988 in
Portsmouth, New Hampshire, that
you could

23:42.321 --> 23:45.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
play today and believe that
they're the same
speeches.

23:45.157 --> 23:47.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what about
her, Hillary
Clinton?

23:47.593 --> 23:52.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL KIRK: Hillary was -- the
great mystery
of Hillary, from my point of
view, I had no

23:52.731 --> 23:57.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
idea what a powerful force she
was in 1969
and '70 and '71.

23:57.970 --> 24:03.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She does the commencement speech
at Wellesley,
gets in "LIFE" magazine, is
called by some

24:03.075 --> 24:05.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people a voice of a generation.

24:05.811 --> 24:08.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She is really on the road.

24:09.014 --> 24:14.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's at that thin edge of the
wedge of feminism
in 1969 and 1970 and a kind of
person who

24:15.020 --> 24:19.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everybody, Marian Wright Edelman
and lots
of people sort of take her under
their wing.

24:19.725 --> 24:21.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She goes to the Watergate
commission.

24:21.527 --> 24:25.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She meets Bill at Yale, to be
sure, but she
goes to the Watergate committee,
and works

24:25.331 --> 24:26.298 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

24:26.332 --> 24:28.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And everybody thinks she's on
her way.

24:28.467 --> 24:34.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And suddenly she announces, I'm
going to Arkansas
to live with this bounder, Bill
Clinton, and

24:34.106 --> 24:36.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we're going to get involved in
politics.

24:36.742 --> 24:41.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And everybody, everybody that we
talked to
said, how can this be?

24:41.480 --> 24:43.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think Robert Reich was
heartbroken.

24:43.615 --> 24:49.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think he just -- literally, on
camera, you
see him sort of melt down
reliving what that

24:49.054 --> 24:50.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
decision meant for her.

24:50.889 --> 24:54.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you're
setting up two
stories that we really, really
want to hear.

24:54.393 --> 24:55.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We will be watching.

24:55.394 --> 24:56.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL KIRK: That's great.

24:56.662 --> 24:58.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael Kirk with
"Frontline,"
we thank you.

24:58.430 --> 25:08.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a reminder: "Frontline: The
Choice 2016"
premieres tonight on most PBS
stations.

25:08.540 --> 25:14.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a reminder: "Frontline: The
Choice 2016"
premieres tonight on most PBS
stations.

25:14.780 --> 25:20.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now to get some post-debate
reaction from
both the campaigns, we hear from
two top political

25:20.352 --> 25:24.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strategists, starting with the
Republican
National Committee's Sean
Spicer.

25:24.723 --> 25:26.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sean, welcome back to the
"NewsHour."

25:27.025 --> 25:29.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, what's your assessment of
last night?

25:29.161 --> 25:30.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How did Mr. Trump do?

25:30.829 --> 25:32.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, Republican National
Committee
Communications Director: Thanks,
Judy.

25:32.331 --> 25:36.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think he really was able to
make that contrast
with Hillary Clinton.

25:36.068 --> 25:40.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, Donald Trump had an
opportunity
to present -- to become that
candidate of

25:40.205 --> 25:44.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change and present himself as
that, whereas
Hillary Clinton was the campaign
-- the candidate

25:44.643 --> 25:46.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the establishment and the
status quo.

25:46.645 --> 25:50.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you were looking for a
candidate that's
going to bring change to
Washington, I think

25:50.048 --> 25:53.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump showed you last
night that he's
your candidate.

25:53.185 --> 25:56.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're ready for more of the
same, I think
Hillary Clinton made the case
that she's been

25:56.221 --> 25:59.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Washington for 30 years, and
she can continue
to deliver more of the same.

25:59.758 --> 26:03.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the things
he tweeted
last night was -- and I'm
quoting -- "Nothing

26:03.929 --> 26:09.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on e-mails, nothing on the
corrupt Clinton
Foundation, and nothing on
Benghazi."

26:09.868 --> 26:13.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of his supporters are
saying today that
he should have brought these
things up, and

26:13.505 --> 26:15.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he missed these opportunities.

26:15.774 --> 26:19.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: Well, you're always
going to
go back after a debate and
figure where you

26:19.244 --> 26:23.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could have probably gotten some
points, additional
points in or where you probably
could have

26:23.215 --> 26:24.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
defended your record better.

26:24.516 --> 26:26.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there is no situation in
which you
wouldn't do that.

26:26.919 --> 26:30.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think for the -- when you
look at the
overall tone and tenor of the
debate, it was

26:30.255 --> 26:32.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one after another against Donald
Trump.

26:32.090 --> 26:36.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was no follow-up on
Hillary Clinton
and nothing about her record
with respect

26:36.495 --> 26:40.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the Clinton Foundation,
nothing about Benghazi,
nothing about immigration,
nothing against

26:40.566 --> 26:42.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all the issues that were against
them.

26:42.468 --> 26:46.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, for all the whining
they did the
day before about the media's
role in this,

26:46.605 --> 26:48.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think they definitely got
their way.

26:48.373 --> 26:50.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of the questions seemed
focused on Donald
Trump.

26:50.476 --> 26:53.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of the follow-ups and the
interruptions
were against Donald Trump.

26:53.512 --> 26:57.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She basically got a pass last
night, but it
is what it is.

26:57.649 --> 26:59.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So you're saying
the moderating
was unfair?

26:59.885 --> 27:03.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: No, I mean, I don't
-- it's not
a question of fair or unfair.

27:03.455 --> 27:04.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Those are the facts.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Those are what they are.

27:06.225 --> 27:09.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was never interrupted once
and she was
never asked about key scandals
and issues

27:09.962 --> 27:11.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
concerning her record.

27:11.530 --> 27:13.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those aren't -- I'm not here to
complain.

27:13.131 --> 27:16.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm just here to make sure that
everyone understands
what happened last night.

27:16.101 --> 27:21.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump had a full vetting
of his record,
and she was basically given a
pass on the

27:21.206 --> 27:25.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issues of substance that matter
to voters
where there's been a lot of
concern on her

27:25.377 --> 27:27.145 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
record.

27:27.179 --> 27:29.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me ask
you about
something she brought up, and
that was -- or

27:29.047 --> 27:32.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he was asked about by
Lester Holt, and
that was his income taxes.

27:32.818 --> 27:38.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton said the few
years that his
forms have been made public, he
didn't pay

27:38.223 --> 27:39.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
federal income tax.

27:39.958 --> 27:42.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And his answer was, "That makes
me smart."

27:42.661 --> 27:45.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think that's a good
message to send
to the American people?

27:45.931 --> 27:50.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: Well, first, I
think most Americans
are sitting back there saying, I
want his

27:50.035 --> 27:51.570 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
accountant.

27:51.603 --> 27:54.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, no one sits back to
try to figure
it out, how to pay more taxes.

27:54.806 --> 27:58.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We all pay a ton of taxes,
whether it's sales
taxes, utility taxes.

27:58.911 --> 28:01.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the fact of the matter is,
she was there
trying to get at him.

28:01.246 --> 28:05.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What she wanted to do was to
avoid and pivot
away from talking about the fact
that Donald

28:05.250 --> 28:09.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's taxes, no matter what he
pay, didn't
hurt anybody, didn't compromise
national security.

28:09.755 --> 28:13.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The secret server that she had
and the ability
that -- or the classified
information that

28:13.892 --> 28:17.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she took off of her secret
server and e-mailed
around potentially could have
threatened national

28:17.829 --> 28:18.797 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
security.

28:18.830 --> 28:20.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Other countries could have
gotten it.

28:20.566 --> 28:23.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she was doing everything she
could to
pivot away from having to talk
about her own

28:23.068 --> 28:24.269 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
record.

28:24.303 --> 28:27.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me ask
you about
something else.

28:27.072 --> 28:30.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Going into this et, the Trump
campaign was
saying that they -- among other
things, they

28:30.742 --> 28:35.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clearly wanted to add in, bring
in new voters,
minorities, women.

28:35.247 --> 28:40.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then you had this series of
comments about
what Donald Trump has said in
the past about

28:40.085 --> 28:41.887 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the former Miss Universe.

28:41.920 --> 28:43.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary Clinton raised it last
night.

28:43.722 --> 28:47.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She said Donald Trump had called
Alicia Machado
Miss Piggy.

28:48.026 --> 28:53.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Donald Trump spoke about
that and said
that Ms. Machado had -- quote --
"gained a

28:53.465 --> 28:57.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
massive amount of weight, and
that was a problem."

28:58.003 --> 29:01.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this something you think he
should be expanding
on, talking about?

29:01.707 --> 29:04.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: Well, look, I mean,
he didn't
bring this up.

29:04.910 --> 29:05.877 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
She did.

29:05.911 --> 29:06.878 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Lester Holt did.

29:06.912 --> 29:07.879 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
She did.

29:07.913 --> 29:09.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They went into this.

29:09.648 --> 29:11.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump, as you said, went
in talking
about how to make America great
again, how

29:11.683 --> 29:16.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to bring jobs, how to change the
regulatory
system to allow people to have
better lives

29:16.121 --> 29:20.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and make more money, how to
provide better
for their family, how to lift
all people up

29:20.125 --> 29:21.093 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in America.

29:21.126 --> 29:22.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, that's what he was doing
last night.

29:22.661 --> 29:25.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was talking about policies
and solutions
to make the country better.

29:25.697 --> 29:29.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was digging up 20-year-old
comments and
quotes out of context and
saying, this is

29:29.835 --> 29:31.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what's happening.

29:31.069 --> 29:32.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I mean, let's be honest
about who was
doing what.

29:32.838 --> 29:36.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was Hillary Clinton who
should have been
there talking about her record
as secretary

29:36.074 --> 29:39.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of state and two terms in the
Senate and 30
years in Washington.

29:39.211 --> 29:41.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead of doing that, she was
digging up
quotes.

29:41.113 --> 29:45.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have got to wonder, if you
have that kind
of a resume and that few of
accomplishments,

29:45.651 --> 29:47.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that really tells you where you
are in this
race.

29:47.853 --> 29:51.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump was the candidate
that was there
talking about solutions and
policies last

29:51.590 --> 29:53.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
night, not Hillary Clinton.

29:53.392 --> 29:58.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just quickly, he
said going
into this debate, really, in a
way, took pride

29:58.363 --> 30:01.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the fact that he didn't
prepare a great
deal.

30:01.199 --> 30:03.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think that's the right
approach for
the next debate?

30:03.602 --> 30:05.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: Well, first of all,
he didn't
say that.

30:05.904 --> 30:10.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He didn't prepare, in the sense
that -- in
the traditional sense of
standing at podiums

30:10.542 --> 30:12.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going back and forth, but he was
clearly preparing.

30:12.511 --> 30:16.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He spent a lot of time with
senior advisers
and economic advisers going over
key policies

30:16.782 --> 30:18.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and honing in stuff.

30:18.316 --> 30:20.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was largely successful at
that.

30:20.152 --> 30:24.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You look at the online polls
that came out,
the CNBC poll, the "TIME" poll
-- 1.4 million

30:24.890 --> 30:26.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people weighed in on the "TIME"
poll.

30:26.792 --> 30:27.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He was the clear winner.

30:28.026 --> 30:31.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The CNBC poll, almost a million
people all
favoring him.

30:31.329 --> 30:35.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We took in $14 million in the
past 24 hours,
mostly in low dollars.

30:35.834 --> 30:39.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What that tells you is that his
message of
change is resonating.

30:39.071 --> 30:44.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is what mostly matters
is, are people
hearing what he's saying and
want to be part

30:44.476 --> 30:46.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of this team and cast their vote
for him in
November?

30:46.845 --> 30:48.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think the evidence was
pretty clear.

30:48.447 --> 30:51.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we know
that online polls
are not necessarily scientific.

30:51.817 --> 30:54.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People can answer them multiple
times.

30:54.186 --> 30:57.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we hear what you're saying,
and we certainly
hear you say that you have
raised some money.

30:57.923 --> 30:59.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sean Spicer with the RNC, we
thank you.

30:59.991 --> 31:01.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: Thanks, Judy.

31:01.159 --> 31:04.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now we turn
to the Democrats.

31:04.529 --> 31:09.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining me is President Obama's
2008 campaign
manager and now Hillary Clinton
supporter

31:09.835 --> 31:10.836 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
David Plouffe.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
David, welcome back to the
program.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's your assessment of last
night?

31:14.773 --> 31:17.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID PLOUFFE, Former Senior
White House Adviser:
Well, I think the first debate
was probably

31:17.809 --> 31:20.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the most important moment for
the rest of
the campaign.

31:20.078 --> 31:23.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think Hillary Clinton
seized that moment.

31:23.048 --> 31:26.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump -- I think Donald
Trump had a
good first 10 or 15 minutes, and
then he kind

31:26.618 --> 31:28.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of lost his way and became
unhinged.

31:28.620 --> 31:32.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I believe Hillary Clinton's
got an edge
in the race, so, given that, the
fact that

31:32.390 --> 31:34.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump squandered the
moment.

31:34.259 --> 31:35.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it wasn't just that he
performed badly.

31:35.627 --> 31:37.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hey, we had a bad debate in
2012, the first
one.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I have been through both
good and bad.

31:40.332 --> 31:43.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we were in the lead, and
Barack Obama
just had a bad performance.

31:43.335 --> 31:45.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He didn't have a lot of bad
moments.

31:45.070 --> 31:50.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump saying he was smart
not to pay
taxes, really bragging about the
fact that

31:50.876 --> 31:55.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he exploited loopholes not to
pay his contractors,
taking advantage of the housing
crisis, and

31:55.313 --> 31:59.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then I think this Alicia Machado
incident
that he doubled down on today is
going to

31:59.451 --> 32:00.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
live on in the campaign.

32:00.652 --> 32:02.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's not just that he had a
bad night
last night.

32:02.554 --> 32:04.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think he's going to have bad
few days here.

32:04.389 --> 32:08.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, at the same
time, he
did continue the argument that
he's the change

32:08.293 --> 32:11.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the country needs and that
politicians like
Hillary Clinton, who he said
have been in

32:11.830 --> 32:17.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
office 30, 35 years, have messed
things up
and the country needs somebody
new.

32:17.035 --> 32:19.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Did she have a good answer for
that, do you
think?

32:19.805 --> 32:21.740 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID PLOUFFE: I think she did.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm sure that will come up
again in Saint
Louis.

32:23.708 --> 32:28.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I will leave it to Hillary
Clinton to
show how she's going to advance
that ball.

32:28.413 --> 32:32.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think part of it is, OK,
Donald Trump
is change, but he's dangerous
change.

32:32.717 --> 32:34.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, listen, I worked in the
White House,
Judy.

32:34.519 --> 32:37.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I obviously support Hillary
Clinton, but I
can't fathom someone of that
temperament and

32:37.956 --> 32:39.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that decision-making and what we
saw last
night.

32:39.691 --> 32:46.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, we have never seen a
major party nominee
be so substance-less, be
confused.

32:46.498 --> 32:52.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, I mean, Mitt Romney,
John McCain,
John Kerry, Al Gore, these were
serious people.

32:52.404 --> 32:55.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, again, I think that's
going to be
a difference in this race.

32:55.473 --> 32:57.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think he has a ceiling.

32:57.375 --> 33:01.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have always thought his
ceiling on his vote
was quite a bit lower than
Hillary Clinton's.

33:01.379 --> 33:04.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think she's got more vote to
gain of what's
left out there.

33:04.182 --> 33:06.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I really don't -- I don't
think he lost
any votes last night.

33:06.518 --> 33:09.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm sure Trump partisans
loved what he
had to say.

33:09.321 --> 33:10.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But I don't think he added.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think he's in a position
in this race
where he needs to add quite a
bit.

33:12.958 --> 33:15.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Hillary
Clinton is getting
some good reviews.

33:15.360 --> 33:20.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But even some Democratic
commentators are
saying she didn't have the best
answer on

33:20.999 --> 33:26.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some of the issues that resonate
most with
voters, like jobs that are
leaving this country

33:26.104 --> 33:33.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to go elsewhere because of
trade, like the
TPP, the Trans-Pacific
Partnership, like NAFTA.

33:33.378 --> 33:37.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What else could she have said,
do you think,
to improve her answer on that?

33:37.482 --> 33:40.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID PLOUFFE: Well, what she
spoke was the
truth.

33:40.518 --> 33:43.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, she said there are some
trade deals she
supports, and here's the
criteria.

33:43.955 --> 33:50.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there's no doubt that Trump
has used trade
to gain some support.

33:50.562 --> 33:53.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think he's probably gotten all
he's going
to get from that issue.

33:53.431 --> 33:57.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I'm sure we will talk about
this in Saint
Louis with him.

33:57.369 --> 34:01.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think she's got to say,
A, here's
my view on trade, and, B, what I
think she

34:01.539 --> 34:06.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did do a good job of is saying
Trump's ideas
on taxes, on the economy would
actually cost

34:06.811 --> 34:08.813 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
us millions of jobs and blow up
the deficit.

34:08.847 --> 34:11.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, he's not offering
anything new.

34:11.216 --> 34:13.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it's worse than what Romney
was offering.

34:13.585 --> 34:15.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's worse than what McCain was
offering.

34:15.453 --> 34:17.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we had great success on both
of those
things.

34:17.455 --> 34:21.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You also hear,
David Plouffe,
you also hear Democrats saying
that they wish

34:21.493 --> 34:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she had a crisp answer on why
she should be
elected president, that she
often tends to

34:28.333 --> 34:34.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say when asked about one issue
or another,
she gives a number of items in a
list, and

34:34.839 --> 34:37.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she will say, this is my plan or
this is my
platform.

34:37.742 --> 34:39.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you think that's a challenge
for her?

34:39.744 --> 34:42.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID PLOUFFE: Well, I spoke
about this before
the debate.

34:42.747 --> 34:47.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what I would like to see
more of,
for sure, is no one doubts her
head.

34:47.786 --> 34:51.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People might not agree with
everything she's
got, but she's got a great grasp
of politics

34:51.056 --> 34:55.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- to, really, from the heart
and from the
gut, talk about why she's
running, why this

34:55.427 --> 34:59.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
race, why her at this moment,
and on whose
behalf.

34:59.264 --> 35:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the town hall debate is a
great place,
obviously, because you're having
a conversation

35:02.634 --> 35:04.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with your fellow citizens to do
that.

35:04.436 --> 35:07.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, yes, I think the moments
where she has
talked about those types of
things, that she

35:07.706 --> 35:10.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't want anybody to have to
struggles
that her mom did.

35:10.108 --> 35:13.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, I think she talked very
passionately
about her father and the lessons
she learned

35:13.645 --> 35:14.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
there last night.

35:14.646 --> 35:16.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That was effective.

35:16.381 --> 35:18.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The more we see of that, I think
the better
off these next five-and-a-half
weeks will

35:18.116 --> 35:19.918 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
be.

35:19.951 --> 35:22.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You started out,
David Plouffe,
by saying you thought this first
debate would

35:22.087 --> 35:23.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be the most watched.

35:23.955 --> 35:28.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are you saying we really aren't
going to have
any more sort of pivotal moments
in this campaign

35:28.727 --> 35:30.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the next six weeks?

35:30.161 --> 35:32.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID PLOUFFE: Well, so, here's
what I would
say.

35:32.630 --> 35:36.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are two more pivotal
moments we know
about, the two presidential --
the V.P. debate

35:36.735 --> 35:40.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is important, but it's rarely
been something
that really moves the ball.

35:40.372 --> 35:43.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's important, and I'm sure
Tim Kaine
will do a good job, and Pence
will try and

35:43.041 --> 35:44.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
do a good job for Trump.

35:44.876 --> 35:48.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The two presidential campaigns,
the campaign
itself, meaning, you know, where
the candidates

35:48.546 --> 35:51.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are going, are they turning out
the right
kind of vote, are they
persuading voters,

35:51.783 --> 35:54.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what kind of ground operation,
and then obviously
the unforeseen event.

35:54.652 --> 35:58.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think, unlike '12, when we
lost the
first debate, we were in the
lead.

35:58.790 --> 36:01.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that's a difference, because
I think Clinton
is in the lead.

36:01.593 --> 36:04.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, again, secondly, I don't
think Obama
-- it was just a bad
performance.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We prepared him poorly.

36:06.064 --> 36:07.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He didn't perform well.

36:07.265 --> 36:08.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Romney performed well.

36:08.500 --> 36:09.801 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But there was no one moment.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was just a bad, flat
performance.

36:11.569 --> 36:14.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think that Trump lost a
big opportunity
last night.

36:14.773 --> 36:16.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The TV ratings were over 80
million.

36:16.808 --> 36:21.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
My suspicion is, if you
aggregate everyone
who watched it together with
people in homes,

36:21.946 --> 36:25.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at bars, on their phones, it's
goings to be
close to 100.

36:25.250 --> 36:26.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, I don't know.

36:26.251 --> 36:28.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Maybe the next one.

36:28.086 --> 36:33.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump may be must-see TV, and
the next two
will be important, but he has
got to really,

36:33.224 --> 36:37.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really dominate the next two
debates in a
way that swing voters say, OK,
Trump is now

36:37.729 --> 36:39.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the one I'm leaning towards.

36:39.397 --> 36:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just -- I don't think he's
got that
in him, by the way.

36:42.233 --> 36:44.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't see a president when I
look at Donald
Trump.

36:44.569 --> 36:45.537 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But we will see.

36:45.570 --> 36:49.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Plouffe, we
thank you.

36:49.140 --> 36:57.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID PLOUFFE: Thanks, Judy.

36:57.615 --> 37:02.620 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

37:02.654 --> 37:10.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
personal view
on the struggles of white
working-class Americans.

37:10.462 --> 37:16.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: At a time when public
schools across
the country are cutting the arts
out of education,

37:16.067 --> 37:21.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a jazz musician in Boston is
finding a way
to push through the noise.

37:21.339 --> 37:25.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lisa Stark of our partners at
Education Week
has this report.

37:25.276 --> 37:30.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's for our weekly education
series, Making
the Grade.

37:30.682 --> 37:39.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Myran Parker-Brass
began singing
at age 5.

37:39.491 --> 37:43.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She's never stopped.

37:43.628 --> 37:51.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A classically trained
mezzo-soprano, she's
now raising her voice to push
arts education

37:51.936 --> 37:53.771 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in Boston's public schools.

37:53.805 --> 37:58.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MYRAN PARKER-BRASS, Arts
Activist: Finding
the opportunity to teach, as
well as to perform,

37:58.409 --> 38:02.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has always been what keeps me
sane, I think.

38:02.247 --> 38:08.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Parker-Brass is the
district's
arts director, a job she jumped
into five

38:08.620 --> 38:11.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years ago after two decades with
the Boston
Symphony.

38:11.956 --> 38:16.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A one-time public schoolteacher
herself, she
had an ambitious plan.

38:16.828 --> 38:24.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MYRAN PARKER-BRASS: Our goal is
that we will
have 100 percent of our students
in K-8 receiving

38:24.202 --> 38:25.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at least weekly arts education.

38:25.737 --> 38:27.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA STARK: They're almost
there.

38:27.805 --> 38:33.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2009, less than 70 percent of
elementary
and middle school students had a
regular arts

38:33.745 --> 38:34.712 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
class.

38:34.746 --> 38:38.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Today, over 90 percent do.

38:38.216 --> 38:40.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHILDREN: She was right behind
us, wasn't
she?

38:40.718 --> 38:47.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Taking theater,
dance, music and
visual art at least once a week.

38:47.992 --> 38:52.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the percentage of high
school students
taking art classes has nearly
tripled.

38:52.197 --> 38:57.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALLYSSA JONES, Boston Public
Schools: It's
been a huge, huge change.

38:57.902 --> 39:01.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Allyssa Jones, who
oversees the
district's performing arts
program, was a

39:01.873 --> 39:07.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
music teacher when Parker-Brass
came on board
and began ramping up the arts
programs.

39:07.178 --> 39:11.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALLYSSA JONES: What a parade,
man, what a
parade.

39:11.115 --> 39:15.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What a battle to win.

39:15.453 --> 39:17.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Changing minds is pretty
awesome.

39:17.889 --> 39:22.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Changing minds about
the value
of arts education.

39:22.093 --> 39:26.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MYRAN PARKER-BRASS: Learning and
working in
the arts provide students the
opportunity

39:26.898 --> 39:35.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to be creative, to be
innovative, to be reflective,
to learn how to work as a team.

39:35.506 --> 39:40.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: And it's not just
students who
are harmonizing.

39:40.044 --> 39:46.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parker-Brass built a team to
support her arts
teachers, and she fine-tuned
outside partnerships

39:46.951 --> 39:50.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
already in place.

39:50.922 --> 39:55.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These high school students, for
example, explore
art with the help of the
Massachusetts College

39:55.460 --> 40:00.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Art and Design, but the
lynchpin of the
turnaround, increased funding.

40:00.898 --> 40:07.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under Parker-Brass, Boston
increased its arts
spending by more than 50
percent, from $17

40:08.006 --> 40:13.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
million to $26 million, and
added millions
more in outside grant funding,
allowing the

40:13.911 --> 40:18.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
district to double the number of
full-time
art teachers.

40:18.449 --> 40:21.219 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
The result?

40:21.252 --> 40:32.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An additional 14,000 students in
Boston now
receive instruction during the
school week.

40:32.930 --> 40:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Parker-Brass isn't ready to take
a bow.

40:35.533 --> 40:40.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's too busy with her next
push, trying
to convince Massachusetts state
universities

40:40.638 --> 40:46.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to change their admission
requirements to
include not just academics, but
a high school

40:46.544 --> 40:48.313 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
arts class.

40:48.346 --> 40:51.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MYRAN PARKER-BRASS: I think our
job is to
make sure that our students see
art, understand

40:51.816 --> 40:57.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
art, appreciate it, and, it is
-- and if they
are passionate enough, create
it.

40:57.422 --> 41:06.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: I'm Lisa Stark of
Education Week,
reporting for the "PBS
NewsHour."

41:06.931 --> 41:18.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, in this
topsy-turvy election
year, we have a timely portrait
of Americans

41:18.276 --> 41:23.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are often ignored and
misunderstood, depicted
as only an insider could.

41:23.348 --> 41:28.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the first in an occasional
series on
books this election season we're
calling Political

41:28.686 --> 41:29.654 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Ink.

41:29.687 --> 41:32.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
J.D. Vance, welcome to the
"NewsHour."

41:32.457 --> 41:39.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This book is many things,
"Hillbilly Elegy,"
but I think, amongst all else,
it's a personal

41:39.297 --> 41:41.099 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
story.

41:41.132 --> 41:43.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's about growing up in
Appalachia under
what I think what everybody
would agree difficult

41:43.868 --> 41:49.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
circumstances, raised by your
grandparents,
father who wasn't there, mother
had an addiction.

41:49.374 --> 41:53.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, for most people, hard
to write about
these things, but not hard for
you?

41:53.878 --> 41:55.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
J.D. VANCE, Author, "Hillbilly
Elegy: A Memoir
of a Family and Culture in
Crisis": No, it

41:55.446 --> 41:57.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was definitely hard.

41:57.382 --> 42:01.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I definitely struggled allotted
with the intrusion
and just being so open about my
personal history

42:01.586 --> 42:03.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and my family history.

42:03.388 --> 42:06.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I decided that, ultimately,
it was worth
it because I felt that a lot of
these issues

42:06.290 --> 42:07.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
needed to be talked about.

42:07.291 --> 42:09.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They needed to be talked about
openly.

42:09.227 --> 42:12.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I couldn't think of a better
way to do
it than just be really honest
about my own

42:12.363 --> 42:16.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
failings and my family's
failings, because
sometimes honesty is just the
best policy,

42:17.001 --> 42:18.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and that starts with me.

42:18.870 --> 42:26.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you do
write very candidly
about a rough-around-the-edges
lifestyle,

42:26.310 --> 42:30.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
both in Kentucky and then when
your family
moved to Southern Ohio.

42:30.081 --> 42:35.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's rough around the edges, but
it's a life
you love and a life you honor.

42:35.286 --> 42:36.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
J.D. VANCE: Yes, absolutely.

42:36.854 --> 42:40.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are good and bad parts of
this community
and of my own family, of course.

42:40.425 --> 42:46.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I try to be very frank about
the problems,
but also very compassionate, and
also explain

42:46.297 --> 42:50.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why so many of these people were
so good to
me and so important in my life,
and, frankly,

42:50.668 --> 42:53.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why I wouldn't have had the
opportunities
I have right now if it weren't
for them.

42:53.704 --> 42:59.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At the same time,
as you grow
older, as you finish school, you
joined the

42:59.610 --> 43:05.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marines and your life changed,
you began to
be more critical of some of
these people,

43:05.683 --> 43:11.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of their lifestyle, not of the
individuals,
but of what you were seeing.

43:11.355 --> 43:12.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And what did you find?

43:12.790 --> 43:15.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What did you grow to see that
you didn't see
when you were younger?

43:15.293 --> 43:19.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
J.D. VANCE: Well, I started to
see that a
lot of the reason that we don't
have the level

43:19.163 --> 43:24.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of upward mobility, why there
aren't more
kids like me at places like Yale
Law School

43:24.168 --> 43:26.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- that's really the question I
was trying
to answer in writing the book.

43:27.004 --> 43:30.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it occurred to me that there
are things
happening in our community, from
the addiction

43:30.842 --> 43:34.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crisis, to family breakdown, to
also the economic
problems that exist in the
community.

43:34.979 --> 43:38.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And all of these sort of
conspired against
a lot of our youth.

43:38.349 --> 43:42.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you make it
clear the blame
can be spread all around.

43:42.520 --> 43:46.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You point out the social
programs that haven't
helped.

43:46.123 --> 43:47.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You talk about the individuals
themselves...

43:48.025 --> 43:48.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
J.D. VANCE: Sure.

43:49.026 --> 43:50.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... who are part
of the issue.

43:50.361 --> 43:52.163 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
J.D. VANCE: Yes, absolutely.

43:52.196 --> 43:56.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The thing I try to really hammer
home in the
book is that this is a sort of
all-of-the-above

43:56.400 --> 43:57.502 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
type of problem.

43:57.535 --> 43:59.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not just that government
has failed us.

43:59.470 --> 44:01.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not just that we have
failed ourselves.

44:01.739 --> 44:02.773 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's government.

44:02.807 --> 44:04.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's individuals.

44:04.709 --> 44:07.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's sort of everything in
between, from families
and communities and
neighborhoods, churches

44:07.945 --> 44:09.413 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and so forth.

44:09.447 --> 44:12.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's the sort of problem
that I think
can't be solved super easily.

44:12.683 --> 44:16.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and, as you
say, you
make it clear that the rest of
us, the rest

44:16.053 --> 44:22.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the country, is partly to
blame for what's
happened to white working-class
Americans.

44:22.393 --> 44:25.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You don't see a solution, but
what should
we be doing differently?

44:25.696 --> 44:29.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
J.D. VANCE: Yes, I think that we
should be
understanding these communities
and taking

44:29.567 --> 44:31.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these communities as they
actually are.

44:31.435 --> 44:35.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we might ask, for example,
how do we make
it a little bit easier for
low-income parents

44:35.706 --> 44:38.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to interact better with their
children, to
interact better with their
partners?

44:38.910 --> 44:40.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's just one idea.

44:40.745 --> 44:44.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, hopefully, folks who pick
up the book
will take away from it a sense
that this social

44:44.649 --> 44:49.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crisis in white working-class
communities
is pretty complicated, but it's
not totally

44:49.153 --> 44:51.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
immune to public policy
solutions.

44:51.355 --> 44:53.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are things that we might
do as a broader
society.

44:53.958 --> 45:01.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You spell out so
much of the
gap between educated America,
well-to-do,

45:01.299 --> 45:05.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well-off, middle-income America,
and the life
that you grew up in.

45:05.703 --> 45:07.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why is that gap getting bigger?

45:07.738 --> 45:11.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
J.D. VANCE: Well, I think part
of it is that
we don't spend a whole lot of
time around

45:11.709 --> 45:13.411 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
each other.

45:13.444 --> 45:15.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it was really striking to me
the sense
of culture alienation I had when
I started

45:16.013 --> 45:17.782 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
law school.

45:17.815 --> 45:19.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was clear to me that I had
never really
spent that much time around
these people,

45:19.617 --> 45:23.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and these people had never
really spent that
much time in a neighborhood that
I grew up

45:23.254 --> 45:25.022 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
around.

45:25.056 --> 45:28.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when you're so disconnected
geographically,
even if you live in the same
maybe region

45:28.292 --> 45:33.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the country, it's hard to
really understand
how the other thinks, what the
attitudes of

45:33.297 --> 45:35.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
other groups of people are.

45:35.132 --> 45:38.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I think it's
pretty clear in
this year a lot of people have
looked to you

45:38.169 --> 45:41.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to explain frankly much of the
Donald Trump
vote.

45:41.272 --> 45:43.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
J.D. VANCE: Sure.

45:43.140 --> 45:48.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: White
working-class Americans,
is that really who you're
talking about here?

45:48.980 --> 45:51.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And how do you explain the
attraction of Donald
Trump?

45:51.248 --> 45:54.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
J.D. VANCE: I think it's a very
complicated
phenomenon.

45:54.285 --> 45:57.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's difficult to understand why
so many of
these folks have been attracted
to Donald

45:57.788 --> 45:58.923 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

45:58.956 --> 46:00.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But a big part of it is the way
that he conducts
himself.

46:00.625 --> 46:05.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's relatable in a way that you
might talk
about politics around the dinner
table.

46:05.863 --> 46:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's something that people see
in Donald
Trump that maybe they see a
little bit in

46:09.100 --> 46:10.768 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
themselves.

46:10.801 --> 46:13.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's also a sense that
people just
feel ignored by the political
class.

46:13.070 --> 46:16.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They feel like their communities
have really
been struggling in a lot of
different ways

46:16.607 --> 46:19.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for 20 or 30 years, and nobody
has really
cared.

46:19.210 --> 46:23.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Trump is the first person to
at least
see these communities, even if
you think,

46:23.180 --> 46:24.982 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as I do, that he doesn't have
all the solutions.

46:25.016 --> 46:29.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You said many of
the Americans
you know so well don't trust --
not only do

46:29.320 --> 46:30.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they not trust politicians.

46:30.454 --> 46:32.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They don't trust the news media.

46:32.556 --> 46:38.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You quote somebody you know as
saying the
free press, to them, is full of
-- I'm not

46:38.896 --> 46:39.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going to say the word.

46:39.897 --> 46:41.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:41.799 --> 46:46.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you do
describe a gap here,
people with information, with
education, and

46:46.070 --> 46:49.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those with less information and
less education.

46:49.640 --> 46:51.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you see that?

46:51.509 --> 46:54.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
J.D. VANCE: Well, I think that
the sense of
cultural alienation breeds a
sense of mistrust

46:54.645 --> 46:57.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of everything that is perceived
to be of the
elite.

46:57.048 --> 47:00.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you ultimately don't trust
the people
who seem to have information,
power, and control

47:00.951 --> 47:02.787 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
over the news.

47:02.820 --> 47:06.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I also think, frankly, the
conservative
media -- and I say this as a
right-wing person

47:06.724 --> 47:09.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- we have got to do a better
job of engaging
with voters.

47:09.894 --> 47:14.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I write that some of the ways
that we talk
about the news media, the way
that conservative

47:14.265 --> 47:17.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
media talks about the president,
it foments
this sense of alienation.

47:17.768 --> 47:22.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what a lot of the folks in
the white working
class really need right now is
something that

47:22.039 --> 47:26.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
encourages them to reintegrate
with their
communities, not to further
self-segregate.

47:26.110 --> 47:32.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, like everything, it's the
sort of situation
where all of us have a role to
play.

47:32.149 --> 47:34.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I certainly put my side in
part of that.

47:34.351 --> 47:39.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We have been
paying attention
to something Hillary Clinton
said in describing

47:39.523 --> 47:40.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Donald Trump's followers.

47:40.524 --> 47:43.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She called them a basket of
deplorables.

47:43.761 --> 47:47.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there something to what she
said, or is
she completely off-base?

47:47.798 --> 47:50.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
J.D. VANCE: Well, I think it's
probably both.

47:50.434 --> 47:53.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are definitely -- there is
definitely
an element of Donald Trump's
support that

47:53.838 --> 47:56.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has its basis in racism or
xenophobia.

47:56.941 --> 48:01.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a lot of these folks are
just really hardworking
people who are struggling in
really important

48:01.078 --> 48:02.913 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ways.

48:02.947 --> 48:06.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the way that I think about
is that folks
can be led by political leaders
in one direction

48:06.617 --> 48:07.585 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or another.

48:07.618 --> 48:09.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They can be pushed or pulled.

48:09.487 --> 48:12.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when Hillary Clinton says
something like
that, it strikes me that she's
pushing people

48:12.323 --> 48:15.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
away from what she wants them to
get out of
her message.

48:15.459 --> 48:20.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you think, as I do, that
Donald Trump
doesn't necessarily have a good
message either,

48:20.531 --> 48:22.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's maybe not the best
approach to politics.

48:22.299 --> 48:24.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not how you win these folks
over.

48:24.068 --> 48:27.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you're worried about them
being racist
now, when you push them away and
push them

48:27.772 --> 48:30.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to somebody like Trump, you're
only going
to make the problem worse.

48:30.307 --> 48:32.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what is the
way to win
them over?

48:32.109 --> 48:35.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
J.D. VANCE: Well, I think the
first step,
as Trump has sort of shed some
light on, is

48:35.846 --> 48:39.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just to recognize the nature of
the problem,
to recognize that these
communities are really

48:39.917 --> 48:41.585 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
struggling.

48:41.619 --> 48:45.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my hope is that, after 2016,
after we
have all survived this election
season, that

48:45.923 --> 48:48.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people are thinking a little bit
more constructively
about how to help.

48:48.592 --> 48:52.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're not just diagnosing the
problem and
then saying, well, let's build a
Mexican border

48:52.563 --> 48:54.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wall to fix everything.

48:54.431 --> 48:57.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe they're diagnosing the
problem and thinking
a little bit more constructively
about the

48:57.201 --> 48:59.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
best way forward.

48:59.069 --> 49:04.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: J.D. Vance, the
book is "Hillbilly
Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and
Culture in

49:04.642 --> 49:05.609 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Crisis."

49:05.643 --> 49:06.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is a great read.

49:06.644 --> 49:08.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

49:08.712 --> 49:15.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
J.D. VANCE: Thank you.

49:15.920 --> 49:21.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Time for a
"NewsHour" Essay.

49:21.525 --> 49:27.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last month, a column by Tracy
Grant, The Washington
Post newspaper's deputy managing
editor, really

49:27.765 --> 49:29.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
moved members of our staff.

49:29.333 --> 49:31.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We asked her to expand on her
idea with us.

49:31.769 --> 49:37.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACY GRANT, The Washington
Post: Ten years
ago, my world as I knew it
ended.

49:37.441 --> 49:44.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My husband of 19 years, the
father of my two
sons, was diagnosed with
terminal cancer.

49:44.481 --> 49:48.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over the course of seven months,
Bill went
from beating me silly on the
tennis court

49:48.919 --> 49:52.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to needing my help to go to the
bathroom and
bathe.

49:52.389 --> 49:55.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was the best seven months of
my life.

49:55.993 --> 50:01.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I realize how that sounds, but I
was 42 when
my husband was diagnosed.

50:01.398 --> 50:07.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had a great job, two terrific
kids, but
I had yet to discover the reason
I was put

50:07.171 --> 50:09.306 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on this Earth.

50:09.340 --> 50:14.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During those seven months, I
came to understand
that, whatever else I did in my
life, nothing

50:15.012 --> 50:18.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
would matter more than this.

50:18.415 --> 50:22.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the early days after Bill's
diagnosis,
being a caregiver caused me to
be the best

50:22.853 --> 50:25.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reporter I knew how to be.

50:25.089 --> 50:28.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a heavy sense that I
could out-MacGyver
the disease.

50:28.559 --> 50:34.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was relentless in making
doctors and insurance
companies answer my questions.

50:34.164 --> 50:37.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I had been a good reporter
before.

50:37.167 --> 50:41.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here's what changed: There were
no bad days.

50:41.705 --> 50:48.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The petty day-in/day-out
grievances of an
irksome co-worker or a flat
tired paled in

50:48.145 --> 50:52.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
comparison to the joy of
spontaneous laughter
or the night sky.

50:52.816 --> 51:00.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I found I could train myself to
see more beauty
than bother, to set my internal
barometer

51:00.090 --> 51:04.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be more compassionate than
callous.

51:04.428 --> 51:09.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During Bill's last weekend, we
sat side by
side on his hospital bed,
sharing a sandwich

51:09.800 --> 51:12.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and watching television.

51:12.236 --> 51:14.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was our last moment as us.

51:14.872 --> 51:20.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I thought to myself, I could
live with
this man, even as compromised as
he is, for

51:20.978 --> 51:27.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the next 40 years, not because I
was a saint,
but because I had learned to
focus on the

51:27.785 --> 51:31.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
essence of Bill and our
relationship.

51:31.455 --> 51:37.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What seven months earlier would
have seemed
to be unspeakably less was just
right.

51:37.695 --> 51:44.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I now realize that I may never
be as good
a person as I was when I cared
for Bill, but

51:44.234 --> 51:47.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the best version of myself
didn't die with
him.

51:47.438 --> 51:52.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have fought hard not to lose
the perspective
his illness gave me.

51:52.676 --> 51:57.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the worst things that can
happen to
anyone has already happened to
me.

51:57.047 --> 52:00.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, what else is there to be
afraid of?

52:00.517 --> 52:06.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has been liberating in a way
that has made
me a better mother, a better
friend, a better

52:06.657 --> 52:08.459 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
colleague.

52:08.492 --> 52:14.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm quicker to say I'm sorry,
and I don't
need to be right all the time.

52:14.198 --> 52:19.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am a better person for having

caregiver.

It was his last, best gift to
me.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to our
"NewsHour" Shares.

52:22.106 --> 52:23.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, the Miami Marlins
baseball team
paid tribute to 24-year-old Jose
Fernandez,

52:23.607 --> 52:29.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the talented young pitcher who
died in a boating
accident this weekend.

52:29.580 --> 52:31.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has more.

52:31.615 --> 52:34.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNOUNCER: Our community, the
baseball world
and the Miami Marlins suffered a
tragic loss

52:34.852 --> 52:36.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
yesterday with the passing of
Jose Fernandez.

52:36.754 --> 52:37.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our hearts are heavy with sorry
as we gather
today, together tonight, as a
family to remember

52:37.921 --> 52:39.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a man and a teammate who meant
so much to
all of us.

52:39.690 --> 52:41.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Jose Fernandez
had been
scheduled to start in last
night's game against

52:41.492 --> 52:42.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the New York Mets, but, instead,
the stadium
took a moment of silence and
then a poignant

52:42.459 --> 52:44.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rendition of "Take Me Out to the
Ball Game."

52:44.194 --> 52:45.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fernandez, who had defected from
Cuba when
he was just 15, was wildly
popular in Miami

52:45.329 --> 52:47.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a former National League
Rookie of the
Year.

52:47.164 --> 52:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the pregame ceremony closed,
the Marlins,
each wearing a jersey with
Fernandez's name,

52:49.066 --> 52:50.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
gathered to inscribe the
two-time All-Star's
name on the pitcher's mound
bearing his number.

52:50.267 --> 52:52.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And emotions ran high even as
the game got
under way.

52:52.036 --> 52:52.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Teammate and leadoff hitter Dee
Gordon wore
Fernandez's helmet, stepped to
the plate,

52:52.870 --> 52:53.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and hit the ball out of the
park.

52:53.737 --> 52:55.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was his first homer of the
season.

52:55.406 --> 52:56.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gordon said he had never hit a
ball that far
before, even in batting
practice.

52:56.106 --> 52:57.908 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Marlins went on to win 7-3.

52:57.941 --> 52:59.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in victory, they again
honored Fernandez,
each kneeling to place their
caps and the

52:59.276 --> 53:01.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
game ball on the mound where
their former
ace had once stood.

53:01.245 --> 53:01.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Marlins plan to retire
Fernandez's number,
16, the first number ever
retired in the club's

53:01.545 --> 53:02.813 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
history.

53:02.846 --> 53:03.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the perfect
way to remember
Jose Fernandez.

53:03.714 --> 53:04.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:04.214 --> 53:08.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.
