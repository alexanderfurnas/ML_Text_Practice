04:09.148 --> 04:10.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAY, I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED BY MY

04:10.416 --> 04:12.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OWN COMMENTS HERE.

04:12.051 --> 04:14.053 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE THEY, ON THE ONE HAND, A

04:14.053 --> 04:15.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FUNDER OF TERRORISM AT THE

04:15.421 --> 04:16.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIGHEST LEVELS, AS THE PRESIDENT

04:16.723 --> 04:18.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID, OR ARE WE SELLING THEM

04:18.958 --> 04:20.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIGHTER JETS?

04:20.193 --> 04:20.994 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I MEAN, IT'S A VERY

04:20.994 --> 04:24.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPLICATED SITUATION FOR SURE.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU HAVE THE AL-UDEIED AIRBASE,

04:25.665 --> 04:28.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH IS THE MAIN STAGING GROUND

04:28.201 --> 04:30.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR U.S. AIRSTRIKES AGAINST

04:30.803 --> 04:33.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISLAMIC STATE IN SYRIA AND IRAQ.

04:33.006 --> 04:35.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU HAVE HUGE EXXON BUSINESS

04:35.875 --> 04:37.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERESTS IN QATAR.

04:37.176 --> 04:38.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU'VE HAD A LOT OF

04:38.111 --> 04:40.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTERTERRORISM COOPERATION.

04:40.013 --> 04:41.547 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THERE HAS

04:41.547 --> 04:44.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN CONCERN GOING BACK YEARS

04:44.784 --> 04:46.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THERE IS MONEY COMING FROM

04:46.986 --> 04:49.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QATAR THAT HAS REACHED AL QAEDA

04:49.222 --> 04:50.590 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELEMENTS; THAT SINCE THE ARAB

04:50.590 --> 04:51.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPRING, THEY'VE SUPPORTED

04:51.891 --> 04:54.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACTIONS THAT ARE ALIGNED WITH

04:54.794 --> 04:55.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AL QAEDA ELEMENTS.

04:55.895 --> 04:57.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND EVEN BACK TO THE BUSH

04:57.664 --> 04:59.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION, A LOT OF CONCERN

04:59.165 --> 05:02.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT AL JAZEERA, ITS MAIN SOURCE

05:02.035 --> 05:05.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF SOFT POWER, STIRS UP ANTI-

05:05.338 --> 05:07.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICAN SENTIMENT AT TIMES, OR

05:07.774 --> 05:09.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STIRS UP SENTIMENT AGAINST

05:09.309 --> 05:11.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QATAR'S NEIGHBORS IN SAUDI

05:11.744 --> 05:13.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARABIA AND THE U.A.E.

05:13.012 --> 05:15.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT'S VERY MUCH A CONFLICTED

05:15.315 --> 05:15.982 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PICTURE.

05:15.982 --> 05:16.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: SO THIS WEEK,

05:16.683 --> 05:19.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT SEEMS THOSE CONVERSATIONS

05:19.352 --> 05:21.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE MOVED TO WASHINGTON, D.C.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.455 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SIDES ARE LOBBYING.

05:22.455 --> 05:23.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> OH, IT'S AMAZING.

05:23.189 --> 05:24.857 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERY ONE OF THESE GOVERNMENTS--

05:24.857 --> 05:26.359 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAUDI ARABIA, THE U.A.E.,

05:26.359 --> 05:28.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QATAR-- HAVE FLOODED THE ZONE,

05:28.227 --> 05:30.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS SOME SAY, INTO WASHINGTON TO

05:30.930 --> 05:32.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEET SECRETARY TILLERSON,

05:32.332 --> 05:34.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECRETARY MATTIS, MEET PRASAD.

05:34.767 --> 05:36.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THESE COUNTRIES HAVE SO MUCH

05:36.569 --> 05:38.771 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFLUENCE IN WASHINGTON THROUGH

05:38.771 --> 05:40.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INVESTMENTS AND THINK TANKS,

05:40.273 --> 05:41.974 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGH LOBBYING FIRMS, JUST

05:41.974 --> 05:43.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGH THEIR BUSINESS AND

05:43.376 --> 05:45.044 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEFENSE CONTRACTS, THAT IT'S--

05:45.044 --> 05:47.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S A VERY MUCH A CONFLICT

05:47.246 --> 05:48.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S PLAYING OUT HERE, AS MUCH

05:48.481 --> 05:50.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS IT IS IN THE GULF.

05:50.516 --> 05:53.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND EACH SIDE HAS REAL EQUITIES

05:53.319 --> 05:54.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY BRING, AND I THINK

05:54.354 --> 05:56.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S PART OF THE REASON YOU'VE

05:56.189 --> 05:58.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEN SUCH MIXED MESSAGES FROM

05:58.091 --> 05:59.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

05:59.459 --> 06:01.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I ALSO THINK THEY'RE HERE

06:01.294 --> 06:02.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW

06:02.261 --> 06:03.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXACTLY WHAT THE TRUMP POSITION

06:03.996 --> 06:05.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS BECAUSE HE'S SAID THINGS THAT

06:05.832 --> 06:07.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THE SURFACE APPEAR AT ODDS

06:07.467 --> 06:09.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH HIS SECRETARY OF STATE AND

06:09.235 --> 06:10.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS DEFENSE SECRETARY.

06:10.436 --> 06:11.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: SO THE

06:11.337 --> 06:13.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECRETARY OF STATE HAS TRIED TO

06:13.339 --> 06:14.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KIND OF CALM THE TEMPERATURE

06:14.273 --> 06:14.974 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOWN.

06:14.974 --> 06:16.676 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THEN THE PRESIDENT SAYS WHAT

06:16.676 --> 06:17.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE SAYS.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SECRETARY TILLERSON HAS BEEN

06:18.511 --> 06:20.613 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORKING THE PHONES AGGRESSIVELY

06:20.613 --> 06:22.482 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVER THE PAST WEEK AND MEETING

06:22.482 --> 06:23.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH FOREIGN MINISTERS FROM

06:23.416 --> 06:25.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE COUNTRIES, BASICALLY

06:25.318 --> 06:27.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAYING THIS ECONOMIC SIEGE THAT

06:27.387 --> 06:29.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS BEING PUSHED ON QATAR SHOULD

06:29.555 --> 06:30.590 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE EASED.

06:30.590 --> 06:32.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT THERE'S A CONCERN THAT

06:32.625 --> 06:34.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTER-ISIS OPERATIONS THAT ARE

06:34.427 --> 06:36.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUN OUT OF AL-UDEID CAN BE

06:36.596 --> 06:38.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPACTED IF THIS FEUD DOESN'T

06:38.865 --> 06:39.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
END.

06:39.465 --> 06:41.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO HE'S VERY MUCH PUSHED THAT

06:41.067 --> 06:43.002 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LINE BACKED BY SECRETARY

06:43.002 --> 06:43.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TILLERSON.

06:43.703 --> 06:45.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PROBLEM IS, PRESIDENT TRUMP,

06:45.738 --> 06:47.073 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON HIS TWEETS AND IN PUBLIC

06:47.073 --> 06:49.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMENTS, HAS SEEMED TO SIDE

06:49.208 --> 06:51.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH SAUDI ARABIA AND THE U.A.E.

06:51.010 --> 06:52.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAINST QATAR, SAYING, YOU

06:52.612 --> 06:54.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW, THIS HIGH-LEVEL SUPPORT OF

06:54.747 --> 06:56.449 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERRORISM THAT HAS BEEN

06:56.449 --> 06:57.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLEGEDLY SEEN.

06:57.316 --> 06:57.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: HAS THIS

06:57.917 --> 06:59.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BREAK IN THE GULF ALLIANCE

06:59.852 --> 07:01.788 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR IRAN?

07:01.788 --> 07:02.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE WE WERE REPORTING THAT

07:02.855 --> 07:04.090 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WERE ONE OF THE FIRST

07:04.090 --> 07:05.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE THAT SENT FOOD-AID TO

07:05.525 --> 07:06.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QATAR.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THAT?

07:07.693 --> 07:09.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> NO, I THINK DEFINITELY,

07:09.362 --> 07:10.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHEN HE

07:10.696 --> 07:12.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WENT TO SAUDI ARABIA, HAS

07:12.965 --> 07:14.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASICALLY BEEN TRYING TO CREATE

07:14.167 --> 07:17.870 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS BLOC OF GULF ARAB STATES

07:17.870 --> 07:20.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAINST ISIS, BUT ALSO AGAINST

07:20.306 --> 07:21.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IRAN.

07:21.007 --> 07:23.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IRAN'S LOVING THE FACT THAT

07:23.242 --> 07:24.343 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S THIS FEUD.

07:24.343 --> 07:25.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND A LOT OF THESE COUNTRIES,

07:25.812 --> 07:28.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHETHER IT'S QATAR, BAHRAIN, THE

07:28.581 --> 07:29.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.A.E.-- I MEAN, THEY'RE PRETTY

07:29.582 --> 07:31.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VULNERABLE TO IRAN.

07:31.350 --> 07:33.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THIS HOPE OF NOT JUST THE

07:33.119 --> 07:34.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BUT THE

07:34.253 --> 07:36.389 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, AS WELL,

07:36.389 --> 07:37.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY COULD CREATE A BLOC

07:37.523 --> 07:39.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAINST THESE SIX COUNTRIES IN

07:39.158 --> 07:41.027 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT REGION AGAINST IRAN, THESE

07:41.027 --> 07:42.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY VISIBLE FISSURES PLAY TO

07:42.895 --> 07:44.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IRAN'S ADVANTAGE.

07:44.363 --> 07:46.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE PLAYING A VERY ASTUTE

07:46.232 --> 07:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIPLOMATIC GAME, BECAUSE THIS

07:47.633 --> 07:49.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLAYS INTO THEIR HANDS.

07:49.001 --> 07:49.669 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT.

07:49.669 --> 07:50.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"WALL STREET JOURNAL'S" JAY

07:50.603 --> 07:54.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

08:01.447 --> 08:02.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBAMA'S AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

08:02.782 --> 08:04.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANDATED THAT ALL AMERICANS

08:04.116 --> 08:05.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBTAIN HEALTH INSURANCE AND

08:05.618 --> 08:07.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CREATED EXCHANGES TO HELP THE

UNINSURED ACQUIRE A PLAN.

08:08.955 --> 08:10.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT AFTER ONLY A FEW YEARS, BIG

08:10.957 --> 08:13.125 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSURERS LIKE AETNA, ANTHEM, AND

08:16.496 --> 08:18.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

08:18.631 --> 08:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENROLLEES HAD A CHOICE OF THREE

19:58.964 --> 19:59.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE GATES TO THE PARKING LOT AND

20:01.133 --> 20:02.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

WORK FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.

20:14.146 --> 20:15.113 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE REALLY TIED TO IT.

20:15.113 --> 20:16.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR WHOLE INVESTMENT GETS TIED

20:16.582 --> 20:18.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UP INTO THIS TRUCK.

20:18.450 --> 20:21.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WENT BANKRUPT, HOUSES GOT

20:21.119 --> 20:23.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORECLOSED ON, ALL BECAUSE THEY

20:23.188 --> 20:24.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE POURING THEIR LIFE SAVINGS

20:24.289 --> 20:25.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO THIS THING THAT THEY REALLY

20:25.891 --> 20:26.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEVER QUALIFIED FOR TO BEGIN

20:27.426 --> 20:28.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE

CREDITWORTHINESS.

20:28.927 --> 20:29.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S WHAT THE COMPANIES KNEW

20:29.861 --> 20:30.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN THEY WERE DRAWING UP THE

20:30.629 --> 20:31.630 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGREEMENTS, AND THAT'S WHY THEY

20:31.630 --> 20:33.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEPPED IN TO KIND OF BE THE

20:33.365 --> 20:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIDDLE MAN.

20:33.966 --> 20:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHEN YOU SAY

WORKING DOUBLE SHIFTS AND

20:35.867 --> 20:37.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
120 HOURS A WEEK SOMETIMES,

20:37.436 --> 20:38.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AREN'T THERE RULES IN THE

TRUCKERS FROM WORKING TOO MANY

ALERT BEHIND THE WHEEL?

20:44.977 --> 20:45.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> EXACTLY, YEAH.

20:45.777 --> 20:47.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

20:50.148 --> 20:51.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE LOOKING AT GUYS WHO ARE

20:51.183 --> 20:52.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALMOST DOING DOUBLE THAT.

20:52.517 --> 20:54.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THEY

20:54.786 --> 20:56.021 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOK THEIR LOG BOOKS.

20:56.021 --> 20:58.023 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DOCTOR THEIR MANIFESTS.

20:58.023 --> 20:59.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND A LOT OF THE COMPANIES NOT

20:59.191 --> 21:00.559 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONLY KNOW THAT THEIR DRIVERS ARE

21:00.559 --> 21:02.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOING THAT, BUT THEY REQUIRE IT.

21:02.361 --> 21:03.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE FOUND INSTANCES OF

21:09.434 --> 21:10.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAD MANAGERS WHO WERE

21:10.435 --> 21:11.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY SHOWING THEM HOW TO DO

21:11.770 --> 21:13.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT EVERY FRIDAY.

21:13.305 --> 21:15.274 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT'S REALLY ILLEGAL, AND

21:15.274 --> 21:15.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S REALLY DANGEROUS.

21:15.941 --> 21:16.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TRANSPORTED BY THESE TRUCKS ARE

21:18.610 --> 21:20.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAKING THEIR WAY INTO MOST OF

21:22.581 --> 21:23.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN YOU ASK THOSE STORES

HAPPENING AND HOW THESE GOODS

21:26.184 --> 21:27.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GET TO THEIR SHELVES, WHAT DO

21:27.386 --> 21:28.153 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY SAY?

21:28.153 --> 21:28.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> BECAUSE THEY DON'T HIRE THESE

21:28.987 --> 21:30.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GUYS DIRECTLY-- THEY OFTEN HIRE

SHIPPING COMPANIES, OR LOGISTICS

21:31.823 --> 21:33.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPANIES THAT HANDLE ALL THIS--

21:33.258 --> 21:34.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO

21:34.593 --> 21:35.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMENT.

21:35.060 --> 21:35.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DIDN'T THINK IT WAS THEIR

21:35.827 --> 21:37.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACE, WHICH IS, OF COURSE, AN

21:37.429 --> 21:38.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARGUMENT THEY TRIED USING IN THE

21:38.664 --> 21:39.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAST WITH A LOT OF THEIR

21:39.631 --> 21:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACTORIES OVERSEAS.

21:41.166 --> 21:42.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WHAT THEY WERE SAYING,

21:42.167 --> 21:44.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY, WAS THAT WE EXPECT ALL

21:44.303 --> 21:45.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF OUR VENDORS AND CONTRACTORS

21:45.570 --> 21:47.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO ADHERE TO THE LAWS.

21:47.873 --> 21:49.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE OUR CODE OF ETHICS.

21:49.708 --> 21:52.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE WANT EVERYONE TO FOLLOW IT.

21:52.344 --> 21:54.446 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

HEARD, A LOT OF THE TIMES, THIS

21:55.847 --> 21:56.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS NEWS TO THEM.

21:56.748 --> 21:58.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND, THEREFORE, THEY DIDN'T

21:58.216 --> 21:59.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK THEY REALLY WERE IN A

21:59.918 --> 22:01.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
