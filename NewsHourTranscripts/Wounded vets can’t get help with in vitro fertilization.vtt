JUDY WOODRUFF: For thousands of
young veterans
in America, putting the wars in
Afghanistan

00:05.906 --> 00:12.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Iraq behind them remains a
constant challenge.
For some, starting a family is
an important

00:12.079 --> 00:14.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
part of the healing process.

00:14.181 --> 00:18.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as the "NewsHour"'s William
Brangham
reports, even that can be a
struggle.

00:18.919 --> 00:24.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All newlyweds
face challenges,
but Jason and Rachel Hallett
have more challenges

00:24.791 --> 00:31.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than most. Jason is a triple
amputee. Back
in 2010, at age 19, this young
Marine lost

00:31.098 --> 00:35.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two legs and an arm when he
stepped on an
IED while on patrol in
Afghanistan.

00:35.168 --> 00:38.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CPL. JASON HALLETT (RET.), U.S.
Marine Corps:
When 9/11 and everything
happened, I was -- I

00:38.739 --> 00:42.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had a little bit of interest to
join the military.
But, as soon as that happened,
it just became

00:42.843 --> 00:46.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- everything was circling
around me joining
the military.

00:46.246 --> 00:50.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: After his
injury, barely
clinging to life, and riddled
with infections,

00:50.717 --> 00:55.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jason was cared for at U.S.
military facilities
in Germany, Maryland and
California.

00:55.822 --> 00:59.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He hadn't been in touch with
Rachel since
they dated back in eighth grade.
But, in the

00:59.393 --> 01:01.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hospital, he found her again on
Facebook.

01:01.295 --> 01:04.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHEL HALLETT, Wife of Jason
Hallett: He
sends me this friend request a
couple years

01:04.898 --> 01:12.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after I had kind of given up.
And when I saw
what had happened, I just
started crying.

01:12.673 --> 01:18.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He hadn't posted, like, what
happened. But
he had, like -- his picture
obviously was

01:18.946 --> 01:23.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
different than last time I
remembered him,
and said that he worked for the
Marine Corps,

01:23.550 --> 01:25.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so I kind of put two pieces
together.

01:25.886 --> 01:33.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Facebook led
to phone calls,
which led to a visit, and then a
wedding day.

01:33.827 --> 01:41.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They now live in Windsor,
Colorado. Jason's
studying to be a certified
financial planner.

01:41.435 --> 01:46.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rachel baby-sits to make extra
money, but
her full-time job now really is
caring for

01:46.373 --> 01:50.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jason, and she gets a small
stipend from the
VA for that work.

01:50.777 --> 01:54.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What the Halletts want most is
to start a
family. But there's a problem.

01:54.448 --> 01:58.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHEL HALLETT: We had just kind
of been told
that it would probably be a
problem because

01:58.352 --> 02:05.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of some of his injuries and
where his shrapnel
is. There's tons of shrapnel
everywhere throughout

02:05.092 --> 02:06.026 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his body.

02:06.059 --> 02:07.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Still in your
body today?

02:07.828 --> 02:10.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CPL. JASON HALLETT: Yes. So,
basically, one
of the pieces had actually
connected itself

02:10.564 --> 02:14.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to one of my testicles. And so I
now have
to take testosterone injections
basically

02:14.634 --> 02:20.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get me back to normal. And
with that, one
of the side effects is, it
basically kills

02:20.173 --> 02:22.009 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the sperm off.

02:22.042 --> 02:26.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In order to
conceive a child,
the Halletts have to go through
lengthy in

02:26.847 --> 02:31.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vitro fertilization treatments.
In vitro is
an expensive process. It
typically costs about

02:31.852 --> 02:39.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
$12,000 to $13,000 per try, and
the first
try often doesn't work, nor does
the second.

02:39.593 --> 02:44.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the bills can stack up. But,
unlike all
the other medical treatment
related to Jason's

02:44.865 --> 02:49.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
injuries, the VA doesn't cover
IVF treatment
for wounded vets, and so the
young couple

02:49.803 --> 02:52.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are paying for this themselves.

02:52.472 --> 02:56.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congress passed a law in 1992
that led to
the Veterans Administration
banning coverage

02:56.743 --> 03:02.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of any in vitro fertilization
services. That
means that for an estimated
1,800 veterans

03:02.349 --> 03:07.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like Jason, they will also have
to spend tens
of thousands of dollars to get
pregnant and

03:07.087 --> 03:08.855 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
start a family.

03:08.889 --> 03:12.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Patty Murray wants that
to change.
This Democrat from Washington
state sits on

03:12.793 --> 03:17.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Senate Veterans Affairs
Committee, and
she wrote a bill that would lift
the VA's

03:17.130 --> 03:20.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IVF ban. But for six years, her
efforts have
been blocked.

03:20.934 --> 03:24.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. PATTY MURRAY (D),
Washington: To me,
when someone goes off to fight a
war for us,

03:24.805 --> 03:29.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a man or a woman, we have an
obligation as
the country to make them whole
again, as whole

03:29.976 --> 03:35.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as we can. And, certainly,
having a family,
having children, having that
kind of quality

03:35.515 --> 03:39.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of life that a lot of Americans
want is something
that we should make sure they
get.

03:39.453 --> 03:42.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Why is it that
the VA doesn't
pay for these services now?

03:42.856 --> 03:48.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. PATTY MURRAY: I have been
told that it
is because of the cost. I
believe that that

03:48.895 --> 03:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shouldn't be an issue. This is
something that
is a cost of war and that, as
Americans, we

03:53.934 --> 04:00.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should do what we can for the
people who served
our country. So, the stated
reason is money,

04:00.807 --> 04:02.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but I'm skeptical.

04:02.342 --> 04:04.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What do you
think the issue
it really is?

04:04.511 --> 04:10.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. PATTY MURRAY: It is hard to
get anyone
to say anything past cost. I
would say to

04:10.217 --> 04:13.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them, let's get over the cost.
If there's
another issue, tell us what it
is.

04:14.020 --> 04:18.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, what is
the cost? One
estimate says covering IVF and
other fertility

04:18.325 --> 04:24.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
treatments for veterans for five
years would
be $578 million. Some IVF
advocates say that

04:24.898 --> 04:26.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
estimate is inflated.

04:26.633 --> 04:29.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We reached out to the two
Republicans who
run the Veterans Affairs
Committees in the

04:30.003 --> 04:34.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House and the Senate. Neither
would speak
with us. Republican Congressman
Jeff Miller

04:34.141 --> 04:38.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Florida, chairman of the
House VA Committee,
gave us a statement saying he
was trying to

04:38.745 --> 04:42.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
balance the needs of veterans
with the concerns
over IVF.

04:42.749 --> 04:47.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Several sources told the
"NewsHour" that these
concerns over IVF apparently
come from pro-life

04:47.787 --> 04:52.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
organizations who object to the
treatments.
These groups argue that, because
some of the

04:52.159 --> 04:58.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
embryos created or stored during
IVF sometimes
get destroyed, IVF is then
similar to abortion.

04:58.598 --> 05:02.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We reached out to the main
pro-life groups
to talk about their concerns,
but they all

05:02.102 --> 05:03.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
declined our requests.

05:03.870 --> 05:07.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. PATTY MURRAY: What I would
answer to
that is that this is a decision
each one of

05:07.908 --> 05:12.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these men and woman have to make
on their
own. And if they decide this is
the way that

05:12.312 --> 05:16.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they can have a family and
become whole again,
that decision should be up to
them.

05:16.716 --> 05:23.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But our country shouldn't be
deciding for
one philosophy, if it's a
religious philosophy,

05:24.024 --> 05:29.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a ban on all Americans who
served our country
in having the ability to have a
child.

05:29.829 --> 05:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It appears
unlikely Congress
will change the VA's policy
before the next

05:34.034 --> 05:38.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election. But for young veterans
and their
families who struggle to afford
IVF, time

05:38.872 --> 05:40.574 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is very short.

05:40.607 --> 05:43.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. GILBERT MOTTLA, Shady Grove
Fertility:
We're really talking about some
1,800 Iraq

05:43.643 --> 05:51.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Afghanistan veterans who are
now aging.
This one group of war injured,
we really need

05:51.918 --> 05:57.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to move this legislation forward
and get these
individuals the coverage they
need before

05:57.457 --> 05:59.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they lose their own reproductive
potential.

05:59.292 --> 06:03.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Doctor Gilbert
Mottla is
a fertility doctor in Maryland
who works with

06:03.163 --> 06:08.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
military families. He's pushing
the VA to
change its policy, which he says
is driven

06:08.101 --> 06:13.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in part by misconceptions about
IVF, like
the concern that IVF causes
multiple pregnancies

06:13.506 --> 06:15.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at once, leading to selective
abortions.

06:15.408 --> 06:19.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. GILBERT MOTTLA: I think it
really is a
misunderstanding of what the
procedure is

06:19.779 --> 06:26.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about. And it generates -- goes
back to the
early '90s, when in vitro was
very, very new.

06:26.219 --> 06:31.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a 34-year-old procedure
now that has
come of age tactically.

06:31.591 --> 06:35.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And back in the early '90s, when
Congress
was looking at this, it was a
new procedure,

06:35.762 --> 06:41.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not very successful, fraught
with some problems
of multiple pregnancy, which
really are over

06:41.034 --> 06:42.902 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in many ways.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: There's no
sign Jason Hallett
is at all frustrated with the
injuries he's

06:45.372 --> 06:49.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suffered and what they have done
to his life,
but the same isn't true for the
way he feels

06:49.476 --> 06:51.211 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about Congress.

06:51.244 --> 06:54.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you think about the
people who have
been holding this piece of
legislation up?

06:54.114 --> 06:59.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CPL. JASON HALLETT: It's very
angering. And
it brings a lot of resentment
towards my active

06:59.319 --> 07:03.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
service and stuff. I don't
regret joining
the Marine Corps. But the simple
fact is that

07:03.590 --> 07:05.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they told us that we'd be taken
care of us
if we got injured.

07:05.925 --> 07:11.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I guarantee that, if it was
a congressman's
kid or them themselves that
wanted IVF, and

07:11.564 --> 07:15.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they had to go through the same
process and
the same hoops, that they would
be doing everything

07:15.602 --> 07:17.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they can to make it happen.

07:17.370 --> 07:21.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHEL HALLETT: It's hard to
know that he
would protect them and he would
give up all

07:21.408 --> 07:27.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this for them, and they will
not take just
a little bit of time to try to
fix this issue

07:27.947 --> 07:30.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that we are having.

07:30.717 --> 07:35.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Rachel is
undergoing the
first steps of her fertility
treatment. If

07:35.055 --> 07:39.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all goes well, she could be
pregnant as early
as February. If it doesn't, they
will probably

07:39.959 --> 07:42.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
need loans for any additional
treatment.

07:42.529 --> 07:44.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham
in Windsor, Colorado.
