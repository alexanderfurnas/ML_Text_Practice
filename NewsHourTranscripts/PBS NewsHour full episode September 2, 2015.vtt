NANCY LINDBORG, President, U.S.

on pace to double from the numbe
Europe a year ago.

09:33.573 --> 09:38.311
But we really need to remember t
a small tip of a very large glob

09:39.779 --> 09:43.183
where we're seeing 60 million pe
from their homes over this past

09:44.651 --> 09:49.656

are giving up hope. They are liv

09:51.124 --> 09:56.229
of repression, poverty, conflict
ending, and they are seeking a b

at great cost, at great danger f

Is there any distinction to be m

10:10.009 --> 10:13.813
NANCY LINDBORG: Well, I think th
Clearly, legally, refugees are t

10:15.281 --> 10:20.887
fleeing persecution, conflict an
That 60 million is people who ha

10:22.355 --> 10:27.293
displaced from their homes and a
internally displaced or are alre

10:28.761 --> 10:33.066
The importance, however, is how
are so intermixed, where you hav

10:34.234 --> 10:37.804
poor governance, and poverty tha
with conflict.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.540
GWEN IFILL: One thing leads to t
leads to the other.

10:41.274 --> 10:41.374
NANCY LINDBORG: Exactly.

10:42.842 --> 10:45.178
GWEN IFILL: Astrid Ziebarth, in
Merkel, among others, have said

10:46.646 --> 10:51.951
accept up to 800,000 of these mi
find some way to take care of th

10:53.419 --> 10:58.224
thousand arrived just last month
a plan that's Germany-specific o

10:59.058 --> 10:59.459
that can begin to tackle this?

11:00.927 --> 11:03.229
ASTRID ZIEBARTH, German Marshall
first of all, we have to have no

11:04.697 --> 11:09.135
800,000 are a projection for the
and this was stated by our inter

11:10.603 --> 11:13.206
but it's not entirely transparen
numbers come about, so we always

11:14.674 --> 11:18.177
cautious about this, because the
-- the authorities also switched

11:19.045 --> 11:19.913
system of how to account for it.

11:21.381 --> 11:27.820
So, this is just a note as we go
What is to be noted is that Germ

11:29.289 --> 11:32.592
currently to take up that many m
refugees, but, as you also state

11:34.060 --> 11:39.666
to be cautious not to just see t
are refugees from Syria are flee

11:41.134 --> 11:45.271
and violence, but almost 42 perc
from the Western Balkans and the

11:46.139 --> 11:48.741
recognition for asylum is less t

11:50.209 --> 11:54.747
So this is something where the G
is trying to figure out how to s

11:56.215 --> 12:00.053
processes for those who are flee
and violence, but also trying to

12:00.920 --> 12:03.323
if those who are not, how they c

12:04.791 --> 12:07.560
GWEN IFILL: Well, let me stay wi
a moment, because there has been

12:09.028 --> 12:12.231
in Germany, not only Germany, bu
of this in Hungary, where people

12:13.700 --> 12:17.870
to say, we can't absorb all of t
picking up speed, that attitude?

12:19.339 --> 12:22.175
ASTRID ZIEBARTH: At the moment,
the number of 800,000 being put

12:23.643 --> 12:28.481
also in the public, it's remarka
public mood in Germany is still

12:29.949 --> 12:32.919
You have -- the latest public op
state that you have 60 percent o

12:34.387 --> 12:37.957
who say that we can cope with th
interior minister also said, wel

12:39.425 --> 12:44.030
cope with this for a while, but
deal with such a high amount for

12:45.498 --> 12:49.268
is the question. And here's wher
government also turns to the Eur

12:50.737 --> 12:53.439
GWEN IFILL: Nancy Lindborg, you
was the tip of an iceberg. So, t

12:54.807 --> 12:57.043
someone has figured out or tried
how to handle this before.

12:58.511 --> 13:01.347
There's something called a Dubli
which is the way that people try

13:02.615 --> 13:04.317
this. Explain what that is and w
is working anymore.

13:05.785 --> 13:09.689
NANCY LINDBORG: Well, the Dublin
was simply an agreed-upon rule w

13:11.157 --> 13:14.994
European Union that where you la
country in which you sought asyl

13:15.862 --> 13:18.431
what's being shifted right now.

13:19.899 --> 13:26.372
The larger question is not just
we deal with those who are arriv

13:27.840 --> 13:32.612
right now, but how do we address
conflicts and repression that is

13:34.080 --> 13:38.418
out? Because you have a large pi
people who are displaced, but st

13:39.886 --> 13:44.390
their borders. And as these conf
unaddressed, there are many, man

13:45.258 --> 13:46.959
may be seeking refuge into the f

13:48.428 --> 13:51.798
GWEN IFILL: And, at some point,
-- we have seen Iceland -- a lot

13:53.266 --> 13:55.935
say they would open their homes
There are others. But at some po

13:57.403 --> 14:00.406
of nations are hanging back and
whether the backlash will make t

14:01.274 --> 14:02.275
on this end, as well as that end

14:03.076 --> 14:04.277
NANCY LINDBORG: Absolutely.

14:05.745 --> 14:09.549
And I would also note that if yo
the Middle East, this was a regi

14:11.017 --> 14:15.521
with refugees even before the Sy
And since then, you have the cou

14:16.989 --> 14:22.562
the immediate region like Turkey
Jordan who have taken the majori

14:23.429 --> 14:26.232
four million Syrian refugees to

14:27.700 --> 14:33.806
In Lebanon, one out of four peop
there is Syrian, which is an alm

14:34.874 --> 14:37.510
number to imagine happening in E
country.

14:38.978 --> 14:41.614
GWEN IFILL: Astrid Ziebarth, is
discussion about imposing quotas

14:42.315 --> 14:43.316
of people allowed in?

14:44.650 --> 14:47.854
ASTRID ZIEBARTH: Well, yes, ther
discussion about quotas.

14:49.322 --> 14:52.158
What is remarkable, that a year
at the European level or nationa

14:53.626 --> 14:58.998
have talked about quotas, but we
that the crisis has gotten so ur

15:00.466 --> 15:04.403
at first the European Commission
the discussion about quotas in t

15:05.571 --> 15:09.108
And then they also proposed thei
on migration.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.980
It was met by fierce opposition
wanted to have binding quotas. B

15:15.448 --> 15:18.317
other member states said, well,
want to have binding quotas. And

15:19.786 --> 15:23.489
had especially Eastern European
that were against binding quotas

15:24.957 --> 15:28.995
pushing for voluntary quotas, bu
that is voluntary is always hard

15:29.762 --> 15:30.329
an agreement on that one.

15:31.798 --> 15:34.600
So, we're now seeing again the d
about quotas and it will be defi

15:36.068 --> 15:39.172
the table for the upcoming confe
when the interior ministers meet

15:40.640 --> 15:43.509
GWEN IFILL: Nancy Lindborg, is t
at all about resettling any of t

15:44.377 --> 15:45.077
or migrants in the United States

15:46.546 --> 15:51.284
NANCY LINDBORG: Well, the United
about 70,000 refugees every year

15:52.752 --> 15:56.189

from the vibrancy that many of t

15:56.622 --> 15:57.456
bring.

Since 9/11, it's been a lot hard
in refugees from the Middle East

16:04.030 --> 16:09.001
the number from Syria thus far i
I certainly hope that we can fin

to increase that, because we wil
benefit as a country, as well as

JUDY WOODRUFF: While much of the

16:46.239 --> 16:50.610
fighting there largely raged on,
wounding more fighters and civil

16:51.477 --> 16:53.045
to displace people in that count

16:54.513 --> 16:59.685
Yet another cease-fire between R

ambushed, killing two people.

17:31.350 --> 17:35.621
Indeed, now in its second year o
cease-fires brokered by European

All told, some 6,800 people have

more than two million have fled

of fear.

when the night is coming, we are

18:02.982 --> 18:04.684

nights.

MARGARET WARNER: Washington Post
Thomas Gibbons-Neff just returne

18:10.856 --> 18:15.428

with rebels just a thousand yard

THOMAS GIBBONS-NEFF, The Washing
Every night, it was kind of the

18:21.867 --> 18:26.238
but that same routine involved a
know, palpable sense of tension.

18:27.707 --> 18:30.476
ready for someone to say, hey, t
across this field, get ready to

18:31.310 --> 18:32.011
death, or prepare to retreat.

18:33.479 --> 18:37.550
Like, it was a strange routine,
that it happened the same every

that same night, every night inv
maybe this is it, maybe this is

18:42.521 --> 18:43.055
the big attack.

18:44.523 --> 18:48.794
MARGARET WARNER: The conflict in
has stoked political tensions in

18:50.262 --> 18:55.001
Kiev. Far-right nationalists pro
outside Parliament, as it voted

18:55.735 --> 18:58.237
autonomy to rebel areas.

18:59.705 --> 19:05.544
Violence broke out, killing thre
guardsmen and hospitalizing 140

19:07.013 --> 19:11.417

today will stop the Ukrainian na

a slave to others. The authority
place will belong to the people

19:42.581 --> 19:44.550

MARGARET WARNER: Meanwhile, Wash
Russia for the continued turmoil

JOSEPH BIDEN, Vice President of
States: The fact of the matter i

19:52.491 --> 20:01.767
is now under siege. Russia is bu
outposts on Ukrainian soil. The

not only Ukraine, but the shared

for a Europe that is whole and f
peace.

20:19.952 --> 20:24.490
MARGARET WARNER: NATO is now con

other nations in Operation Sea B

JUDY WOODRUFF: And Margaret join

Margaret, welcome.

20:36.869 --> 20:40.206
So, how significant is this ceas

MARGARET WARNER: It was, though,

be holding.

20:45.978 --> 20:49.815
And so they want the Europeans n
really handling these negotiatio

20:51.283 --> 20:55.421
Putin very hard, Russian Preside
hard, to keep up his end of the

that Poroshenko is pushing for t

21:02.528 --> 21:06.899
to withdraw Russian heavy weapon
from Ukraine.

21:08.367 --> 21:12.004
The question is, what's the ince
Putin to do this? If Putin's obj

21:24.483 --> 21:26.952

he will decide he has to keep up

JUDY WOODRUFF: So you were repor

21:46.906 --> 21:49.875
days, devolving authority back t
Violent protest, what was drivin

21:51.343 --> 21:53.746
MARGARET WARNER: I think, Judy,
the more disturbing thing that h

21:55.214 --> 21:58.684
in the last week or two. And tha
there is growing resistance to t

21:59.552 --> 22:00.886
a negotiated settlement with the

22:02.354 --> 22:05.191
We have had a growing kind of ra
in the western part of Ukraine a

22:06.659 --> 22:11.797
has ground on and on. And so, on
there were these two fringe far-

22:13.265 --> 22:17.036
who did very poorly in the elect
is one. The other is called the

22:18.504 --> 22:23.309
And people call them skinheads,
calls them Nazis. And they were

22:24.777 --> 22:31.951
actual event. But the deeper pro
is that there is growing unhappi

22:33.419 --> 22:37.556
the idea of a negotiated settlem
attitude of these hard-right par

22:39.024 --> 22:42.094
should we give anything to these
when they continue killing -- yo

22:42.962 --> 22:45.130
been hundreds killed since this

22:46.599 --> 22:50.102
And that is -- they're calling f
war right now on the eastern fro

22:51.570 --> 22:55.674
of course, is fantasy. If the Uk
were to try to step up the war,

22:57.142 --> 23:02.081
and their proteges would crush t
is a very persistent theme from

23:03.549 --> 23:05.751
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, is it clear
broader Ukrainian public thinks?

23:06.452 --> 23:06.452
MARGARET WARNER: Yes.

23:07.886 --> 23:09.588
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes, there were t
but what do most people think?

23:11.056 --> 23:13.826
MARGARET WARNER: So, there are p
that while the most extreme rhet

23:15.294 --> 23:17.596
resonated yet -- the leader of o
parties, Yarosh, says, well, now

23:18.897 --> 23:21.267
to go after our internal enemies
President Poroshenko.

23:22.735 --> 23:28.073
That is not hitting the public.
that they are being played as fo

23:29.541 --> 23:33.345
that Ukrainians are dying -- tho
are in the paper every single da

23:34.446 --> 23:37.182
this whole idea of a negotiated
is flawed.

23:38.651 --> 23:42.855
The problem with that is that, s
NATO, the U.S., the Europeans ar

23:44.323 --> 23:48.394
to enter and help Ukrainians mil
negotiated solution is the only

23:49.862 --> 23:54.166
them. So it puts the Ukrainian g
in a difficult position. Plus, t

23:55.200 --> 23:57.202
is furious because economically
hard.

23:58.671 --> 24:01.240
All these things they had to do
requirements, for example, or ge

24:02.708 --> 24:07.880
restructured has meant end of su
people pay more for electricity

24:09.348 --> 24:15.487
So, all in all, it's kind of a s
And, again, if the aim of Putin

24:16.955 --> 24:20.659
to so destabilize this governmen
public will essentially kick the

24:21.760 --> 24:23.128
will put in someone, or try to,
to Russia.

24:24.596 --> 24:27.266
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly,
what is the U.S. role in all of

24:28.367 --> 24:30.135
do U.S. officials you talk to th
to happen?

24:31.003 --> 24:31.370
MARGARET WARNER: Two things, Jud

24:32.838 --> 24:35.007
The U.S. -- we have seen multipl
from Vice President Biden, Secre

24:36.475 --> 24:38.344
even the president to Ukrainian
officials. They have been mentor

24:39.211 --> 24:41.347
how to handle the economic issue

24:42.815 --> 24:47.753
But they recognize that, again,
of the U.S. being willing to ste

24:49.221 --> 24:53.359
assistance, give true military a
that Ukraine is, to some degree,

24:54.827 --> 24:57.096
and one senior official said to
to play survivor, which I think

24:58.564 --> 25:03.168
is outwit, outplay and outlast y
with a little help from the U.S.

25:04.636 --> 25:10.442
But it is not -- that is not the
a powerful alliance that can res

25:11.310 --> 25:11.543
JUDY WOODRUFF: Another tough one

25:12.244 --> 25:12.378
MARGARET WARNER: Yes.

25:13.245 --> 25:15.381
JUDY WOODRUFF: Margaret Warner,

25:16.248 --> 25:23.655
MARGARET WARNER: Always a pleasu

25:24.423 --> 25:27.826

But, first, militants in the Isl

25:54.319 --> 25:58.490
treasures in Syria over the past
weeks, all part of a continuing

target the region's cultural her

26:02.694 --> 26:05.798
Jeffrey Brown has the story, par
series Culture at Risk.

26:07.266 --> 26:11.937
JEFFREY BROWN: Satellite images
by the U.N. confirmed the fears:

26:13.138 --> 26:15.174
of the Temple of Bel in the anci
city of Palmyra.

26:16.642 --> 26:20.379
GIOVANNI BOCCARDI, UNESCO: We kn
that some time after the 27th of

26:21.780 --> 26:26.285
likely on the 30th of August, th
was blown up by explosives.

26:27.152 --> 26:28.387
UNESCO official Giovanni Boccard

26:29.855 --> 26:35.694
GIOVANNI BOCCARDI: It was dedica
god, Bel, but during Byzantine t

26:37.162 --> 26:42.100
turned into a church and then wi
of the Arabs, it was turned into

26:43.569 --> 26:49.141
So this is why it has this profo
meaning, which goes beyond sort

26:49.942 --> 26:51.176
and even aesthetic aspects.

26:52.644 --> 26:57.349
JEFFREY BROWN: Palmyra, a modern
antiquities site located 150 mil

26:58.817 --> 27:03.889
of Damascus, was taken over by I
in May, who then continued a pat

27:05.357 --> 27:09.228
ancient sites in Iraq and Syria.
they destroyed a smaller temple

27:10.696 --> 27:16.001
and, before that, beheaded Khale
an 82-year-old Syrian archaeolog

27:17.169 --> 27:19.438
looked after the city's sites fo
four decades.

27:20.906 --> 27:25.010
On another front, the FBI last w
a statement urging U.S. art deal

27:26.478 --> 27:29.781

East, saying there is evidence c

27:31.250 --> 27:37.055

by Islamic State fighters in Syr

Joining me now is Brenton Easter
agent with the Homeland Security

Immigration and Customs Enforcem
Danti, an archaeologist at Bosto

27:48.400 --> 27:50.769
who's worked in the region for m
and advises the State Department

27:51.637 --> 27:52.404
Michael Danti, let me start with

27:53.872 --> 27:57.342
Help us to understand a little b
what has been lost. Tell us abou

27:58.076 --> 27:58.977
and the specific temple.

28:00.445 --> 28:03.582
MICHAEL DANTI, Boston University
is a site that dates back to the

28:05.050 --> 28:09.821
several thousand years B.C., but
most known for is standing Greco

28:10.822 --> 28:13.392
that largely date to first and s
A.D.

28:14.860 --> 28:19.031
It was essentially an antiquity
met West in the Syrian desert, l

28:20.499 --> 28:24.970
with the great caravan traffic b
Mediterranean and East Asia. So

28:26.438 --> 28:30.008
fusion of cultures and antiquity
in antiquity for its multicultur

28:31.476 --> 28:34.813
JEFFREY BROWN: You and I talked
issue most recently after the de

28:36.281 --> 28:41.119
of sites in Iraq. When you look
this, is there a pattern that yo

28:42.287 --> 28:45.524
about why specific sites are bei
at this point?

28:46.191 --> 28:47.359
MICHAEL DANTI: Yes.

28:48.827 --> 28:53.231
In many ways, Palmyra serves as
for the larger picture, for Isla

28:54.700 --> 28:57.936
and Jabhat al-Nusra destructions
into new territory. As their foo

28:59.404 --> 29:03.408
expanded out, the first step gen
they carry out deliberative dest

29:04.876 --> 29:10.916
Muslim heritage, generally Sufi
such as mosques, historic school

29:12.384 --> 29:16.121
And those destructions happened
after ISIL moved into the Tadmor

29:16.722 --> 29:16.588
Palmyra region.

29:17.289 --> 29:17.322
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

29:18.490 --> 29:21.026
MICHAEL DANTI: They blew up two
Muslim sites.

29:22.494 --> 29:27.666
Then they move on to looting cul
museum collections, the collecti

29:29.134 --> 29:31.870
individuals. And they began disc
ISIL leadership in Tadmor about

29:33.338 --> 29:37.175
archaeological site of Palmyra u
That was followed by the plantin

29:38.644 --> 29:42.714
IEDs in many of the structures a
And then it was just a matter of

29:43.382 --> 29:43.815
something happened.

29:45.283 --> 29:48.987
And we don't know what the timin
of these destructions of Baal Sh

29:49.855 --> 29:50.756
temple. That may become clearer.

29:51.289 --> 29:51.089
(CROSSTALK)

29:52.557 --> 29:55.160
JEFFREY BROWN: Let me bring in B
on that issue, particularly on -

29:56.628 --> 30:00.332
the FBI issuing this warning. We
about the antiquities as a sourc

30:00.832 --> 30:02.200
for ISIS.

30:03.669 --> 30:07.072
Is this a certainty at this poin
specifically are you seeing comi

30:07.739 --> 30:08.240
antiquities market?

30:09.708 --> 30:12.544
BRENTON EASTER, Immigration and
One of the things that HSI has d

30:14.012 --> 30:17.249
over the past few is we have beg
these cases not just as cultural

30:18.116 --> 30:19.851
investigations, but also as fina

30:21.319 --> 30:24.256
So, we are tracing the money. An
that these revenue streams can f

30:25.724 --> 30:28.894
things. We are trying to tackle
One of the things that I heard e

30:30.362 --> 30:34.599
the program that Gwen Ifill was
is how conflict is a problem wit

30:36.068 --> 30:40.672
Well, when you have conflict are
are fleeing or moving in large q

30:42.140 --> 30:44.910
you're also going to have a lot
commodities, which ISIS can use

30:45.744 --> 30:47.446
fund, being smuggled as well.

30:48.714 --> 30:50.949
JEFFREY BROWN: How much -- can I
in that, how much...

30:51.650 --> 30:51.249
BRENTON EASTER: Sure.

30:52.718 --> 30:56.121
JEFFREY BROWN: Do we know how mu
talking about? Do we know how ma

30:57.589 --> 31:02.427
we're talking about? What is the
the damage and of what's flowing

31:03.295 --> 31:05.130
BRENTON EASTER: Well, that's a v

31:06.598 --> 31:08.767
And I don't know if you're ever
able to get an exact number or t

31:10.235 --> 31:11.837
of that. You're hearing differen
from all different people saying

31:13.305 --> 31:16.374
things. What we have seen is tha
these commodities coming out, th

31:17.843 --> 31:20.645
offered to people outside of Syr
the pieces are still in Syria wh

31:21.313 --> 31:22.180
them being offered.

31:23.648 --> 31:26.351
Other times, they have made it t
the transshipment locations. Wha

31:27.819 --> 31:31.089
noticed is that once they do lea
into a very large transnational

31:32.557 --> 31:37.696
network, which is expert at smug
things, it's expert at layering

31:39.164 --> 31:42.234
and paperwork to be associated w
pieces, so that they can be ente

31:42.701 --> 31:42.601
market.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.471
They also are very good at stori
for a period of time, so, someti

31:47.939 --> 31:51.710
have these pieces sit for five,
they will actually be shown some

31:52.577 --> 31:53.578
of the major consumer markets li

31:55.046 --> 31:57.849
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, I was going
briefly about the U.S. Is there

We have students in this generat
working and growing up in a very

44:14.318 --> 44:17.355
society. There's additional stre
things that they're carrying on

And there's an increase in the a
we see in students.

44:22.293 --> 44:24.462

44:41.412 --> 44:45.416
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jennifer, are
dealing with this change differe

44:46.884 --> 44:49.353
In a couple of your stories, I f
one school really tried to send

44:50.821 --> 44:53.291
as fast as possible to get help,
school didn't. There doesn't see

44:53.824 --> 44:53.658
uniformity.

44:55.126 --> 44:57.428
JENNIFER RUARK: Every school obv
its students to be in an environ

44:58.896 --> 45:02.433
learning is possible, both for t
individual and for the rest of h

45:02.967 --> 45:02.900
classmates.

45:04.368 --> 45:08.172
But the care that they're able t
widely from campus to campus. Yo

45:09.640 --> 45:14.111
college campuses that are able t
on-site psychiatrist, but there

45:15.580 --> 45:19.216
don't. There are many campuses w
have as many hours available at

center, who are staffing the cen
or trying to rely more on peer e

45:30.294 --> 45:32.930
faculty intervention, simply bec
don't have the resources that th

45:34.398 --> 45:36.167
HARI SREENIVASAN: Micky Sharma,
one of the biggest schools in th

45:37.635 --> 45:40.571
probably better-resourced than,
colleges or graduate schools aro

45:41.872 --> 45:44.308
that might also be dealing with
and these challenges.

45:45.776 --> 45:51.148
But what are the appropriate bou
an institution of learning today

45:52.617 --> 45:56.187
for the mental, the physical, th
the psychological well-being of

45:57.655 --> 46:00.358
because someone is going to ask,
your job just to be a university

46:01.826 --> 46:04.829
and help teach? Now we're really
to think about health care and m

46:05.262 --> 46:05.129
care.

46:06.597 --> 46:09.634
MICKY SHARMA: So, I think that t
the university is to provide as

46:11.035 --> 46:13.704
can in terms of support services
be academically successful.

46:15.172 --> 46:17.108
And, at the end of the day, that
counseling centers are doing. Th

46:18.576 --> 46:22.647
my center is doing, is providing
students, so that they can come

46:23.914 --> 46:26.050
be successful, graduate, earn a
launch their career.

46:27.518 --> 46:31.822
So, for many university counseli
what we're doing is providing sh

46:33.290 --> 46:36.627
and on a time-limited basis at m
so that we're able to provide st

46:37.495 --> 46:38.729
reach as many students as possib

46:40.197 --> 46:44.602
Additionally, many centers have
providing a menu of service opti

46:46.070 --> 46:47.938
majority of what we do is indivi
but there's a lot of group couns

46:49.407 --> 46:54.178
we offer, as well as drop-in wor
get coping strategies, better st

46:55.312 --> 46:56.981
strategies in the hands of as ma
as possible.

46:58.449 --> 47:00.151
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jennifer, what
reporters find about the balanci

47:01.619 --> 47:05.856
some schools are having to do be
to have their student population

47:07.258 --> 47:09.393
well cared for on the one hand a
privacy rights on the other?

47:10.861 --> 47:15.399
JENNIFER RUARK: Well, a college
to know whether students come to

47:16.867 --> 47:20.705
preexisting mental health condit
the student or his family choose

47:21.138 --> 47:21.505
that.

47:22.973 --> 47:25.476
About one in four students repor
counseling centers now are alrea

47:26.944 --> 47:30.314
kind of psychotropic medicine, i
of the lifting of the stigma tha

47:31.782 --> 47:39.523
to earlier. So, if a faculty mem
notices a troubled student or no

47:40.991 --> 47:44.295
that a student may be troubled,
that student to seek counseling

47:45.763 --> 47:50.735
to people, but unless it becomes
situation, they can't really for

47:51.402 --> 47:51.435
to seek counseling.

47:52.903 --> 47:54.505
HARI SREENIVASAN: Micky Sharma,
little bit about the challenge t

47:55.973 --> 47:58.743
If you have a larger population
you year after year who might al

48:00.211 --> 48:04.448
been in therapy for several year
come to college or if, as Jennif

48:05.916 --> 48:09.086
to, if they're already on prescr
what does that do when you have

48:09.620 --> 48:09.820
them first?

48:11.288 --> 48:15.459
MICKY SHARMA: So, in terms of wh
to the services at the universit

48:16.794 --> 48:19.764
center is, it forces us to look
ways to reach students.

48:21.232 --> 48:24.034
So, as I mentioned before, we do
center -- the individual therapy

48:25.503 --> 48:28.839
one thing that we do, but we als
who provide treatment. But we a

48:30.307 --> 48:34.345
other forms of resources to prov
such as psychoeducational progra

48:35.813 --> 48:39.250
group counseling that we provide
more students simultaneously, an

48:40.284 --> 48:42.653
matching the services to a parti
need.

48:44.121 --> 48:47.725
I often tell our faculty and sta
a student is crying doesn't mean

48:49.193 --> 48:52.062
needs psychotherapy. Sometimes,
the emotional response that I wa

48:53.531 --> 48:56.734
So we're looking at getting the
of service to match an individua

48:57.168 --> 48:57.101
need.

48:58.569 --> 49:00.571
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Mic
Jennifer Ruark, thanks so much f

JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
an essay: a new occasional featu

"NewsHour" bringing, we hope, a
on provocative issues.

49:23.828 --> 49:27.798
Tonight, we hear from author Jos
He gives us his thoughts on the

49:29.266 --> 49:33.170
property, such as inventions, li
artistic works, and what it mean

49:33.637 --> 49:33.637
stolen.

JOSHUA COHEN, Author: What's the
that a pirate is afraid of. The

I remember hearing that joke whe
years old. I remember the guy I

His name was Herman Pollack (ph)
older guy around the synagogue a

a lot of jokes, and a lot of the
pirates.

49:54.658 --> 50:00.231
Why did the pirate quit his ship
poetry? He did it for the love o

Anyway, this guy from the synago

I owe Herman Pollack or his heir
of whatever I'm earning?

I remember clicking on some site
and some of the jokes on the sit
