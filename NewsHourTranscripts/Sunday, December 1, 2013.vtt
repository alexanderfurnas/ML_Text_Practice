07:37.700 --> 07:39.667
WORTH FUNDED PUBLIC EMPLOYEE

07:39.667 --> 07:39.967
PENSION SYSTEM IN THE NATION

07:39.967 --> 07:41.733
ESTIMATES ARE THAT IT IS

07:41.733 --> 07:43.933
UNDERFUNDED BY $100 BILLION.

07:43.933 --> 07:45.333
THE SITUATION SO SERIOUS THA

07:45.333 --> 07:47.033
ACCORDING TO ONE RECENT REPORT

07:47.033 --> 07:49.267
ABOUT 20 CENTS OF EVERY TAXPAYER

07:49.267 --> 07:50.433
DOLLAR IN ILLINOIS IS NOW USED

07:50.433 --> 07:53.733
TO PAY FOR PENSIONS.

07:53.733 --> 07:53.967
BUT ON WEDNESDAY, STAT

07:53.967 --> 07:56.033
LEGISLATORS ANNOUNCED

07:56.033 --> 07:57.267
TENTATIVE BIPARTISAN DEAL TO

07:57.267 --> 07:58.967
ADDRESS THE PROBLEM.

07:58.967 --> 08:00.633
FOR MORE ABOUT ALL THIS, WE'RE

08:00.633 --> 08:02.800
JOINED FROM CHICAGO BY SAR

08:02.800 --> 08:03.000
BURNETT.

08:03.000 --> 08:03.967
SHE'S WITH THE ASSOCIATED PRES

08:03.967 --> 08:04.933
AND HAS BEEN REPORTING THI

08:04.933 --> 08:05.133
STORY.

08:05.133 --> 08:07.967
WHAT'S THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS

08:07.967 --> 08:08.633
POTENTIAL DEAL

08:08.633 --> 08:10.400
>> WELL, THE BIGGEST CHANGE IS

08:10.400 --> 08:13.000
THAT IT AFFECTS THE COST O

08:13.000 --> 08:15.533
LIVING INCREASES, THOSE ANNUAL

08:15.533 --> 08:17.700
INCREASES THAT RETIREES RECEIV

08:17.700 --> 08:18.700
ON THEIR PENSION BENEFITS TO

08:18.700 --> 08:21.633
KEEP UP WITH THE COST OF LIVING.

08:21.633 --> 08:23.933
SO IT WILL REDUCE THOS

08:23.933 --> 08:25.000
INCREASES FROM THE CURRENT

08:25.000 --> 08:25.133
LEVEL.

08:25.133 --> 08:26.433
SOME OF THE WORKERS WHO HAVE

08:26.433 --> 08:28.367
WORKED THE LONGEST AND RECEIVE

08:28.367 --> 08:30.633
THE SMALLEST SALARIES WILL

08:30.633 --> 08:32.067
CONTINUE TO GET INCREASES AT THE

08:32.067 --> 08:34.467
LEVEL THEY DO CURRENTLY, BUT

08:34.467 --> 08:36.867
MOST EVERYONE ELSE WILL SE

08:36.867 --> 08:39.433
THEIR BENEFITS GROW AT A MUC

08:39.433 --> 08:39.967
SLOWER RATE.

08:39.967 --> 08:43.067
OTHER THAN THAT, IT'S RAISIN

08:43.067 --> 08:44.767
THE RETIREMENT AGE AND MAKIN

08:44.767 --> 08:47.267
SOME OTHER CHANGES IN HOW TH

08:47.267 --> 08:50.167
STATE DIRECTS MONEY TO THOSE

08:50.167 --> 08:50.433
FUNDS.

08:50.433 --> 08:52.033
>> SO PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CRITICA

08:52.033 --> 08:53.033
ABOUT THIS PROCESS AS IT'S BEE

08:53.033 --> 08:54.267
HAPPENING FROM BOTH SIDES.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.800
SOME CONSERVATIVES SAY THESE

08:55.800 --> 08:57.133
CUTS DON'T GO FAR ENOUGH AND

08:57.133 --> 08:59.167
SOME OF THE LABOR UNIONS SAY

08:59.167 --> 09:01.467
THIS IS ALMOST UNCONSTITUTIONA

09:01.467 --> 09:06.400
AND TOO DEEP A CUT

09:06.400 --> 09:07.633
>> YES, EXACTLY.

09:07.633 --> 09:09.867
THEY BELIEVE THIS PLAN I

09:09.867 --> 09:10.100
UNCONSTITUTIONAL

09:10.100 --> 09:11.733
THE LABOR UNIONS HAVE ALREAD

09:11.733 --> 09:14.367
SAID THAT IF IT PASSES THE

09:14.367 --> 09:15.933
LEGISLATURE ON TUESDAY, THEY'L

09:15.933 --> 09:18.167
FILE A LAWSUIT TO HAVE IT THROWN

09:18.167 --> 09:19.167
OUT.

09:19.167 --> 09:20.200
THEIR BELIEF IS THAT THESE

09:20.200 --> 09:22.167
PUBLIC WORKERS AND THESE

09:22.167 --> 09:24.200
RETIREES SPENT THEIR CAREERS

09:24.200 --> 09:25.467
PAYING INTO RETIREMENT SYSTEMS

09:25.467 --> 09:26.833
HOLDING UP THEIR END OF TH

09:26.833 --> 09:28.133
BARGAIN WHILE THE STATE DID NOT.

09:28.133 --> 09:30.500
THEN IT'S UNFAIR FOR THEM TO CUT

09:30.500 --> 09:31.833
THEIR BENEFITS TO THE DEGREE

09:31.833 --> 09:32.500
THEY'RE BEING CUT.

09:32.500 --> 09:35.000
THE LABOR UNIONS DID PROPOSE A

09:35.000 --> 09:35.933
COMPROMISED DEAL EARLIER IN TH

09:35.933 --> 09:37.400
YEAR, BUT IT COULDN'T GE

09:37.400 --> 09:38.733
THROUGH THE HOUSE BECAUS

09:38.733 --> 09:40.033
LAWMAKERS THERE DIDN'T THINK I

09:40.033 --> 09:41.133
SAVED ENOUGH MONEY

09:41.133 --> 09:43.333
>> AND SO HOW UNIQUE IS TH

09:43.333 --> 09:44.233
ILLINOIS STATE CONSTITUTION?

09:44.233 --> 09:47.400
ARE THERE -- IS THIS A CASE THAT

09:47.400 --> 09:47.733
OTHER STATES ARE GOING TO STUD

09:47.733 --> 09:49.900
AND SAY, WAIT, YOU KNOW WHAT, WE

09:49.900 --> 09:51.067
HAVE A VERY SIMILAR CLAUSE

09:51.067 --> 09:54.167
THE OUTCOME MATTERS TO US AS

09:54.167 --> 09:54.300
WELL

09:54.300 --> 09:58.167
>> MANY STATES HAV

09:58.167 --> 09:59.867
CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS

09:59.867 --> 10:01.733
YOU'VE SEEN MANY, MANY OTHER

10:01.733 --> 10:03.500
STATES HAVE ALREADY DEALT WITH

10:03.500 --> 10:04.933
THESE PROBLEMS AND ARE FIGHTIN

10:04.933 --> 10:06.433
THEM OUT IN THE COURTS RIGHT

10:06.433 --> 10:06.567
NOW.

10:06.567 --> 10:09.200
WHAT I'VE BEEN TOLD IS THA

10:09.200 --> 10:09.733
ILLINOIS'S CONSTITUTIONA

10:09.733 --> 10:11.367
PROTECTION IS A PARTICULARLY

10:11.367 --> 10:13.300
ROCK-SOLID ONE COMPARED TO HOW

10:13.300 --> 10:14.900
THE LANGUAGE IS WRITTEN INTO

10:14.900 --> 10:15.767
SOME OTHER STATES.

10:15.767 --> 10:18.133
SO IT MAY NOT BE A

10:18.133 --> 10:19.033
APPLES-TO-APPLES COMPARISON, BUT

10:19.033 --> 10:20.033
CERTAINLY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE

10:20.033 --> 10:22.000
WATCHING THIS ONE BECAUSE IT I

10:22.000 --> 10:23.633
SUCH A HUGE CASE AND IT IS S

10:23.633 --> 10:25.500
CRITICAL TO THE FUTURE OF TH

10:25.500 --> 10:26.133
STATE'S FINANCES

10:26.133 --> 10:27.867
>> AND WHAT ABOUT THE FACT THA

10:27.867 --> 10:30.567
THIS IS A HEAVILY DEMOCRATIC

10:30.567 --> 10:30.733
STATE?

10:30.733 --> 10:32.367
IF THIS BIPARTISAN DEAL CAN BE

10:32.367 --> 10:33.600
AGREED ON AND REALLY CHALLENGE

10:33.600 --> 10:35.933
WHERE THE LABOR UNIONS SIT, CA

10:35.933 --> 10:37.733
THAT HAVE LONGER TERM OR WIDER

10:37.733 --> 10:39.667
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE LABOR

10:39.667 --> 10:40.300
MOVEMENT IN THE U.S.

10:40.300 --> 10:41.733
>> WELL, THAT IS ONE OF TH

10:41.733 --> 10:43.533
THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING

10:43.533 --> 10:43.967
AT

10:43.967 --> 10:47.433
YOU KNOW, LABOR HAS TAKE AN HI

10:47.433 --> 10:48.900
IN SOME SORT OF SURPRISING

10:48.900 --> 10:49.967
PLACES LIKE MICHIGAN IN RECENT

10:49.967 --> 10:50.100
YEARS.

10:50.100 --> 10:54.367
YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY THIS WOULD

10:54.367 --> 10:57.533
BE A BLOW TO THE LABOR UNIONS.

10:57.533 --> 10:58.567
THEY HAVE HAD A PRETTY AMICABL

10:58.567 --> 10:59.800
RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH

10:59.800 --> 11:02.933
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS UP T

11:02.933 --> 11:03.467
THIS POINT

11:03.467 --> 11:07.500
BUT IT WILL SET OFF WHAT I

11:07.500 --> 11:09.500
BELIEVE WILL BE SOME PRETT

11:09.500 --> 11:11.033
HOSTILE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE

11:11.033 --> 11:13.433
UNIONS AND THESE LAWMAKERS GOING

11:13.433 --> 11:13.700
FORWARD.

11:13.700 --> 11:16.867
>> SO WHAT IMPACT DOES THIS SORT

11:16.867 --> 11:18.700
OF A CREDIT CRUNCH HAVE FOR TH

11:18.700 --> 11:22.033
STATE OF ILLINOIS AND TH

11:22.033 --> 11:22.400
TAXPAYERS?

11:22.400 --> 11:24.067
>> WELL, THE REPEATED FAILURES

11:24.067 --> 11:29.000
BY THE LAWMAKERS TO COME UP WITH

11:29.000 --> 11:30.500
A SOLUTION FOR THIS PROBLEM HA

11:30.500 --> 11:32.333
LED THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES

11:32.333 --> 11:33.933
TO DOWNGRADE ILLINOIS'S RATING

11:33.933 --> 11:35.200
MULTIPLE TIMES OVER THE LAST

11:35.200 --> 11:35.967
SEVERAL YEARS.

11:35.967 --> 11:37.733
ILLINOIS NOW HAS THE LOWES

11:37.733 --> 11:39.133
CREDIT RATING OF ANY STATE I

11:39.133 --> 11:39.600
THE NATION

11:39.600 --> 11:41.200
THAT MEAN WHEN IS THEY GO TO

11:41.200 --> 11:43.133
SELL BONDS, BORROW MONEY, FO

11:43.133 --> 11:44.933
CAPITAL PROJECTS, ROADS, THING

11:44.933 --> 11:47.467
IT LIKE THAT, TAXPAYERS IN

11:47.467 --> 11:50.300
ILLINOIS ARE PAYING A HIGHER

11:50.300 --> 11:50.433
INTEREST RATE ON THAT BORROWED

11:50.433 --> 11:52.633
MONEY THAN TAXPAYERS IN AN

11:52.633 --> 11:54.333
OTHER STATE.

11:54.333 --> 11:55.700
AT THE SAME TIME, IN ORDER T

11:55.700 --> 11:57.667
MAKE THESE PAYMENTS EACH YEAR,

11:57.667 --> 12:01.700
AS YOU MENTIONED IN THE INTRO,

12:01.700 --> 12:03.733
THE STATE IS PUTTING ABOUT 2

12:03.733 --> 12:05.567
CENTS OF EVERY DOLLAR INTO THE

12:05.567 --> 12:05.733
PENSION FUNDS.

12:05.733 --> 12:07.033
THAT'S MONEY THAT COULD BE GOING

12:07.033 --> 12:08.067
TO SCHOOLS

12:08.067 --> 12:09.167
THERE ARE SOCIAL SERVICE

12:09.167 --> 12:10.600
AGENCIES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN PAID

12:10.600 --> 12:12.500
WHAT THE STATE OWES THEM FOR

12:12.500 --> 12:15.367
MONTHS AT A TIME

12:15.367 --> 12:16.433
THEY'VE GOT -- I THINK IT'

12:16.433 --> 12:18.833
CLOSE TO $8 BILLION BACKLOG OF

12:18.833 --> 12:21.433
UNPAID BILLS SITTING I

12:21.433 --> 12:22.567
SPRINGFIELD, WAITING TO BE PAI

12:22.567 --> 12:23.633
BECAUSE THERE ISN'T MONEY TO D

12:23.633 --> 12:23.700
IT

12:23.700 --> 12:25.967
>> SO WHAT ARE THE CHANCES

12:25.967 --> 12:28.000
NOW, THIS COMING WEEK WE'R

12:28.000 --> 12:30.033
GOING TO HAVE THIS BE SORT O

12:30.033 --> 12:31.433
PROPOSED MAYBE IN BOTH SECTIONS,

12:31.433 --> 12:32.933
THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE IN TH

12:32.933 --> 12:34.000
STATE LEGISLATURE?

12:34.000 --> 12:34.533
>> CORRECT

12:34.533 --> 12:36.333
WE'RE EXPECTING THIS TO MOVE

12:36.333 --> 12:37.200
FAIRLY QUICKLY ON TUESDAY.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.667
THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE WIL

12:38.667 --> 12:40.667
BOTH COME IN, AND BOTH CHAMBER

12:40.667 --> 12:43.367
CAN ADDRESS IT ON THAT DAY

12:43.367 --> 12:46.300
IT HAS THE SUPPORT OF TH

12:46.300 --> 12:47.233
DEMOCRATIC AND THE REPUBLICA

12:47.233 --> 12:48.633
LEADERS IN BOTH CHAMBERS

12:48.633 --> 12:50.767
AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THA

12:50.767 --> 12:52.300
THERE HAS BEEN ANY PENSION

12:52.300 --> 12:52.567
PROPOSAL

12:52.567 --> 12:54.433
THERE HAVE BEEN PREVIOUS

12:54.433 --> 12:55.533
PROPOSALS THAT THE TWO CHAMBER

12:55.533 --> 12:57.000
COULDN'T AGREE ON OR THE TWO

12:57.000 --> 12:58.933
PARTIES COULDN'T AGREE ON.

12:58.933 --> 13:00.567
THIS IS THE FIRST ONE THAT HAS

13:00.567 --> 13:02.800
THE SUPPORT FROM ALL FOUR OF

13:02.800 --> 13:04.933
THOSE LEADERS, WHICH MAKES IT,

13:04.933 --> 13:06.600
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS IS

13:06.600 --> 13:07.600
THE BEST CHANCE YET.

13:07.600 --> 13:08.000
>> OKAY.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.600
SO STEPPING BACK FOR A SECOND,

13:09.600 --> 13:12.067
IS THERE A LESSON THAT OTHER

13:12.067 --> 13:13.633
STATES CAN LEARN IN PREVENTING

13:13.633 --> 13:17.367
THEMSELVES FROM GETTING IN SUC

13:17.367 --> 13:19.000
AN HUNDRED-BILLION-DOLLAR MESS

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
>> YES, THERE'S PROBABLY A LOT

13:20.000 --> 13:21.367
OF LESSONS TO BE LEARNED FRO

13:21.367 --> 13:22.633
THE THINGS THAT ILLINOIS HAS

13:22.633 --> 13:24.567
DONE WRONG HERE.

13:24.567 --> 13:26.500
FIRST OF ALL, THE LEGISLATURES

13:26.500 --> 13:28.100
GOING BACK FOR DECADES

13:28.100 --> 13:28.900
REPUBLICAN AND

13:28.900 --> 13:29.600
DEMOCRAT-CONTROLLE

13:29.600 --> 13:30.433
LEGISLATURES, FOR YEARS AN

13:30.433 --> 13:32.867
YEARS DID NOT PUT IN THEIR

13:32.867 --> 13:33.933
REQUIRED CONTRIBUTION INTO THESE

13:33.933 --> 13:34.700
PENSION FUNDS.

13:34.700 --> 13:36.767
THEY AGREED TO CERTAIN BENEFITS,

13:36.767 --> 13:38.000
AND THEN INSTEAD OF PUTTING TH

13:38.000 --> 13:39.600
MONEY AWAY TO PAY FOR THEM, THEY

13:39.600 --> 13:44.733
USED THAT MONEY FOR SOMETHIN

13:44.733 --> 13:45.800
ELSE

13:45.800 --> 13:47.567
NOW, OBVIOUSLY, THE UNFUNDED

13:47.567 --> 13:48.667
LIABILITY HAS GROWN TO THE POINT

13:48.667 --> 13:50.033
WHERE THAT CANNOT CONTINUE ANY

13:50.033 --> 13:50.300
LONGER

13:50.300 --> 13:51.633

18:25.933 --> 18:30.800
OUR REASON FOR PUTTING IT IN THE

19:06.800 --> 19:09.233
INSTEAD OF TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS OF

19:09.233 --> 19:12.200

19:12.600 --> 19:14.167
KNOW THEM AND TALK TO THEM

I WANTED TO KNOW THEM SO I COULD

PHOTOGRAPH THEM AND PASS ON THAT

19:16.133 --> 19:17.933
EXPERIENCE TO THE VIEWERS.

ABOUT THE PERSON IN THE PICTUR

19:48.333 --> 19:49.667
AS THE PHOTOGRAPHER HIS OR

19:49.667 --> 19:49.900
HERSELF.

19:49.900 --> 19:52.167
IT'S THE PHOTOGRAPHER'S CHOICE

19:52.167 --> 19:53.800
THAT MADE THE PORTRAIT A

19:53.800 --> 19:54.333
POWERFUL AS IT IS.

19:54.333 --> 19:56.300
THE BETTER THE PORTRAIT, THE

19:56.300 --> 19:57.433
MORE UNIVERSAL IT BECOMES.

19:57.433 --> 19:58.567
IT BECOMES EVERY SOLDIER

19:58.567 --> 20:00.800
IT BECOMES NOT A SPECIFIC ONE.
