RUSSIA AND TURKEY AGREED TO A

04:21.328 --> 04:21.828 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEAL.

04:21.828 --> 04:22.762 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TURKEY IS ONE OF THE MAIN

04:22.762 --> 04:23.864 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BACKERS OF THE REBELS, AND

04:23.864 --> 04:25.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIA IS THE MOST POWERFUL

04:25.732 --> 04:27.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BACKER OF THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT,

04:27.667 --> 04:28.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVING BAILED IT OUT WITH AIR

04:28.969 --> 04:31.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRIKES AND POLITICAL SUPPORT.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.039 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND, YOU KNOW, AT THE SAME TIME,

04:33.039 --> 04:34.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE OTHER CRUCIAL ALLIES,

04:34.474 --> 04:35.809 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE IRAN, WHICH HAS PROVIDED

04:35.809 --> 04:39.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOUSANDS OF MILITIA MEMBERS TO

BOLSTER THE GROUND FORCES OF THE

SYRIAN ARMY.

04:42.816 --> 04:43.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WERE OTHER COMPLICATIONS

04:43.917 --> 04:46.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THE AL QAEDA-LINKED

04:46.086 --> 04:47.053 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AL-NUSRA FRONT.

04:47.053 --> 04:49.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WERE NOT FULLY COOPERATING

04:49.222 --> 04:50.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT

04:50.423 --> 04:51.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PART OF THE DEAL, EITHER, NOT

04:51.858 --> 04:53.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:01.201 --> 05:02.068 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE THE PEOPLE HELPING THEM

05:02.068 --> 05:03.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE, THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT

05:03.003 --> 05:04.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN ABLE TO LEAVE?

05:04.371 --> 05:06.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE THING IS, DURING THE FOUR

05:06.540 --> 05:07.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARS OF THE WAR, WHEN ALEPPO

05:07.941 --> 05:10.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS A DIVIDED CITY, SOME FORM OF

05:10.443 --> 05:12.345 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALTERNATE STRUCTURE SPRANG UP IN

05:12.345 --> 05:13.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EASTERN REBEL-HELD ALEPPO.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WERE INTERNATIONAL AID

05:15.215 --> 05:16.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORGANIZATIONS.

05:16.049 --> 05:18.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WERE THE LOCAL BRANCH OF

05:18.451 --> 05:20.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SYRIAN-- THERE WERE

05:20.387 --> 05:23.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
N.G.O.s SPONSORED BY SYRIANS

05:23.723 --> 05:25.725 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABROAD AND TURKEY AND OTHERS.

05:25.725 --> 05:30.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS, WHEN THE

05:30.263 --> 05:31.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REBEL DEFENSES REALLY COLLAPSED

05:31.731 --> 05:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THERE WAS PRETTY MUCH MASS

05:32.966 --> 05:35.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHAOS ON THAT SIDE OF THE LINE,

05:35.235 --> 05:37.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LOT OF PEOPLE WENT TO

05:37.938 --> 05:39.839 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WESTERN ALEPPO.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T WANT TO

05:41.107 --> 05:42.742 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GO THERE FLED DEEPER INTO THE

05:42.742 --> 05:43.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REBEL-HELD DISTRICTS, AND THAT

05:43.910 --> 05:46.213 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCLUDED MANY OF THESE REBEL

05:46.213 --> 05:47.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORKERS AND AID WORKERS.

05:47.814 --> 05:49.783 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL THOSE FACILITIES BASICALLY

05:49.783 --> 05:52.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE BOMBED OR DESTROYED OR FELL

05:52.052 --> 05:56.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO CHAOS.

05:56.723 --> 05:57.457 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANF SOME OF THE WORKERS WENT TO

05:57.457 --> 05:58.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OTHER SIDE.

05:58.258 --> 05:59.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME WENT TO REBEL AREAS.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WHOLE SYSTEM HAS MORE OR

06:00.026 --> 06:00.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LESS COLLAPSED SO PEOPLE ARE

06:00.961 --> 06:01.761 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY IN THE WORST STATE

06:01.761 --> 06:02.562 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'VE BEEN IN.

06:02.562 --> 06:03.530 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF CIVILIANS

06:03.530 --> 06:04.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEFT IN THERE.

06:04.297 --> 06:05.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE WAY WAITING IN RAIN AND

06:05.465 --> 06:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COLD EVERY DAY WAITING FOR THE

06:06.666 --> 06:08.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUSES TO COME TO EVACUATE THEM.

06:08.268 --> 06:09.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: IF WE ALL REMEMBER

06:09.536 --> 06:11.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BACK TO HOW THIS ALL BEGAN IN

06:11.504 --> 06:14.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
2011 IT REALLY WAS A PROTEST FOR

06:14.441 --> 06:17.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CIVIL RIGHTS AND FOR GOVERNMENT

06:17.244 --> 06:18.445 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REFORM.

06:18.445 --> 06:19.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THERE ANY OF THAT POLITICAL

06:19.913 --> 06:22.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL LEFT, OR IS THAT JUST GONE

06:22.115 --> 06:23.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BY THE WAYSIDE AND PEOPLE ARE

06:23.216 --> 06:25.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE?

06:25.151 --> 06:26.186 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, LOOK, THERE ARE

06:26.186 --> 06:26.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENT ISSUES.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.788 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WENT

06:28.788 --> 06:29.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVER TO THE GOVERNMENT

06:29.823 --> 06:31.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERRITORIES BECAUSE THEY JUST

06:31.258 --> 06:33.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULDN'T LIVE WITH MORE YEARS OF

06:33.193 --> 06:33.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOMBARDMENT.

06:33.793 --> 06:35.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY COULDN'T, YOU KNOW, STAY IN

06:35.528 --> 06:37.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AN AREA THAT WAS FULL OF

06:37.130 --> 06:39.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCREASING DIFFICULTIES WITH

06:39.899 --> 06:41.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAILY LIFE.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME OF THEM DEFINITELY

06:42.302 --> 06:43.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPRESSED TO US THAT THEY GOT

06:43.803 --> 06:44.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIRED.

06:44.337 --> 06:46.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REBELS DID NOT DELIVER WHAT

06:46.706 --> 06:48.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO.

06:48.508 --> 06:49.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SOME PEOPLE EVEN SAID THAT

06:49.509 --> 06:50.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REBELS PREVENTED THEM FROM

06:50.610 --> 06:51.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEAVING.

06:51.311 --> 06:53.046 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT EVERYBODY, AS I SAID, REBELS

06:53.046 --> 06:54.614 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE NOT UNITED.

06:54.614 --> 06:55.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IN SOME AREAS THEY SAID

06:55.615 --> 06:57.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REBELS HELPED THEM LEAVE.

06:57.484 --> 06:59.185 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ENERGIES THEY SAID THAT

06:59.185 --> 07:00.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REBELS PREVENTED THEM FROM

07:00.220 --> 07:01.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEAVING.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.922 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE POINT IS, I THINK THERE ARE

07:02.922 --> 07:04.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STILL PEOPLE THERE-- THERE STILL

07:04.357 --> 07:05.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXIST MANY SYRIANS WHO BELIEVE

07:05.992 --> 07:09.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE KINDS OF CIVIL GOVERNMENT

07:09.896 --> 07:11.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REFORMS THAT WERE INITIALLY

07:11.231 --> 07:12.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASKED FOR.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S ALSO MANY SYRIANS THAT

07:13.533 --> 07:16.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WANTED SOME KIND OF ISLAMIST-

07:16.670 --> 07:17.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FLAVORED GOVERNMENT.

07:17.537 --> 07:19.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S SOMETHING SYRIANS HAVE TO

07:19.205 --> 07:20.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORK OUT AMONG THEMSELVES.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.676 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ISSUE IS I DON'T THINK THERE

07:22.676 --> 07:25.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS ANY POLITICAL WILL ON THE

07:25.412 --> 07:26.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER SIDE, ON THE GOVERNMENT

07:26.513 --> 07:28.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIDE, TO MAKE ANY COMPROMISES OR

07:28.114 --> 07:29.749 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN DISCUSS COMPROMISES AT THIS

07:29.749 --> 07:30.684 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POINT.

07:30.684 --> 07:31.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE WINNING

07:31.451 --> 07:33.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY DON'T SEE THE NEED TO

07:33.453 --> 07:34.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGE ANYTHING.

07:34.587 --> 07:36.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN FACT, THEY DISPUTE THE VERY

07:36.089 --> 07:37.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IDEA THAT THIS WHOLE THING

07:37.123 --> 07:38.224 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STARTED WITH LEGITIMATE

07:38.224 --> 07:39.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICAL DEMANDS, AND THEY

07:39.592 --> 07:42.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAINT THE ENTIRE UPRISING AS A

07:42.729 --> 07:44.864 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOREIGN-LED CONSPIRACY THAT WAS

07:44.864 --> 07:46.032 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXTREMIST AND ISLAMIST FROM THE

07:46.032 --> 07:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

CONTROLLED STATE LEGISLATURE IS

08:29.909 --> 08:31.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT TAKING THE LOSS LIGHTLY.

08:31.511 --> 08:32.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YESTERDAY, IT PASSED LAWS

LIMITING THE POWER OF THE

08:34.180 --> 08:35.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCOMING GOVERNOR.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE STRIPS HIM OF THE POWER TO

08:37.550 --> 08:39.252 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APPOINT A MAJORITY OF

08:39.252 --> 08:41.020 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

08:54.934 --> 08:56.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

HILL, AND HE JOINS ME NOW TO

09:02.509 --> 09:03.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISCUSS THESE DEVELOPMENTS.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROFESSOR, LET'S START REALLY

09:05.145 --> 09:07.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BROAD AND THEN WE'LL DRILL DOWN.

09:07.013 --> 09:09.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY DID THIS HAPPEN?

09:09.082 --> 09:09.816 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THAT'S A VERY GOOD

09:09.816 --> 09:10.383 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LEGISLATURE HAD INITIALLY

09:12.385 --> 09:13.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CALLED IT A SPECIAL SESSION TO

09:13.787 --> 09:15.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEAL WITH DISASTER RELIEF, AND

09:15.422 --> 09:16.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEN THEY EXTENDED IT TO

09:16.756 --> 09:18.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSIDER OTHER BILLS.

09:18.625 --> 09:19.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WAS SOME CONCERN ABOUT

09:19.392 --> 09:20.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE ELSE THE LEGISLATURE WOULD

09:20.827 --> 09:21.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GO, AND NOW WE HAVE A SENSE OF

09:21.961 --> 09:23.163 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE THEY'VE GONE.

09:23.163 --> 09:23.830 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: AND WHY DID THEY

09:23.830 --> 09:24.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GO THERE?

09:24.764 --> 09:26.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THEY'VE CLAIMED THAT THEY'VE

09:26.699 --> 09:27.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONE THIS IN PART BECAUSE THEY

09:27.967 --> 09:29.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE

09:29.235 --> 09:30.437 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNORSHIP OF NORTH CAROLINA

09:30.437 --> 09:32.539 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEING TOO POWERFUL A POSITION,

09:32.539 --> 09:34.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO THEY WANT TO CONSTRAIN

09:34.007 --> 09:34.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT.

09:34.774 --> 09:36.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HISTORICALLY, THOSE OF US WHO

09:36.876 --> 09:38.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOLLOW THESE THINGS DON'T THINK

09:38.511 --> 09:39.245 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE GOVERNORSHIP OF NORTH

09:39.245 --> 09:40.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAROLINA AS BEING A VERY

09:40.713 --> 09:41.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POWERFUL OFFICE.

09:41.481 --> 09:42.649 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S ONE OF THE LAST STATES IN

09:42.649 --> 09:43.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COUNTRY TO GIVE THE

09:43.616 --> 09:45.652 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNORSHIP VETO POWER.

09:45.652 --> 09:46.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S BEEN A PRETTY WEAK OFFICE

09:46.886 --> 09:49.022 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYWAY AND IS NOW WEAKER BECAUSE

09:49.022 --> 09:50.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE LEGISLATURE'S ACTIONS.

09:50.623 --> 09:51.324 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: IS THAT WHY SOME

09:51.324 --> 09:54.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID IT WAS A NEEDED REALIGNMENT

09:54.627 --> 09:58.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF POWER WHILE OTHER PEOPLE ARE

09:58.865 --> 09:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAYING IT'S AN OVER-REACH?

09:59.566 --> 10:01.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

10:01.067 --> 10:02.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU SIT ON

10:02.702 --> 10:03.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT DIVIDE.

10:03.536 --> 10:05.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF YOU AGREE WITH THE OUTCOMES,

10:05.305 --> 10:06.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU WOULD SAY, YES, WE'RE JUST

10:06.172 --> 10:08.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRYING TO CONSTRAIN A GOVERNOR

10:08.007 --> 10:09.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM DOING THINGS WE DON'T AGREE

10:09.008 --> 10:11.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH, AND ON THE OTHER SIDE,

10:11.010 --> 10:13.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAYING THIS IS TO UNDERMINE AN

10:13.146 --> 10:17.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCOMING GOVERNOR, BY LIMITING

10:17.817 --> 10:20.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DISCRETION FURTHER.

10:20.587 --> 10:21.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: SOME OF THE

10:21.287 --> 10:22.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRITICISM IS NOT JUST THAT IT

10:22.222 --> 10:25.692 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENED BUT HOW IT HAPPENED.

10:25.692 --> 10:29.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW DID IT HAPPEN SO QUICKLY?

10:29.929 --> 10:32.031 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT HAPPENED VERY FAST BECAUSE

10:32.031 --> 10:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE A LEGISLATURE THAT IS

10:34.400 --> 10:35.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VETO-PROOF.

10:35.201 --> 10:38.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S GOT SUCH A STRONG CONTROL

10:38.705 --> 10:42.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT

10:42.275 --> 10:44.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT PARTY'S LEADERS CAN PRETTY

10:44.844 --> 10:46.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUCH DO WHATEVER THEY WANT IN

10:46.513 --> 10:47.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LEGISLATURE.

10:47.747 --> 10:48.715 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT'S WHAT WE SAW.

10:48.715 --> 10:49.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK IN PART THIS HAPPENS,

10:49.949 --> 10:51.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRANKLY, BECAUSE I THINK THE

10:51.784 --> 10:53.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEGISLATURE BELIEVES IT CAN DO

10:53.253 --> 10:54.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS KIND OF THING AND GET AWAY

10:54.487 --> 10:55.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH IT.

10:55.221 --> 10:57.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEEP IN MIND THAT MANY OF THESE

10:57.257 --> 10:58.658 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE-- IN FACT ALL OF THEM--

10:58.658 --> 11:01.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE JUST RE-ELECTED IN PRETTY

11:01.694 --> 11:02.595 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAFE SEATS.

11:02.595 --> 11:04.464 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE MAJORITY AND SUPER-

11:04.464 --> 11:05.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAJORITY OF THE STATE

11:05.164 --> 11:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEGISLATURE FEELS SECURE

11:06.466 --> 11:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICALLY.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: THIS MOVE IS

11:08.167 --> 11:09.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GETTING NATIONAL ATTENTION AND

11:09.435 --> 11:11.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION BUT

11:11.571 --> 11:13.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW FROM YOU IS

11:13.072 --> 11:15.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT'S THAT LOCAL ELEMENT OF IT,

11:15.708 --> 11:17.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT NORTH CAROLINIAN ELEMENT,

11:17.577 --> 11:18.711 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT DOG WHISTLE THAT YOU FOLKS

11:18.711 --> 11:19.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEAR THAT MAYBE WE DON'T

11:19.846 --> 11:22.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NECESSARILY KEY INTO?

11:22.181 --> 11:23.249 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE OF

11:23.249 --> 11:23.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINGS.

11:23.683 --> 11:24.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE IS, OF COURSE, I'M AT THE

11:24.951 --> 11:26.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.588 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY, AND

11:28.588 --> 11:30.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN THAT.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.291 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE

11:31.291 --> 11:33.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATE LEGISLATURE DID YESTERDAY

11:33.426 --> 11:35.828 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS IT RESTRICTED THE GOVERNOR

11:35.828 --> 11:36.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM MAKING ANY APPOINTMENTS TO

11:36.896 --> 11:37.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE

11:37.931 --> 11:39.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA.

11:39.098 --> 11:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE GOVERNOR-ELECT, ROY

11:41.100 --> 11:42.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOPER, HAD MADE PUBLIC

11:42.235 --> 11:44.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EDUCATION A REAL FOCUS OF HIS

11:44.103 --> 11:45.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAMPAIGN.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE

11:46.472 --> 11:48.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIMITATIONS NOW PLACED ON HIM.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO HIS ABILITY TO INFLUENCE THE

11:51.077 --> 11:51.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FUTURE DIRECTION OF THE

11:51.911 --> 11:53.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNIVERSITY HAS BEEN LIMITED, TO

11:53.112 --> 11:53.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME EXTENT.

11:53.780 --> 11:55.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN THERE ARE OTHER AREAS

11:55.048 --> 11:56.816 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN WHICH THE STATE LEGISLATURE

11:56.816 --> 11:58.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REDESIGNED THINGS.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR EXAMPLE, YOU MENTIONED THE

11:59.018 --> 12:01.254 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATE ELECTION SYSTEM, ELECTION

12:01.254 --> 12:01.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOARD.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT REALIGNMENT IS LIKELY TO

12:04.524 --> 12:05.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAKE IT HARDER, IF NOT

12:05.825 --> 12:08.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE CURRENT-- THE

12:08.461 --> 12:09.329 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNOR-ELECT TO BE ABLE TO

12:09.329 --> 12:11.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFLUENCE ELECTION BOARDS, WHICH

12:11.197 --> 12:12.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEANS THE CURRENT PEOPLE IN

12:12.565 --> 12:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POWER WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN

12:13.833 --> 12:14.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POWER.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: SOMETHING ELSE

12:15.468 --> 12:17.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERESTING ABOUT NORTH CAROLINA

12:17.070 --> 12:18.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY

12:18.705 --> 12:21.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELIABLY A RED STATE OR A BLUE

12:21.007 --> 12:22.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATE IN 2016.

12:22.775 --> 12:24.277 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S REALLY QUITE PURPLE AND

CAROLINA THAT YOU THINK IS

12:34.320 --> 12:35.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPORTANT FOR US TO PAY

12:35.221 --> 12:36.389 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTENTION TO, IN TERMS OF THE

12:36.389 --> 12:37.323 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHOLE COUNTRY?

12:37.323 --> 12:38.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> NORTH CAROLINA MAY BE TO SOME

12:38.958 --> 12:40.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXTENT A MICROCOSM OF THE

12:40.093 --> 12:41.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIVIDE THAT WE SEE ACROSS THE

12:41.294 --> 12:42.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRY.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.529 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COUNTRY, OBVIOUSLY, WAS VERY

12:43.529 --> 12:44.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIVIDED INSOFAR AS THE LAST

12:44.731 --> 12:45.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WAS

12:45.765 --> 12:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCERNED.

12:46.666 --> 12:48.901 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND NORTH CAROLINA, I THINK, IS,

12:48.901 --> 12:50.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO SOME EXTENT, A PURPLE STATE

12:50.603 --> 12:52.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE OF THE DIVISIONS.

12:52.238 --> 12:53.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THOSE DIVISIONS ARE NOT JUST

12:53.506 --> 12:55.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTY-WIDE BETWEEN REPUBLICAN

12:55.575 --> 12:56.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND DEMOCRAT.

12:56.142 --> 12:57.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE DIVISIONS BETWEEN URBAN

12:57.577 --> 12:59.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND RURAL AS WELL.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S A DIVISION OVER VALUES.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.415 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WE SEE THOSE DIVISIONS WORK

13:02.415 --> 13:03.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEMSELVES OUT WHEN THE

13:03.916 --> 13:05.284 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

13:05.284 --> 13:06.185 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: THE LEGISLATURE

13:06.185 --> 13:07.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DID... WHAT THEY DID WAS

13:07.654 --> 13:08.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERFECTLY LEGAL.

13:08.821 --> 13:10.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I'M WONDERING ABOUT OTHER

13:10.256 --> 13:12.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES THAT HAVE THIS SORT OF

13:12.058 --> 13:13.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAME SPLIT WITHIN THE

LEGISLATURE BETWEEN DEMOCRATS

13:14.861 --> 13:16.029 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND REPUBLICANS.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE SIX OTHER STATES THAT

13:17.263 --> 13:18.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE THIS SPLIT.

13:18.398 --> 13:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS WHAT HAPPENS IN NORTH

13:19.966 --> 13:21.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAROLINA, COULD THAT SET A

13:21.067 --> 13:22.602 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRECEDENT FOR OTHER STATES?

13:22.602 --> 13:24.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, IT COULD.

13:24.103 --> 13:25.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I-- I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY

13:25.605 --> 13:27.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT THAT THIS WOULD BE UPHELD

13:27.240 --> 13:29.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS LEGAL, BUT YOU'RE EXACTLY

13:29.375 --> 13:30.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT TO SORT OF CALL ATTENTION

13:30.376 --> 13:31.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

13:31.110 --> 13:33.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT OTHER STATES DO WILL BE

13:33.012 --> 13:33.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPORTANT.

13:33.746 --> 13:34.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS NORTH CAROLINA GOING TO BE AN

13:34.681 --> 13:36.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING TO FOLLOW?

13:36.716 --> 13:38.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR IS IT GOING TO BE AN EXAMPLE

13:38.317 --> 13:40.053 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
