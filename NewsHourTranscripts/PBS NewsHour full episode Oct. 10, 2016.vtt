HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.

00:05.572 --> 00:06.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

00:06.573 --> 00:08.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff are
away.

00:08.308 --> 00:12.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: After
a contentious
debate, the nation's top
Republican won't

00:12.579 --> 00:17.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
defend Donald Trump, focusing
instead on trying
to keep control of the U.S.
House.

00:17.885 --> 00:21.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Also ahead this Monday:
Hurricane Matthew
leaves a path of destruction
throughout the

00:21.788 --> 00:26.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nation's Southeast, as dangerous
flooding
continues to threaten North
Carolina.

00:26.627 --> 00:29.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Ruth Bader Ginsburg in her
own words.

00:29.563 --> 00:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We sit down with the Supreme
Court justice
to talk about her new book and
breaking boundaries.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUTH BADER GINSBURG, Associate
Justice, U.S.
Supreme Court: When I graduated
from law school

00:36.470 --> 00:43.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in 1959, there wasn't a single
woman on any
federal bench.

00:43.110 --> 00:46.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It wouldn't be a realistic
ambition.

00:46.146 --> 00:54.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:54.154 --> 00:56.924 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:56.957 --> 01:06.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Twenty-nine
days to go until
the election, it's the day after
debate number

01:06.066 --> 01:10.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
two, and Donald Trump is
scrambling to save
his presidential bid.

01:10.203 --> 01:14.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the fallout from his lewd
remarks about
women cost him again today.

01:14.574 --> 01:16.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Lisa Desjardins reports.

01:16.343 --> 01:22.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: He is the
highest-ranking
Republican in the nation, and,
today, House

01:22.215 --> 01:26.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Speaker Paul Ryan drew a hard
line with his
party's nominee.

01:26.320 --> 01:30.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He won't defend Donald Trump,
and won't campaign
for him either.

01:30.357 --> 01:35.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A spokeswoman for Ryan told the
"NewsHour":
"The speaker is going to spend
the next month

01:35.329 --> 01:39.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
focused entirely on protecting
our congressional
majorities."

01:39.433 --> 01:43.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Ryan is still on the record
endorsing
Trump.

01:43.337 --> 01:48.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
About that, his spokeswoman
said: "There is
no update in his position" --
all this three

01:48.875 --> 01:56.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
days after The Washington Post
posted video
of Trump in 2005 using lewd
language and bragging

01:56.083 --> 01:59.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about making unwanted sexual
advances on women.

01:59.519 --> 02:04.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In last night's debate, Trump
again apologized
for the remarks, but mainly
argued that his

02:04.691 --> 02:06.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
words were simple bravado.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
This was locker room talk.

02:08.562 --> 02:12.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Today, Trump
took to Twitter
to lash out at the speaker.

02:12.432 --> 02:17.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wrote: "Paul Ryan should
spend more time
on balancing the budget, jobs
and illegal

02:17.104 --> 02:21.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immigration and not waste his
time on fighting
the Republican nominee."

02:22.009 --> 02:27.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Trump today was
sending a different
kind of signal to Pennsylvania
voters, waving

02:27.080 --> 02:30.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the Pittsburgh Steelers'
terrible towel and
talking of humility.

02:30.751 --> 02:34.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I'm not proud of
everything
that I have done in life.

02:34.287 --> 02:35.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I mean, who among us is?

02:35.489 --> 02:38.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is anybody totally proud of
every single element?

02:38.125 --> 02:43.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Meanwhile, for
Democrat Hillary
Clinton, the day after the
debate was occasion

02:43.163 --> 02:46.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to kick off a two-day,
three-college swing.

02:46.533 --> 02:50.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was back on the attack, this
afternoon
at Wayne State University in
Detroit.

02:50.404 --> 02:55.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I believe that every single one
of us in this

02:55.308 --> 03:00.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
room today has paid more in
federal income
taxes than Donald Trump has.

03:00.881 --> 03:05.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As Clinton
embarks on her
post-debate push, a new NBC
News/Wall Street

03:05.919 --> 03:11.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Journal poll conducted after the
Trump videotape
appeared showed she is widening
her lead over

03:11.858 --> 03:16.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump, with 46 percent in a
four-way race
to Trump's 35 percent.

03:16.563 --> 03:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Libertarian Gary Johnson and the
Green Party's
Jill Stein are in the single
digits.

03:20.634 --> 03:27.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, that poll was conducted
before a national
TV audience of around 60 million
people watched

03:27.174 --> 03:29.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the second Clinton-Trump debate
last night.

03:29.543 --> 03:33.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a few moments have cascaded
into questions
today.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: He and I haven't
spoken, and
I disagree.

03:35.982 --> 03:40.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That was Trump
disagreeing
with a stance on Syria that
moderator Martha

03:40.287 --> 03:44.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Raddatz attributed to his
running mate, Mike
Pence, that the U.S. should be
ready to use

03:44.925 --> 03:49.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
force against Russian ally and
Syrian leader
Bashar al-Assad.

03:49.096 --> 03:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pence's actual words from the
V.P. debate
added a qualifier:

03:53.100 --> 03:55.035 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE PENCE (R-IN), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
And if Russia chooses to be
involved and continue,

03:56.870 --> 04:00.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I should say, to be involved in
this barbaric
attack on civilians in Aleppo,
the United

04:00.674 --> 04:04.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States of America should be
prepared to use
military force.

04:04.244 --> 04:08.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: On CNN this
morning, Pence
stressed again he was speaking
about using

04:08.115 --> 04:11.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
force if Russia attacks
civilians in Aleppo.

04:11.718 --> 04:16.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's still a difference with
Trump, but
it's a narrower one than was
portrayed in

04:16.623 --> 04:18.091 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the debate.

04:18.125 --> 04:21.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there was one other moment,
on investigating
Hillary Clinton's e-mails:

04:21.495 --> 04:30.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: If I win, I am
going to instruct
my attorney general to get a
special prosecutor

04:30.137 --> 04:35.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to look into your situation,
because there
has never been so many lies, so
much deception.

04:35.442 --> 04:40.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The Clinton
campaign decried
those remarks as using power to
target political

04:40.514 --> 04:46.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opponents, but, this morning,
Trump campaign
manager Kellyanne Conway
indicated her boss'

04:46.353 --> 04:47.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
words were sarcastic.

04:47.554 --> 04:49.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY, Trump Campaign
Manager:
That was a quip.

04:49.289 --> 04:53.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I saw in NBC's own reporting
it was referred
it a quip, so I will go with NBC
on it.

04:53.293 --> 04:57.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Conway went on
to say that
Trump was venting the
frustrations of his

04:57.264 --> 04:58.231 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
voters.

04:58.265 --> 05:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

05:00.267 --> 05:05.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We will take a
closer look
at the campaign, and divisions
within Republican

05:05.505 --> 05:08.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ranks, right after the news
summary.

05:08.108 --> 05:12.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
desperation of
Aleppo, Syria, prompted Doctors
Without Borders

05:12.479 --> 05:17.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to appeal for access, amid a
Russian-Syrian
assault on the city.

05:17.284 --> 05:24.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The group supports eight
hospitals there,
but has only 35 doctors to help
275,000 civilians.

05:24.257 --> 05:27.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It says the wounded are sleeping
outside,
waiting for care.

05:27.861 --> 05:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Russia announced it
is creating
a permanent naval base in Syria
to increase

05:32.966 --> 05:35.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
its military presence in the
region.

05:35.435 --> 05:40.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The wind and rain have subsided,
but the damage
that Hurricane Matthew did is
far from over.

05:40.273 --> 05:45.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As of today, the storm is blamed
for hundreds
of deaths in Haiti, plus at
least 22 more

05:45.278 --> 05:52.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the U.S. Flooding extends
across five states,
with North Carolina hit the
hardest.

05:52.852 --> 05:58.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whole towns awash in water, the
legacy of
a long, stormy weekend across
Eastern North

05:58.124 --> 05:59.326 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Carolina.

05:59.359 --> 06:05.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALISHA BROOKS, North Carolina: I
don't have
nothing left.

06:05.398 --> 06:06.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Nothing.

06:06.499 --> 06:08.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have to take all this and put
it in the
garbage.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just want somewhere else to
go.

06:10.136 --> 06:13.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It's the worst
the state
has seen since Hurricane Floyd
in 1999, and

06:14.007 --> 06:16.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Governor Pat McCrory warned
today, it will
not end soon.

06:16.509 --> 06:18.278 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

06:18.311 --> 06:20.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAT MCCRORY (R), North Carolina:
The greatest
threat at this point in time
remains inland

06:20.880 --> 06:25.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
flooding that will continue
throughout this
week in both Central and Eastern
North Carolina.

06:25.552 --> 06:30.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Matthew dumped
a foot or
more of rain more than 100 miles
inland in

06:30.056 --> 06:35.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fayetteville, and eight inches
in Raleigh,
the state capital.

06:35.395 --> 06:39.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Lumberton, just south of
Fayetteville,
rescuers worked to evacuate
1,500 people after

06:39.933 --> 06:42.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a levee along the Lumber River
broke overnight.

06:42.802 --> 06:48.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The deluge also triggered scores
of rescue
missions Saturday night and
Sunday, with emergency

06:49.009 --> 06:51.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crews from as far away as New
York taking
part.

06:51.378 --> 06:54.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: All us had to pitch
together and help
people get out of their
apartments, get our

06:54.447 --> 06:55.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stuff out, and crawl through
water all night
long, babies, all children all
stuck in the

06:55.482 --> 07:00.153 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
water.

07:00.186 --> 07:06.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Nearly a
million homes and
businesses in the Carolinas were
still in

07:06.626 --> 07:10.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the dark today, plus thousands
more in Georgia
and Virginia.

07:10.830 --> 07:15.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parts of Interstate 95 were
flooded in several
places in North Carolina,
halting traffic

07:15.201 --> 07:17.671 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on a major north-south artery.

07:17.704 --> 07:23.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A number of roads and bridges
remained closed
in South Carolina as well, and
2,000 people

07:23.376 --> 07:25.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
were still in shelters.

07:25.111 --> 07:31.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, cleanup began
elsewhere in Savannah,
Georgia, where 17 inches of rain
fell and

07:31.484 --> 07:34.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Florida, where Governor Rick
Scott surveyed
coastal erosion today.

07:34.654 --> 07:36.356 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

07:36.389 --> 07:39.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICK SCOTT (R), Florida: We were
actually
blessed that this storm never
turned in and

07:39.125 --> 07:40.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
had a direct hit.

07:41.027 --> 07:45.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While we don't want to see the
devastation
we have seen behind us at all,
the most important

07:45.198 --> 07:47.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thing is to save everybody's
life.

07:47.400 --> 07:53.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The hurricane
did score
a direct hit on Haiti,
destroying whole towns.

07:53.473 --> 07:59.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Estimates of the dead there
range from 500
to 1,000, with a new outbreak of
cholera compounding

07:59.279 --> 08:01.047 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the crisis.

08:01.081 --> 08:06.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The United Nations called today
for a massive
response to get food, water and
shelter to

08:06.052 --> 08:08.054 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at least 750,000 Haitians.

08:08.088 --> 08:13.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We will look at what the
hurricane did to

Samsung faced a new debacle
today after reports
that replacement Galaxy Note 7
phones are

08:19.065 --> 08:22.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
overheating and catching fire,
just like the
originals.

08:22.369 --> 08:25.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The company said it is
temporarily adjusting
production schedules.

08:25.305 --> 08:29.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It didn't confirm reports that
it halted production
entirely.

08:29.309 --> 08:35.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Samsung recalled the original

PER STROMBERG, Chairman,

Thanks to their

08:54.734 --> 09:01.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
research, we now have -- can
analyze not just
financial terms, who should get
paid what,

09:01.040 --> 09:07.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but also the control and
decision rights,
ownership, property rights and
other types

09:07.614 --> 09:09.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

the Republican Party.

10:02.502 --> 10:07.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: With the mass
defection of high-profile
Republicans from their
presidential nominee,

10:07.340 --> 10:12.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has the divide between Donald
Trump and the
GOP establishment become
irreconcilable?

10:12.645 --> 10:17.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We explore that question now
with Tom Davis,
a former member of Congress who
was in charge

10:17.650 --> 10:21.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of electing Republicans to the
House, and
Barry Bennett, a Donald Trump
supporter and

10:21.921 --> 10:23.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
former campaign senior adviser.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gentlemen, thank you both for
joining us.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Davis, let me start with
you.

10:27.827 --> 10:32.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The House speaker this morning
said he's not
going to defend Donald Trump,
he's not going

10:32.465 --> 10:36.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to campaign with him, he's going
to focus
on the House and Senate.

10:36.736 --> 10:39.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is he saying that he thinks the
presidential
race is over?

10:39.172 --> 10:41.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM DAVIS (R), Former U.S.
Congressman: No,
I think he's saying he wants to
make sure

10:41.441 --> 10:44.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the House Republicans get
reelected and he
has a working majority.

10:44.978 --> 10:48.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This isn't different than what
he was telling
the House a month ago, which is,
you have

10:48.815 --> 10:50.250 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to look after your own district.

10:50.283 --> 10:52.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump is going to help
candidates in
some districts.

10:52.585 --> 10:55.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In some districts, he's going to
a liability
and candidates are going to have
to do what

10:55.889 --> 10:57.156 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they have to do.

10:57.190 --> 11:00.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But his number one
responsibility isn't to
elect a president.

11:00.293 --> 11:01.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's to reelect the House
members.

11:01.961 --> 11:06.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when I was campaign chairman
in 2000,
it was actually a similar
arrangement with

11:06.466 --> 11:09.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
George W. Bush, where they went
out and did
their thing and we did out
things.

11:10.003 --> 11:14.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We coordinated to some extent,
but it was
up to each individual member in
terms of how

11:14.641 --> 11:16.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they were going to handle it.

11:16.409 --> 11:19.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But, Mr. Bennett,
with all these
Republicans, with so many
Republicans over

11:19.479 --> 11:24.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the weekend who -- many of them
in tough races,
many of them running for
reelection, saying

11:24.551 --> 11:29.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that they are no longer
supporting Donald
Trump, is that the smart move?

11:29.255 --> 11:33.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRY BENNETT, Former Trump
Campaign Senior
Adviser: Well, the smart move is
to recognize

11:33.526 --> 11:37.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the issues that he's
talking about and
how people are reacting to them
and talk about

11:37.297 --> 11:39.165 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those issues.

11:39.198 --> 11:43.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, if this were an
election on personality,
Donald Trump would be down by
100 points.

11:43.469 --> 11:49.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, Hillary has spent $200
million pointing
out his perfectly obvious
imperfections.

11:49.175 --> 11:52.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the issues that he talks
about are why
people rally around him.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think it would be smart
for all candidates
to think about those issues.

11:55.481 --> 11:57.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: We have had -- let's
stay with
you.

11:57.584 --> 12:02.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have had Donald Trump
tweeting out that
maybe Paul Ryan should be
focusing on balancing

12:02.488 --> 12:07.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the budget, creating jobs and
immigration
and not fighting with him, that
Kellyanne

12:07.460 --> 12:15.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Conway this morning talked about
inappropriate
behavior by some of the
Republicans who are

12:15.368 --> 12:17.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
now turning against him.

12:17.870 --> 12:21.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are we lining up with this sort
of one wing
of the party vs. another wing of
the party?

12:21.874 --> 12:23.343 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BARRY BENNETT: I hope not.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I hope we're lining up with
people who are
in real pain across America.

12:25.445 --> 12:26.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's what we should be talking
about.

12:26.779 --> 12:28.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's all Mr. Trump should be
talking about.

12:28.481 --> 12:31.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are people out there that
haven't had
a real increase in real wages in
a really

12:31.584 --> 12:32.785 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
long time.

12:32.819 --> 12:33.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's what he should be talking
about.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't care what Paul Ryan
does.

12:35.488 --> 12:39.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paul Ryan's duty, as Tom's was,
is to help
elect members to the House.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tom was very good at it.

12:41.127 --> 12:43.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Speaker Ryan needs to raise
a lot of money
to those done.

12:43.262 --> 12:45.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they don't need to be
talking about each
other.

12:45.264 --> 12:47.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

12:47.066 --> 12:49.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM DAVIS: John, I don't think
there is any
question, though, that the Trump
constituency

12:49.702 --> 12:53.640 align:left position:0%,start line:66.67% size:100%
that came in, to some extent,
was anti-establishment,
and that means
anti-congressional
establishment.

12:53.673 --> 12:55.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is some tension there.

12:55.541 --> 13:00.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question is, can they
coexist and get
along and maximize both their
outputs to produce

13:00.446 --> 13:04.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a Republican Congress and
perhaps elect a
Republican president?

13:04.450 --> 13:05.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, of course, there are
tensions there.

13:05.918 --> 13:07.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What is the answer to
that question?

13:07.587 --> 13:09.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Can they get along and how can
they get along?

13:09.188 --> 13:10.256 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

13:10.289 --> 13:12.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM DAVIS: Well, I think members
-- it just
depends.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In some districts, you have
members endorsing
Trump, running with Trump,
coming to his Trump

13:15.028 --> 13:16.796 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rallies.

13:16.829 --> 13:19.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In other districts, you won't be
able to find
them with a search if Trump
comes to town.

13:19.065 --> 13:20.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It really depends.

13:20.166 --> 13:22.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we have always had to run
our own races.

13:22.068 --> 13:26.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have found, in my district out
here in Northern
Virginia, after a couple of
terms, there were

13:26.139 --> 13:30.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very few Republicans I could
really appear
with without hurting myself.

13:30.543 --> 13:34.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You were trying to be a team
player, but,
first of all, you owe yourself
and the caucus

13:34.414 --> 13:36.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a duty to get reelected.

13:36.215 --> 13:39.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Donald Trump performs very
well in some
districts, and in some
districts, he's not.

13:39.752 --> 13:43.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Bennett, over the
weekend,
we saw Paul Ryan actually get
booed when he

13:43.923 --> 13:52.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talked about the situation, the
videotape,
and that Trump wasn't with him,
as he was

13:52.532 --> 13:54.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
scheduled to be.

13:54.333 --> 14:00.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When Joe Heck in Nevada, a
Senate candidate,
withdrew his endorsement of Mr.
Trump, he

14:00.273 --> 14:01.674 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
got booed.

14:01.708 --> 14:06.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there a risk for candidates
who are jumping
off the Trump bandwagon?

14:06.913 --> 14:08.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BARRY BENNETT: Yes.

14:08.581 --> 14:12.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, no one's ever
successfully sawed a
boat in half and floated to
safety.

14:12.151 --> 14:15.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Once we're in the boat, we're in
the boat.

14:15.421 --> 14:19.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need the presidential race --
if not it's
winnable, we need it to be very
close in order

14:19.358 --> 14:23.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for those House and Senate races
like Joe
Heck to get across the line.

14:23.129 --> 14:25.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, you have got to be very
careful.

14:25.331 --> 14:30.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can have your own opinions,
but realize
that 40 or 50 or 60 percent of
your supporters

14:30.870 --> 14:31.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are still with him.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So don't go too far.

14:33.840 --> 14:39.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Davis, if you
were running
the Congressional Campaign
Committee now,

14:39.579 --> 14:43.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what would you be telling
challengers, what
would be your members who are
running for

14:43.816 --> 14:44.784 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
reelection?

14:44.817 --> 14:45.785 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

14:45.818 --> 14:46.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TOM DAVIS: Well, it's district
by district.

14:46.819 --> 14:48.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think you look at the top
of the ticket.

14:48.554 --> 14:51.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it helps you, you want to try
to latch
onto those coattails and ride
across the line.

14:51.457 --> 14:55.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the wind is coming at you,
you are going
to have to basically personalize
the district,

14:55.361 --> 14:57.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
carve your own identity, make
this a referendum
on you.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
By the way, the NRCC has been
pretty successful.

15:00.666 --> 15:05.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Katko's district up in
Syracuse, he's
running double digits ahead, and
Mr. Trump

15:05.271 --> 15:07.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is running double digits behind.

15:07.373 --> 15:09.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Everybody understands this.

15:09.809 --> 15:13.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Professionals understand you do
what you have
to do to get reelected at this
point.

15:13.546 --> 15:17.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump's remarks, nobody's
going to attach
themselves to those remarks.

15:17.483 --> 15:19.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You won't find anybody coming
forward.

15:19.452 --> 15:23.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that doesn't necessarily
mean you abandon
ship, because, once you divide
yourself up,

15:23.322 --> 15:26.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have seen very few cases where
parties survive
that kind of thing.

15:26.726 --> 15:32.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Bennett, no
matter what happens
at the top of the ticket in
November, this

15:32.498 --> 15:36.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anti-establishment feeling that
you have been
talking about is going to be
there.

15:36.669 --> 15:38.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's going to continue and it's
going to exist.

15:38.938 --> 15:42.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What does the Republican Party
look like moving
forward?

15:42.608 --> 15:44.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What does it do moving forward,
win or lose?

15:44.610 --> 15:50.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because even if Donald Trump is
elected president,
he will have to deal with this
Congress that

15:50.349 --> 15:55.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is the establishment that so
many of his supporters
hate right now.

15:55.354 --> 15:59.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARRY BENNETT: Well, I think the
Freedom Caucus
probably gets larger.

15:59.091 --> 16:01.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that there's going to be
more turmoil.

16:01.127 --> 16:06.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that if we think the
scary stuff
is over now, wait until after
the election,

16:06.399 --> 16:10.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because the winner is probably
only going
to get 46, 47 percent of the
vote, so more

16:10.837 --> 16:13.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people will have not voted for
them than voted
for them.

16:13.673 --> 16:17.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the next four years in
Washington, I don't
predict calm seas.

16:17.310 --> 16:22.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What would you do,
Mr. Davis, if
you were running a party and, if
you were

16:22.481 --> 16:24.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the RNC chairman?

16:24.250 --> 16:26.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How would you move forward after
the election,
no matter who wins?

16:26.652 --> 16:27.887 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM DAVIS: Well, look, we have
got to learn
how to coexist.

16:29.689 --> 16:32.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What the Republicans have found
in my state
of Virginia is, even when
they're united,

16:32.892 --> 16:35.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
given the Democratic shifts, we
lose sometimes.

16:35.328 --> 16:38.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you are going to have to
learn to coexist,
everybody get a piece of things
and try to

16:38.798 --> 16:40.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
line up accordingly.

16:40.566 --> 16:42.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to primaries,
instead of conventions.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that's a good thing in
this state.

16:44.303 --> 16:48.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it shouldn't jeopardize the
Trump supporters
either, who won primaries.

16:48.941 --> 16:51.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's the kind of thing where
we are going
to have to learn to coexist.

16:51.644 --> 16:53.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Politics is parties are
coalitions.

16:53.512 --> 16:56.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And coalitions mean sometimes
you get in a
room with people you're not
quite comfortable

16:56.916 --> 16:58.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with to advance your own
interests.

16:58.851 --> 17:02.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Republicans have not
gotten comfortable
with their coalition.

17:02.255 --> 17:06.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats, which are also a
diverse coalition,
have learned to coexist and win.

17:06.058 --> 17:09.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Tom Davis, Barry
Bennett, thanks
so much for coming in and
discussing these

17:10.029 --> 17:11.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
interesting days with us.

17:11.163 --> 17:12.131 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

17:12.164 --> 17:13.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TOM DAVIS: Thank you.

17:13.165 --> 17:15.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BARRY BENNETT: Thanks.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That brings us
to our Politics
Monday duo, Amy Walter of The
Cook Political

17:17.904 --> 17:21.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Report and Tamara Keith of NPR,
joining us
tonight from Detroit.

17:21.407 --> 17:27.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Amy, let's start with this
evaporation
of support from some Republican
leadership.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.414 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Does it matter?

17:28.447 --> 17:30.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Oh,
it absolutely matters.

17:30.216 --> 17:35.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you think back to the 2012
election, Mitt
Romney, of course, lost the
campaign.

17:35.388 --> 17:39.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He lost while getting 93 percent
of the Republican
vote.

17:39.325 --> 17:44.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Getting less than 90 percent is
a big problem
in a country that is as
polarized as this.

17:44.864 --> 17:49.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so even if it's only 5 or 10
percent of
voters, not necessarily who even
just go out

17:49.468 --> 17:54.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and vote for Hillary Clinton,
but the bigger
concern, I think, for
Republicans down ballot

17:54.240 --> 17:57.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is that traditional Republican
voters stay
home.

17:57.510 --> 18:00.746 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They find themselves so
disgusted by this
race, they can't support Donald
Trump, they

18:00.780 --> 18:05.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't like Hillary Clinton, and
so they sit
on their hands, they don't turn
out.

18:05.551 --> 18:10.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is a bigger problem, I
think, for down-ballot
races than almost anything else.

18:10.456 --> 18:14.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tamara, what
does it mean
when the man, Paul Ryan, two
heartbeats away

18:14.226 --> 18:20.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the president, the leader
of the House,
says that he's not necessarily
unendorsing

18:20.333 --> 18:22.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump, but he's not
backing him, he's
not going to spend more effort?

18:22.668 --> 18:25.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: He's
in absolutely a tough position.

18:25.738 --> 18:31.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he's been in a tough
position, and really
the Trump candidacy has put a
ton of Republicans

18:31.344 --> 18:34.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in very tough positions.

18:34.080 --> 18:39.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From the Democratic perspective,
the Clinton
campaign today responding to
Paul Ryan, basically

18:39.218 --> 18:44.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said, Paul Ryan, you enabled
Donald Trump
for months throughout the summer
and before

18:44.724 --> 18:46.559 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

18:46.592 --> 18:51.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are intent on not
letting congressional
Republicans, including those
ones who are

18:51.130 --> 18:57.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unendorsing, get away with
trying to distance
themselves from Donald Trump.

18:57.703 --> 19:02.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we're very close to
this point
in a campaign where potentially
you are going

19:02.274 --> 19:07.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to have congressional
candidates, Republican
congressional candidates
running, saying,

19:07.646 --> 19:12.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
let's assume Hillary Clinton is
going to be
president, reelect me or elect
me so that

19:12.084 --> 19:16.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we can have a Republican Senate
and a Republican
House to serve as a
counterbalance to the

19:16.422 --> 19:18.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
person they assume will be the
president of
the United States.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is a pretty remarkable
moment.

19:20.626 --> 19:22.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And that
happened during
the Clinton...

19:22.294 --> 19:23.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: During the '96...

19:23.529 --> 19:25.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Right.

19:25.398 --> 19:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Right, during the
'96 campaign,
there was concerted effort by
the House and

19:27.433 --> 19:32.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senate campaign committees to
basically concede
the presidential race and say,
vote for Republican

19:32.271 --> 19:37.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidate X to make sure that
Clinton, then
Bill Clinton, doesn't get a
blank check.

19:37.076 --> 19:39.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this has been happening
throughout the
campaign, Hari.

19:39.311 --> 19:44.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen the Republican
Party divided,
come back together, divide, come
back together.

19:44.817 --> 19:49.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we are now only 30 days from
the election,
and so the question is, does it
come back

19:49.388 --> 19:54.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
together like it always does, or
are we going
to see it continue to be
divided, dispirited

19:54.994 --> 19:59.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and essentially you are going to
have this
big enthusiasm gap between those
who are going

19:59.432 --> 20:02.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to go out and support Hillary
Clinton and
those who are going to split the
Republicans?

20:02.668 --> 20:05.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tamara, late
in the afternoon,
we had the RNC come out and say:
We are still

20:05.971 --> 20:07.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
behind our candidate.

20:07.773 --> 20:13.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this sort of continued cause
to believe
about this rift inside the
Republican Party,

20:13.179 --> 20:17.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
almost a civil war, intentions
on who is supporting
who to be a true Republican?

20:17.817 --> 20:21.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, and there
had been rumors
over the weekend that Reince
Priebus was trying

20:21.720 --> 20:26.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to tamp down that the RNC was
cutting bait
and was going to pull its
support from Donald

20:26.892 --> 20:30.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump, financial support or
campaign support.

20:30.229 --> 20:35.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with this, Priebus is
essentially saying,
no, we're in it for our
candidate.

20:35.367 --> 20:38.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Priebus is in another tough
position.

20:38.504 --> 20:41.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have a large portion of the
Republican
base.

20:41.974 --> 20:46.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, there are people who are
Republicans
who say that they can't vote for
Donald Trump,

20:46.312 --> 20:50.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but there are a lot of people
who voted for
Donald Trump in the primaries
who are passionate

20:50.749 --> 20:57.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about his candidacy and do not
want establishment
Republicans or Beltway
Republicans to tell

20:57.957 --> 21:00.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them that they can't have their
candidate.

21:00.126 --> 21:03.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Amy, so, where
do voters fall on this divide
inside the Republican

21:03.796 --> 21:04.763 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Party?

21:04.797 --> 21:06.565 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

21:06.599 --> 21:12.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have had some polling
come out in the
wake of the videotape that came
out over the

21:12.638 --> 21:14.473 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weekend.

21:14.507 --> 21:19.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the question was asked --
The Wall Street
Journal poll asked voters who
are supporting

21:19.311 --> 21:23.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump, do you think that
this is enough
for the Republican Party to
distance themselves,

21:24.016 --> 21:28.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to ask him to step down, maybe
to repudiate
him?

21:28.320 --> 21:32.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Sixty-seven percent of
Republicans said, don't
do anything, right, Donald Trump
is in the

21:32.258 --> 21:36.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right, the party has no right to
basically
do any of those things.

21:36.095 --> 21:37.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sixty-seven percent is a big
number.

21:37.596 --> 21:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As Tam pointed out, that is not
a group of
voters you want to alienate.

21:40.866 --> 21:45.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, that means
that there is
another pretty sizable group of
Republicans

21:45.237 --> 21:52.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right now, or at least people
who would support
Donald Trump, who say, I don't
know that I

21:52.278 --> 21:55.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can continue to have him at the
top of ticket.

21:55.147 --> 22:01.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that is a very, very
difficult spot to
be, especially if you are a
candidate running

22:01.387 --> 22:05.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Congress in one of these
districts like
Tom Davis did, suburban, where
you have a

22:05.524 --> 22:12.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
lot of voters who are
independent, maybe are
Republican by nature, but
feeling very alienated

22:12.531 --> 22:13.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by the party at this point.

22:13.999 --> 22:16.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tamara, first
I guess your
impressions on the debate.

22:16.502 --> 22:19.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, so it was a
tough debate.

22:19.772 --> 22:20.973 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It was rough.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was hard to watch.

22:22.942 --> 22:28.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was -- I got messages from
lots of people
saying, oh, my gosh, I have a
pit in my stomach

22:28.480 --> 22:29.515 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
watching this.

22:29.548 --> 22:34.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In the end, you know, Donald
Trump went nuclear.

22:34.386 --> 22:36.088 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He really did.

22:36.121 --> 22:40.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He brought out the big thing
that he said
he had been threatening to bring
out for a

22:40.092 --> 22:41.427 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
long time.

22:41.460 --> 22:44.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I don't know that it
materially changed
the state of the race.

22:44.997 --> 22:51.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It certainly excites his base,
but it's not
clear that it was any sort of a
knockout blow

22:52.004 --> 22:53.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
against Hillary Clinton.

22:53.839 --> 22:58.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She, you know, today, at her
rally said, how
about that debate, and got the
biggest applause

22:58.644 --> 23:00.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the day again.

23:00.312 --> 23:06.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for people who support her,
she did a
fine job, and they were happy
with it.

23:06.585 --> 23:10.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in terms of broadening the
ways, Donald
Trump appealed to his base, but
I don't know

23:11.023 --> 23:15.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he appealed to people who
were looking,
trying to figure out what to do
in this election.

23:15.961 --> 23:17.563 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

23:17.596 --> 23:18.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a lot of talk about, is
the floor
going to drop out on Donald
Trump?

23:18.897 --> 23:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump has never had a
floor problem.

23:20.966 --> 23:23.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The people who are with him are
always going
to be with him.

23:23.335 --> 23:26.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's say that is 35, 40 percent
of the electorate.

23:26.338 --> 23:28.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
His problem is a ceiling
problem.

23:28.140 --> 23:32.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he has never been able to
expand it very
high, in part because he keeps
going back

23:32.344 --> 23:36.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and talking to the people who
make up his
floor, instead of trying to go
to the people

23:36.181 --> 23:38.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who can expand his ceiling.

23:38.851 --> 23:45.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that scorched earth campaign
that he ran
yesterday at the debate to me
suggests that

23:45.090 --> 23:48.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's the kind of thing we're
going to see
for the next 30 days, which
means there is

23:48.927 --> 23:52.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no reaching out, there is no
broadening, there's
no pivoting.

23:52.064 --> 23:58.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is all about, can I get
those people
who love me, who come to my
rallies to continue

23:58.370 --> 24:00.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to support me at the same rate?

24:00.306 --> 24:03.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's, though, not a winning
coalition.

24:03.575 --> 24:05.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a coalition, though, that
he likes to
spend time with.

24:05.878 --> 24:08.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It's also one
of the first
times that we have had a
candidate essentially

24:08.414 --> 24:10.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
threaten to throw the other one
in jail if
he wins.

24:10.416 --> 24:15.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes, I mean, we have
never seen
anything quite like that.

24:15.321 --> 24:19.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And his campaign will say, well,
it wasn't
actually -- he quipped about it.

24:19.625 --> 24:22.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the fact of the matter is,
he said, I'm
going to -- first of all, I'm
going to have

24:22.795 --> 24:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this -- the Justice Department
appoint a special
prosecutor to investigate
somebody who lost

24:27.700 --> 24:29.368 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a campaign.

24:29.401 --> 24:35.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, as an aside, he said,
well, if I
were president, you would be in
jail.

24:35.040 --> 24:38.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is not something that
anybody has ever
seen before.

24:38.844 --> 24:44.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, again, to the
voters who are
looking to see could they
picture Donald Trump

24:44.750 --> 24:48.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as president, where their number
one concern,
at least that I hear from a lot
of these especially

24:48.454 --> 24:53.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women voters, worried about his
temperament,
that is the sorts of thing that
keeps them

24:53.625 --> 24:55.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- you know, keeps pushing them
away.

24:55.594 --> 24:59.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tamara, did
Hillary Clinton
reach out to any larger
audiences last night?

24:59.198 --> 25:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: There was a little
of that.

25:00.866 --> 25:03.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the campaign is continuing
that today.

25:03.869 --> 25:08.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Certainly, she delivered her
stronger together
message, which is, of course,
the theme of

25:08.240 --> 25:10.109 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
her campaign.

25:10.142 --> 25:15.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that is a message that is
intended to
reach people who aren't just
deep blue Democrats.

25:15.080 --> 25:19.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, today, her campaign is out
with four
ads that will be running in
swing states that

25:19.618 --> 25:25.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feature Republicans talking
about why they're
voting for her and not Donald
for Trump.

25:25.290 --> 25:31.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she's really presenting this
as a choice
of saying, voters know who
Donald Trump is,

25:31.430 --> 25:38.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but the way we vote will be --
will say who
we are, is the message that
she's delivering.

25:38.070 --> 25:42.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is a message that's aimed
at Republicans
and independents, and certainly
not just die-hard

25:42.708 --> 25:44.176 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Democrats.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Tamara Keith,
Amy Walter, thanks so much.

25:46.712 --> 25:47.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome,
Hari.

25:47.713 --> 25:49.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

25:49.681 --> 25:52.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And our
analysis and fact-checking
continues on our Web site, where
you can find

25:52.117 --> 26:06.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the top five debate takeaways
from our politics
team.

26:06.432 --> 26:10.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We turn now to the ongoing civil
war in Yemen,
where the civilian death toll
grew over the

26:10.235 --> 26:12.004 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weekend.

26:12.037 --> 26:16.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 140 people died after
what witnesses
say was an airstrike on a
funeral Saturday

26:16.442 --> 26:18.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the capital city of Sanaa.

26:18.343 --> 26:23.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Saudi air force has been
bombing the country
for months, with logistical
assistance from

26:23.182 --> 26:28.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.S. Reports from the scene
said it was
U.S.-made bombs that were
dropped on the funeral.

26:28.687 --> 26:34.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Saudi-backed government in
Yemen is fighting
Houthi rebels, as well as
al-Qaida forces.

26:34.259 --> 26:39.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At least 10,000 people have died
over the
last 18 months, and more than
million have

26:39.798 --> 26:41.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been displaced.

26:41.633 --> 26:47.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Sunday, a U.S. Navy
guided missile
destroyer in the Red Sea was
targeted by Houthi

26:47.406 --> 26:49.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
missiles fired from the Yemeni
coast.

26:49.708 --> 26:53.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Navy says the missiles
detonated short
of the target, leaving the ship
untouched.

26:53.712 --> 26:57.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We begin with this report from
Neil Connery
of Independent Television News.

26:57.483 --> 27:03.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL CONNERY: They're burying
the dead in
Sanaa, dozens of burials for
those killed

27:03.555 --> 27:05.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in this weekend's funeral
attack.

27:05.657 --> 27:15.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the streets, thousands came
to mourn the
capital's governor, his picture
looking down

27:15.701 --> 27:24.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on his own procession.

27:24.776 --> 27:30.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The governor was one of hundreds
of people
packed into the funeral hall
when it was hit

27:30.115 --> 27:32.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by a Saudi-led coalition
airstrike.

27:32.317 --> 27:39.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But even as they pay their
respects to the
governor's family, the jets are
back again,

27:39.091 --> 27:46.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their roar heard overhead.

27:46.265 --> 27:52.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Sanaa buries its dead, there
is rising
anger at the weekend funeral
attack, and,

27:52.237 --> 27:55.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with it, calls for revenge.

27:55.607 --> 27:58.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hopes for peace here have never
seemed so
far away.

27:58.944 --> 28:03.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: It means to us war.

28:03.181 --> 28:06.852 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We need war.

28:06.885 --> 28:10.389 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will kill or be killed.

28:10.422 --> 28:14.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's for us, blood for blood,
and eye for
eye.

28:14.092 --> 28:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL CONNERY: Yemen's tragedy
has a new chapter,
the single deadliest attack in
its 19-month

28:21.567 --> 28:23.268 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
war.

28:23.302 --> 28:28.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the capital, as they cover
the graves of
its victims, how many more will
follow?

28:28.707 --> 28:31.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And to Jeffrey
Brown.

28:31.109 --> 28:34.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yesterday,
Secretary of State
Kerry spoke with Saudi officials
and called

28:34.947 --> 28:37.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for an immediate cessation of
hostilities.

28:37.883 --> 28:42.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a National Security Council
spokesman
said that the U.S. would review
its support

28:42.154 --> 28:44.156 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the Saudi-led coalition.

28:44.189 --> 28:49.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on the situation, I'm
joined by Michael
Hanna, a senior fellow at the
Century Foundation.

28:49.661 --> 28:51.463 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome to you.

28:51.496 --> 28:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was already so much
concern and anger
over civilian casualties and
deaths in this

28:54.967 --> 28:55.934 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
conflict.

28:55.968 --> 28:57.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How important is this new
incident?

28:57.903 --> 28:59.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL HANNA, Senior Fellow,
Century Foundation:
Well, it's gotten a lot more
attention than

29:00.005 --> 29:01.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this war usually does.

29:01.907 --> 29:09.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's partly
because of the nature
of this attack and the scope of
the damage.

29:09.648 --> 29:11.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This was a really horrific
attack.

29:11.483 --> 29:21.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It happened on a funeral hall
with a huge
number of senior Yemeni figures,
tribal figures

29:21.093 --> 29:23.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and political leaders.

29:23.762 --> 29:29.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it does seem like a
difference in time,
like a red line had been crossed
in bombing

29:29.468 --> 29:32.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this kind of funeral gathering.

29:33.005 --> 29:37.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for that reason, it's gotten
a lot of
attention and a lot of negative
attention.

29:37.376 --> 29:40.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the reaction of the United
States has
been different.

29:40.846 --> 29:45.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen horrific bombings
in the past,
but this has elicited a
different kind of

29:45.851 --> 29:47.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
response from the United States.

29:47.653 --> 29:51.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Before we get to
that, just
remind us briefly where things
stand in this

29:51.423 --> 29:52.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
conflict in Yemen.

29:52.591 --> 29:55.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what's behind the Saudi-led
bombing?

29:55.427 --> 30:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL HANNA: Well, the Saudi
military campaign
began in March of 2015, so it's
been going

30:01.967 --> 30:03.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on about a year-and-a-half.

30:03.869 --> 30:09.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, Yemen and Saudi
are border
countries, so Saudi has looked
at Yemen differently

30:09.141 --> 30:14.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than it does at other conflicts,
say, Syria,
for example.

30:14.212 --> 30:20.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That being said, it is quite
different to
see Saudi Arabia engaged in
direct military

30:20.385 --> 30:21.620 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
conflict.

30:21.653 --> 30:25.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They began a military campaign
about a year-and-a-half
ago.

30:25.090 --> 30:26.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were joined by other Gulf
states.

30:26.792 --> 30:31.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, they are getting
support from
the United States and the United
Kingdom.

30:31.697 --> 30:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so this is a difference in
kind.

30:34.733 --> 30:39.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think Saudi Arabia sees the
region changing.

30:39.071 --> 30:41.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's quite concerned about the
influence of
Iran.

30:41.973 --> 30:48.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It sees in the Houthis, the
rebel movement
that essentially overthrew the
government

30:48.513 --> 30:53.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Yemen, as a kind of extension
of Iranian
influence, as a proxy force.

30:54.019 --> 30:58.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while the United States has
a differing
view of the conflict, doesn't
necessarily

30:58.690 --> 31:06.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agree about the Saudi analysis
of the conflict,
it has clearly reached a point
for Saudi Arabia

31:06.064 --> 31:10.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in its own calculations that
enough is enough.

31:10.569 --> 31:16.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some of this is about
establishing deterrent
capacity and trying to change
the kind of

31:16.742 --> 31:18.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
regional balance of power at the
moment.

31:18.877 --> 31:22.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so, to the
extent the
U.S. has supported this Saudi
effort, and

31:22.848 --> 31:27.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
yet there have been many
strains, particularly
over casualties among civilians.

31:27.919 --> 31:29.154 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What now?

31:29.187 --> 31:32.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When they talk about a review,
what do you
see happening?

31:32.290 --> 31:35.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL HANNA: Well, I think
it's high time
that there is a review.

31:35.293 --> 31:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The statement by the NSC this
weekend suggested
that U.S. security operation is
not a blank

31:41.166 --> 31:42.901 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
check.

31:42.934 --> 31:47.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, for a long time
now, the United
States has hoped that the Saudis
and others

31:47.205 --> 31:52.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would essentially declare
victory and focus
on a political settlement.

31:52.811 --> 31:55.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that's still the
American position.

31:55.447 --> 31:58.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that has been voiced
publicly and privately.

31:58.683 --> 32:03.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do think this seems
different, that
the United States, because of
this latest

32:04.022 --> 32:10.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
incident, is going to be much
more keen in
bringing about a cessation of
hostilities,

32:10.562 --> 32:17.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and much more keen on focusing
on the diplomatic
track, which has sputtered on
through various

32:17.169 --> 32:21.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
iterations, but has failed to
have any kind
of lasting impact.

32:21.807 --> 32:26.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think the United States
has a very different
view about the utility -- the
continuing utility

32:26.845 --> 32:32.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this military campaign and
the prospects
for it to be particularly
successful in the

32:32.284 --> 32:33.585 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coming months.

32:33.618 --> 32:36.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
Michael Hanna, thank
you very much.

32:36.188 --> 32:42.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL HANNA: Thank you.

32:42.194 --> 32:53.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Earlier in the
program,
we told you about the
record-breaking flooding

32:53.271 --> 32:55.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in North Carolina.

32:55.106 --> 33:00.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hurricane Matthew also left a
wake of damage
on its way to North Carolina
along the coasts

33:00.245 --> 33:01.947 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of three states.

33:01.980 --> 33:06.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Billed as the oldest city in
America, St.
Augustine, Florida, was one of
the places

33:06.618 --> 33:08.420 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that felt the storm's might.

33:08.453 --> 33:13.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The small coastal town of nearly
14,000, which
dates back to the 16th century,
is only now

33:13.892 --> 33:16.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
emerging from this weekend's
storm.

33:16.394 --> 33:19.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was there yesterday.

33:19.397 --> 33:24.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It looked like one big garage
sale on Solana
Road in St. Augustine, Florida.

33:24.302 --> 33:30.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But everything in the front
yards was contaminated,
couches, mattresses, family
keepsakes all

33:30.876 --> 33:34.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
soaked by the floods after
Hurricane Matthew.

33:34.246 --> 33:38.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Families were racing to get it
all out before
the moisture turned to mold and
made its way

33:38.283 --> 33:40.085 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into the walls.

33:40.118 --> 33:41.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY SHAVER, Mayor of St.
Augustine, Florida:
When you evacuate, you take only
the things

33:41.987 --> 33:43.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that you really find
irreplaceable.

33:43.922 --> 33:50.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this is the whole -- these
are all the
things that may be replaceable,
but they're

33:50.262 --> 33:52.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what give you something to come
home to.

33:52.330 --> 33:55.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mayor Nancy
Shaver took
us to one of the low-lying areas
that was

33:55.967 --> 33:57.702 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
hardest-hit.

33:57.736 --> 34:02.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The sewer pumps were still
offline, meaning
underground waste was
overflowing onto the

34:02.874 --> 34:04.009 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
street.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Residents were only allowed back
into the
area Saturday.

34:06.678 --> 34:11.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY SHAVER: Your home is where
you're supposed
to go to be peaceful, restful,
be with your

34:11.950 --> 34:13.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
family, sleep, eat.

34:13.318 --> 34:15.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And none of these things are
possible in these
homes.

34:15.453 --> 34:19.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the
homeowners on
this block, the city manager,
John Regan.

34:19.224 --> 34:20.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What did you have to throw out?

34:20.592 --> 34:21.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN REGAN, City Manager, St.
Augustine, Florida:
Everything.

34:21.526 --> 34:22.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How many feet
of water?

34:22.494 --> 34:24.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN REGAN: My house was two
feet of water.

34:24.396 --> 34:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tasked with
coordinating
the city's recovery effort, now
working furiously

34:28.566 --> 34:29.834 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on his own.

34:29.868 --> 34:32.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN REGAN: And these houses are
at this level
of destruction.

34:32.771 --> 34:36.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: While trying
to salvage
what he could from his home, he
was also trying

34:36.708 --> 34:41.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to prevent more fires like the
ones the city
has been fighting every night
since the storm.

34:41.413 --> 34:44.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN REGAN: So, and all these
houses that
have been flooded, when we bring
the power

34:44.983 --> 34:47.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back, you got to be sensitive
that there's
no short-circuiting.

34:48.019 --> 34:52.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Regan is
luckier than some
just up the coast, who will
never move back

34:52.524 --> 34:54.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into their homes again.

34:54.326 --> 34:58.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The storm's waves gouged deep
beneath the
foundations of some homes, and
surge-driven

34:58.430 --> 35:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
waters lifted and washed away
everything they
could.

35:02.167 --> 35:06.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The debris is not limited to the
coastline,
but inlets as well.

35:06.037 --> 35:11.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marinas usually full of tourists
and boaters
are shut down because floating
junk is a danger

35:11.409 --> 35:14.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to boats and several docks have
lost their
moorings.

35:14.579 --> 35:18.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL HUNSICKER, Charter Boat
Captain: We're
ready to go fishing, but, at
this point, this

35:18.583 --> 35:20.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
marina, we can't get our boats
back in here.

35:20.852 --> 35:23.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Bill Hunsicker
captains
a charter boat for sport
fishermen.

35:23.989 --> 35:30.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says he can last two weeks
without customers
before he has to make tough
decisions.

35:30.495 --> 35:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the city's historic Old Town,
most businesses
remained shuttered, as they
dried out and

35:35.233 --> 35:36.301 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cleaned up.

35:36.334 --> 35:39.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: This is the oldest bar in
the oldest
city.

35:39.137 --> 35:43.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The local
watering hole
that rarely closes stopped for
Matthew.

35:43.475 --> 35:47.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Usually, we have a
hurricane party,
but, this year, we didn't have
any power.

35:47.112 --> 35:48.079 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
So...

35:48.113 --> 35:49.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: And it was a really bad
one.

35:49.114 --> 35:50.482 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Nobody wanted to be here.

35:50.515 --> 35:52.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JORGE RIVERA, Blogger: So, this
is where the
bulk of the water came.

35:52.450 --> 35:56.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Blogger Jorge
Rivera wanted
to stay and track the storm.

35:56.287 --> 35:59.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JORGE RIVERA: The water's up to
my waist.

35:59.090 --> 36:03.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: He captured
some of the
earliest scenes of Matthew's
arrival.

36:03.261 --> 36:05.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Over the weekend, he continued
to document
its toll.

36:05.530 --> 36:11.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JORGE RIVERA: This was scary,
because it's
not so much that the hurricane
is powerful.

36:11.536 --> 36:14.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's that you're in such a
vulnerable place.

36:14.472 --> 36:16.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now he wonders
whether it
would have been worth it.

36:16.775 --> 36:21.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JORGE RIVERA: The question is,
once they find
your body, they say, was he a
fool or was

36:21.546 --> 36:22.514 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he brave?

36:22.547 --> 36:23.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, I don't know.

36:23.548 --> 36:24.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't have an answer for that.

36:24.549 --> 36:26.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But Rivera
wasn't alone.

36:26.484 --> 36:31.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mayor Shaver says almost half
the city stayed
behind, many who didn't have the
means to

36:31.056 --> 36:36.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
evacuate and others who were
homeless and
out of reach, numbers she hopes
to change

36:36.394 --> 36:37.662 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the future.

36:37.695 --> 36:40.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you build in resilience
to face something
like this?

36:40.231 --> 36:44.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NANCY SHAVER: Well, this is a --
we have had
450 years of practice.

36:44.102 --> 36:46.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are an extraordinarily
resilient city.

36:46.671 --> 36:48.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a real community.

36:48.206 --> 36:51.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has a very rich fabric of
reaching out,
connecting and helping folks.

36:51.943 --> 36:55.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That sentiment
moved the
owners of Le Macaron to hand out
sweets to

36:55.980 --> 36:57.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their local firefighters.

36:57.916 --> 37:01.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Recent transplants from France,
they're overwhelmed
by the support

37:01.052 --> 37:08.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHANE JUSKOWIAK, Le Macaron:
Here, we see
this, and it's -- we don't have
this in Europe,

37:08.226 --> 37:09.394 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in France.

37:09.427 --> 37:13.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm sorry to say that, but,
here, it's very
different.

37:13.298 --> 37:19.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we -- there was lots of
people coming
every 15 minutes, saying, hey,
we can help

37:19.137 --> 37:20.905 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

37:20.939 --> 37:25.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This city has
soldiered
on through challenges for more
than 400 years.

37:25.043 --> 37:29.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
City hall, which was flooded,
reopened to
essential personnel today.

37:29.848 --> 37:35.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Online, a poet shares her
experience of hurricane
destruction and recovery.

37:35.520 --> 37:44.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Find that at PBS.org/NewsHour.

37:44.462 --> 37:57.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Next: combining sustainable
agriculture with
entrepreneurship in developing
countries.

37:57.809 --> 38:02.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Fred de
Sam Lazaro reports
from EARTH University, a campus
in Costa Rica

38:02.747 --> 38:04.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that aims to do just that.

38:04.749 --> 38:07.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His story is part of our Agents
for Change
series.

38:07.719 --> 38:13.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: It is quite
likely the
only university in the world
where traffic

38:13.358 --> 38:19.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stops for bananas, millions of
them wrapped
tightly in blue plastic.

38:19.764 --> 38:25.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EARTH University actually was a
commercial
banana plantation before being
converted in

38:25.937 --> 38:32.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1992 to a school to train
students from developing
countries grappling with climate
change and

38:32.143 --> 38:34.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
growing populations.

38:34.078 --> 38:38.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Funds came from the U.S. and
Costa Rican governments
and the Michigan-based Kellogg
Foundation.

38:38.983 --> 38:42.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE ZAGLUL, Co-Founder, EARTH
University:
When we first came to this
property, the whole

38:42.654 --> 38:48.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
river was contaminated with the
blue plastic
bag that also have chemical
inside to protect

38:48.526 --> 38:50.562 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it, to protect it from insects.

38:50.595 --> 38:56.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when the first group of
students came,
we brought them here and we
started to pick

38:56.634 --> 38:58.469 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all the plastic.

38:58.503 --> 39:03.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Today,
university co-founder
Jose Zaglul says the blue
plastic bags are

39:03.107 --> 39:09.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
recycled and tons of plant
waste, stalks,
fruit that don't make the grade.

39:09.681 --> 39:13.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Things that used to be discarded
are collected
and fed to livestock.

39:13.117 --> 39:17.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSE ZAGLUL: Now we don't use
chemicals in
the bags.

39:17.455 --> 39:20.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we also are using an organic
fungicide.

39:20.925 --> 39:27.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: These
bananas are labeled
as responsibly grown and sold
across the U.S.

39:28.032 --> 39:29.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Whole Foods stores.

39:29.934 --> 39:33.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The enterprise supports dozens
of local jobs
and scholarships.

39:33.204 --> 39:36.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSE ZAGLUL: That girl over
there, she's from
Panama.

39:36.441 --> 39:38.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This guy is from Brazil.

39:38.910 --> 39:42.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think she is from Ecuador.

39:42.947 --> 39:45.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That guy you see, he's from
Somaliland in
Africa.

39:45.650 --> 39:48.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Forty-three
countries
are represented here.

39:48.820 --> 39:53.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A majority of the 400 students
depend on financial
aid.

39:53.124 --> 39:57.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From 1,600 applications, about
110 are admitted
each year.

39:57.862 --> 40:05.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE ZAGLUL: What we attempt to
discover there
is their interest to go back to
their countries,

40:05.503 --> 40:13.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because we are about forming
leaders and individuals
that really overcome barriers.

40:13.845 --> 40:21.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Yves
Rusanganwa is a first-year
student from Rwanda born soon
after that country's

40:21.986 --> 40:23.755 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
genocide.

40:23.788 --> 40:27.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
YVES RUSANGANWA, EARTH
University: I grew
up hearing about hunger, hearing
about poverty,

40:27.525 --> 40:29.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hearing epidemic diseases.

40:29.761 --> 40:31.562 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I grew up in that environment.

40:31.596 --> 40:37.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, as I was growing up, I grew
up a passion
inside of me of doing something
in this world

40:37.902 --> 40:39.671 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and try to change that history.

40:39.704 --> 40:43.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Many
students say a lack
of knowledge hinders
productivity and keeps

40:43.975 --> 40:47.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
most farmers in their homelands
in poverty.

40:47.912 --> 40:54.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Devotha Tumushimiyimana is also
from Rwanda,
a nation the size of Maryland
with a population

40:54.218 --> 40:55.720 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of 11 million.

40:55.753 --> 40:57.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEVOTHA TUMUSHIMIYIMANA, EARTH
University:
My country is a small country.

40:57.722 --> 41:03.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I would like also to teach
people how
they can use -- I mean, how they
can do agriculture

41:03.995 --> 41:05.763 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in small land.

41:05.797 --> 41:10.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Jose Zaglul
says doing
agriculture on small land, or
even no land,

41:10.601 --> 41:12.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is an important part of the
curriculum.

41:12.503 --> 41:20.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE ZAGLUL: At home, in the
schools, in rooftops
in the cities, and you don't
have to utilize

41:20.278 --> 41:23.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so much energy and fossil fuels
to transport
them.

41:23.514 --> 41:28.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Across
campus, fruits
and vegetables are grown in
unlikely containers,

41:28.353 --> 41:30.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with unlikely tools.

41:30.154 --> 41:34.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE ZAGLUL: All the bottles,
you can fill
them with water, with -- and
then it's like

41:34.459 --> 41:36.260 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
drip irrigation.

41:36.294 --> 41:40.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The campus
tries to model
the ideal carbon-neutral world
it wants its

41:40.131 --> 41:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
graduates to help create.

41:41.966 --> 41:47.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Zaglul says that's sometimes
involved taking
risks, like the decision at the
start to keep

41:47.472 --> 41:49.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
producing bananas.

41:49.340 --> 41:55.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE ZAGLUL: It used to cost us
25 cents more
per box to do all the
sustainable practices.

41:55.079 --> 41:58.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And nobody would pay us for
that.

41:58.449 --> 42:04.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I tell you, we were losing
money, but we had
to show the students that it is
possible to

42:04.956 --> 42:06.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
do sustainable business.

42:06.791 --> 42:11.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Possible, he
says, because,
over time, recycling and not
using pesticides

42:11.429 --> 42:13.164 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
save money.

42:13.197 --> 42:17.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then came the right large
customer, Whole
Foods.

42:17.568 --> 42:24.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Besides the classroom and field
emphasis on
sustainable practices, students
are encouraged

42:24.275 --> 42:26.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to develop business ideas.

42:26.644 --> 42:31.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Twenty-three-year-old Diderot
Saintilma has
plans for when he returns to his
native Haiti.

42:31.983 --> 42:35.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DIDEROT SAINTILMA, EARTH
University (through
translator): Where I come from,
there are

42:35.787 --> 42:37.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a lot of peanut farmers.

42:37.355 --> 42:40.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They don't do very much
post-harvest processing.

42:40.358 --> 42:45.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I would like to start an
association or
cooperative of small peanut
farmers, so they

42:45.196 --> 42:46.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can get added value for
products.

42:46.898 --> 42:51.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Many
graduates have taken
ideas from here to the business
world.

42:51.803 --> 42:55.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For Costa Rican Joaquin Viquez,
it was animal
waste recycling.

42:55.940 --> 43:01.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Solids are separated to make
fertilizer, while
large bladders or bio-digesters
break down

43:01.813 --> 43:04.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
liquid wastes to capture
methane, or biogas.

43:04.782 --> 43:07.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOAQUIN VIQUEZ, EARTH University
Graduate:
This is like five times thinner
than what

43:07.785 --> 43:08.886 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we use now.

43:08.920 --> 43:11.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Its not new
technology,
he says.

43:11.155 --> 43:14.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It simply wasn't commercialized
for farms
in developing countries.

43:14.125 --> 43:17.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOAQUIN VIQUEZ: There was no one
you could
call or no store you could go
and say, hey,

43:18.029 --> 43:19.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I want a digester.

43:19.897 --> 43:25.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we made it technically
accessible and
we do a lot of efforts to make
it economically

43:25.636 --> 43:27.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
feasible for a farmer.

43:27.772 --> 43:34.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: On this day,
they were
installing a digester at the
Calderon family

43:34.779 --> 43:37.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
farm, about 100 head of dairy
and beef cows.

43:37.715 --> 43:42.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIA AGUILLAR CALDERON, Farmer
(through translator):
I took a course recently at the
National Institute

43:42.753 --> 43:46.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Learning, and they talked
about global
warming and hygiene.

43:46.390 --> 43:49.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I really came back wanting
to have a clean
farm.

43:49.460 --> 43:56.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I contacted a microfinance
agency, talked
to my husband and used our
savings to do this.

43:56.100 --> 44:01.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Viquez says
not only will
this family be reducing
greenhouse gases emitted

44:01.105 --> 44:06.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by unprocessed animal wastes,
but their energy
savings over time will more than
cover the

44:06.544 --> 44:08.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
digester's $3,400 cost.

44:08.479 --> 44:13.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOAQUIN VIQUEZ: They're not
going to have
to use any firewood or propane
for the cooking.

44:13.885 --> 44:15.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I know they're going to have
surplus.

44:15.486 --> 44:20.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Viquez is
one of about
2,000 EARTH University alumni.

44:20.091 --> 44:25.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jose Zaglul says each on average
has created
four other jobs, and their
influence has spread

44:25.830 --> 44:27.565 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in other ways.

44:27.598 --> 44:32.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Many commercial banana
producers, he says,
have adopted practices that
began here.

44:32.870 --> 44:38.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Fred de Sam
Lazaro in Guapiles, Costa Rica.

44:38.175 --> 44:43.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Fred's
reporting is a partnership
with the Under-Told Stories
Project at the

44:43.147 --> 44:48.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
University of St. Thomas in
Minnesota.

44:48.653 --> 45:00.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ruth Bader Ginsburg broke
countless barriers
for women in the legal
profession long before

45:00.131 --> 45:04.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she was tapped by President Bill
Clinton for
the highest court in the land.

45:04.402 --> 45:08.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now she has published a
collection of her
writings and speeches called "My
Own Words."

45:08.839 --> 45:12.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For this latest addition to the
"NewsHour"
Bookshelf, Gwen Ifill sat down
with Justice

45:12.543 --> 45:14.779 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ginsburg recently at the Supreme
Court.

45:14.812 --> 45:18.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Justice Ginsburg,
thank you for
speaking with us.

45:18.049 --> 45:22.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to start by -- with a
broader question
than you even address in your
book, which

45:22.453 --> 45:25.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is, you have become something of
a folk hero
to some women.

45:25.523 --> 45:27.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Did you see that coming?

45:27.224 --> 45:30.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUTH BADER GINSBURG, Associate
Justice, U.S.
Supreme Court: It is utterly
amazing.

45:30.161 --> 45:32.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Of course I didn't see it
coming.

45:32.797 --> 45:39.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was all the creation of a
second-year
student, second-year law
student, at NYU.

45:39.403 --> 45:41.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It came about this way.

45:41.539 --> 45:49.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was reading a court's
decision that invalidated
a very significant part of the
Voting Rights

45:49.814 --> 45:50.881 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Act of 1965.

45:50.915 --> 45:53.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And she was angry.

45:53.718 --> 45:57.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then she remembered that I
had said anger
is a useless emotion.

45:57.855 --> 45:59.590 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It doesn't get you any place.

45:59.624 --> 46:01.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do something positive.

46:01.325 --> 46:08.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, she created this tumbler
starting with
my dissent, and then it took off
into the

46:08.265 --> 46:09.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wild blue yonder.

46:10.001 --> 46:13.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You know, some
people would say
it's about politics, but I
wonder if it's

46:13.938 --> 46:19.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not also about your presence,
your very existence
on the court and the way that
you write and

46:19.944 --> 46:23.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the way that you sometimes take
on your colleagues.

46:23.080 --> 46:28.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUTH BADER GINSBURG: I would
like to think
so, but I certainly was given a
tremendous

46:28.486 --> 46:33.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
boost into the public arena by
the Notorious
R.B.G.

46:33.691 --> 46:42.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I was asked about it, I
said, well, it's
exactly right, because Notorious
B.I.G. and

46:42.133 --> 46:45.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I had something in common?

46:45.836 --> 46:46.871 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
You did?

46:46.904 --> 46:48.039 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
What?

46:48.072 --> 46:50.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were both born and bred in
Brooklyn, New
York.

46:50.841 --> 46:51.809 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:51.842 --> 46:54.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You ever consider
being a rapper?

46:54.245 --> 46:55.413 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:55.446 --> 46:58.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH BADER GINSBURG: I don't
think I have
that talent.

46:58.249 --> 46:59.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, neither do I.

46:59.817 --> 47:03.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to talk to you about
someone you give
a lot of credit to in this book.

47:03.254 --> 47:05.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is your late husband,
Marty Ginsburg.

47:05.056 --> 47:08.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the things that
someone said is
that you would never have been
on the court

47:08.626 --> 47:09.593 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
without him.

47:09.627 --> 47:10.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do you agree with that?

47:10.628 --> 47:12.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUTH BADER GINSBURG: It's
absolutely true.

47:12.863 --> 47:20.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of my law clerks at the
Court of Appeals
said at the time that Clinton
was considering

47:20.304 --> 47:27.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who would be his first nominee
to the court,
he said, "You will be on the
list, but you

47:27.178 --> 47:33.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will be probably be around
number 25, unless
you do something to promote
yourself."

47:33.217 --> 47:39.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, I'm not very good at
promotion, but Marty
was.

47:39.156 --> 47:46.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he was tireless in his
effort to see that
I would be the nominee.

47:46.997 --> 47:52.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Just the way you
write about,
speak about Marty, it's almost
like a present

47:52.336 --> 47:54.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tense presence in your life.

47:54.205 --> 47:58.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH BADER GINSBURG: He will be
present in
my life as long as I live.

47:58.275 --> 48:02.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have his portrait in my
bedroom.

48:02.279 --> 48:05.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I look at it and say, "You
would probably
like what I am doing now."

48:05.883 --> 48:07.651 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:07.685 --> 48:12.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Out of all the
speeches and the
writings that you have collected
in this book,

48:12.223 --> 48:14.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
what do you get the most
frequent questions
about?

48:14.625 --> 48:17.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do young people, older
people ask you?

48:17.962 --> 48:26.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RUTH BADER GINSBURG: One
question is, did
you always want to be a judge,
or, more exorbitantly,

48:26.704 --> 48:29.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did you always want to be a
Supreme Court
justice?

48:29.340 --> 48:36.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I try to explain the way things
were in the
not-so-good-old-days.

48:36.147 --> 48:45.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when I graduated from law
school in 1959,
there wasn't a single woman on
any federal

48:45.122 --> 48:46.824 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bench.

48:46.857 --> 48:54.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It wouldn't be a realistic
ambition for a
woman to want to become a
federal judge.

48:54.832 --> 49:00.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It wasn't realistic until Jimmy
Carter became
our president.

49:00.938 --> 49:07.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He looked around at the federal
judiciary
and said: That's nice, but they
all look like

49:07.378 --> 49:09.113 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me.

49:09.146 --> 49:16.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I am determined to appoint
members of
minority groups and women in
numbers to the

49:16.253 --> 49:23.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
federal bench, so we will use
the talent of
all of the people of the United
States, and

49:23.627 --> 49:25.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not just some of them.

49:25.663 --> 49:31.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: I'm not sure
everyone knows how
extensive your interest in
women's issues,

49:31.836 --> 49:35.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
women's rights were long before
you got to
the court.

49:35.139 --> 49:38.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is that something which this can
also begin
to illuminate?

49:38.275 --> 49:40.211 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUTH BADER GINSBURG: Yes.

49:40.244 --> 49:45.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The book includes one of my many
speeches
about why we need an equal
rights amendment.

49:45.416 --> 49:51.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Do you feel that --
as a liberal,
that conservative women, men can
identify

49:51.288 --> 49:53.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with you as well?

49:53.057 --> 49:58.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUTH BADER GINSBURG: The label
liberal or
conservative, any -- every time
I hear that,

49:58.062 --> 50:03.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think of the great Gilbert and
Sullivan
song from "Iolanthe."

50:03.734 --> 50:13.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It goes, every gal and every boy
that's born
alive is either a little liberal
or else a

50:13.410 --> 50:15.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
little conservative.

50:15.813 --> 50:17.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do those labels mean?

50:17.615 --> 50:20.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It depends on whose ox is being
gored.

50:20.351 --> 50:24.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You got into a
little trouble
for making a comment about
Donald Trump this

50:24.755 --> 50:25.723 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

50:25.756 --> 50:27.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do you still regret it?

50:27.458 --> 50:34.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUTH BADER GINSBURG: I said what
I had to
say about that, and I will not
address that

50:34.398 --> 50:35.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
subject again.

50:35.399 --> 50:36.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: That's fair.

50:36.767 --> 50:39.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let me ask you another question
about what's
happening right now.

50:39.236 --> 50:40.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you know Merrick Garland?

50:40.504 --> 50:44.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH BADER GINSBURG: Yes, I know
Merrick quite,
quite well.

50:44.308 --> 50:49.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is now the chief judge of the
court on
which I served for many years.

50:49.513 --> 50:51.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And he's an expert in
administrative law.

50:51.949 --> 50:55.152 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I have read his writings.

50:55.185 --> 51:03.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wish that the spirit that
prevailed in 1993,
when I was nominated, I wish
that that could

51:03.327 --> 51:04.695 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be restored.

51:04.728 --> 51:12.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In 1993, the vote on me was 96
to 3.

51:12.102 --> 51:16.440 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was nominated on June 14.

51:16.473 --> 51:19.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was confirmed on August 3.

51:19.343 --> 51:21.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's very different
now.

51:21.078 --> 51:22.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUTH BADER GINSBURG: Yes.

51:22.146 --> 51:26.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there was a true bipartisan
spirit prevailing.

51:26.750 --> 51:29.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrat and Republicans worked
together,
and they got things done.

51:29.753 --> 51:33.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Everybody wonders
whether you're
going to be ever done.

51:33.257 --> 51:35.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have moved the bar many
different times.

51:35.459 --> 51:36.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUTH BADER GINSBURG: Yes.

51:36.827 --> 51:40.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At first, I said I wanted to
stay as long
as Justice Brandeis did.

51:40.497 --> 51:44.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was appointed at the same age
I was, 60.

51:44.268 --> 51:48.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But he retired when he was 83,
which I am.

51:48.572 --> 51:54.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, my answer is, I will do this
job as long
as I can do it full-steam.

51:54.078 --> 51:59.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, at my age, that means you
take it year
by year, though I am confident
that, this

51:59.850 --> 52:05.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
year, there will be no slowdown.

52:05.289 --> 52:06.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What will be next year?

52:06.924 --> 52:08.258 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

52:08.292 --> 52:10.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: None of us really
knows, but we
will be watching.

52:10.928 --> 52:12.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
thank you very
much.

52:12.863 --> 52:18.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUTH BADER GINSBURG: It was a
pleasure.

52:18.435 --> 52:29.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: On the

Sixty-nine years ago tonight, a
brand-new

52:29.913 --> 52:35.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rodgers and Hammerstein musical

doctor debuted on Broadway, and
it was a huge

52:35.519 --> 52:37.287 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
flop.

52:37.321 --> 52:40.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that doesn't stop medical
historian Howard
Markel from recommending the
