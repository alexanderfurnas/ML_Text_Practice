JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the
ongoing struggle to craft a
health care reform bill in the

00:04.866 --> 00:06.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
U.S. Senate.

00:06.900 --> 00:10.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Republican lawmakers
are scrambling to draft
a new version of their
bill before leaving

00:12.033 --> 00:14.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Washington for the
July fourth recess.

00:14.066 --> 00:18.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A short time ago, I spoke with
Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri,
who is vice chair of the

00:19.033 --> 00:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Senate Republican Conference.

00:20.966 --> 00:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I begin by asking where
the efforts to find
compromise stand right now.

00:24.500 --> 00:26.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:26.033 --> 00:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROY BLUNT (R), Missouri: I think
it's challenging and challenged.

00:28.166 --> 00:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will see what happens, but
this is a difficult topic that
touches every American family.

00:34.966 --> 00:37.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the more members of the
Senate and the House both know
about it, I think the harder

00:37.666 --> 00:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it is to reach that conclusion
you would like to get to.

00:40.366 --> 00:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well,
there are reports, as
you know, news reports
that the majority leader,

00:44.633 --> 00:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mitch McConnell, is trying to
come up with accommodations
to appeal to both sides of

00:48.400 --> 00:51.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this argument, to
moderate Republicans.

00:51.333 --> 00:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the stories is that
he's considering keeping the
tax on high-income individuals

00:57.800 --> 01:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in order to pay for more of
the gaps in Medicaid coverage.

01:01.900 --> 01:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, by the way, the
Congressional Budget Office is
saying the cuts to Medicaid are

01:06.400 --> 01:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to be much deeper than
thought in the future years.

01:09.533 --> 01:11.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:11.600 --> 01:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROY BLUNT: Well, I think what
they're saying is, in the
second 10 years, you have even

01:16.433 --> 01:18.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more substantial savings.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now, remember, there
are no cuts to Medicaid.

01:20.366 --> 01:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every year in Medicaid, you
spend more money than you spent
the year before under this

01:24.333 --> 01:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plan, but the growth is not
as great as it would be if you
continued to pay, for instance,

01:30.500 --> 01:33.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
100 percent for single
able-bodied adults.

01:33.033 --> 01:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have got a plan where the
states were told, OK, we will
pay 100 percent for able-bodied

01:40.133 --> 01:44.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
single adults, but we're only
going to pay an average of 52
percent for mothers and their

01:44.166 --> 01:45.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
young children.

01:45.933 --> 01:48.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Now, there is something
wrong with the way that
system is put together.

01:48.433 --> 01:51.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But
keeping that tax on
higher-income individuals,
is that being looked at?

01:51.400 --> 01:52.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:52.400 --> 01:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROY BLUNT: I think it is.

01:54.500 --> 01:56.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think everything is being
looked at, both on the revenue
side and on the expenditure

01:56.866 --> 02:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
side and trying to reach that
point where 50 Republicans,
that might include the vice

02:01.400 --> 02:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president being one of the 50,
is -- are being added to that
50 is what it takes to get this

02:07.833 --> 02:09.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
done.

02:09.900 --> 02:13.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One of
the other things we're
seeing, a potential
way of appealing to the

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
moderates, adding $45 billion or
so for opioid abuse treatment.

02:19.166 --> 02:20.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is that something else
that's on the table?

02:20.200 --> 02:22.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:22.266 --> 02:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROY BLUNT: It's a problem that
Congress has really taken on
in the last couple of years.

02:25.800 --> 02:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I started sharing the
committee that appropriates
money for health and
human services two years

02:31.266 --> 02:33.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ago.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We tripled that year the
money that was being - -
to be spent on opioids.

02:38.266 --> 02:39.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Legislation sort
of followed that.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Then we doubled that tripling.

02:41.200 --> 02:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, at some point, there's
a limit to how many times we
can multiply that in a short

02:47.333 --> 02:49.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
period of time, but
this is a real problem.

02:49.666 --> 02:53.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In Missouri, more people
die from drug overdoses
than car accidents.

02:53.233 --> 02:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you're a first-responder
in Missouri as part of a fire
department, you're three times

02:58.000 --> 03:02.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more likely to respond to a drug
overdose than you are a fire.

03:02.466 --> 03:04.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So it's a problem.

03:04.600 --> 03:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know exactly what the
right number is, but certainly
I think members of the Senate

03:07.200 --> 03:09.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and House are rightly
concerned about it.

03:09.200 --> 03:12.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And to appeal
to conservatives, we're reading
that the majority leader is

03:12.700 --> 03:17.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
giving more options for coverage
plans, allowing people, in
other words, to have a choice of

03:19.600 --> 03:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some less costly, cheaper
plans, in effect, that would
provide less coverage, but would

03:25.533 --> 03:26.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
give them more choices.

03:26.533 --> 03:27.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:27.766 --> 03:29.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ROY BLUNT: Give
them more choices.

03:29.266 --> 03:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It might also provide some
more up-front coverage.

03:31.400 --> 03:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think one of the lessons we
should have learned from what's
happened with the current

03:38.266 --> 03:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plan is that there is insurance
coverage, but there is not
really, many times, access

03:42.200 --> 03:44.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to health care.

03:44.200 --> 03:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you have these high
deductibles, there is every --
there is a disincentive to get

03:46.533 --> 03:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the policy, because you would
have to pay another -- I think
the average of deductible

03:51.133 --> 03:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
policies on the individual
market is $6,000 per individual
before the insurance really

03:57.333 --> 04:01.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
kicked in, and if two of
you got sick, $12,000.

04:01.133 --> 04:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Makes it hard to make that
decision, particularly
when you think what
your family needs is the

04:05.733 --> 04:10.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first $1,000 that covers the
kids getting sick with the
flu or something like that.

04:10.633 --> 04:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you
think the chances are now that
you're going to be able to come

04:13.300 --> 04:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
up with something that passes?

04:15.366 --> 04:19.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I ask this because President
Trump tweeted this morning, he
said, "If Republican senators

04:19.166 --> 04:24.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are unable to pass what they
are working on now, they should
immediately repeal and then

04:25.033 --> 04:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
replace at a later date."

04:26.900 --> 04:28.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:28.366 --> 04:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROY BLUNT: Well, it's pretty
late to come up with a new plan.

04:30.900 --> 04:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The hypotheticals are never
legislatively what you
want to be talking about.

04:35.566 --> 04:38.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You want to be talking
about what you're
focused on at the time.

04:38.533 --> 04:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's fair to say that
it's hard to get 50 senators
out of 52 to vote for a package

04:46.700 --> 04:48.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this complicated.

04:48.766 --> 04:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Actually, Judy, the more that
members know about this, in
many ways, the harder it is

04:54.700 --> 04:57.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make that final decision,
because you have got so much
information, and you know how

04:57.066 --> 05:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many other things are impacted
here by one decision here
that, five decisions later,

05:03.433 --> 05:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has made a big difference
in somebody's life.

05:05.500 --> 05:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, if you
can't get it passed in July,
do you just set it aside?

05:08.733 --> 05:10.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:10.233 --> 05:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROY BLUNT: Well, I think we have
had a three-step plan in mind.

05:13.066 --> 05:18.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We pass this bill that did as
much as we could to kind of
clear the way for Democrats and

05:21.566 --> 05:23.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republicans to work
together later.

05:23.933 --> 05:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The secretary of health and
human services would look at
the 1,400-plus rules that the

05:30.900 --> 05:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
law gave that person the
ability to define and see how
those could be better defined,

05:34.366 --> 05:39.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
so they were better for
families, better for
access and then, when
that's done, get down

05:41.400 --> 05:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the real work of Republicans
and Democrats working together
to do things you can do outside

05:47.833 --> 05:50.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the budget restraints
of the way we're trying
to do this first step.

05:50.333 --> 05:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if the first step doesn't
work, then you just go to, I
guess, a two-step process, and

05:54.566 --> 05:56.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it will take longer.

05:56.666 --> 05:58.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Where
you do finally work with
Democrats, Democrats and
Republicans together?

05:58.500 --> 05:59.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:59.500 --> 06:00.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROY BLUNT: Right.

06:00.533 --> 06:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last thing...

06:01.500 --> 06:02.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:02.666 --> 06:04.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ROY BLUNT: And that's
going to happen.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That has to happen to expand
the way more people can get
more insurance in groups, to

06:06.266 --> 06:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
look at things like more
transparency from providers.

06:09.433 --> 06:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That eventually has to happen.

06:11.466 --> 06:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it doesn't have to
happen to stabilize the
moment we're in right now.

06:17.333 --> 06:19.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The insurance markets,
the individual markets
are collapsing.

06:19.400 --> 06:23.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A third of the counties
in America now only
have one company that's
willing to offer an

06:25.000 --> 06:27.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
insurance product
on the exchange.

06:27.700 --> 06:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The estimate for next year is
over 40 percent of the counties.

06:30.966 --> 06:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you only have would
be choice, you really
don't have any choice.

06:34.200 --> 06:39.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You either buy that policy or
pay the penalty, and all those
things will happen if we don't

06:39.933 --> 06:42.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
change the current law.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last thing I want
to ask you about, Senator Blunt,
and that is the president's

06:44.166 --> 06:46.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tweets.

06:46.600 --> 06:49.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of attention has been
diverted in the last few
days to the president's
tweets criticizing

06:49.866 --> 06:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cable news hosts Joe
Scarborough, Mike
Brzezinski, in her case in
very harsh personal terms.

06:56.633 --> 06:57.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's your reaction?

06:57.833 --> 06:59.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:59.866 --> 07:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROY BLUNT: Well, there's no
doubt that cable news hosts can
say things that the president

07:03.533 --> 07:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the United States
shouldn't say, and people
can be harsh at you.

07:06.433 --> 07:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That doesn't mean you
benefit by being harsh back.

07:10.500 --> 07:15.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think, generally,
the president's tweets
are not helpful to him.

07:17.533 --> 07:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time, he's figured
out a way to communicate with
people in ways that no other

07:20.600 --> 07:22.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president has, or he
wouldn't be president.

07:22.800 --> 07:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do those
