VITAL AND THAT'S NOWHERE NEAR

12:29.533 --> 12:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE.

12:31.233 --> 12:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

PEOPLE WITHOUT A COLLEGE

12:52.067 --> 12:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

12:54.700 --> 12:56.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALIENATED BY THE MEDIA, AND MOST

12:56.567 --> 12:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TURNED OFF BY JOURNALISM.

12:58.533 --> 13:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IN SO MANY WAYS THE LANDSCAPE

13:00.733 --> 13:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS LIKE A GIANT BUFFET TABLE.

13:02.433 --> 13:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON ONE SIDE WE'VE GOT THE HIGH

13:04.800 --> 13:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP AND ON THE

VEGETABLES.

13:09.467 --> 13:11.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO HOW CAN WE AGAIN CONVINCE THE

13:11.667 --> 13:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

13:13.533 --> 13:15.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
METAPHOR TO DEATH, THE DIET

13:15.067 --> 13:16.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

13:19.167 --> 13:21.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREAT AND REALLY IMPORTANT

13:21.167 --> 13:22.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

13:25.600 --> 13:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE AT M.I.T. RIGHT DOWN THE

OVERLAP.

14:01.267 --> 14:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

INFORMATION WE RECEIVED IS

14:05.267 --> 14:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

14:10.467 --> 14:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

14:16.833 --> 14:19.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

14:24.833 --> 14:28.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PART OF IT COULD BE MORE
