JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.706 --> 00:06.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.707 --> 00:09.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
tragedy in Berlin.

00:09.309 --> 00:15.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At least nine people are dead
and many others
injured after a truck plowed
into a Christmas

00:15.182 --> 00:16.149 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
market.

00:16.183 --> 00:18.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Also ahead: escaping a
nightmare.

00:18.318 --> 00:24.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
After days of delays,
evacuations resume in
the war ravaged Syrian city of
Aleppo.

00:24.191 --> 00:30.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: Protests greet Electoral
College voters
as they gather at statehouses
across the country

00:30.998 --> 00:34.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to finalize president-elect
Trump's win.

00:34.167 --> 00:38.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our Politics Monday duo analyze
the latest
in the transition.

00:38.605 --> 00:44.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plus: a rare look inside Bruce
Springsteen's
personal studio.

00:44.144 --> 00:47.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The rock legend opens up about
his creative
process.

00:47.447 --> 00:52.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, Musician:
Most artists
I know consider themselves to be
phonies,

00:52.986 --> 00:57.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
along with the feeling that
there's something
that you're doing is essential,
essential

00:57.925 --> 01:03.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to communicate, and deeply,
deeply real.

01:03.864 --> 01:07.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:07.601 --> 01:10.771 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:10.804 --> 01:25.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's been a day
of horror in
the capital cities of Germany
and Turkey.

01:25.118 --> 01:29.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First Berlin, where a truck
drove into a crowd
of Christmas shoppers, leaving
the street

01:29.756 --> 01:31.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
full of dead and wounded.

01:31.858 --> 01:33.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We get more now from Ira
Spitzer.

01:33.794 --> 01:37.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's the Berlin bureau chief for
Feature Story
News.

01:37.264 --> 01:40.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a warning: Some images might
be disturbing
to some viewers.

01:41.001 --> 01:46.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let me start, Ira Spitzer, with
this comment
we just saw crossing the wires.

01:46.373 --> 01:52.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is the German interior
minister saying
that more information now does
seem to point

01:52.980 --> 01:54.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to an act of terrorism.

01:54.314 --> 01:56.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you know?

01:56.083 --> 02:01.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IRA SPITZER, Feature Story News:
Well, the
Berlin police have confirmed
that nine people

02:01.822 --> 02:07.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been killed in the scene of
violence
earlier in Berlin, and one of
those -- one

02:07.961 --> 02:11.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the dead was a passenger in
that truck.

02:11.264 --> 02:18.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition to the nine people
who died, at
least 50 others are injured,
some seriously.

02:18.872 --> 02:25.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the -- as you mentioned
there, the German
interior minister saying that
there are signs

02:25.145 --> 02:27.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
here that point to a terror
attack.

02:27.381 --> 02:34.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
No one has come out and
explicitly said that
this was intentional, but we
also heard from

02:34.988 --> 02:41.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- the White House issued a
statement not
long ago, and they also
referenced that this

02:41.395 --> 02:45.032 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was possibly a terror attack.

02:45.065 --> 02:52.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, investigations are ongoing
here in Berlin,
trying to uncover what happened,
but an important

02:52.472 --> 02:58.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
piece of information here, the
driver, the
suspected driver of the truck
has been taken

02:58.612 --> 03:00.347 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into custody.

03:00.380 --> 03:05.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So much, of course, will hinge
on who that
person is and what they are able
to uncover

03:05.719 --> 03:07.320 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from him.

03:07.354 --> 03:10.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the moment, police have
asked people
to stay off the streets in
Berlin.

03:10.557 --> 03:15.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is an ongoing rescue
operation that's
happened at a Christmas market
right near

03:15.962 --> 03:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the heart of Berlin, so a tragic
situation
unfolding right now.

03:20.267 --> 03:24.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ira Spitzer, tell
us a little
bit more about where this
happened.

03:24.104 --> 03:26.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You describe it as a Christmas
market.

03:26.106 --> 03:29.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What exactly was the location,
the situation?

03:29.776 --> 03:38.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IRA SPITZER: So, this happened
in the district
of Charlottenburg, right near
the Gedachtniskirche,

03:38.852 --> 03:41.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which is a famous landmark here
in Berlin.

03:41.588 --> 03:46.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is a church where they have
not repaired
the steeple from World War II,
so it's visited

03:46.827 --> 03:52.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by many tourists throughout the
course of
the year, and this Christmas
market is someplace

03:52.599 --> 03:58.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where thousands of people
congregate in the
month leading up to the holidays
here.

03:58.105 --> 03:59.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People go there with their
families.

03:59.606 --> 04:02.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They eat, drink, do Christmas
shopping.

04:02.809 --> 04:09.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Christmas markets are a very
big tradition
in Germany, a much loved
tradition in Germany.

04:09.282 --> 04:15.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there also has been a lot of
speculation
in the past few months that
perhaps a Christmas

04:15.589 --> 04:18.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
market could be the target of a
terror attack.

04:18.658 --> 04:21.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So they have stepped up security
across the
board.

04:21.962 --> 04:28.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, at these open spaces
like this, it
is, of course, very difficult to
predict and

04:28.401 --> 04:31.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then to prevent an attack from
taking place.

04:32.005 --> 04:36.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, again, we don't know a
hundred percent
that this was an intentional
act.

04:36.943 --> 04:40.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
However, the authorities are
certainly treating
it as such right now.

04:40.147 --> 04:47.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ira Spitzer
watching this unfolding
story in Berlin for us, thank
you very much.

04:47.854 --> 04:55.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, meantime, hours before that
Berlin incident,
the Russian ambassador to Turkey
was assassinated

04:55.829 --> 04:58.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by a lone gunman in Ankara.

04:58.098 --> 05:03.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Andrey Karlov was addressing an
art exhibition
when a Turkish policeman in
civilian clothes

05:03.603 --> 05:05.138 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
opened fire.

05:05.172 --> 05:09.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He shouted slogans about Syria,
where Russia's
military is heavily involved.

05:09.743 --> 05:12.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The gunman later died in a
shoot-out with
police.

05:13.013 --> 05:17.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian President Vladimir Putin
and Turkey's
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan
condemned the

05:18.018 --> 05:19.786 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
attack.

05:19.819 --> 05:24.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: Here in
the United
States, the Electoral College
confirmed that

05:24.291 --> 05:27.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump's victory in the
presidential
race.

05:27.394 --> 05:33.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He was on track for 304
electoral votes, losing
two defectors in Texas.

05:33.533 --> 05:37.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton lost four
electors in Washington
State.

05:37.170 --> 05:41.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Otherwise, it went mostly as
expected, despite
a day of demonstrations.

05:41.875 --> 05:44.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang reports.

05:44.110 --> 05:48.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Election Day, part
two.

05:48.648 --> 05:53.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In some states, protesters urged
Electoral
College voters to dump
president-elect Trump.

05:53.453 --> 05:55.188 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
In Pennsylvania:

05:55.222 --> 05:58.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I'm here today because I
feel like
it's the last chance we have to
really save

05:58.058 --> 05:59.025 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this country.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, Hillary Clinton won the
popular vote.

06:00.961 --> 06:07.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm hoping we can make some kind
of difference
in the Electoral College.

06:07.467 --> 06:12.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The outcome didn't
change, but
controversy still swirls around
evidence of

06:12.038 --> 06:15.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian cyber-attacks aimed at
influencing
the election.

06:15.308 --> 06:17.043 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MCCAIN (R), Arizona:
There's no doubt
they were interfering and no
doubt that it

06:18.979 --> 06:20.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was cyber-attacks.

06:20.847 --> 06:26.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question now is, how much
and what damage
and what should the United
States of America

06:26.186 --> 06:27.887 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do?

06:27.921 --> 06:30.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Senator John McCain
and fellow
Republican Lindsey Graham have
now joined

06:30.924 --> 06:35.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Democrats Chuck Schumer and
Jack Reed
to call for a special Senate
committee to

06:35.895 --> 06:37.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
try to find the answers.

06:37.998 --> 06:43.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell says
existing panels should handle
the investigation.

06:43.903 --> 06:48.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton campaign chairman John
Podesta suggested
Trump aides may have colluded
with Moscow.

06:48.508 --> 06:50.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN PODESTA, Former Clinton
Campaign Chairman:
What did Trump, Inc., know and
when did they

06:50.844 --> 06:52.145 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
know it?

06:52.178 --> 06:53.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Were they in touch with the
Russians?

06:53.446 --> 06:55.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think those are still open
questions.

06:55.315 --> 06:59.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Trump's incoming
chief of staff
said the president-elect isn't
convinced Russia

06:59.753 --> 07:01.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was behind the hacking.

07:01.655 --> 07:04.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REINCE PRIEBUS, Incoming White
House Chief
Of Staff: I think he would
accept the conclusion

07:04.291 --> 07:10.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
if these intelligence
professionals would
get together, put out a report,
show the American

07:10.930 --> 07:15.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people that they're actually on
the same page,
as opposed to third parties
through The Washington

07:15.602 --> 07:17.437 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Post.

07:17.470 --> 07:21.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Trump is spending
the Christmas
holidays at his Mar-a-Lago
resort in Florida.

07:21.574 --> 07:23.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

07:23.710 --> 07:28.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also today, the
Trump transition
team announced that he's naming
businessman

07:28.315 --> 07:33.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and veteran Vincent Viola as
secretary of
the army.

07:33.053 --> 07:38.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State legislators in North
Carolina appear
ready to repeal a law that curbs
protections

07:38.191 --> 07:39.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for transgender people.

07:39.959 --> 07:44.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Democratic governor-elect,
Roy Cooper,
announced it today.

07:44.164 --> 07:48.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans who supported the
law said that
they're now open to repeal in a
special session

07:48.902 --> 07:50.570 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on Wednesday.

07:50.603 --> 07:56.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The law has cost the state major
sports events,
concerts and corporate
expansions.

07:56.309 --> 08:01.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The head of the International
Monetary Fund,
Christine Lagarde, was convicted
today of

08:01.381 --> 08:03.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
financial negligence.

08:03.149 --> 08:08.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A special French court found
that she should
have blocked a huge arbitration
award to a

08:08.922 --> 08:11.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
business tycoon in 2008.

08:11.124 --> 08:14.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lagarde was French finance
minister at the
time.

08:14.694 --> 08:18.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Despite the guilty verdict, the
court opted
against any punishment.

08:18.431 --> 08:21.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That left Lagarde's lawyers
questioning the
point of the proceedings.

08:21.434 --> 08:25.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER BAKER, Attorney for
Christine
Lagarde: The result of this last
five years

08:25.271 --> 08:33.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is nothing, which leaves us in
kind of a complicated
or strange, again, situation.

08:33.480 --> 08:41.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have an unusual court, with
an unusual
hearing, with no accusation and
no sentence.

08:41.321 --> 08:43.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, where are we exactly?

08:43.456 --> 08:50.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Late today, the
IMF's executive

In South Korea, the extortion
trial of Choi
Soon-sil opened today.

08:57.270 --> 09:02.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's the longtime confidante of
the now-impeached
President Park Geun-hye.

09:02.609 --> 09:06.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Choi appeared in court in Seoul
wearing white
prison clothes.

09:06.846 --> 09:12.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She denied using her ties with
Park to make
big companies give millions to
foundations

09:12.752 --> 09:14.053 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
she controlled.

09:14.087 --> 09:16.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Park has received extensive
immunity from
prosecution.

09:16.856 --> 09:20.360 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She, too, denies wrongdoing.

09:20.393 --> 09:25.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cities in the north of China
were engulfed
in a choking haze of air today,
and the government

09:25.498 --> 09:28.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
issued a red alert for a third
straight day.

09:28.735 --> 09:34.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hundreds of factories and
schools were closed
and restrictions on driving were
in place.

09:34.174 --> 09:39.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many in Beijing wore face masks
to try to
keep the smog out of their
lungs.

09:39.179 --> 09:43.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): I
think it's very
inconvenient for going out.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I really don't like putting on
the face mask.

09:45.852 --> 09:50.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can't go to the supermarket or
take my child
to play outside.

09:50.323 --> 09:52.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We spent the last two days at
home over this
weekend.

09:52.959 --> 09:57.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: China's severe
air pollution
is blamed on its heavy reliance
on coal and

09:57.997 --> 10:00.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
carbon emissions from older
cars.

10:00.967 --> 10:06.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, the U.S.
Interior Department
set final rules to limit damage
from coal

10:06.039 --> 10:07.841 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mining.

10:07.874 --> 10:13.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They'd protect some 6,000 miles
of streams
by barring mining within 100
feet of the water.

10:13.813 --> 10:18.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Industry officials, though, warn
that the
regulations will kill jobs, and
the incoming

10:18.551 --> 10:22.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican Congress could well
vote to block
them.

10:22.555 --> 10:27.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The city of New Orleans today
announced settlements
in fatal shootings by police
after Hurricane

10:27.861 --> 10:29.429 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Katrina.

10:29.462 --> 10:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two people were shot dead on the
Danziger
Bridge, and a third at a strip
mall.

10:33.633 --> 10:38.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The settlements in those
killings, and one
before the hurricane, total more
than $13

10:38.271 --> 10:39.939 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
million.

10:39.973 --> 10:43.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH LANDRIEU (D), Mayor of New
Orleans,
Louisiana: The city is here
today to try to

10:43.743 --> 10:48.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the extent that is humanly
possible to bring
closure to this dark, dark, dark
time and

10:48.915 --> 10:55.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to pledge that it shall never
happen again,
because, as I have said, change
is going to

10:55.522 --> 10:57.223 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
come.

10:57.257 --> 11:01.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The settlements
are with 17
plaintiffs who sued over the
killings.

11:01.227 --> 11:06.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition, 20 current or
former New Orleans
police officers were charged in
federal civil

11:06.466 --> 11:08.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rights investigations after
Katrina.

11:08.535 --> 11:13.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A number of them were convicted
or pleaded
guilty to criminal charges.

11:13.573 --> 11:18.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama today pardoned
79 people convicted
of crimes and shortened the
sentences for

11:18.912 --> 11:20.413 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
153 others.

11:20.446 --> 11:24.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the most in a single day by
any president.

11:24.250 --> 11:27.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Obama has focused mainly on
drug offenders.

11:27.186 --> 11:31.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House says he has now
pardoned or
commuted the sentences for more
than 1,300

11:31.991 --> 11:35.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people, more than any of his
predecessors.

11:35.662 --> 11:37.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Wall Street managed modest gains
today.

11:37.830 --> 11:43.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
was up 39
points to close at 19883.

11:43.903 --> 11:48.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 20, and the S&amp;P
500 added
four.

11:48.675 --> 11:53.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Zsa Zsa Gabor died Sunday in
Los Angeles,
after years of ill health.

11:53.580 --> 11:59.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Hungarian-born actress was
known for her
glamorous image and multiple
marriages, including

11:59.118 --> 12:03.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to hotel mogul Conrad Hilton in
the 1940s.

12:03.523 --> 12:09.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she made divorce an art
form, once quipping:
"I am a marvelous Housekeeper.

12:09.095 --> 12:11.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Every time I leave a man, I keep
his house."

12:11.965 --> 12:15.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Zsa Zsa Gabor was 99 years old.

12:15.268 --> 12:20.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Evacuations
resume in Aleppo after delays
and dangerous

12:20.340 --> 12:26.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conditions; protest greet
electors casting
their vote for the next
president; our Politics

12:26.613 --> 12:35.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Monday duo take on today's
political importance;
and much more.

12:35.922 --> 12:45.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The United Nations Security
Council demanded
that the Syrian government and
other interested

12:46.032 --> 12:51.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parties allow the U.N. to have
unhindered
access to Aleppo, so that
monitors can watch

12:52.005 --> 12:56.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those trying to flee that
war-ravaged city.

12:56.476 --> 13:02.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a welcome sight for
thousands of Syrians
trapped in Eastern Aleppo,
waiting in the

13:02.682 --> 13:04.517 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cold.

13:04.550 --> 13:09.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Evacuations resumed overnight,
after days
of delays, under terms of a
fragile cease-fire.

13:09.522 --> 13:13.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We
were very hungry.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
God will take revenge on our
behalf.

13:15.261 --> 13:18.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hopefully, we will return to
Aleppo.

13:18.398 --> 13:23.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Forty-seven
children trapped
in an orphanage were among those
rescued,

13:23.603 --> 13:29.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but the U.N. children's agency,
UNICEF, reported
some were in critical condition.

13:29.542 --> 13:35.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The evacuees were being ferried
to Idlib province,
widely expected to be the next
front in the

13:35.548 --> 13:37.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
government's offensive.

13:37.350 --> 13:43.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At the same time, buses
evacuated civilians
from two Shiite villages in
Idlib besieged

13:43.890 --> 13:45.725 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by rebels.

13:45.758 --> 13:51.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Syrian army and its allies
demanded that
evacuation in exchange for
letting thousands

13:51.831 --> 13:56.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of civilians and rebel fighters
leave Eastern
Aleppo.

13:57.003 --> 14:03.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many of the evacuees were taken
first to the
rebel-held town of al-Rashideen,
west of Aleppo.

14:03.843 --> 14:09.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They received much-needed food,
water and
humanitarian aid, and, by
nightfall, they

14:09.949 --> 14:14.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
huddled around fires to stay
warm, and recounted
the horror they left behind.

14:14.954 --> 14:19.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAHMOUD ABU MOHAMMAD, Evacuee
(through translator):
We left Aleppo to escape the
relentless shelling.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
All the houses were damaged.

14:21.294 --> 14:24.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Not a single one remained
undamaged.

14:24.330 --> 14:26.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We left because of the heavy
airstrikes.

14:26.299 --> 14:32.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Late in the day,
Turkish officials
estimated some 20,000 people had
been bussed

14:32.772 --> 14:36.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out of Eastern Aleppo so far.

14:36.042 --> 14:41.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on what comes next for
Aleppo's evacuated
civilians and what U.N. monitors
will be able

14:41.748 --> 14:46.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do, I'm joined by former
British Foreign
Secretary David Miliband.

14:46.786 --> 14:49.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's now CEO of the
International Rescue Committee.

14:49.856 --> 14:51.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
David Miliband, welcome.

14:51.858 --> 14:55.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think it's pretty
self-evident, but why
are these monitors necessary?

14:56.028 --> 15:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND, Former British
Foreign Secretary:
The simple reason for these
monitors is that

15:00.967 --> 15:06.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Aleppo has not just been a site
of terrible
death and destruction over the
last few months.

15:06.806 --> 15:13.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's also been the site of the
destruction
of basic norms of international
humanitarian

15:13.079 --> 15:19.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
law, not just the besiegement or
the randomized
bombings of civilian centers,
including a

15:19.051 --> 15:24.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hospital supported by the
International Rescue
Committee, but also
door-to-door, cold-blooded

15:24.524 --> 15:28.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
murder by militias working their
way through
the city.

15:28.861 --> 15:32.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's very important
that there
are people on the ground who
can, by bearing

15:32.565 --> 15:36.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
witness or threatening to bear
witness to
what's happening, try to put a
stop to it.

15:36.869 --> 15:39.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everything that we're seeing and
hearing from
people who have fled the city is
that the

15:39.906 --> 15:42.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fear levels are at terrifying
levels.

15:42.208 --> 15:45.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But can they put
a stop to
it by monitoring?

15:45.745 --> 15:50.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: I think that the
monitoring
on its own is only part of the
answer.

15:50.850 --> 15:56.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, there's got to be a
decision from
the Syrian government, and their
Russian backers,

15:56.088 --> 16:00.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the Hezbollah militias that
have been
working their way through the
city, about

16:00.726 --> 16:02.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what they're going to do next.

16:02.395 --> 16:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obviously, the Russians voted
for this resolution
in the Security Council today.

16:07.266 --> 16:09.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some people were surprised by
that.

16:09.735 --> 16:15.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if it does mean a halt to
the terrible
scenes that we have seen over
the last week

16:15.842 --> 16:18.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inside Aleppo, that's obviously
a step forward.

16:18.477 --> 16:24.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The people that we're meeting 20
kilometers
to the west of Aleppo in the
governorate of

16:24.383 --> 16:29.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Idlib are concerned that they're
moving from
one killing zone into another,
because obviously

16:29.355 --> 16:35.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the great fear is that the
tactics that have
been used in Aleppo are now
deployed in Idlib,

16:35.428 --> 16:38.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is 1.9 million people
across the whole
governorate.

16:38.731 --> 16:43.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bombing, the murder, the
great danger
is that that flows with the
people to the

16:43.169 --> 16:45.004 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
west.

16:45.037 --> 16:48.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I want to ask
you about
that, but when it comes to
Aleppo, is it believed,

16:48.507 --> 16:54.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is it understood that these
monitors are going
to be in a position to stop
whatever indiscriminate

16:54.714 --> 16:58.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
killing or other terrible things
are happening
to these people as they leave?

16:58.918 --> 17:02.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: Well, at best,
they can bear
witness to it.

17:02.121 --> 17:05.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're obviously not in a
position to intervene
militarily.

17:05.391 --> 17:09.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not a U.N. peacekeeping
force that has
been deployed as a result of
this resolution

17:09.996 --> 17:11.764 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

17:11.797 --> 17:17.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a group of monitors who are
unarmed and
who are there to monitor the
conduct of the

17:17.937 --> 17:20.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
security and other forces and
report on it.

17:20.673 --> 17:26.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, it is right and better for
there to be
some degree of international
presence, but,

17:26.746 --> 17:32.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
obviously, that is cold comfort
to very, very
scared residents of Aleppo who
have been the

17:32.485 --> 17:36.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
subject of this brutal assault
not just over
the last few weeks, but over the
last few

17:36.989 --> 17:38.824 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

17:38.858 --> 17:41.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, to the
point you were
making a moment ago, David
Miliband, the place

17:41.060 --> 17:46.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where these evacuees are going,
Idlib province,
as we reported, is expected to
be the next

17:46.632 --> 17:49.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
front in the government's focus.

17:49.835 --> 17:52.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why are they any safer there
than they were
in Aleppo?

17:52.939 --> 17:57.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: Well, I think
that the words
of the people who are fleeing
tell it all.

17:57.243 --> 18:00.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They say, we had to get out of
hell.

18:00.046 --> 18:04.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they don't know where --
whether the place
they're going to is going to be
any better,

18:04.083 --> 18:06.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but there is a chance that it
might.

18:06.052 --> 18:12.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Idlib has a different
composition, population
composition, and a different
group of rebel

18:12.058 --> 18:14.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fighters who are dominant there.

18:14.694 --> 18:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an area that combines a
large government
with Idlib City, which is a
confined urban

18:19.999 --> 18:21.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
area like Aleppo.

18:21.834 --> 18:27.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's going to be a much tougher
military effort,
I think, on the part of the
Syrian and the

18:27.273 --> 18:29.041 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Russian forces.

18:29.075 --> 18:32.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the great plea -- and I'm
afraid it is
only a plea from the
international community

18:32.278 --> 18:38.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the moment -- is that the
tactics of bombardment,
besiegement and then
door-to-door murder are

18:38.184 --> 18:39.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not deployed in Idlib.

18:39.986 --> 18:46.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And in the absence of
international military
support, then it can only be a
diplomatic

18:46.625 --> 18:52.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plea that the way this war takes
its next
turn is going to be critical for
whether any

18:52.631 --> 18:55.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stability comes back to Syria in
the future.

18:56.002 --> 18:59.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You reported yourselves that
ISIS have been
resurgent in taking Palmyra.

18:59.405 --> 19:01.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

19:01.240 --> 19:05.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: And we know from
history that
the way wars are concluded is
absolutely the

19:05.411 --> 19:07.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
key to whether or not there is
any peace to
be kept.

19:07.580 --> 19:13.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, I guess my
question is,
is there an expectation that
what these monitors

19:13.219 --> 19:17.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are doing in Aleppo could --
they could just
be moved next to Idlib to
prevent the same

19:17.990 --> 19:23.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of thing from happening
there and then
onto the next place where the
government is

19:23.763 --> 19:25.464 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
moving in?

19:25.498 --> 19:29.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: Well, the
terrible truth of
the last few weeks is that there
has been

19:29.402 --> 19:34.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plenty on social media and
elsewhere explaining
what's been going on in Aleppo,
but it's not

19:34.740 --> 19:40.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been possible to rally any kind
of sufficient
diplomatic, political or other
pressure on

19:40.579 --> 19:46.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those taking part in these
activities to prevent
the kind of horrific scenes that
you broadcast

19:46.085 --> 19:48.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
last week and that are feared in
the future.

19:48.320 --> 19:54.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is now a real test of
whether or not
the Russians and their Iranian
backers are

19:54.460 --> 19:59.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
serious about winning a
sustainable peace
in Syria, whether they are
serious about taking

19:59.732 --> 20:05.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on some of the rebel elements
who are affiliated
with al-Qaida, or whether this
is simply a

20:05.671 --> 20:12.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pretense and a fig leaf for a
wider attempt
to drive large sections of the
Syrian population

20:12.344 --> 20:16.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out of their homes as part of a
bloody attempt
to restore order.

20:16.248 --> 20:20.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, do you
believe they
are serious, based on what you
know?

20:20.619 --> 20:25.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: Well, I have had
-- over the
last five years of this
conflict, the International

20:25.624 --> 20:31.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rescue Committee has had between
1,200 and
2,500 local staff on the ground
through this.

20:31.997 --> 20:37.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it has been the most
appalling descent
into hell for all of the people
who work for

20:37.103 --> 20:38.838 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

20:38.871 --> 20:42.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of the norms under which
international
humanitarian organizations work
have been

20:42.341 --> 20:43.742 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
violated.

20:43.776 --> 20:47.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Never did I think we would see
the day of
U.N. convoys being bombed.

20:47.046 --> 20:52.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And never did I think we would
go back to
the days when there seemed to be
no accountability

20:52.451 --> 20:55.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the most grotesque abuses of
human rights.

20:55.321 --> 20:58.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I cannot -- of even human
life, never
mind human rights.

20:58.858 --> 21:02.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, for me to sit here
comfortably and tell
you I'm confident about the
future would be

21:02.728 --> 21:03.696 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
quite wrong.

21:03.729 --> 21:05.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a desperate situation in
Syria.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have got my own staff in the
front line.

21:07.967 --> 21:13.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're desperate for the kind
of coordinated
and impactful political and
diplomatic pressure

21:13.038 --> 21:16.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that can ease some of the plight
of the civilians
and allow us to get on with our
work.

21:16.942 --> 21:20.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Miliband,
the CEO of
the International Rescue
Committee, we thank

21:20.913 --> 21:21.881 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

21:21.914 --> 21:26.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: Thank you very
much.

21:26.886 --> 21:39.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, president-elect
Donald Trump is now one step
closer to officially

21:39.398 --> 21:41.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sealing his victory.

21:41.267 --> 21:46.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the debate over the value of
the Electoral
College has intensified this
year, in part

21:46.505 --> 21:51.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because Hillary Clinton won the
popular vote
by almost three million votes.

21:51.877 --> 21:53.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has our report.

21:53.712 --> 21:58.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: At the
Maryland Statehouse
in Annapolis today, a rare sight
for our cameras:

21:58.984 --> 22:03.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
members of the Electoral College
gathering
to cast their official votes for
president

22:03.289 --> 22:04.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and vice president.

22:04.290 --> 22:07.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: I vote today for Hillary
Rodham Clinton.

22:07.159 --> 22:11.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: After a simple
roll call
vote, Maryland's 10 electors
have spoken and

22:11.830 --> 22:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
certified the official results
for the state.

22:14.533 --> 22:19.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton swept Maryland
on Election
Day, and, as expected, she
received all 10

22:19.905 --> 22:21.507 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
electoral votes.

22:21.540 --> 22:25.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In just 40 minutes, more than a
year of presidential
campaigning comes to an end.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it's not just here in
Maryland.

22:27.947 --> 22:32.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Across the country today,
electors from all
50 states and the District of
Columbia gathered

22:32.351 --> 22:38.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to do the same, from
Pennsylvania and Virginia
to Colorado and Michigan.

22:38.457 --> 22:40.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Even Bill Clinton is an elector
in New York.

22:40.759 --> 22:44.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, in most years, no one pays
much attention
to this process.

22:44.597 --> 22:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Electoral College vote is
something of
an afterthought.

22:47.466 --> 22:50.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this time, electors have
been under a
lot of pressure.

22:50.603 --> 22:55.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some even received hate mail and
death threats
because some voters wanted them
to change

22:55.374 --> 22:58.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their votes, and deny Donald
Trump the presidency.

22:58.944 --> 23:03.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We all know the White House
hinges on that
magical 270 number.

23:03.148 --> 23:06.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the simple majority of
538 electoral
votes.

23:06.986 --> 23:09.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a number Mr. Trump clearly
reached on
election night.

23:09.555 --> 23:15.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Associated
Press is calling
Wisconsin, so that puts him over
the top.

23:15.561 --> 23:18.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Donald Trump is the next
president of the
United States.

23:18.530 --> 23:23.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's the
theory, at least,
because most states have laws
that bind electors

23:23.402 --> 23:27.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to cast their vote according to
the popular
vote in their state.

23:27.072 --> 23:30.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they don't, they can be
replaced or punished
with a fine.

23:30.242 --> 23:35.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But some states do allow for
what's called
faithless electors, and they can
vote for

23:35.114 --> 23:39.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whomever they want, regardless
of how their
state voted on Election Day.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, these faithless electors
are pretty rare.

23:41.987 --> 23:46.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There have only been about 160
in history,
and they have never flipped the
outcome of

23:46.358 --> 23:48.060 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an election.

23:48.093 --> 23:51.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To have upended Trump's victory
this year,
it would have taken 37 electors
to change

23:51.730 --> 23:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their votes, and that didn't
happen.

23:54.066 --> 23:58.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were a handful of would-be
defectors
this year, including ones in
Georgia and Texas.

23:58.971 --> 24:02.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They chose to resign as
electors, rather than
vote for Mr. Trump.

24:02.975 --> 24:05.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were replaced today by
Trump supporters.

24:05.511 --> 24:10.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But only one Republican had come
out publicly
as faithless elector, Chris
Suprun from Texas.

24:10.716 --> 24:13.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS SUPRUN, Elector: I am not
voting for
Donald Trump because I don't
think he's the

24:13.952 --> 24:15.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
right man for the job.

24:15.821 --> 24:18.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And Harvard
law professor
Lawrence Lessig, who briefly ran
for president

24:18.957 --> 24:24.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a Democrat this year, argues
electors have
a moral obligation to vote their
conscience.

24:24.196 --> 24:28.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAWRENCE LESSIG, Harvard Law
School: Our goal
is to let the electors exercise
their judgment.

24:29.001 --> 24:32.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Electoral College was made
for this election,
precisely.

24:32.438 --> 24:36.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But Trump's
incoming chief
of staff, Reince Priebus, says
these efforts

24:37.009 --> 24:38.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are just sour grapes.

24:38.777 --> 24:40.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REINCE PRIEBUS, Incoming White
House Chief
Of Staff: It's about Democrats
that can't

24:40.646 --> 24:42.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
accept the outcome of the
election.

24:42.181 --> 24:45.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's about delegitimizing the
American system.

24:45.684 --> 24:49.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As they have
done in elections
past, the states will now send
their vote

24:49.321 --> 24:54.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
totals to Washington, D.C.,
where Congress
will tally them in a joint
session next month

24:54.526 --> 24:56.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and officially announce the
election results.

DICK CHENEY, Former Vice
President of the

25:54.753 --> 25:55.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
A lot going on today.

25:55.954 --> 25:57.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Yes.

25:57.756 --> 26:01.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Namely, as we
just saw in that
report, Amy, that Donald Trump
is over the

26:01.460 --> 26:03.328 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
top.

26:03.362 --> 26:06.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The outcome is not surprising,
but there were
a lot of protests, a lot of
noise made around

26:06.498 --> 26:09.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
state capitals around the
country.

26:09.168 --> 26:12.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is the Electoral College process
in any danger?

26:12.137 --> 26:13.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Well,
no, I don't think so.

26:13.939 --> 26:17.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were a lot of protests,
but, at the
end of the day, there were nor
defectors on

26:17.276 --> 26:19.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Democratic side than on the
Republican
side.

26:19.578 --> 26:23.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You had one in Minnesota, one in
Maine who
wanted to vote for Bernie
Sanders.

26:23.949 --> 26:26.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, ultimately, the state law
doesn't allow
that.

26:26.185 --> 26:31.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They ended up both casting -- in
one case,
an alternate cast for Hillary
Clinton.

26:31.723 --> 26:35.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But there were four in
Washington state, a
state that she carried, that
voted for someone

26:35.561 --> 26:37.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
other than Hillary Clinton.

26:37.429 --> 26:41.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I don't think that we're
seeing a breakdown
of the Electoral College by Any
measure, but

26:41.600 --> 26:47.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
electors are using the focus on
them to make
a broader point on the
Democratic side much

26:47.673 --> 26:49.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more than the Republican side.

26:49.074 --> 26:50.275 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
One final note.

26:50.309 --> 26:52.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's amazing how much winning
brings people
together.

26:52.945 --> 26:56.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at the end of the day, the
Democrats were
the ones who lost.

26:56.815 --> 27:01.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They had more of a stake in
making a bigger
statement than Republicans, who
won, and they

27:01.820 --> 27:07.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just simply want to move on and
get the Republican
Congress and the Republican
president in office.

27:07.259 --> 27:11.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Tam, this is
a reminder,
though, that this election, that
a lot of

27:11.430 --> 27:15.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people are not content just to
let this election
sit, that they are going to go
on a protest,

27:15.834 --> 27:18.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even though they knew the odds
were really
long they were going to change
anything.

27:18.704 --> 27:23.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, this was one
of the things
where people felt like they
needed to try.

27:23.375 --> 27:28.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, people were contacting --
mostly people
on the left were contacting
electors trying

27:28.180 --> 27:29.581 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do something.

27:29.615 --> 27:32.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were a handful of electors
who wanted
an intelligence briefing.

27:33.018 --> 27:36.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ultimately -- about the alleged
Russian meddling
in the election.

27:36.321 --> 27:38.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ultimately, that didn't happen.

27:38.390 --> 27:42.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The person who won the Electoral
College on
election night won the Electoral
College tonight.

27:42.728 --> 27:46.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it will be finalized and
made official
on January 6.

27:46.398 --> 27:49.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, let's talk
about the Russian
meddling piece of this.

27:49.501 --> 27:53.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Amy, you now have senators
commenting.

27:53.906 --> 27:57.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump, of course, his --
the people
around him has commented.

27:57.843 --> 28:03.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The intelligence community is
united now in
saying it does look as if not
only did the

28:03.382 --> 28:07.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russians hack the Democrats, the
Democratic
National Committee and John
Podesta, but they

28:07.486 --> 28:10.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
did it to help Donald Trump.

28:10.656 --> 28:12.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is the political fallout?

28:12.190 --> 28:13.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where do we go from here...

28:13.191 --> 28:14.993 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

28:15.027 --> 28:16.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: The political
fallout becomes
very difficult, because it's
hard to separate,

28:16.962 --> 28:21.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at least in the minds of many in
the political
community, the difference
between Russian

28:21.300 --> 28:27.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meddling, which the intelligence
communities
agrees on, and Russian meddling
to help Donald

28:27.072 --> 28:31.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump, which then gets us right
into the political
and partisan debates.

28:31.310 --> 28:37.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And whereas you have at least
four senators,
two Democrats, two Republicans,
John McCain

28:37.249 --> 28:41.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Lindsey Graham on the
Republican side,
and two Democrats with them,
saying we should

28:41.853 --> 28:46.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a special committee, you're
not hearing
a groundswell from the
grassroots on the Republican

28:46.692 --> 28:50.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
side and from Republican
leadership to support
a special committee.

28:50.562 --> 28:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once you get into a special
committee to enforce
it, then it becomes partisan and
political.

28:54.933 --> 29:00.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this entire debate about
Russian involvement,
you can't -- you theoretically
can separate

29:00.172 --> 29:03.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it from the politics, but we
really can't.

29:03.275 --> 29:05.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, where does it
go from here,
Tam?

29:05.544 --> 29:10.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, the relevant
committees
will investigate, the
Intelligence Committee

29:10.148 --> 29:12.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
certainly on the Senate side.

29:12.050 --> 29:16.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's where Mitch McConnell,
the Senate majority
leader, has said he thinks this
should be.

29:16.655 --> 29:21.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, John McCain and Chuck
Schumer and
some others would like a select
committee.

29:21.426 --> 29:23.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it's not clear that will
happen.

29:23.362 --> 29:25.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It truly is remarkable.

29:25.130 --> 29:32.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you took the names off of it,
and you just
said, Russia meddles in the U.S.
elections,

29:32.471 --> 29:36.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people would be extremely
alarmed, and it
wouldn't break along partisan
lines.

29:36.475 --> 29:42.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But because it is, Russia
meddled, Donald
Trump may have been aided,
Hillary Clinton

29:42.381 --> 29:46.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may have been harmed, suddenly,
it does become
significantly more political.

29:46.084 --> 29:51.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we should also say that no
one is saying
-- people like John McCain are
saying that

29:51.223 --> 29:54.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia clearly did something,
clearly did
this hacking.

29:54.893 --> 30:00.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But John McCain, President
Obama, various
others are saying that election
systems were

30:00.232 --> 30:02.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not hacked, votes were not
hacked.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
However, those e-mails were.

30:04.369 --> 30:07.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they were leaked out at
inopportune times
for one candidate.

30:07.072 --> 30:11.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there
hangover, though,
Amy, in all this from what
President Obama

30:11.677 --> 30:12.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
did or didn't do?

30:12.678 --> 30:13.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He had a news conference on
Friday.

30:13.779 --> 30:16.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He defended his own actions.

30:16.148 --> 30:22.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is there any lingering -- we
heard some pushback
from Donna Brazile, the acting
Democratic

30:22.287 --> 30:26.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Party chair, about what the
president said
about how he told Vladimir Putin
cut it out.

30:26.825 --> 30:30.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And she said, well, no,
actually, they didn't
cut it out.

30:30.062 --> 30:33.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They kept at it after he talked
to Putin.

30:33.198 --> 30:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's right.

30:35.033 --> 30:37.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To go right on Tam's point,
there was very
little that the president could
do that wouldn't

30:37.669 --> 30:41.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have made this the partisan
political issue
that it is today.

30:41.406 --> 30:47.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it would have been even more
highly charged
in the middle of a campaign.

30:47.512 --> 30:53.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, at the end of the day, I
think the folks
in the White House, as with many
people here

30:53.719 --> 30:58.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Washington, believed that
Hillary Clinton
was going to win on election
night and that

30:58.557 --> 31:03.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
this issue brought up
post-election would
be less contentious than in the
middle of

31:03.729 --> 31:05.497 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a campaign.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to turn
you both now
to what we are just learning
about literally

31:07.265 --> 31:09.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the last few minutes.

31:09.201 --> 31:13.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is Donald Trump put out
a statement
and has been tweeting, Tam,
about these incidents

31:13.905 --> 31:16.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Europe, in Turkey.

31:17.008 --> 31:22.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is lumping together the
assassination in
Turkey of the Russian ambassador
and the terrible

31:22.514 --> 31:25.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
incident in Berlin with the
truck driving
into a crowd in a Christmas
market.

31:25.984 --> 31:30.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was also a shooting at an
Islamic mosque
today in Zurich, Switzerland.

31:30.088 --> 31:35.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he's saying these are -- I'm
quoting now
from his statement.

31:35.260 --> 31:39.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He condemned the Berlin attack,
said: "The
Islamic State and other Islamist
terrorists

31:39.798 --> 31:42.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are slaughtering Christians as
part of their
global jihad."

31:42.467 --> 31:47.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he said the U.S. -- he said
civilized
world must change its thinking.

31:47.506 --> 31:51.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't have clear evidence yet
of what was
behind these attacks.

31:51.877 --> 31:58.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's assuming that it's all an
Islamic -- or
an Islamist motive here.

31:58.250 --> 32:01.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And the civilized
world line
came in a tweet.

32:01.987 --> 32:03.088 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
This is not new.

32:03.121 --> 32:06.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is new is that Donald Trump
is now president-elect.

32:06.558 --> 32:13.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump turning to Twitter
to declare
that something is Islamist
terrorism before

32:14.032 --> 32:17.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the broader security community,
before the
White House, before others have
been willing

32:17.936 --> 32:21.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to declare that, before
investigators have
been willing to declare that,
that is not

32:21.740 --> 32:22.707 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
new.

32:22.741 --> 32:24.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's done that before in past
instance.

32:24.142 --> 32:27.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We saw that
during the campaign,
Amy.

32:27.279 --> 32:30.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do we expect that this is just
going to continue
when he's president?

32:30.248 --> 32:31.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Absolutely.

32:31.983 --> 32:36.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the question becomes,
what do we
do about it once he's in office
and hear,

32:36.855 --> 32:41.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of course, the broader dialogue
from him and
the people around him?

32:41.259 --> 32:46.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we are --
as we have
known about these, we have been
waiting ourselves

32:46.164 --> 32:51.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to decide or to know what
exactly we can say,
because the German authorities,
the Turkish

32:51.403 --> 32:54.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
authorities were only putting
out so much
information.

32:54.172 --> 32:58.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it appears that Donald Trump
has already
drawn these conclusions, and so
we report

32:58.043 --> 32:59.010 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

32:59.044 --> 33:00.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Amy Walter, Tamara Keith, thank
you both.

33:00.045 --> 33:01.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

33:01.046 --> 33:09.788 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Thank you, Judy.

33:09.821 --> 33:20.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next: Of the
stains left on
our national heritage by the
country's history

33:20.832 --> 33:27.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of slavery and Jim Crow
segregation, perhaps
the least discussed is the
practice of racial

33:27.539 --> 33:32.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
lynchings, executions of
African-Americans
done outside the judicial system
and often

33:32.978 --> 33:37.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
intended to subdue black
communities into
passivity.

33:37.315 --> 33:42.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan looks at a plan
to help bring
that conversation to the fore.

33:42.320 --> 33:46.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The plan is to
commemorate
victims of racially motivated
lynchings with

33:46.658 --> 33:48.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a memorial in Montgomery,
Alabama.

33:48.760 --> 33:52.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The design calls for some 800
columns, which,
upon closer viewing, reveal
themselves to

33:52.998 --> 33:56.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be suspended from above in a way
that mimics
a hanging.

33:56.868 --> 34:01.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Each will bear the names of
lynching victims,
over 4,000 in all, as well as
the date and

34:01.239 --> 34:03.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
location of their deaths.

34:03.308 --> 34:07.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A companion courtyard will hold
duplicate
columns which will be moved to
the county

34:07.679 --> 34:12.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of the lynchings each
commemorates, once that
local community accepts it.

34:12.150 --> 34:15.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A recent $10 million donation
from sibling
philanthropists Pat and Jon
Stryker brings

34:15.820 --> 34:18.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the project closer to its
planned 2018 opening.

34:18.957 --> 34:23.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on all this, we turn to
Bryan Stevenson,
the founder of the Equal Justice
Initiative,

34:23.395 --> 34:26.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which created the concept and is
overseeing
its completion.

34:26.464 --> 34:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Bryan, thanks for being with us.

34:27.966 --> 34:30.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First, why do we need a memorial
like this?

34:30.435 --> 34:33.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRYAN STEVENSON, Founder, Equal
Justice Initiative:
Well, I think we're still
haunted by our history

34:33.972 --> 34:35.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of racial inequality.

34:35.640 --> 34:39.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are really burdened by this
legacy.

34:39.110 --> 34:41.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't think we have
acknowledged it
adequately.

34:42.013 --> 34:46.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We terrorized African-Americans
at the end
of the 19th century and through
half of the

34:46.518 --> 34:48.219 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
20th century.

34:48.253 --> 34:52.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The demographic geography of
this country
was shaped by this era of racial
terror and

34:52.657 --> 34:54.426 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lynching.

34:54.459 --> 34:56.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The black people who went to
Cleveland and
Chicago and Detroit went there
as refugees

34:56.528 --> 34:58.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and exiles from terror.

34:58.129 --> 34:59.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we haven't owned up to it.

34:59.798 --> 35:01.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I think we need to.

35:01.166 --> 35:04.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It took us 15 years to build a
9/11 memorial
here in New York.

35:04.970 --> 35:06.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I think that's important.

35:06.604 --> 35:10.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think it's critically
necessary that we
remember what happened on that
day.

35:10.742 --> 35:15.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's equally important that
we acknowledge
this history of terror that I
think still

35:15.814 --> 35:21.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
undermines our ability to be
free, to be just
with one another, to kind of
shake the burden

35:21.119 --> 35:25.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of racial inequality that still
undermines
us in many areas.

35:25.457 --> 35:28.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This is part
of a longer
project that you have been
working on.

35:28.827 --> 35:32.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You documented, I think, 8,000
lynchings over
almost a 75-year period.

35:32.497 --> 35:36.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You even grabbed jars of soil
from each of
these sites.

35:36.034 --> 35:37.869 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

35:37.902 --> 35:40.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRYAN STEVENSON: The American
South is littered
with the iconography of the
Confederacy.

35:40.839 --> 35:46.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are communities where
the devastation
of slavery, where the
devastation of the genocide

35:46.177 --> 35:51.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Native people has not been
acknowledged,
has not been recognized.

35:51.249 --> 35:55.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lynchings provide an opportunity
for us to
go to very specific places.

35:55.220 --> 36:01.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many of these acts of terror
took place on
courthouse lawns, in front of
schools, in

36:01.092 --> 36:04.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
front of churches, in front of
places that
still exist today.

36:04.429 --> 36:09.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have been asking people
in the community
to engage in acts of
truth-telling and acts

36:09.401 --> 36:12.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of recovery, reconciliation,
reparation.

36:12.570 --> 36:15.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think we need that in this
country.

36:15.240 --> 36:16.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In South Africa, you have seen
that.

36:16.641 --> 36:17.809 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
In Rwanda, you have seen that.

36:17.842 --> 36:19.711 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
In Germany, you have seen that.

36:19.744 --> 36:23.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think they are healthier
communities because
they acknowledge their histories
of mass atrocity

36:23.982 --> 36:25.784 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and violence.

36:25.817 --> 36:29.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we're less healthy
because we haven't
talked about the genocide of
Native people,

36:29.287 --> 36:32.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we haven't talked about slavery,
we haven't
talked about lynching.

36:32.090 --> 36:34.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, to get there, we're
going to
have to do these tasks.

36:34.559 --> 36:37.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to have to take
these steps.

36:37.262 --> 36:40.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the community involvement,
the soil collections
are part of that process.

36:40.498 --> 36:44.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The countries
you mentioned,
they didn't get there very
quickly.

36:44.702 --> 36:46.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There was resistance.

36:46.504 --> 36:48.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is there resistance, especially
in the South
in the United States, when you
bring up the

36:48.807 --> 36:50.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
idea of this memorial?

36:50.141 --> 36:53.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRYAN STEVENSON: I think there
is certainly
a reluctance.

36:53.578 --> 36:55.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have denied this history for
a long time.

36:55.480 --> 36:58.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think we have become such a
punitive society.

36:58.383 --> 37:00.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have the highest rate of
incarceration
in the world.

37:00.285 --> 37:04.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think a lot of people are
afraid to talk
about slavery, are afraid to
talk about lynching

37:04.689 --> 37:08.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and segregation because they
fear they will
be punished.

37:08.126 --> 37:11.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't have an interest in
punishing America
for this history, but we don't
believe we

37:11.496 --> 37:14.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can be free until we acknowledge
this history.

37:14.833 --> 37:20.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Issues of police violence,
issues of discrimination,
issues of lack of diversity are
rooted in

37:20.138 --> 37:24.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an absence of truth-telling
about our history.

37:24.142 --> 37:29.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we have to just persuade
people that
there is something powerful and
positive and

37:29.814 --> 37:34.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beautiful that can come when we
acknowledge
these histories, however
painful, and make

37:34.152 --> 37:36.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our ways forward.

37:36.054 --> 37:40.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Germany is a nation that we
trust more today
because they don't have these --
they don't

37:40.992 --> 37:42.393 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have statutes to Adolf Hitler.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They don't celebrate the Nazis.

37:44.929 --> 37:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rwanda is a healthier place
because they have
acknowledged that legacy.

37:48.399 --> 37:49.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So is South America.

37:49.834 --> 37:52.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think America has to replicate
that if we're
going to really be free.

37:52.170 --> 37:56.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: I tried to
give a group
description of what it looks
like or what

37:56.141 --> 37:59.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it will look like, but what are
you hoping
that people take away if they
walk through

37:59.844 --> 38:01.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and visit the space?

38:01.579 --> 38:06.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRYAN STEVENSON: I hope people
will begin
to think differently about who
we are and

38:06.050 --> 38:07.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what our past is.

38:07.886 --> 38:11.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, this donation comes
from Jon and
Pat Stryker, who are honoring
their father,

38:11.956 --> 38:15.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who stood for civil rights, who
understood
the importance of civil rights.

38:15.393 --> 38:17.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think we have to create
spaces.

38:17.795 --> 38:20.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Holocaust memorials are very
powerful
places.

38:20.131 --> 38:24.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You walk through them, you
understand things,
you come out and you say never
again.

38:24.402 --> 38:28.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we need to create
spaces in America
where we begin to confront this
history of

38:28.173 --> 38:32.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
racial inequality and we walk
out and we say
never again.

38:32.210 --> 38:34.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We want them to be sober places.

38:34.145 --> 38:38.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want them to be informational
places, but
we also want them to be places
where there's

38:38.816 --> 38:42.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
beauty, where there's hope,
where there's
the chance for transformation.

38:42.687 --> 38:44.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I think we can do that.

38:44.556 --> 38:49.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we can't do it without
spending more time
creating the kind of cultural
infrastructure

38:49.694 --> 38:51.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that I hope this memorial will
contribute
to.

38:52.030 --> 38:58.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is there a
through-line
or a legacy of lynching in the
criminal justice

38:58.903 --> 38:59.871 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
system today?

38:59.904 --> 39:01.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRYAN STEVENSON: Oh, absolutely.

39:01.806 --> 39:06.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you know, at the end of
the Civil
War, we didn't really deal with
the great

39:06.211 --> 39:08.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
evil of American slavery.

39:08.146 --> 39:11.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The great evil of American
slavery was an
involuntary servitude of forced
labor.

39:11.683 --> 39:15.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I believe the great evil of
American slavery
was the narrative of racial
difference that

39:16.020 --> 39:18.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we created to legitimate it.

39:18.523 --> 39:21.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And because we didn't address
that in the
13th Amendment, I don't think
slavery ended.

39:21.759 --> 39:23.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think it just evolved.

39:23.928 --> 39:27.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what we did in this country
is, we began
to criminalize black people.

39:27.865 --> 39:33.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the late 19th century,
convict leasing
was a new kind of slavery, where
we put black

39:33.471 --> 39:37.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people in jails and prisons, and
then leased
them to do the same work they
would have done

39:37.909 --> 39:39.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as enslaved people.

39:39.777 --> 39:45.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that narrative of
criminality was very
much behind lynching, even
though black people

39:45.049 --> 39:49.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were being lynched for things
like not using
the colored entrance, for asking
for better

39:49.921 --> 39:51.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wages, for scolding white
children.

39:52.023 --> 39:55.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Elizabeth Lawrence was lynched
in Birmingham,
Alabama, because she told white
kids to stop

39:55.627 --> 39:57.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
throwing stones at her.

39:57.362 --> 40:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even though these acts were
not crimes,
they challenged this racial
hierarchy.

40:02.233 --> 40:04.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They challenged this narrative
of racial difference.

40:04.469 --> 40:09.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we used the apparatus of
punishment,
the narrative of punishment to
carry out these

40:09.807 --> 40:11.442 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lynchings.

40:11.476 --> 40:14.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when lynchings were shut
down because
of federal pressure, they moved
indoors.

40:14.479 --> 40:19.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we had a criminal justice
system and still
have a criminal justice system
that operates

40:19.250 --> 40:23.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where too often there are
presumptions of
dangerousness and guilt that get
assigned

40:23.955 --> 40:25.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to black and brown people.

40:26.024 --> 40:30.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The wrongful convictions, the
overincarceration
of people of color, these
disparities in sentencing

40:30.528 --> 40:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are rooted in this history of
criminalizing
and demonizing people of color
that is made

40:35.833 --> 40:38.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
most dramatic in this era of
lynching.

40:38.036 --> 40:41.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, if we understand
it, we will
do better at overcoming it.

40:41.606 --> 40:43.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we have to understand it
first.

40:43.241 --> 40:47.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why these projects on
slavery and
lynching, for me, are so
critical.

40:47.378 --> 40:52.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Bryan
Stevenson of the Equal
Justice Initiative, thanks for
joining us.

40:52.216 --> 40:56.688 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRYAN STEVENSON: Thank you.

40:56.721 --> 41:10.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He was proclaimed
rock's next
big thing in 1975, and he became
the real

41:10.735 --> 41:17.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thing with albums like "Born to
Run," "Darkness
on the Edge of Town," "Born in
the USA," and

41:17.108 --> 41:18.276 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
many more.

41:18.309 --> 41:22.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now Bruce Springsteen tells his
own story
in a memoir.

41:22.347 --> 41:24.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown paid him a visit
to hear first-hand.

41:24.582 --> 41:35.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In his new
memoir, Bruce Springsteen
looks back at his young,
struggling and then

41:35.059 --> 41:40.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
little known self and writes: "I
wasn't modest
in the assessment of my
abilities.

41:40.932 --> 41:43.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Of course, I thought I was a
phony.

41:43.101 --> 41:45.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That is the way of the artist.

41:45.570 --> 41:51.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I also thought I was the
realest thing
you had ever seen."

41:52.009 --> 41:53.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, Musician:
That's right.

41:53.878 --> 42:00.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most artists I know consider
themselves to
be phonies, along with the
feeling that there's

42:00.051 --> 42:06.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something that you're doing is
essential,
essential to communicate, and
deeply, deeply

42:06.858 --> 42:08.693 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
real.

42:08.726 --> 42:15.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Springsteen has
been rocking
his way through marathon,
arena-sized concerts

42:15.500 --> 42:26.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for decades, a kind of
working-class rock
'n' roll hero to millions of
devoted fans.

42:26.044 --> 42:31.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the recording studio he built
at this rural
New Jersey home, we talked about
becoming

42:31.048 --> 42:35.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bruce Springsteen, the story he
tells in his
book, "Born to Run."

42:35.253 --> 42:38.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: It was a very
different
type of writing from
songwriting.

42:38.289 --> 42:40.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In what way?

42:40.124 --> 42:43.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: A pop song is
a condensed
version of a life in three
minutes, whereas,

42:43.327 --> 42:50.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when you go to write your prose,
you have
to find the rhythm in your
words, and you

42:50.535 --> 42:55.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to find the rhythm in the
voice that
you have found and the way
you're speaking.

42:55.807 --> 42:57.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What about that
voice, though?

42:57.608 --> 43:01.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because in songs -- I think of
writers I have
talked to, or poets, and there's
always the

43:01.879 --> 43:03.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
question of, how much of that is
you?

43:03.748 --> 43:06.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: I would say,
in your memoir,
it's you.

43:06.083 --> 43:11.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that, when you're
writing your songs,
there's always a debate about
whether, is

43:11.923 --> 43:12.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that you in the song?

43:13.024 --> 43:14.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is it not you in the song?

43:14.926 --> 43:16.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What's the
answer?

43:16.694 --> 43:22.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: So, every
song has a piece
of you in it, because just
general regret,

43:22.800 --> 43:24.936 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
love.

43:24.969 --> 43:30.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to basically zero in on
the truth
of those particular emotions.

43:30.274 --> 43:33.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then you can fill it out in
any character
and in any circumstance that you
want.

43:33.878 --> 43:37.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you have written really well,
people will
swear that it happened to you.

43:37.882 --> 43:41.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Springsteen grew
up in the
working-class town of Freehold,
New Jersey,

43:41.686 --> 43:47.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Italian and Irish stock,
adored and spoiled
by his mother and grandparents,
ignored and

43:47.758 --> 43:53.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
denigrated by a brooding,
drinking, distant
father, a figure who would
obsess him personally

43:53.264 --> 43:54.832 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and musically.

43:54.866 --> 43:59.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: Initially, I
had my conversations
with him through my music.

43:59.837 --> 44:04.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that was the most effective,
not the greatest
way to do it, but it was
certainly -- it was

44:04.575 --> 44:06.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the most effective for us.

44:06.410 --> 44:09.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I mean, but you
write early
on, "When my dad looked at me,
he didn't see

44:09.247 --> 44:10.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what he needed to see."

44:10.681 --> 44:11.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: Yes.

44:11.682 --> 44:13.451 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Now...

44:13.484 --> 44:15.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, you're
going, yes, now,
but I mean, that's hard when
you're a young

44:15.953 --> 44:16.921 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
boy.

44:16.954 --> 44:17.922 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: It is hard.

44:17.955 --> 44:19.857 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It is hard.

44:19.891 --> 44:25.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that it's a natural
thing for parents
to look for reflections of
themselves in their

44:25.530 --> 44:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
children and feel a certain
pride there.

44:28.599 --> 44:32.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So if your child is very, very
different,
or perhaps if he's very, very
similar, it

44:32.036 --> 44:35.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
makes you uncomfortable.

44:35.106 --> 44:46.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there was a lot of that when
I was young,
and it took a long time to get
through.

44:46.717 --> 44:54.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Reconciliation
would come later,
along with an understanding of
the role of

44:54.892 --> 44:58.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
depression in his father's and
his own.

44:58.129 --> 45:03.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From the beginning, though, the
young Springsteen
showed a ferocious drive and
sense of his

45:03.401 --> 45:08.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
own mission, first as a king of
the bar bands
in Central and South Jersey.

45:08.039 --> 45:12.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I started to make a list of the
clubs you
played early on.

45:12.243 --> 45:14.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These are not high-rent places,
right?

45:14.645 --> 45:18.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Angle Inn Trailer Park,
Cavatelli's Pizza,
the I.B.

45:18.816 --> 45:25.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Club, Surf and the Sea Beach
Club, Long Branch
Italian American Club, the
Pandemonium Club.

45:25.690 --> 45:27.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You probably remember each and
every one of
them.

45:27.892 --> 45:31.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: Yes, I
remember those a
lot more than some of the
Madison Square Garden

45:31.562 --> 45:32.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and other things.

45:32.563 --> 45:33.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Is that right?

45:33.564 --> 45:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: Of course.

45:35.366 --> 45:38.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were all so distinctive in
their own
way, and they all drew their own
little clique

45:38.903 --> 45:40.671 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of kids.

45:40.705 --> 45:45.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was such a formative
moment in your
life that, you know, you were
just coming

45:45.843 --> 45:46.811 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into being.

45:46.844 --> 45:48.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You write about
your voice.

45:48.980 --> 45:51.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You say, about my voice, "First
of all, I
don't have much of one."

45:51.782 --> 45:52.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: Yes.

45:52.783 --> 45:53.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right?

45:53.784 --> 45:55.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But you worked at it.

45:55.586 --> 45:58.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: Initially
just sounded
awful, just so terribly awful,
but there was

45:58.623 --> 46:00.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nothing I could do about it.

46:00.091 --> 46:02.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I just kept singing and kept
singing and
kept singing.

46:02.960 --> 46:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I studied other singers, so
I would learn
how to phrase, and learn how to
breathe.

46:08.399 --> 46:13.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the main thing was, I
learned how to inhabit
my song.

46:13.170 --> 46:15.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Which means what?

46:15.039 --> 46:19.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: What you were
singing about
was believable and convincing,
that's the

46:19.043 --> 46:20.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
key to a great singer.

46:20.144 --> 46:22.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A great singer has to learn how
to inhabit
a song.

46:22.880 --> 46:24.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You may not be able to hit all
the notes.

46:24.815 --> 46:25.783 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's OK.

46:25.816 --> 46:27.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You may not have the clearest
tone.

46:27.885 --> 46:29.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You may not have the greatest
range.

46:29.420 --> 46:32.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if you can inhabit your
song, you can
communicate.

46:32.923 --> 46:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The early songs,
though, are
what I would call, like, word
drunk.

46:42.867 --> 46:47.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're so many words in there
that you're
barely catching your breath as
you're singing

46:47.104 --> 46:48.439 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

46:48.472 --> 46:55.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: Well, I was
influenced
by Dylan very intensely.

46:55.780 --> 46:57.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I had a rhyming dictionary.

46:57.648 --> 47:02.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A man armed with a rhyming
dictionary is a
dangerous man.

47:02.319 --> 47:03.587 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:03.621 --> 47:08.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: So, yes, the
words came
fast and furious.

47:08.926 --> 47:14.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A dictionary and,
more important,
a great band, the E Street Band,
which includes

47:14.899 --> 47:20.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
singer Patti Scialfa, his wife
since 1991.

47:20.037 --> 47:22.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Springsteen never liked his
nickname, the
Boss.

47:22.873 --> 47:26.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: I had no
credit cards.

47:26.210 --> 47:27.344 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I had no checks.

47:27.378 --> 47:30.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was cash only until I was
probably 30 years
old.

47:30.815 --> 47:36.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But the Boss is
what he became,
deciding early on that, to
endure, he would

47:36.587 --> 47:38.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have to treat music like a
business.

47:38.589 --> 47:40.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: Well, that
has to happen.

47:40.558 --> 47:46.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're a band leader, you
need that type
of discipline and dedication in
the guys you're

47:46.163 --> 47:47.498 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
playing with.

47:47.531 --> 47:51.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We came from where
professionalism wasn't
a dirty word, as I say.

47:51.235 --> 48:00.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we worked like the old
soul bands worked,
very intensely, and very
methodically, in

48:00.244 --> 48:01.479 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
great detail.

48:01.512 --> 48:03.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You even call it
a benevolent
dictatorship.

48:03.447 --> 48:04.982 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: That's what
it is.

48:05.015 --> 48:06.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's what it
is.

48:06.250 --> 48:07.885 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:07.918 --> 48:11.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: Small unit
democracy, I
found early on, didn't work for
me.

48:11.188 --> 48:14.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the band contributes
enormously.

48:14.492 --> 48:18.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wouldn't have gotten anywhere
near where
I was without them.

48:18.162 --> 48:20.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's basically the buck
stops here sort
of situation.

48:20.965 --> 48:23.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But are you a
control freak?

48:23.634 --> 48:26.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's sort of the what -- I
think you say
that.

48:26.504 --> 48:29.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: Yes, I am,
probably less
now than I used to be.

48:29.707 --> 48:35.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, when I was young, I was
-- because
you're insecure, you really --
you're very

48:35.479 --> 48:36.447 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
controlling.

48:36.480 --> 48:38.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now I'm moderately controlling,
I would say.

48:38.516 --> 48:43.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But you use that
word insecure,
because, frankly, I'm reading
this thing,

48:43.487 --> 48:48.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and it's such a mix of sort of
insecurities
and sense of self.

48:48.092 --> 48:49.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: That's the
artist's way.

48:49.527 --> 48:51.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's the
artist's way.

48:51.195 --> 48:52.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Explain that to me.

48:52.863 --> 48:54.598 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:54.632 --> 48:57.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: Most artists
I know had
one person in their life who
told them they

48:57.568 --> 49:01.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were the second coming of the
baby Jesus,
and another person that told
them they weren't

49:01.572 --> 49:05.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
worth anything, and they
believed them both,
you know?

49:05.543 --> 49:10.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so you go through the rest
of your life
in pursuit of both of those
things, proving

49:10.948 --> 49:13.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that both of those things are
true.

49:13.117 --> 49:16.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you feel like the burden of
proof is on
you.

49:16.887 --> 49:20.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It doesn't matter what happened
last night
or the night -- or tomorrow
night.

49:20.324 --> 49:24.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's all about what you're doing
with this
audience right now.

49:24.862 --> 49:28.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And insecurity, natural part of
being an artist.

49:28.065 --> 49:29.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It is always
there.

49:30.000 --> 49:35.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: Along with a
driving, driving,
driving ego, a vanity, and the
self-confidence.

49:35.139 --> 49:38.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So you have got to have both of
those things.

49:38.809 --> 49:40.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's what makes it
interesting.

49:40.711 --> 49:44.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what makes someone --
that's what makes
you want to watch someone, or
want to listen

49:44.281 --> 49:48.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to someone, are those particular
complexities.

49:48.752 --> 49:57.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: My conversation
with Bruce
Springsteen continues tomorrow
night with

49:57.061 --> 50:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a look at his lifelong bouts of
depression,
his love of reading, and the
election of Donald

50:02.366 --> 50:03.601 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

50:03.634 --> 50:12.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jeffrey Brown.

50:12.576 --> 50:22.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to our
"NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught our eye
that might be

50:22.620 --> 50:29.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to our
"NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught our eye
that might be

50:29.927 --> 50:31.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of interest to you, too.

50:31.896 --> 50:37.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every December, hundreds of tuba
and euphonium
players gather in cities around
the world

50:37.268 --> 50:39.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to perform holiday tunes.

50:39.270 --> 50:44.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We recently spoke with Chris
Quade, one of
the organizers of TubaChristmas
at Washington,

50:44.842 --> 50:48.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
D.C.'s Kennedy Center, about
what makes the
events so special.

50:48.812 --> 50:57.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS QUADE, TubaChristmas: My
name is Chris
Quade.

50:57.788 --> 50:59.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm one of the coordinators of
TubaChristmas.

50:59.990 --> 51:04.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm also the emcee.

51:04.161 --> 51:07.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The original TubaChristmas was
in New York
City, and that was 1973.

51:07.932 --> 51:12.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In 1974, they started D.C.
TubaChristmas.

51:13.003 --> 51:21.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People thought of the tuba as a
back-row instrument,
shouldn't play too soft, because
it can't,

51:21.211 --> 51:23.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shouldn't play too fast, because
it can't.

51:23.180 --> 51:35.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To me, TubaChristmas represents
breaking out
of the tuba stereotype.

51:35.125 --> 51:38.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's been the same music for 43
years.

51:38.429 --> 51:39.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The arrangements work.

51:39.797 --> 51:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are interesting enough to
hold the attention
of the players.

51:42.800 --> 51:45.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are simple enough to put
together in
one rehearsal.

51:45.469 --> 51:51.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They lay in a good range, and
they have the
right amount of fast and slow.

51:51.642 --> 51:57.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the magic of those
arrangements is
really what makes this work.

51:58.015 --> 52:02.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's great because it is
timeless.

52:02.686 --> 52:03.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We can't play top 40.

52:03.921 --> 52:06.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We'd have to change the book
every year.

52:06.323 --> 52:07.858 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it's tubas.

52:07.891 --> 52:10.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Top 40 doesn't really work.

52:10.828 --> 52:19.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a kind part concert, part
educational
experience, part reunion.

52:19.470 --> 52:24.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think every year, I imagine,
come on, they
are going to traipse in from
miles and miles

52:24.842 --> 52:29.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
away into the city and come up
just to do
this?

52:29.446 --> 52:31.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a pain, right?

52:31.615 --> 52:32.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they come all the time.

52:32.750 --> 52:36.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there are so many young
players.

52:36.220 --> 52:38.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the thing that gets me
every year.

52:38.422 --> 52:48.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're excited by it.

52:48.265 --> 52:50.034 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
This is fun.

52:50.067 --> 52:54.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you have children come here,
and they have
got a book of music in front of
them, and

52:54.905 --> 52:59.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everyone is very somber, they
are going to
be much more nervous about what
they are doing.

52:59.143 --> 53:02.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you have lights on this tuba,
and garland
on this tuba, and this guy's got
reindeer

53:02.913 --> 53:06.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
antlers, it creates an
atmosphere where you
are just trying to have fun.

53:06.850 --> 53:17.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TubaChristmas, 300 tuba players,
and it's
a beautiful sound.

53:17.061 --> 53:26.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tubas at
Christmas, Bruce Springsteen.

53:26.804 --> 53:28.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
