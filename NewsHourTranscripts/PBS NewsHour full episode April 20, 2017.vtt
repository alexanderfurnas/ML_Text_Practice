HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.

00:05.605 --> 00:06.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

00:06.606 --> 00:07.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Judy Woodruff is away.

00:07.941 --> 00:10.143 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: Paris
attack.

00:10.176 --> 00:15.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A gunman opens fire on police
just three days
before the French elections.

00:15.048 --> 00:18.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also ahead: Exxon seeks a waiver
to do business
in Russia.

00:18.952 --> 00:23.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are the Trump administration's
business ties
impacting their decisions?

00:23.356 --> 00:28.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plus: news divisions -- how a
politically
divided nation gets its news.

00:28.428 --> 00:31.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEN BLOCK, Independent: I guess
there was
an element of distrust.

00:31.264 --> 00:35.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As citizens, we don't know what
we don't know.

00:35.035 --> 00:40.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Plus: the
turbulent business
of the airline industry, record
profits, expanding

00:40.807 --> 00:43.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
routes, and in some cases bad
service.

00:43.743 --> 00:50.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:50.383 --> 00:53.086 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:53.119 --> 01:02.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Paris is on
high alert again,
after a gunman killed one
policeman and wounded

01:02.896 --> 01:05.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
two more, before being killed
himself.

01:05.098 --> 01:09.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The attack came just three days
before voting
starts in France's presidential
election.

01:09.269 --> 01:14.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The sitting president, Francois
Hollande,
said all indications are that it
was terror-related.

01:14.574 --> 01:18.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Authorities sealed off the area
after the
incident on the famed Champs
Elysees.

01:18.244 --> 01:22.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It happened near a subway
station in an area
popular with tourists.

01:22.715 --> 01:26.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN (through translator): It was
a terrorist.

01:26.653 --> 01:29.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He came out with a Kalashnikov
and started
shooting.

01:29.055 --> 01:33.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He could've shot us on the
pavement and killed
more people with a spray of
shots, but he

01:33.226 --> 01:34.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
targeted the policemen.

01:34.994 --> 01:38.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In Washington,
President
Trump called the killings a
terrible thing

01:38.364 --> 01:41.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and said it looks like another
terrorist attack.

01:41.067 --> 01:44.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We get more now from special
correspondent
Malcolm Brabant, who's in Paris.

01:44.571 --> 01:47.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He spoke with us moments ago via
Skype.

01:47.073 --> 01:48.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Malcolm, what's the latest that
we know?

01:48.875 --> 01:58.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The latest
information we
have is that the Islamic State
(INAUDIBLE)

01:58.218 --> 01:59.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is now claiming responsibility
for this attack
in the Champs Elysees.

02:00.019 --> 02:03.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At least, they're claiming
responsibility
here a couple hours after this
gunman opened

02:03.223 --> 02:08.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fire with what we believe was a
Kalashnikov
on police officers who were
sitting in a van

02:08.261 --> 02:13.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
near the Champs Elysees, which
is this main
boulevard that goes through
Paris.

02:13.433 --> 02:18.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The latest information that we
have is that
one policemen have been killed,
two have been

02:18.805 --> 02:19.772 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wounded.

02:19.806 --> 02:20.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The gunman himself was shot
dead.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But he was known to the
authorities.

02:23.610 --> 02:27.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The police have been carrying
out a raid on
his home to find out more
information.

02:27.814 --> 02:34.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The French president, Francois
Hollande, has
also called a meeting of his
security chiefs

02:34.554 --> 02:39.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to work out what the
implications are for
this attack.

02:39.626 --> 02:42.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's of utmost importance
for this country,
because it's going to the polls
in three days'

02:43.029 --> 02:44.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
time, and tensions are extremely
high.

02:44.898 --> 02:48.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That's two
sort of important
pieces of context here, that,
one, is that

02:48.568 --> 02:51.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there was a thwarted attack just
a little
while ago.

02:51.471 --> 02:55.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you were actually out with
one of the
candidates at a rally when that
happened.

02:55.074 --> 02:56.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Yes.

02:56.242 --> 03:00.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was a raid on a couple of
men in Marseille.

03:00.647 --> 03:06.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The police were made aware that
an attack
was imminent, and they arrested
two Islamists

03:06.152 --> 03:10.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who had proclaimed loyalty to
the Islamic
State.

03:10.290 --> 03:11.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They seized a bunch of weapons,
a whole load
of ammunition, and some homemade
explosives.

03:11.824 --> 03:13.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they may have been going
into court.

03:13.259 --> 03:21.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the fear was that they were
going to attack
one of the candidates.

03:21.901 --> 03:24.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the time that these arrests
were made,
I was down in the city of Dijon,
where Jean-Luc

03:24.704 --> 03:27.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Melenchon, the hard-left
candidate, was speaking.

03:27.507 --> 03:35.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what he was trying to say to
French people
was that these people were
criminals, that

03:35.782 --> 03:40.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people shouldn't be afraid, that
there should
be vigorous debate, and that the
freedom of

03:40.453 --> 03:44.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the French people shouldn't be
impinged by
this.

03:44.324 --> 03:49.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, nevertheless, this
particular shooting,
and also those arrests in
Marseille have shown

03:49.495 --> 03:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the Islamists are serious,
that they
perhaps want to disrupt this
election process.

03:54.534 --> 04:00.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that's going to be making
people extremely
nervous on Sunday, when they go
to put their

04:00.974 --> 04:02.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ballots in the boxes.

04:02.775 --> 04:07.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the police and the army are
basically
saying that there will be about
50,000 people

04:07.080 --> 04:13.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out on the streets of Paris
alone to try to
make sure that this election
goes off as smoothly

04:13.119 --> 04:14.887 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as possible.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Malcolm Brabant
joining via Skype from Paris
tonight, thanks

04:17.257 --> 04:19.158 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
so much.

04:19.192 --> 04:23.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
president renewed
his attack on Iran and the
nuclear deal struck

04:23.496 --> 04:25.365 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 2015.

04:25.398 --> 04:28.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a White House news conference
with Italy's
prime minister, he called it a
terrible agreement

04:29.002 --> 04:30.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and sharply criticized Tehran.

04:30.870 --> 04:34.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
They are not living up to the
spirit of the

04:34.741 --> 04:35.708 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agreement.

04:35.742 --> 04:37.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I can tell you that.

04:37.343 --> 04:38.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're analyzing it very,
very carefully.

04:38.878 --> 04:42.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will have something to
say about it
in the not-too-distant future.

04:42.348 --> 04:49.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Iran has not lived up to the
spirit of
the agreement, and they have to
do that.

04:49.355 --> 04:54.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Earlier this
week, the administration
told Congress that Iran is
complying, at least

04:54.394 --> 04:56.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
technically, with the terms of
the deal.

04:56.863 --> 05:01.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Russia, the Supreme Court
today banned
the Jehovah's Witnesses after
the government

05:01.067 --> 05:02.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
labeled them an extremist group.

05:03.002 --> 05:06.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia is home to more than
170,000 Jehovah's
Witnesses.

05:06.572 --> 05:10.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have been the target of a
crackdown,
but they say they will appeal
the court's

05:10.510 --> 05:11.944 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
decision.

05:11.978 --> 05:15.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Human Rights Watch calls it a
blow to religious
freedoms in Russia.

05:15.848 --> 05:20.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
General Motors has halted
operations in Venezuela
after its factory there was
seized by the

05:20.286 --> 05:21.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
socialist government.

05:21.554 --> 05:23.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the latest in a series of
such incidents.

05:23.823 --> 05:28.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement, the automaker
said it strongly
rejects the arbitrary measures
and will vigorously

05:28.895 --> 05:32.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
take all legal actions to defend
its rights.

05:32.899 --> 05:37.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vice President Pence today
praised Indonesia
as a land of democracy and
tolerance, in the

05:37.770 --> 05:39.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
latest stop on his Asian tour.

05:39.906 --> 05:44.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He held talks with President
Joko Widodo in
Jakarta, and said the world's
most populous

05:44.777 --> 05:47.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Muslim nation is an inspiration
to the world.

05:47.246 --> 05:50.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE, Vice President of
the United States:
As the second and third largest
democracies

05:50.616 --> 05:56.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the world, our two countries
share many
common values, including
freedom, the rule

05:56.622 --> 06:01.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of law, human rights, and
religious diversity.

06:02.028 --> 06:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The United States is proud to
partner with
Indonesia to promote and protect
these values,

06:07.834 --> 06:09.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the birthright of all people.

06:10.002 --> 06:13.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The visit came
a day after
Islamic conservatives in Jakarta
defeated

06:13.940 --> 06:17.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the minority Christian governor
in his reelection
bid.

06:17.443 --> 06:21.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's already on trial for
blasphemy against
the Koran.

06:21.080 --> 06:26.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, more than
21,000 drug
convictions are being thrown out
in Massachusetts.

06:26.519 --> 06:30.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The state's highest court
formally approved
the move today, the largest
single dismissal

06:31.023 --> 06:32.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in American history.

06:32.825 --> 06:38.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A former state drug lab chemist
had been accused
of tampering with evidence and
falsifying

06:38.064 --> 06:39.832 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
drug tests.

06:39.866 --> 06:43.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump has ordered an
investigation
into whether imported steel from
China and

06:43.970 --> 06:46.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
elsewhere is hurting national
security.

06:46.372 --> 06:50.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He signed the directive with
executives from
U.S. steelmakers looking on.

06:50.810 --> 06:57.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The results of the probe could
let him curb
steel imports under a 1960s
trade law.

06:57.350 --> 07:01.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Wall Street, stocks
rallied on upbeat
earnings reports.

07:01.587 --> 07:05.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 174
points to close at 20578.

07:05.591 --> 07:10.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 53 points, and

added 17.

07:10.663 --> 07:14.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
business
ties between the Trump
administration and

07:14.300 --> 07:20.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
large corporations; the Russia
file -- documents
reveal Russian plans to
influence the 2016

07:20.673 --> 07:26.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. election; news divisions,
stark contrasts
between where conservative and
liberal Americans

07:26.345 --> 07:33.920 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
get their news; and much more.

07:33.953 --> 07:44.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now: how behind-the-scenes moves
by a pair
of corporate giants are raising
red flags

07:44.430 --> 07:46.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about the Trump administration.

07:46.399 --> 07:51.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Companies routinely advocate and
lobby every
day on behalf of their business
and shareholders.

07:51.404 --> 07:55.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sometimes, those matters are not
just about
corporate profits, but also
about the economic

07:55.341 --> 07:57.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
livelihoods of workers and
communities.

07:57.844 --> 08:03.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But moves by ExxonMobil and Dow
Chemical are
fueling scrutiny about the
corporate influence

08:03.716 --> 08:06.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
within the Trump administration.

08:06.519 --> 08:14.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
April 2012, Rex Tillerson, then
CEO of ExxonMobil,

Russian state oil company
Rosneft.

08:16.395 --> 08:21.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It calls for investing up to
$500 billion
to hunt for oil in the Arctic
Ocean and Black

08:21.567 --> 08:23.269 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sea.

08:23.302 --> 08:24.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary of
State: I
would like to thank you for the
warm welcome,

08:24.437 --> 08:27.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and it is a historic day for
ExxonMobil and
Rosneft.

08:27.039 --> 08:32.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But two years
later, the
drilling venture was blocked,
when the U.S.

08:32.078 --> 08:37.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
imposed sanctions on Russia over
its annexation
of Crimea from Ukraine.

08:37.083 --> 08:42.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now ExxonMobil is asking the
Trump administration
to let the Black Sea part of the
project go

08:42.421 --> 08:44.190 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forward.

08:44.223 --> 08:47.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tillerson, in his new role as
secretary of
state, says he will do just as
he promised

08:47.593 --> 08:49.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
during his confirmation hearing.

08:49.462 --> 08:55.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON: As to any issues
involving
ExxonMobil that might come
before me if confirmed

08:55.768 --> 08:59.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as secretary of state, I would
recuse myself
from those issues.

08:59.772 --> 09:04.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But his past
ties to ExxonMobil
mean the request is certain to
draw extra

09:04.443 --> 09:06.178 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
scrutiny.

09:06.212 --> 09:11.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Moreover, Russia's meddling in
the 2016 election
remains a hot issue in
Washington.

09:11.250 --> 09:15.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Senator John McCain
of Arizona,
for one, voiced disbelief about
the news yesterday.

09:15.254 --> 09:18.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In a tweet, he asked: "Are they
crazy?"

09:18.424 --> 09:23.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, Dow Chemical
is asking the
new administration not to impose
new curbs

09:23.229 --> 09:26.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on three widely used
insecticides.

09:26.799 --> 09:28.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are diazinon, malathion and
chlorpyrifos.

09:28.668 --> 09:34.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Associated Press reports Dow
and two other
manufacturers want the
government to set aside

09:34.740 --> 09:40.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
federal studies that found the
chemicals may
be harmful to about 1,800
threatened or endangered

09:40.413 --> 09:41.614 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
species.

09:41.647 --> 09:44.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The companies argue the studies
are fundamentally
flawed.

09:44.817 --> 09:47.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Environmental advocates say
there's no such
thing as perfect lab conditions.

09:47.954 --> 09:51.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BRETT HARTL, Center for
Biological Diversity:
You can't just take an
endangered fish, an

09:51.490 --> 09:56.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
endangered salmon out of the
wild, take it
to the lab and then expose it to
enough pesticides

09:56.462 --> 10:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
until it dies to get that sort
of data you
need.

10:00.566 --> 10:02.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's wrong morally.

10:02.168 --> 10:04.036 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's illegal.

10:04.070 --> 10:06.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
Environmental Protection
Agency says only that it's
reviewing petitions

10:06.872 --> 10:14.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as they come in, giving careful
consideration
to sound science and good
policy-making.

10:14.113 --> 10:16.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As with Exxon, Dow's influence
will be an
issue.

10:16.649 --> 10:21.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The company contributed a
million dollars
to President Trump's inaugural
activities.

10:21.120 --> 10:28.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in February, when Mr. Trump
signed an
executive order on rolling back
regulations,

10:28.861 --> 10:32.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Dow's CEO was at his side.

10:32.365 --> 10:35.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's look into some of the
questions being
raised about each of these
examples.

10:35.501 --> 10:38.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jay Solomon broke the news about
ExxonMobil
in The Wall Street Journal.

10:39.005 --> 10:42.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Norman Eisen is a former
special counsel
to President Obama.

10:42.074 --> 10:43.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His expertise is government
ethics.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's now a fellow at the
Brookings Institution.

10:45.244 --> 10:47.113 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jay, let me start with you.

10:47.146 --> 10:48.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why does Exxon want this?

10:48.981 --> 10:50.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY SOLOMON, The Wall Street
Journal: Well,
basically, the Arctic and the
Black Sea are

10:50.916 --> 10:56.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
kind of one the most
sought-after kind of
pioneer spots for oil
exploration.

10:56.389 --> 11:01.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, for their future
earnings,
for the growth of the business,
this is seen

11:01.060 --> 11:04.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as kind of one of the last great
places to
explore.

11:04.163 --> 11:06.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How much money
are we talking
about here?

11:06.332 --> 11:08.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How significant is this
potential?

11:08.200 --> 11:13.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY SOLOMON: I mean, President
Putin, when
they announced the deal in 2012,
said it could

11:13.205 --> 11:19.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be as much as $500 billion in
investment,
and huge amounts of oil and gas
is in that

11:19.679 --> 11:21.280 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
region.

11:21.313 --> 11:23.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is it typical
for these
types of exceptions to be asked
for?

11:23.115 --> 11:25.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it sometimes on humanitarian
grounds or
other reasons?

11:25.484 --> 11:27.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAY SOLOMON: There are.

11:27.219 --> 11:31.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look in Iran or Burma, as
the Obama
administration was kind of
pursuing their

11:31.724 --> 11:36.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policies, there were exemptions
granted for
humanitarian or technology
reasons.

11:36.762 --> 11:41.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But an issue like this that is
politically
charged with this much money
with a country

11:41.600 --> 11:45.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like Russia, it's pretty unusual
that you
would see a waiver granted in
this situation.

11:45.571 --> 11:48.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Rex Tillerson,
former secretary
-- or former head of Exxon, now
the secretary

11:48.908 --> 11:50.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of state, he has recused himself
for two years.

11:50.776 --> 11:51.711 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

11:51.744 --> 11:53.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAY SOLOMON: Yes, he has.

11:53.679 --> 11:57.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, ultimately, the decision
on the waiver
is made by an office in the
Treasury Department,

11:57.550 --> 12:02.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but because of the national
security and foreign
policy implications, the State
Department,

12:02.655 --> 12:05.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
probably some of the
intelligence agencies,
it's a broader issue.

12:05.991 --> 12:10.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, obviously, when Tillerson
got this job,
the question was immediately
asked, you know,

12:11.030 --> 12:15.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how will your previous job
impact the issue
of Exxon?

12:15.601 --> 12:20.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's tricky, and already you
see Republicans
and Democrats saying, not just
because of

12:20.573 --> 12:25.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tillerson, but because of the
concerns about
Russia's hacking of the election
and the other

12:25.511 --> 12:29.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investigations, that this is not
going to
get political support.

12:29.281 --> 12:33.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Norm Eisen,
what about the
idea that Rex Tillerson has said
he will recuse

12:33.319 --> 12:35.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
himself for this?

12:35.087 --> 12:37.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Isn't that the kind of safeguard
that we have
in place to make sure that
nothing untoward

12:38.023 --> 12:39.925 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
happens?

12:39.959 --> 12:43.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NORMAN EISEN, Former Special
Counsel to President
Obama: Well, I think it's
important that Mr.

12:43.262 --> 12:44.964 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tillerson recuse himself.

12:44.997 --> 12:51.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he is to be applauded for
doing that and
for making a complete break with
Exxon.

12:51.837 --> 12:54.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that doesn't solve all the
problems here.

12:54.173 --> 12:57.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Exxon gave $500,000 to Mr.
Trump's inaugural.

12:57.843 --> 13:08.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's an enormous cloud around
Russia, not
just the violations of national
borders and

13:08.087 --> 13:14.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sovereignty that led to these
sanctions, but
also the violations of our
democratic norms.

13:14.293 --> 13:17.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There can be no doubt that they
interfered
in the election.

13:17.596 --> 13:23.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only question now is whether
Mr. Trump
or those around him knew of it
or were involved

13:23.202 --> 13:24.470 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in it.

13:24.503 --> 13:29.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, granting a sanctions waiver
here just
is not called for.

13:29.108 --> 13:33.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Norm Eisen, I
mean, a lot
of times, it's the proximity and
the adjacency

13:33.379 --> 13:36.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of facts that ends up leading us
to different
conclusions.

13:36.715 --> 13:41.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Until there is some sort of
smoking gun or
a trail of evidence, are we
prejudging?

13:41.153 --> 13:45.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /NORMAN EISEN: Well, I
think it's
very important not to prejudge,
but at the

13:45.758 --> 13:51.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
same time, it's clear now,
there's a consensus,
an intelligence community
consensus.

13:51.564 --> 13:58.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have just seen documents from
a government
think tank in Russia
demonstrating an interference

13:58.103 --> 14:06.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in our elections, what we can
describe as
an act of gray war by doing
this.

14:06.779 --> 14:09.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's an extraordinary hostility
against the
United States.

14:09.982 --> 14:16.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there's substantial
indications that there
have been contacts by those who
were in and

14:16.755 --> 14:18.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
around Mr. Trump.

14:18.557 --> 14:23.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There's very substantial
evidence that raises
serious questions here, and that
goes to the

14:23.996 --> 14:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
political climate for this
sanctions waiver.

14:27.266 --> 14:29.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think it's going to be
granted.

14:29.401 --> 14:32.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jay Solomon,
you mentioned
this a little bit, the political
climate here.

14:32.605 --> 14:36.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What kind of support or lack of
support is
there when you have, say,
Senator McCain tweeting,

14:36.575 --> 14:38.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Are you crazy?" in the case of
Exxon?

14:38.644 --> 14:40.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAY SOLOMON: No, I think it's
tough.

14:40.312 --> 14:45.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Exxon's argument is, you
know, we
have to basically start drilling
by the end

14:45.584 --> 14:51.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this year, or we're going to
lose this
concession, and if we don't get
it, the European

14:51.056 --> 14:55.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
companies that are already
starting to mobilize
in this area, they have been
granted some

14:55.394 --> 14:58.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
waivers from the European Union
to pursue
this.

14:58.430 --> 15:02.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you know, if we don't get,
it's going
to be developed, you know,
anyway, and then

15:02.968 --> 15:05.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
American jobs and money is going
to be hurt.

15:05.337 --> 15:07.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's what they're going to
argue.

15:07.273 --> 15:12.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I also agree, it's going to
be very difficult
to gin up political support in
an environment

15:12.378 --> 15:17.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where Russia, whether it's the
hacking or
the accusations of collusion or
Ukraine, it's

15:17.583 --> 15:22.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
just they have not given
President Trump anything
to work with either, the
Russians.

15:22.621 --> 15:24.423 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, I agree.

15:24.456 --> 15:27.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think it would be very
difficult for the
Trump administration to get
political support.

15:27.860 --> 15:33.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Norm Eisen, do
you have
different concerns about the
issues with Dow?

15:33.232 --> 15:43.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /NORMAN EISEN: Well,
mercifully, Dow
is not accused of any improper
assault on

15:43.409 --> 15:45.344 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our democracy.

15:45.377 --> 15:55.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we do have an even larger
political contribution
to the Trump inauguration, $1
million from

15:55.654 --> 15:56.855 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Dow.

15:56.889 --> 16:01.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have the Dow CEO, who is
seen at Mr. Trump's
side.

16:01.994 --> 16:08.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has extraordinary access in
the White House,
chairs a group that advises Mr.
Trump, was

16:08.100 --> 16:13.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there when Mr. Trump signed his
executive
order relating to cutting back
regulation.

16:13.172 --> 16:18.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now you have Dow's request
to set aside
the science -- the U.S.
government has made

16:18.410 --> 16:25.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scientific findings about these
®MD-BO /organophosphates
and the harms they cause to --
set aside that

16:25.184 --> 16:30.656 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
science and relieve regulation.

16:30.689 --> 16:32.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It doesn't smell right.

16:32.524 --> 16:35.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Norm Eisen,
how different
is this from the revolving door
that people

16:35.894 --> 16:39.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so hate about Washington, that
people come
right out of government, go
right into the

16:39.999 --> 16:43.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
private sector, and then
oftentimes right
back in if the administration
changes?

16:43.268 --> 16:47.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /NORMAN EISEN: Well, the
problem with
the Trump White House is that
they removed

16:47.606 --> 16:53.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the revolving door and just
threw it open,
and it's being flooded with
corporate executives

16:53.612 --> 16:56.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who are coming in with
lobbyists.

16:56.448 --> 17:03.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They removed the lobbying ban
that President
Obama had in his ethics
executive order.

17:03.188 --> 17:11.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And everybody believes that
business has to
have a seat at the table, has to
be on a level

17:11.864 --> 17:13.632 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
table, though.

17:13.665 --> 17:18.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem is, it appears that
the table
is tilted to disproportionately
favor business

17:18.704 --> 17:24.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as a special interest, beyond
the public interest,
and so that is worrying.

17:24.676 --> 17:26.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's in a way worse than the
revolving door.

17:26.779 --> 17:29.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Norm Eisen of
the Brookings Institution and
Jay Solomon

17:29.815 --> 17:32.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from The Wall Street Journal,
thank you both.

17:32.117 --> 17:38.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAY SOLOMON: Thank you.

17:38.757 --> 17:43.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There is news
in the Russia
file.

17:43.495 --> 17:48.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New documents reveal plans for
Russia to influence
the U.S. presidential election.

17:48.834 --> 17:50.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham has that
report.

17:50.803 --> 17:54.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Reuters
reported today that
a think tank controlled by the
Russian government

17:54.506 --> 17:59.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outlined detailed plans how to
swing the 2016
U.S. election toward Donald
Trump.

17:59.945 --> 18:04.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In two different papers, the
think tank said
Russia should use social media
and Russian-backed

18:04.650 --> 18:09.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
media to bolster Trump and to
undermine faith
in America's electoral system.

18:09.621 --> 18:13.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on these developments,
I'm joined
now by Ned Parker -- he's one of
the reporters

18:13.392 --> 18:16.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who broke the story -- and by
John Sipher.

18:16.295 --> 18:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He served 28 years in the CIA's
clandestine
service, stationed in Russia and
Eastern Europe.

18:21.633 --> 18:23.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's now with the consulting
firm CrossLead.

18:23.902 --> 18:25.771 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Gentlemen, welcome to you both.

18:25.804 --> 18:26.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ned Parker, I would like to
start with you.

18:26.905 --> 18:28.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Can you tell us a little bit
more?

18:28.407 --> 18:29.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is it that you found?

18:29.575 --> 18:30.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What did you report today?

18:31.009 --> 18:32.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NED PARKER, Reuters: Right.

18:32.911 --> 18:38.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, we found are that there
are two documents
drafted by an in-house policy
shop for the

18:39.017 --> 18:43.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kremlin that reports back to
President Vladimir
Putin.

18:43.355 --> 18:48.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this organization is also
headed by former
foreign intelligence service
officers.

18:48.627 --> 18:53.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This organization called the
Russian Institute
for Strategic Studies drafted
two reports

18:53.565 --> 18:56.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
last year, one in June and one
in October.

18:56.935 --> 19:01.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first in June talked about,
how do you
influence the U.S. electorate
through a media

19:01.773 --> 19:08.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and social media campaign to
overturn the
policies of then-President Obama
and promote

19:08.647 --> 19:14.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- persuade the U.S. public to
chose a new
U.S. administration that would
promote policies

19:14.887 --> 19:17.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
beneficial to both Russia and
the United States?

19:17.789 --> 19:21.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And, Ned, just
staying with
you for a second, is this
evidence, is this

19:21.393 --> 19:26.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in line with what U.S.
intelligence agencies
believe the Russians did, in
fact, do during

19:26.899 --> 19:27.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the election?

19:27.900 --> 19:28.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NED PARKER: Right.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that's the significance
of these documents.

19:31.870 --> 19:33.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They came in after the election.

19:33.739 --> 19:38.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second document, which is
from October,
talked about how Hillary Clinton
was likely

19:38.410 --> 19:44.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to win the election, so it made
sense to change
tack in terms of propaganda, and
rather than

19:44.616 --> 19:49.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work for her defeat and a new
administration
under Donald Trump, instead,
they should push

19:49.588 --> 19:57.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for a weak Clinton
administration, and to
bring question about the
integrity of the

19:57.062 --> 20:03.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. electoral process through
different media
and social media information
packets.

20:03.368 --> 20:08.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, getting these two documents
after the
election, it sort of
crystallized what the

20:08.707 --> 20:13.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. already knew about motive
and intent,
including the hacking, for
instance, which

20:13.212 --> 20:18.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there was forensics all over the
place linking
the hacking of the DNC and the
Clinton campaign

20:18.884 --> 20:21.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to Russia's military
intelligence.

20:21.086 --> 20:23.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: John Sipher,
you worked
in Russia.

20:23.322 --> 20:26.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You worked against the Russians
and with the
Russians.

20:26.158 --> 20:29.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does this then conform to your
understanding
of how they operate?

20:29.528 --> 20:31.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN SIPHER, Former CIA Officer:
Well, certainly,
it does.

20:31.063 --> 20:36.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this institute was actually
an internal
part of the SVR, the former KGB.

20:36.735 --> 20:39.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This is not
some separate
think tank, like we would think
of in the

20:39.471 --> 20:41.206 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
U.S.?

20:41.240 --> 20:43.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN SIPHER: No, it was an
internal sort of
analytical unit, which then
separated and

20:43.875 --> 20:49.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tied itself to the presidential
administration,
headed by longtime-serving KGB
officers.

20:49.314 --> 20:54.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, the head of it now was
in fact the
head of the SVR, which is their
external intelligence

20:54.953 --> 20:56.955 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
service.

20:56.989 --> 21:00.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Is this the
kind of evidence,
John Sipher, that gave U.S.
intelligence agencies

21:00.726 --> 21:04.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the confidence to say, we think
Russia did
meddle in the election?

21:04.396 --> 21:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN SIPHER: I think this is
another piece
in that puzzle certainly.

21:07.799 --> 21:10.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't think it's a big
surprise.

21:10.602 --> 21:15.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Putin hardly needed
this group to
tell him by June of 2016 that he
should start

21:15.440 --> 21:21.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to influence the election
or to, you
know, find a candidate that was
pro-Russian,

21:21.446 --> 21:24.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when we already by that time,
all of us sort
of knew that.

21:24.683 --> 21:31.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, I think the -- I do
think this is
part and parcel of a longer
effort that we

21:31.623 --> 21:33.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
see now in Europe.

21:33.458 --> 21:37.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the Russians are now trying
to influence
elections in Germany and Russia
and in Bulgaria.

21:37.229 --> 21:43.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, Mr. Reshetnikov,
who ran this
institute, is tied to possible
efforts to

21:43.135 --> 21:45.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
assassinate the Montenegrin
prime minister
in Montenegro.

21:45.871 --> 21:49.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that may be, in fact, why he
lost his
job in January.

21:49.141 --> 21:54.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Ned Parker, in
these two
documents, as you have
discovered them, was

21:54.813 --> 21:59.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there any mention of WikiLeaks
or the computer
hacking that intelligence
agencies also believe

21:59.851 --> 22:01.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Russians were involved in?

22:01.753 --> 22:06.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NED PARKER: No, there is no
mention of WikiLeaks
or the hacking, but I think you
have to see

22:06.325 --> 22:12.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these as they were described to
myself and
my colleagues, John Walcott and
Jon Landay.

22:12.064 --> 22:15.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were described as part and
parcel of
a campaign.

22:15.100 --> 22:20.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the Kremlin is a very
top-down, authoritarian
culture.

22:20.405 --> 22:25.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So when these documents passed
around, they
only reinforced what everyone
knew to do.

22:25.277 --> 22:31.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when you actually started to
see the WikiLeaks
dumps happening, the
Russian-affiliated media

22:31.850 --> 22:37.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outlets, like U.S. -- like
Russia Today and
Sputnik and the troll factories
outside of

22:37.923 --> 22:44.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
St. Petersburg that pump news
out on Twitter
and other outlets on the
Internet, they were

22:44.329 --> 22:51.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
able to amplify the voice and
the reach of
the hacked, stolen materials
from the Clinton

22:51.770 --> 22:53.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
campaign and DNC.

22:53.071 --> 22:55.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, they reinforced each other.

22:55.073 --> 22:59.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: John Sipher,
is it really
that easy for the Russian
government to say,

22:59.811 --> 23:04.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you three news agencies, start
pumping out
stories that are anti-Clinton or
pro-Trump?

23:04.850 --> 23:06.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that -- does it work that
obviously?

23:06.818 --> 23:10.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN SIPHER: It's funny because,
in my time
in government, especially in the
last years,

23:10.589 --> 23:14.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we often talked about an
all-of-government
approach, so, if we're going
into Afghanistan,

23:14.292 --> 23:16.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
all of our agencies and
institutes had to
work together.

23:16.962 --> 23:20.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have never been quite as good
at it as
the Russians, because that's a
centralized

23:20.399 --> 23:22.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
state.

23:22.134 --> 23:25.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the intelligence services,
from which
Mr. Putin came, were the central
sword and

23:25.871 --> 23:27.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shield of the government.

23:27.706 --> 23:32.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, therefore, yes, they do a
very good job
of a coordinated approach to use
diplomatic,

23:32.611 --> 23:35.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intelligence, military and
political power
as one.

23:35.914 --> 23:37.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I'm not surprised at all by
this.

23:37.883 --> 23:42.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Ned, you heard
John mention
earlier that the concern
obviously is that

23:42.120 --> 23:44.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Russians, they did it to us
back in 2016.

23:44.856 --> 23:48.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have elections coming up in
France and
elsewhere in Europe.

23:48.126 --> 23:52.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Did the intelligence officials
that you talked
with for this reporting, did
they give you

23:52.297 --> 23:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any sense that they believe that
the Russians
are going to be involved in
those elections

23:55.734 --> 23:56.935 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as well?

23:56.968 --> 24:00.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NED PARKER: I think that's sort
of -- it's
an open secret.

24:00.138 --> 24:01.807 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

24:01.840 --> 24:05.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You look at France, and Marine
Le Pen makes
no secret of her affection for
Russia.

24:05.544 --> 24:09.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think that's seen as part
and parcel
for the course.

24:09.848 --> 24:12.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: John Sipher,
one last question
before you go.

24:12.851 --> 24:17.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I understanding there is --
there's also reporting
about a mole hunt that is going
on within

24:17.122 --> 24:19.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the CIA right now.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From your time in the CIA, what
can you tell
us about that?

24:21.626 --> 24:23.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN SIPHER: Yes, that's
unfortunate.

24:23.695 --> 24:27.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Any organization or enterprise
has to worry
about the insider threat and
this type of

24:27.566 --> 24:29.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thing happening, to include the
CIA.

24:29.768 --> 24:34.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In my time in government, I have
seen, and
we have caught spies, like
Aldrich Ames and

24:34.639 --> 24:36.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Hanssen at the FBI.

24:36.541 --> 24:42.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Almost always in that case, it
is an intelligence
source of ours that lead us to
find out who

24:42.514 --> 24:44.182 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that person is.

24:44.216 --> 24:48.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I wish them the best of luck
in figuring
this out, and hopefully they can
find out

24:48.253 --> 24:49.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who it is before too long,
certainly.

24:49.988 --> 24:53.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
John Sipher,
Ned Parker of Reuters, thank you
both very

24:53.425 --> 24:56.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
much for being here.

24:56.194 --> 25:02.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN SIPHER: Thanks.

25:02.701 --> 25:07.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

25:07.639 --> 25:12.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Making Sense
of the airline industry's
turbulent business;

25:12.043 --> 25:16.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a new title from the "NewsHour"
Bookshelf,
"Locking Up Our Own: Crime and
Punishment

25:16.448 --> 25:22.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Black America"; and a Brief
But Spectacular
take on discovering yourself.

25:22.354 --> 25:27.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: The ouster of Bill
O'Reilly from
the FOX News Channel is an
earthquake inside

25:27.225 --> 25:32.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the conservative news media
machine that many
say, over the years, has
contributed to the

25:32.297 --> 25:33.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
polarization of America.

25:34.032 --> 25:38.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we look at one aspect
of the two
Americas what we're calling news
divisions.

25:38.904 --> 25:43.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House correspondent John
Yang went to
Arizona recently to examine how
people get

25:43.308 --> 25:47.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their news and the impact that
has on how
they see the world.

25:47.479 --> 25:53.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Marcus Huey, Ken
Block, and Delia
Salvatierra all live in the
Phoenix area and

25:53.652 --> 25:56.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
call themselves news junkies.

25:56.121 --> 25:59.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that's where the similarity
ends.

25:59.090 --> 26:05.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their sources of news are as
different as
their politics.

26:05.196 --> 26:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Salvatierra is a Democrat who
voted for Hillary
Clinton.

26:07.899 --> 26:12.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DELIA SALVATIERRA, Democrat: The
New York
Times, The Washington Post, CNN,
and "The

26:12.837 --> 26:17.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New Yorker" are sort of the
foundational things
that I surround myself with.

26:17.609 --> 26:21.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Huey is a Republican
who voted
for President Trump.

26:21.146 --> 26:25.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCUS HUEY, Republican: As a
voting member
of the Republican Party, I would
say anything

26:25.650 --> 26:29.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that comes out of FOX, I pretty
much take
to the bank.

26:29.421 --> 26:33.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If something comes from Laura
Ingraham, I
pretty much take that to the
bank.

26:33.258 --> 26:37.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: And Block, an
independent, voted
for Libertarian candidate Gary
Johnson.

26:37.996 --> 26:40.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEN BLOCK, Independent: I kind
of bounce all
over the board.

26:40.732 --> 26:44.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have Twitter and a news feed
on my phone.

26:44.936 --> 26:48.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, you know, I take a little
bit of everything.

26:48.640 --> 26:53.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: None of that
surprises Thom Reilly,
director of the nonpartisan
Morrison Institute

26:53.745 --> 26:57.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for Public Policy at Arizona
State University.

26:57.248 --> 27:02.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's one of the authors of new a
study examining
where voters get both news and
commentary.

27:02.253 --> 27:05.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOM REILLY, Director, Morrison
Institute
for Public Policy: Well, voters
today basically

27:05.390 --> 27:11.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have this cafeteria type format,
where they
can choose from personalized
news sources

27:11.262 --> 27:16.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that not only serves to inform
them, but also
reinforces their world view.

27:16.701 --> 27:21.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want to hear stuff that we
believe in,
or just kind of particularly in
a very polarized

27:21.506 --> 27:23.074 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
world.

27:23.108 --> 27:26.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I do think we're seeing
this, people going
back to what -- they feel safe.

27:26.378 --> 27:32.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The researchers found
that the
proliferation of news sources on
cable TV

27:32.083 --> 27:38.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the Internet has upended the
relationship
between news outlets and their
audiences.

27:38.323 --> 27:44.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead of voters being shaped
by news, Reilly
says news is being shaped for
voters.

27:44.529 --> 27:50.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOM REILLY: What we're seeing
is that, particularly
with a lot of Internet sources,
is they're

27:50.135 --> 27:54.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
appealing to a base, and they're
attracting
a wide audience, and it's
growing.

27:54.439 --> 27:59.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're responding to what
voters want,
instead of vice versa.

27:59.110 --> 28:03.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It used to be that
politicians
and candidates would appeal to a
base, but

28:03.515 --> 28:06.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now you're saying that news
outlets are appealing
to their base?

28:06.384 --> 28:08.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THOM REILLY: And they're shaping
it, yes,
yes.

28:08.586 --> 28:13.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Democrat Salvatierra
grew up in
a conservative Republican
household and found

28:13.491 --> 28:17.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her own brand of politics in
college at the
University of California,
Berkeley.

28:17.829 --> 28:22.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She now runs her own immigration
and criminal
law practice.

28:22.434 --> 28:26.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DELIA SALVATIERRA: I think the
press has become
increasingly important.

28:26.971 --> 28:34.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think once the new
administration attacked
certain organizations as fake
news, it only

28:34.546 --> 28:40.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
empowered me to listen to those
news organizations
even more.

28:40.218 --> 28:48.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And whereas before I could flip
back and forth
between maybe FOX News and CNN,
I don't trust

28:48.126 --> 28:51.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FOX News, because it is so
overwhelmingly
endorsed by the administration.

28:51.629 --> 28:59.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: But you're
deliberately seeking
out opinions, commentary that
reinforce your

28:59.637 --> 29:00.605 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
views?

29:00.638 --> 29:03.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DELIA SALVATIERRA: Yes, I think
so.

29:03.208 --> 29:04.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think I do that naturally.

29:05.009 --> 29:11.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wish that I could tolerate
watching FOX
News a little bit more, but I
can't, because

29:11.249 --> 29:15.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's usually the same time that
I'm watching
Anderson Cooper or Don Lemon,
and they're

29:15.186 --> 29:16.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
asking questions.

29:16.187 --> 29:17.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're asking legitimate
questions.

29:17.655 --> 29:19.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're pushing the envelope.

29:19.758 --> 29:25.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're asking the questions
that I have,
that are aligned with my views.

29:25.897 --> 29:30.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Huey, the Republican,
is a retired
small business owner.

29:30.535 --> 29:34.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He and his wife, Lorri (ph),
view the world
through a very different news
prism.

29:34.839 --> 29:40.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCUS HUEY: I try to get up a
little bit
before 7:00 -- 7:00, I'm in the
breakfast

29:40.378 --> 29:41.346 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
room.

29:41.379 --> 29:43.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have FOX News on.

29:43.248 --> 29:49.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have The Wall Street Journal
down in front
of me, and then I have my iPhone
next to me.

29:49.053 --> 29:54.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if there's no breaking,
urgent news on
the TV, then the first thing I
do is, I will

29:54.425 --> 30:00.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go check my phone, and look
through my Facebook
wall to see anything that I
might have missed

30:00.765 --> 30:02.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
through the night.

30:02.534 --> 30:06.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: You said whatever you
hear from
Laura Ingraham and from FOX, you
feel pretty

30:06.037 --> 30:07.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
much -- you feel confident in?

30:07.639 --> 30:10.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCUS HUEY: I have a track
record and history
with them.

30:10.975 --> 30:16.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I feel they both have been
reliable and
haven't really let me down that
often.

30:16.681 --> 30:21.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Breitbart, I feel good about it,
but if it's
some kind of a startling
headline, I might

30:21.319 --> 30:25.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hold back and look for other
opinions.

30:25.156 --> 30:36.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CNN and MSNBC, I feel it may not
be fake news,
but I feel that those
organizations, unfortunately,

30:36.701 --> 30:40.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think they would like to see
Trump be a
one-term president.

30:40.972 --> 30:47.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Block, an Uber and
Lyft driver,
says he voted Libertarian last
year as a default.

30:47.212 --> 30:52.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEN BLOCK: The thing I'm most
pleased with
is the fact that Hillary Clinton
didn't get

30:52.517 --> 30:54.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the White House.

30:54.085 --> 30:55.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That was my concern.

30:55.587 --> 30:59.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I couldn't vote for Trump at the
time, no,
and I don't know if I could now.

30:59.924 --> 31:05.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: A self-described
cynic, Block grew
up in a Democratic household and
became the

31:05.630 --> 31:07.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
black sheep Republican.

31:07.866 --> 31:15.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With what he calls the recent
political circus,
he declared himself an
independent.

31:15.773 --> 31:19.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
While he drives, he prefers a
right-leaning
talk radio station.

31:19.911 --> 31:26.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At home, he watches CNN and NBC
News in the
morning and at dinner time.

31:26.384 --> 31:30.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His smartphone, with his Twitter
account,
is never far away.

31:30.989 --> 31:34.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is an equal-opportunity
critic when it
comes to some of the news
sources most frequently

31:34.993 --> 31:39.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mentioned by voters in the
Arizona State Morrison
Institute study.

31:39.063 --> 31:40.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Who do you distrust the most?

31:40.565 --> 31:42.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KEN BLOCK: Wolf Blitzer.

31:42.834 --> 31:44.502 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JOHN YANG: Why?

31:44.535 --> 31:51.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEN BLOCK: He has just become
more of a grandstander
than anything else.

31:51.442 --> 31:55.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everything is breaking news,
every day, every
moment.

31:55.980 --> 31:57.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Everything can't be breaking
news.

31:57.282 --> 31:58.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not possible.

31:58.549 --> 32:00.752 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Do you watch FOX?

32:00.785 --> 32:02.887 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEN BLOCK: Not so much anymore.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.555 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I used to.

32:04.589 --> 32:10.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I felt that was one-sided, more
so than the
combination of all the other
outlets.

32:10.628 --> 32:13.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I guess there was an element
of distrust.

32:13.731 --> 32:17.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As citizens, we don't know what
we don't know.

32:17.735 --> 32:19.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're only given so much
information.

32:19.437 --> 32:24.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: How do these three
voters, with
their selected sources for news,
view one

32:24.108 --> 32:26.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
current big story?

32:26.044 --> 32:28.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you believe that the Russians
tried to
interfere with the election?

32:28.746 --> 32:34.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DELIA SALVATIERRA: Has suspicion
around this
issue remained?

32:34.585 --> 32:36.187 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Absolutely.

32:36.220 --> 32:42.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCUS HUEY: Do I believe they
tried to influence
the election for Donald Trump?

32:42.694 --> 32:44.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That seems like a stretch.

32:44.696 --> 32:49.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have the Clintons, who have
received tens
of millions of dollars, either
through -- personally

32:49.467 --> 32:51.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or through their foundation,
from the Russians.

32:51.903 --> 32:56.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In my mind, I would think that,
if Putin has
somebody he would be cheering
for, it would

32:56.841 --> 32:57.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be Hillary Clinton.

32:57.842 --> 33:02.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KEN BLOCK: I believe that they
did.

33:02.347 --> 33:09.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know if it's to the
extent they are
being accused of, but I believe
that they

33:09.220 --> 33:10.989 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
did.

33:11.022 --> 33:14.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The Arizona State
Morrison study
found that independents like
Block can help

33:14.359 --> 33:18.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bridge the alternative realities
of polarized
partisans.

33:18.129 --> 33:24.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOM REILLY: If you talk to
different people,
and you're open to different
ideas, that perhaps

33:24.268 --> 33:27.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on a larger national scale can
lead to more
compromise.

33:27.839 --> 33:32.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: As he drives his
customers, Block
says sometimes the best way to
get along is

33:32.810 --> 33:34.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
simply to change the channel.

33:34.645 --> 33:38.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEN BLOCK: A lot of times, my
customers have
just gotten off a plane, and
they will hear

33:38.449 --> 33:43.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something that just happened,
and, oh, turn
it up, turn it up, turn it up.

33:43.254 --> 33:46.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or, conversely, they will say, I
have been
listening to that all day.

33:46.758 --> 33:48.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Can you please turn that off?

33:48.192 --> 33:50.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Can we have some music?

33:50.228 --> 33:54.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: If they can agree on
that.

33:54.265 --> 34:02.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang in Phoenix.

34:02.507 --> 34:15.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The airline
industry and
its business model have been in
the crosshairs

34:15.653 --> 34:20.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of late, particularly since the
United Airlines
story captured worldwide
attention.

34:20.425 --> 34:25.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many travelers have been asking,
how do airlines
make money, and do those profits
come at the

34:25.163 --> 34:28.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
expense of passenger comfort and
convenience?

34:28.066 --> 34:31.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman,
has been exploring the turbulent
business

34:31.269 --> 34:32.637 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of aviation.

34:32.670 --> 34:36.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's part of his weekly
reporting on Making
Sense of economic news.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Oh, my God!

34:37.442 --> 34:39.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Oh, my God.

34:39.210 --> 34:43.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The whole world was
watching,
watching United Airlines last
week, as its

34:43.848 --> 34:47.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
skies proved a lot less friendly
than advertised.

34:47.518 --> 34:52.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a flight we took recently
had a much happier
ending: No passenger was
bloodied and dragged

34:52.623 --> 34:57.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the plane, which took off
from tiny Windsor
Locks, Connecticut, and landed
barely five

34:57.995 --> 35:05.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hours later in Dublin, Ireland,
for an affordable
$549 round-trip, including
four-day hotel

35:05.703 --> 35:07.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
stay for some of the passengers.

35:07.705 --> 35:13.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a larger theme of our
story, however,
that an industry notorious for
losing money

35:13.678 --> 35:20.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been making it, hand over
fist, at the
expense of often helpless
consumers, but that

35:20.084 --> 35:23.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
competition may be on the verge
of rescuing
us at long last.

35:23.554 --> 35:27.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN KAVANAGH, CEO, Aer
Lingus: The president
was kind enough to put knots in
this twine.

35:27.625 --> 35:32.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Aer Lingus CEO
Stephen Kavanagh
keeps an old globe gifted to his
predecessor

35:32.563 --> 35:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the 1960s by the president of
Ireland.

35:35.299 --> 35:39.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN KAVANAGH: The first knot
being based
in Ireland, and the second knot
was the technical

35:39.770 --> 35:42.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
range of aircraft at the time.

35:42.740 --> 35:46.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And his ambition was that
Ireland would become
a gateway point.

35:46.377 --> 35:50.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And 50 years later, we believe
we're delivering
on that ambition.

35:50.114 --> 35:54.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Now, Aer Lingus
wasn't exactly
a cash cow as a government
service.

35:54.652 --> 35:58.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Aer Lingus was owned by the
Irish government
up until when?

35:58.356 --> 35:59.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STEPHEN KAVANAGH: 2006.

35:59.590 --> 36:04.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And it lost money
in all that
time, right?

36:04.095 --> 36:05.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STEPHEN KAVANAGH: Yes.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.031 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Well, most of the time, yes.

36:07.064 --> 36:11.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: When I told
sophisticated business
people that I was doing this
story, they said,

36:11.435 --> 36:15.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
oh, airlines, an industry that
always in the
end loses money.

36:15.373 --> 36:23.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, are you just in a up phase
of what eventually
is going to be a down industry?

36:23.614 --> 36:28.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN KAVANAGH: There's no
doubt that the
business is cyclical.

36:28.152 --> 36:33.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's no doubt that that
industry over
many years has had difficulty in
returning

36:33.224 --> 36:34.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
its cost of capital to
shareholders.

36:34.759 --> 36:36.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: By difficulty, you
mean it hasn't.

36:36.827 --> 36:38.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEPHEN KAVANAGH: It hasn't.

36:38.729 --> 36:43.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But smaller,
fuel-efficient planes
can now reach well beyond the
knot on that

36:43.100 --> 36:44.902 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
1960s string.

36:44.936 --> 36:50.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Indeed, these are boom times for
airlines,
and not just Aer Lingus.

36:50.541 --> 36:52.410 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What explains the turnaround?

36:52.443 --> 36:56.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The answer demands a bit of
ancient history
and ancient footage as well.

36:56.981 --> 37:01.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For decades, governments,
including the U.S.,
strictly regulated fares and
routes, if they

37:01.986 --> 37:04.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
didn't own the carriers
outright.

37:04.288 --> 37:08.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fares worldwide were high,
routes plentiful,
planes often half-empty.

37:08.793 --> 37:12.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But profits were rare to
nonexistent.

37:12.129 --> 37:18.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, in 1977, President Jimmy
Carter anointed
Cornell economist Alfred Kahn to
deregulate.

37:18.336 --> 37:22.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALFRED KAHN, Economist: It's the
greatest
thing I ever did in my life,
other than have

37:22.573 --> 37:23.541 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
children.

37:23.574 --> 37:24.942 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:24.976 --> 37:27.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Kahn thought market
forces would
bring air travel to all.

37:27.612 --> 37:30.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He didn't worry much about
profits.

37:30.114 --> 37:34.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I visited him in Ithaca,
New York, in
2003, he was proud of his
legacy.

37:34.385 --> 37:41.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALFRED KAHN: What I did has been
extraordinarily
beneficial to millions and
millions and millions

37:41.592 --> 37:46.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of people every year who
couldn't afford to
travel, who now can visit their
grandparents,

37:46.597 --> 37:53.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which now strikes home to me, go
home for
vacation from college, who can
travel and

37:53.337 --> 37:55.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
indeed can be tourists.

37:55.139 --> 38:01.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But a key part of
Kahn's plan
never materialized: antitrust
enforcement.

38:01.579 --> 38:09.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thus, deregulation spurred a
wave of mergers,
speeded up when business was
walloped by 9/11

38:09.387 --> 38:11.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and then the crash of '08.

38:11.389 --> 38:13.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Bankruptcies abounded.

38:13.190 --> 38:20.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the U.S. fleet has shrunk
to just four
main carriers, which control 80
percent-plus

38:20.097 --> 38:21.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the U.S. market.

38:21.999 --> 38:27.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No wonder passengers are at the
mercy of the
major airlines: flights
jam-packed, routes

38:27.672 --> 38:30.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
slashed, service to smaller
airports dumped.

38:30.675 --> 38:37.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, fares have dipped, but
costs have dipped
more, thanks to new planes,
cheap fuel, do-it-ourselves

38:37.715 --> 38:43.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
software, and union work
outsourced to contract
workers.

38:43.454 --> 38:50.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, fees have so
metastasized here
in the U.S., one low-cost
airline now differentiates

38:50.961 --> 38:52.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
itself by mocking them.

38:52.363 --> 38:54.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: Is this your first
flight?

38:54.298 --> 38:57.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: On Southwest Airlines,
we don't
charge fees for stuff that
should be free.

38:57.835 --> 39:03.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: U.S. airlines alone
made an estimated
$20 billion last year.

39:03.341 --> 39:10.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fees accounted for an estimated
$3.8 billion,
itinerary change charges another
$3 billion.

39:10.548 --> 39:15.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Selling miles to credit card
companies has
been estimated to bring in
upwards of $10

39:15.119 --> 39:16.620 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
billion more.

39:16.654 --> 39:22.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hey, even Southwest is now under
pressure
to impose fees to increase
profits.

39:22.526 --> 39:27.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In justifying the profits of Aer
Lingus, which
itself has merged with British
Airways and

39:27.598 --> 39:34.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iberia, CEO Kavanagh might as
well be speaking
for the industry as a whole: It
has achieved

39:34.338 --> 39:35.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
greater efficiency.

39:35.706 --> 39:41.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, your story is: We finally
figured out
how to do it right.

39:41.178 --> 39:42.680 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is that true?

39:42.713 --> 39:44.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN KAVANAGH: We have
figured out what
you need to manage.

39:44.949 --> 39:46.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KEVIN DILLON, Executive
Director, Connecticut
Airport Authority: Airlines are
extremely

39:46.817 --> 39:48.552 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
profitable at this juncture.

39:48.586 --> 39:52.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Kevin Dillon runs
Connecticut's
Airport Authority.

39:52.723 --> 39:58.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
With only four carriers
dominating the domestic
market, he has to pay to bring
new business

39:58.562 --> 40:00.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to his underserved airport.

40:00.464 --> 40:05.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN DILLON: Our passengers out
of this catchment
area for many, many years have
driven down

40:05.035 --> 40:07.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to New York or driven up to
Logan.

40:07.037 --> 40:11.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Connecticut offered
$13 million
dollars in cash and guarantees.

40:11.075 --> 40:16.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they still had to bribe you
to get you
to do this.

40:16.147 --> 40:17.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DECLAN KEARNEY, Director of
Communications,
Aer Lingus: Well, but if what
you're referring

40:17.948 --> 40:22.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to is that we're getting support
from the
airport and from Connecticut,
yes, it's helpful,

40:23.020 --> 40:26.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
as was we put a lot of
commercial risk into
launching a route.

40:26.991 --> 40:30.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fact that they would share
some of the
risk, we think is totally fair.

40:30.094 --> 40:34.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Aer Lingus
spokesman Declan Kearney
stressed that the company too is
making an

40:34.899 --> 40:40.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investment, $50 million in
equipment, crew
and fuel costs, promotion.

40:40.771 --> 40:45.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the bottom line is that the
profits from
overbooked flights, infuriating
fees and cheaper

40:46.010 --> 40:49.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
costs are luring competitors
once more.

40:49.680 --> 40:54.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We first reported this torrent
of competition
last year, when no-frills
Norwegian Airlines

40:54.852 --> 41:00.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
began flying to the balmy isle
of Guadeloupe
from New York and Boston for
$69.

41:00.724 --> 41:08.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Norwegian is about to start
flying to Scotland
from Connecticut, as we flew
affordably to

41:08.933 --> 41:12.269 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Dublin.

41:12.303 --> 41:17.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As we enjoy a brief pub
interlude, remember
the advantages of competition on
flights to

41:17.608 --> 41:26.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dublin or anywhere else: low
fares, no fees,
comfy planes from which no one
is in danger

41:26.083 --> 41:29.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of forcible removal, because of
the profits
that beckon.

41:29.987 --> 41:32.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And one last time, why the
profits?

41:32.556 --> 41:35.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Two main reasons, claims Aer
Lingus CEO Kavanagh.

41:35.860 --> 41:41.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN KAVANAGH: That there has
been some
level of consolidation in North
America, where

41:41.532 --> 41:48.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's possible for airlines as
businesses to
generate sustainable levels of
profitability.

41:48.205 --> 41:50.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the other is, capital is
more disciplined
as to where it's deployed.

41:50.975 --> 41:55.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Investors are more
disciplined,
he means, in that they now
demand immediate

41:55.079 --> 41:58.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
profits, or simply sell their
airline stocks.

41:58.816 --> 42:03.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But maybe the discipline in
North America
is just consolidation, right?

42:03.954 --> 42:11.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it may be that if there
were more
vigorous pursuit of antitrust in
America,

42:11.095 --> 42:17.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you would have more competitors
competing
on price, and then airlines
wouldn't be making

42:17.568 --> 42:18.936 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
any money again.

42:18.969 --> 42:22.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kavanagh's answer to this
question may be
the moral of this story.

42:22.840 --> 42:25.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEPHEN KAVANAGH: That is
undeniably true.

42:25.643 --> 42:33.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you have full freedom of
access to a market,
where capital is cheap, where
there isn't

42:33.918 --> 42:37.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a discipline of a return, then
that isn't
a stable market.

42:37.388 --> 42:42.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in airlines, no business in
that type
of environment is capable of
generating sustainable

42:42.593 --> 42:44.295 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
return.

42:44.328 --> 42:46.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Which would suggest
that, once
competition hits full-throttle,
consumers

42:46.230 --> 42:54.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
may then again be flying high,
while the airline
industry will be coming back
down to earth.

42:54.538 --> 43:01.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," Paul

HARI SREENIVASAN: Now: race,
crime and imprisonment.

43:16.193 --> 43:19.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the focus of the newest
addition to
the "NewsHour" Bookshelf.

43:19.296 --> 43:21.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has that.

43:21.098 --> 43:25.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Mass
incarceration and its
devastating effect on black
Americans and

43:25.102 --> 43:29.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
neighborhoods, it's a subject
that's attracted
much attention in books and
policy circles

43:29.540 --> 43:31.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the last decade.

43:31.208 --> 43:35.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A new take on the issue comes in
the book
"Locking Up Our Own: Crime and
Punishment

43:35.713 --> 43:41.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Black America," based in part
on the experience
of author James Forman Jr. as a
public defender

43:41.185 --> 43:45.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Washington, D.C. Forman is
now a professor
at Yale Law School and joins me
now

43:45.923 --> 43:47.658 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome to you.

43:47.691 --> 43:48.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES FORMAN JR., Author,
"Locking Up Our
Own: Crime and Punishment in
Black America":

43:48.058 --> 43:49.560 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

43:49.593 --> 43:51.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let me pick up on
that experience
of being a public defender.

43:51.128 --> 43:54.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What did you see there that made
you rethink
the story of mass incarceration?

43:54.264 --> 43:59.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES FORMAN JR.: Well, I went
into the job
because I viewed this as the
civil rights

43:59.370 --> 44:03.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issue of my generation, one in
three black
men under criminal justice
supervision.

44:03.941 --> 44:10.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when I got to local courts
of Washington,
D.C., what I saw was case after
case with

44:10.280 --> 44:13.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
African-American judges,
prosecutors, bailiffs.

44:13.283 --> 44:19.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
D.C. has a significant
African-American representation
in operation of this criminal
justice system.

44:19.556 --> 44:21.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that system was very harsh.

44:21.625 --> 44:26.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had one case where a judge
before locking
up my client lectured him on
Martin Luther

44:26.397 --> 44:28.132 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
King.

44:28.165 --> 44:31.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said, Martin Luther King
fought and died
for your generation to be free,
and you're

44:31.635 --> 44:37.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out here messing it up, carrying
a gun, getting
high, disrespecting your family
and the neighborhood.

44:37.741 --> 44:40.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that's the thing that really
told me there
was a story here.

44:40.778 --> 44:43.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You know, a
number of books
and thinkers have looked as this
over the

44:43.747 --> 44:48.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last number of years, mass
incarceration through
the lens on institutional
racism, right, even

44:48.552 --> 44:52.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a continuation of the history of
slavery in
this country.

44:52.056 --> 44:55.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are you challenging the story,
filling it
in?

44:55.526 --> 44:57.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you see yourself doing
here?

44:57.094 --> 45:01.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES FORMAN JR.: No, I think
that story is
correct and powerful and urgent.

45:01.131 --> 45:06.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what I see what I'm doing is
adding to
it, because there's a part of
the story that

45:06.737 --> 45:08.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we haven't focused on yet.

45:08.706 --> 45:13.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's the part of the story
of this generation
of African-American
decision-makers that came

45:13.377 --> 45:18.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in at the end of the civil
rights movement
and took office, became police
chiefs, became

45:18.315 --> 45:20.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
prosecutors, became judges.

45:20.084 --> 45:21.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What were they doing during
the...

45:21.285 --> 45:22.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Became the
attorney general.

45:22.419 --> 45:23.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You talk about Eric Holder.

45:23.420 --> 45:25.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES FORMAN JR.: Absolutely,
who...

45:25.222 --> 45:29.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Give us an
example, though,
I mean, of what -- a specific
example, like

45:29.393 --> 45:31.095 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Holder?

45:31.128 --> 45:33.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES FORMAN JR.: Well, OK, so
somebody like
Eric Holder comes in as the U.S.
attorney

45:33.263 --> 45:38.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the District of Columbia in
the early
1990s, and he gives a big speech
where he

45:38.302 --> 45:42.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says, crime and violence are
destroying our
communities.

45:42.606 --> 45:48.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says, the black people of
D.C. are no more
free than the black people of
Selma, Alabama,

45:48.645 --> 45:50.547 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were in 1955.

45:50.581 --> 45:55.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what's keeping us down,
what's keeping
us locked inside is crime and
violence and

45:55.953 --> 45:57.755 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
criminal gangs.

45:57.788 --> 46:03.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in response to that, he
promoted a program
called Operation Cease-Fire,
where police

46:03.127 --> 46:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would stop cars on any pretext,
of a minor
traffic violation, speeding,
tinted windows,

46:10.067 --> 46:13.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you name it, because they wanted
to search
those cars for guns.

46:13.337 --> 46:18.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, with good
intention, the
best intentions, of protecting
the black community,

46:18.742 --> 46:23.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but you're suggesting all of
that helped foment
what's come in the mass
incarceration.

46:23.380 --> 46:25.149 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES FORMAN JR.: Exactly.

46:25.182 --> 46:29.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the story -- my story is
a tragedy,
right, because it is a story of
best intentions

46:29.720 --> 46:31.488 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in many cases.

46:31.522 --> 46:35.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have people, often, they
don't -- part
of the story is that people
didn't know what

46:35.259 --> 46:36.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was going to happen next.

46:36.760 --> 46:40.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, in the 1970s, they chose not
to decriminalize
marijuana.

46:40.464 --> 46:43.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That was a big debate in D.C. at
the time.

46:43.834 --> 46:45.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And when -- they didn't do it.

46:45.602 --> 46:49.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they said, well, it's not
that big of
a deal if we don't decriminalize
marijuana,

46:49.540 --> 46:54.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because nobody's really going to
prison, no
one's losing their job for a
marijuana conviction.

46:54.645 --> 47:00.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then, later in the '80s and
in the '90s,
we passed laws that said you
can't get a student

47:00.284 --> 47:05.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
loan, you can't get public
housing, you can't
get a job if you have a
marijuana conviction.

47:05.389 --> 47:10.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, a decision they made at time
A later turns
out to have these devastating
effects.

47:10.994 --> 47:15.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, when and why
did these
attitudes change?

47:15.065 --> 47:17.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Or have they shifted
sufficiently?

47:17.100 --> 47:19.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES FORMAN JR.: Well, they
have shifted
in part.

47:19.369 --> 47:22.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think the big thing that's
happened
in the last few years -- and the
Black Lives

47:23.006 --> 47:27.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Matter movement is a part of
this, important
writers like Michelle Alexander
and Bryan

47:27.778 --> 47:31.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Stevenson and Ta-Nehisi Coates
have really
promoted this issue.

47:31.915 --> 47:37.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And attitudes in the black
community have
started to change, as people
more and more

47:37.087 --> 47:41.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see mass incarceration as a
racial justice
issue.

47:41.124 --> 47:47.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But one thing that hasn't
changed is, we still
don't really talk about people
who have committed

47:47.497 --> 47:49.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
violent crimes.

47:49.299 --> 47:54.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we say we're going to try
to reduce mass
incarceration, our whole focus
so far has

47:54.571 --> 47:56.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been on nonviolent drug
offenders.

47:56.807 --> 47:59.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I argue in the book, that's
not going
far enough.

47:59.376 --> 48:04.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Why is it
important to recognize
the role of African-Americans in
bringing

48:04.848 --> 48:06.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about mass incarceration?

48:06.617 --> 48:12.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, why is it important to
fill in or
tell the story, take the story
further the

48:12.189 --> 48:13.957 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
way you have?

48:13.991 --> 48:17.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES FORMAN JR.: Well, part of
it, honestly,
is, you know, I'm just that kind
of person

48:17.160 --> 48:21.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who, if I go to a movie, and
there's no black
characters, somebody asks me at
the end of

48:21.098 --> 48:23.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the movie, what did you think
about it, I
say, well, it was OK, but there
were -- there

48:23.867 --> 48:25.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were no -- where were the black
characters?

48:25.602 --> 48:30.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I think that black
people have been
central to every part of
American history.

48:30.207 --> 48:33.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I don't want to watch a
movie, I don't
want to read a book, I don't
want to study

48:33.310 --> 48:37.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
history that doesn't show the
role that African-Americans
were playing.

48:37.981 --> 48:42.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that, to me, is really, at a
basic level,
the number one reason.

48:42.152 --> 48:48.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But it's also because,
factually, we were
there, right, in D.C., in
Atlanta, in Memphis,

48:49.026 --> 48:51.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Los Angeles, in Chicago, in
New York.

48:51.862 --> 48:54.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have substantial
African-American representation.

48:54.831 --> 48:57.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just don't think we can
write us out
of the picture.

48:57.601 --> 49:00.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let me ask you,
finally, I
mean, we started with a personal
story, you

49:00.370 --> 49:04.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a public defender, talking
about the unfinished
work of the civil rights
movement.

49:04.508 --> 49:09.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're also the son of a very
prominent civil
rights leader, James Forman.

49:09.579 --> 49:15.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Connect the dots for me, the
kind of work
as a public defender, but, more
importantly,

49:15.052 --> 49:18.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the mass incarceration problem
now to the
civil rights movement.

49:18.855 --> 49:19.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you see it?

49:19.957 --> 49:23.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES FORMAN JR.: Well, they
have this similarity.

49:23.160 --> 49:29.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both of them have -- that is to
say, Jim Crow
and mass incarceration both have
led to a

49:29.533 --> 49:35.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whole part of the population
being locked
out of opportunity by being
defined by a certain

49:35.238 --> 49:39.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
status, either your race or the
fact that
you have a criminal conviction.

49:39.443 --> 49:45.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that means you can't get a
job, you can't
get public housing, you can't
get student

49:45.082 --> 49:48.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
loans, you can't live freely as
an American
citizen.

49:48.852 --> 49:54.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think, really, what the
civil rights
movement was about was finding
the most acute

49:54.491 --> 49:58.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thing that was harming black
people, which
at the time was Jim Crow, and
responding.

49:58.929 --> 50:02.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I see the movement to fight
mass incarceration
in much the same way today.

50:02.399 --> 50:06.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, the
new book is
"Locking Up Our Own: Crime and
Punishment

50:06.036 --> 50:07.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Black America,"

50:07.671 --> 50:08.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
James Forman Jr., thank you very
much.

50:08.638 --> 50:12.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES FORMAN JR.: Thank you.

50:12.342 --> 50:23.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Next, another
installment
of Brief But Spectacular, where
we ask interesting

50:23.954 --> 50:25.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people to describe their
passions.

50:25.822 --> 50:30.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tonight, we hear from
illustrator Catia Chien
on what it means to create from
the inside

50:30.694 --> 50:31.661 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out.

50:31.695 --> 50:33.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Her latest picture book is
"Things to Do."

50:33.463 --> 50:38.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CATIA CHIEN, Artist: When I was
growing up,
I didn't actually have bedtime
stories or

50:38.035 --> 50:39.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
anything like that.

50:39.036 --> 50:41.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I grew up in a pretty
dysfunctional family.

50:41.138 --> 50:43.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was a lot of emotional
upheaval.

50:43.607 --> 50:45.108 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I did grow up with comics.

50:45.142 --> 50:48.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Comic books really gave me a way
out of that
loneliness.

50:48.912 --> 50:51.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's this comic book
character named Monica.

50:51.314 --> 50:53.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was a constant that I had in
my life.

50:53.583 --> 50:56.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I could read stories about
Monica and her
friends.

50:56.053 --> 51:00.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought that if I grew up and
I could do
that for another child, like,
that would be

51:00.524 --> 51:08.965 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
worthwhile.

51:08.999 --> 51:12.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I definitely feel that I wasn't
seen when
I was a child.

51:12.269 --> 51:15.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I moved to the U.S., I
didn't have a
voice.

51:15.272 --> 51:17.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
English was difficult for me to
speak.

51:17.240 --> 51:20.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was when I really connected
with the
value of art and expression.

51:20.777 --> 51:26.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a sense of wanting to
find belonging
when you have experiences of
being an outsider,

51:26.583 --> 51:32.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and wanting to create something
that feels
really true to yourself,because
you're constantly

51:32.656 --> 51:36.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
comparing yourself to something
else, and
it doesn't quite match.

51:36.059 --> 51:41.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The process of creating from the
inside out,
it's really a process of
mattering.

51:41.565 --> 51:46.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I teach, a lot of students
ask me like,
what do you use, what is your
tool, and stuff

51:46.436 --> 51:47.404 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like that.

51:47.437 --> 51:48.438 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It goes much deeper than that.

51:48.472 --> 51:50.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It goes into, like, who are you?

51:50.073 --> 51:51.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you actually want to
say?

51:51.741 --> 51:53.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What matters to you?

51:53.343 --> 51:55.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
From that place, everything is
possible.

51:55.545 --> 51:57.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You will find a way to get it
out.

51:57.347 --> 52:01.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the best things that I
things that
I do with the kids is that I
say, let's all

52:01.118 --> 52:04.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
close our eyes and all pretend
to be an illustrator.

52:04.721 --> 52:10.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I guide them through a series of
visual things
that they're experiencing
through their imagination.

52:10.861 --> 52:16.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when I did "A Boy and a
Jaguar," I had
them experience the jungle, and
they jump

52:16.133 --> 52:20.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into a lake, and then they look
in the lake,
and what's reflected back to
them is the face

52:20.770 --> 52:22.539 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of a jaguar.

52:22.572 --> 52:26.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was this kid in the back
of the room
that was really loud and rowdy,
didn't want

52:26.042 --> 52:27.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
anything to do with me.

52:27.577 --> 52:31.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he raised his hand and he
said, "I didn't
know that I could go there."

52:31.414 --> 52:36.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the meaning of empathy, a
story that's
not your own that you can step
inside of.

52:36.686 --> 52:38.221 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's empathy.

52:38.255 --> 52:42.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My family, in terms of how they
have responded
to my work, it's so practical.

52:42.926 --> 52:46.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, it has to do with
like, is that
paying you?

52:46.630 --> 52:50.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have long ago understood that
that's not
where the gold is.

52:50.867 --> 52:55.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, you will chase that
forever, and
then, at the end of your life,
you think,

52:55.172 --> 52:56.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like, what have I done?

52:56.573 --> 53:00.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The feeling of actually
belonging, it's self-created.

53:00.477 --> 53:06.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Arriving at the process of
creating something
from the inside out, it's really
just a validation

53:06.416 --> 53:08.251 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of existing.

53:08.285 --> 53:12.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It matters that we add to the
conversation,
so it's not just one voice
that's being told

53:12.355 --> 53:13.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in picture books.

53:13.523 --> 53:15.192 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It matters.

53:15.225 --> 53:19.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My name is Catia Chien.

53:19.529 --> 53:23.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this was my Brief But
Spectacular take
on creating from the inside out.

53:24.000 --> 53:29.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

And again to our honor roll of
American service
personnel killed in Iraq and
Afghanistan.

53:36.046 --> 53:39.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
