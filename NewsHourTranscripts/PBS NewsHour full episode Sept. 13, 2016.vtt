00:05.439 --> 00:06.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
America's financial boost.

00:10.944 --> 00:16.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. incomes rise for the first
time in almost
a decade, as poverty rates drop.

00:16.950 --> 00:18.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead this
Tuesday:

00:18.752 --> 00:21.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
What sets Hillary apart is that,
through it

00:21.922 --> 00:23.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
all, she just keeps on going.

00:23.724 --> 00:28.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: President Obama
campaigns for
a recovering Hillary Clinton,
while Donald

00:28.362 --> 00:30.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump faces new questions over
his foundation.

00:30.631 --> 00:36.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Then: a farm in
Italy run by
migrants that's missing a key
ingredient,

00:36.670 --> 00:38.305 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the migrants.

00:38.338 --> 00:42.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Malcolm Brabant reports on where
public money
for the refugee crisis is going.

00:42.876 --> 00:48.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And we continue our
Rethinking
College series with a spotlight
on Latino

00:48.048 --> 00:51.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
men and why so many are missing
from higher
education's classrooms.

00:51.685 --> 00:55.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANTONIO SALMERO, College
Student: There's
this sense of machismo in
Mexican cultural.

00:55.923 --> 01:00.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And machismo is the belief that
being a man
is providing for your family.

01:00.794 --> 01:08.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:08.535 --> 01:11.271 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:11.305 --> 01:20.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Hillary Clinton is
still on the
sick list tonight, but she's
gotten a political

01:20.414 --> 01:22.182 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
shot in the arm.

01:22.215 --> 01:26.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It came today from the man she
once battled
for the presidency, and now
hopes to succeed

01:26.787 --> 01:29.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the White House.

01:29.323 --> 01:36.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's the biggest surrogate an
ailing Hillary
Clinton could have called on, at
a moment

01:36.129 --> 01:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the candidate needed it most.

01:40.634 --> 01:45.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Philadelphia today, President
Obama offered
a rousing defense of his former
secretary

01:45.505 --> 01:47.341 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of state.

01:47.374 --> 01:49.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
She's been accused of everything
you can imagine

01:49.242 --> 02:00.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and has been subjected to more
scrutiny, and
what I believe is more unfair
criticism, than

02:00.887 --> 02:04.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
anybody out here.

02:04.191 --> 02:10.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We take for granted sometimes
what is steady
and true.

02:10.664 --> 02:13.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Hillary Clinton's steady,
and she is true.

02:13.867 --> 02:17.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Clinton remained
sidelined with
pneumonia today.

02:17.471 --> 02:23.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she called in to CNN last
night to discuss
her collapse on Sunday and the
delay in publicly

02:23.877 --> 02:25.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
acknowledging her illness.

02:25.779 --> 02:29.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDERSON COOPER, CNN: Why not
just say on
Friday, as you said to --
apparently to Senator

02:29.783 --> 02:33.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Schumer on Sunday, you know, I
have pneumonia,
folks, I'm going to power
through it?

02:33.086 --> 02:34.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why keep it a secret?

02:34.921 --> 02:38.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Well, I just didn't think it was
going to

02:38.625 --> 02:40.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be that big a deal.

02:40.427 --> 02:44.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Republican Donald
Trump was on
the road, stopping in Iowa,
ready, he said,

02:44.664 --> 02:47.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
with a plan to ease the
financial burden of
child care.

02:47.734 --> 02:51.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
We have to start taking care of
each other,

02:51.138 --> 02:53.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
which we're not doing.

02:53.407 --> 02:59.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, I'm going to roll out a
plan to help
our mothers and our families get
affordable

02:59.613 --> 03:02.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quality child care for their
children.

03:02.616 --> 03:07.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Trump's allies stuck
to a different
topic: condemning Clinton for
putting half

03:07.187 --> 03:11.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of his supporters into what she
called a basket
of deplorables.

03:11.291 --> 03:14.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: The
racist, sexist,
homophobic, xenophobic.

03:14.628 --> 03:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Donald Trump Jr.
posted a photo
showing an overflowing Trump
rally, with the

03:20.267 --> 03:23.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
line, "Looks like we are going
to need a bigger
basket."

03:23.904 --> 03:29.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Trump and running mate Mike
Pence faced
new pressure for refusing to say
former Ku

03:29.242 --> 03:35.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Klux Klan leader David Duke is,
to use Clinton's
critique, deplorable.

03:35.282 --> 03:38.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Pence huddled with House
Republicans at the
U.S. Capitol today.

03:38.118 --> 03:39.920 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

03:39.953 --> 03:40.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE PENCE (R-IN), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
Donald Trump and I have
denounced David Duke

03:40.921 --> 03:43.356 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
repeatedly.

03:43.390 --> 03:49.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have said that we do not want
his support,
and we do not want support of
people who think

03:49.229 --> 03:54.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like him, that the simple fact
is that I'm
not in the name-calling
business.

03:54.301 --> 04:00.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I'm also not going to
validate the language
that Hillary Clinton used to
describe the

04:00.107 --> 04:01.775 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
American people.

04:01.808 --> 04:05.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A campaign official
says Trump
will visit Flint, Michigan,
tomorrow.

04:05.412 --> 04:10.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's said he would have
prevented the city's
water crisis if he'd been
president.

04:10.884 --> 04:15.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton is unlikely to return to
the campaign
trail before Friday, as she
recovers, under

04:15.956 --> 04:18.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doctor's orders, at home in New
York.

04:18.825 --> 04:24.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will be back later in the
program with
a look at questions about Donald
Trump's foundation

04:24.498 --> 04:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and his charitable giving.

04:26.266 --> 04:30.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news, the
cease-fire in Syria appears to
be holding

04:30.403 --> 04:33.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the most part, despite
reports of scattered
violations.

04:33.940 --> 04:40.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the ravaged city of Aleppo,
streets and
skies were quiet, and some
people ventured

04:40.247 --> 04:41.581 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.N. special envoy for Syria
confirmed
the change from Geneva.

04:44.384 --> 04:47.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STAFFAN DE MISTURA, Special
United Nations
Envoy for Syria: Sources on the
ground, which

04:47.220 --> 04:55.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do matter, including inside
Aleppo city, said
the situation has dramatically
improved with

04:55.095 --> 04:56.963 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
no airstrikes.

04:56.997 --> 05:04.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Comparing the bottom line to
previous days,
there is no doubt a significant
drop in violence.

05:04.738 --> 05:10.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Two groups of aid
trucks were
able to cross today into Syria
from Turkey.

05:10.610 --> 05:13.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's unclear when they will
be allowed
into Aleppo.

05:13.046 --> 05:18.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Meanwhile, rebels in
Eastern Ukraine
announced a unilateral
cease-fire.

05:18.485 --> 05:21.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're backed by Russia, and
it's the first
time they have taken that step.

05:22.022 --> 05:27.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It came as Ukraine's President
Petro Poroshenko
said Parliament will vote soon
on granting

05:27.327 --> 05:29.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
autonomy to eastern provinces.

05:29.629 --> 05:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fighting there has killed
more than 9,500
people since 2014.

05:33.867 --> 05:39.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Former Israeli
President and
Prime Minister Shimon Peres
suffered a stroke

05:39.372 --> 05:42.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today, and was hospitalized
outside Tel Aviv.

05:42.142 --> 05:47.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The hospital director said the
93-year-old
suffered extensive bleeding in
the brain,

05:47.948 --> 05:50.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and is now sedated and breathing
on a respirator.

05:51.017 --> 05:56.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Peres has held nearly every top
office in
Israel, serving in 12 separate
cabinets.

05:56.623 --> 06:03.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He won the Nobel Peace Prize in
1994 for negotiating
interim peace accords with the
Palestinians.

GWEN IFILL: The Philippines' new
leader sent
more mixed signals today about
his country's

06:08.969 --> 06:11.304 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
alliance with the United States.

06:11.338 --> 06:16.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Rodrigo Duterte called
yesterday
for American military advisers
to leave the

06:16.343 --> 06:18.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Southern Philippines.

06:18.178 --> 06:23.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, today, he said there would
be no change
in ties, while also rejecting
joint patrols

06:23.250 --> 06:25.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the U.S. in the South China
Sea.

06:25.719 --> 06:31.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RODRIGO DUTERTE, Philippine
President: We
will not join any expedition of
patrolling

06:31.258 --> 06:33.026 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the seas.

06:33.059 --> 06:45.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will not allow it, because I
do not want
my country to be involved in a
hostile act.

06:45.338 --> 06:50.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That appeared to
contradict an
agreement for patrols with U.S.
forces reached

06:50.410 --> 06:52.312 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last April.

06:52.345 --> 06:55.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, the governing
body for college sports has put
new pressure

06:55.982 --> 06:57.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on North Carolina.

06:57.984 --> 07:03.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, the NCAA said it's
pulling all
championship events out of the
state.

07:03.657 --> 07:09.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It cited a state law barring
special protections
for transgender people and
others.

07:09.362 --> 07:14.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A spokesman for Governor Pat
McCrory called
the decision -- quote -- "so
absurd, it's

07:14.167 --> 07:15.302 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
almost comical."

07:15.335 --> 07:18.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Easy come, easy go
on Wall Street
today.

07:19.005 --> 07:23.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Yesterday's gains mostly
evaporated after
oil prices slumped and took the
rest of the

07:23.810 --> 07:25.145 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
market down.

07:25.178 --> 07:32.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 258
points to close at 18066.

The Nasdaq fell 56 points, and
the S&amp;P 500

JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
why many people aren't feeling
the benefits

07:40.226 --> 07:47.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of rising incomes; questions
arise around
Donald Trump's charity; an
Italian farm claims

07:47.600 --> 07:55.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to employ migrants, but
something's missing;
and much more.

07:55.542 --> 08:09.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: This campaign has
often focused
on the question of economic
growth, jobs and

08:09.155 --> 08:11.191 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wages, particularly for the
middle class.

08:11.224 --> 08:16.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, today, there was some good
news on that
front, as well as for
lower-income households.

08:16.629 --> 08:21.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins looks at those
latest numbers,
and why so many Americans say
they don't square

08:21.835 --> 08:23.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with their own experiences.

08:23.203 --> 08:27.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It is a triple
hit of good
economic news.

08:27.474 --> 08:33.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New census data showed that,
last year, median
income rose 5.2 percent, the
number of Americans

08:33.813 --> 08:40.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
living in poverty shrank by 3.5
million people,
and the percentage of uninsured
Americans

08:40.186 --> 08:41.588 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
dropped.

08:41.621 --> 08:44.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama, campaigning for
Hillary Clinton
in Pennsylvania, crowed.

08:44.190 --> 08:48.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
It's important just to
understand this is

08:48.328 --> 08:50.063 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a big deal.

08:50.096 --> 08:55.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More Americans are working, more
have health
insurance, incomes are rising,
poverty is

08:55.602 --> 08:57.003 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
falling.

08:57.036 --> 09:00.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But behind each
of these
numbers, there is more going on.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's start with paychecks.

09:02.409 --> 09:08.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That increase is historic, the
largest percentage
jump in at least five decades,
and median

09:08.248 --> 09:10.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
incomes rose for every age
group.

09:10.350 --> 09:15.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, plenty of folks may say,
wait a second,
it definitely doesn't feel like
I got a big

09:15.588 --> 09:16.723 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pay raise.

09:16.756 --> 09:18.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they have a point.

09:18.391 --> 09:21.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Median income in America started
plummeting
in 2008.

09:21.828 --> 09:28.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, as we learned today,
median income rose
last year, by $2,800.

09:28.468 --> 09:29.769 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
The problem?

09:29.803 --> 09:34.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That is still below what
Americans were making
in 2007.

09:34.841 --> 09:38.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This economic angst is a driving
force on
the campaign trail.

09:38.077 --> 09:42.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Inequality is too high, wages
are too low,

09:42.415 --> 09:45.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it is still too hard for too
many to get ahead.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
But what has happened is, we
have people in

09:48.655 --> 09:55.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the audience, in 18 years,
they're making
less money now than they made 18
years ago,

09:55.495 --> 09:57.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in real wages, 18.

09:57.163 --> 09:59.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in many cases, they're
working two and
three jobs.

09:59.499 --> 10:03.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: The two
candidates have spent
less time focused on another
number out today,

10:03.937 --> 10:05.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the poverty rate.

10:05.338 --> 10:09.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It fell, from over 10 percent to
about 9 percent.

10:09.075 --> 10:12.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the biggest drop since at
least the
1960s.

10:12.946 --> 10:19.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even so, 43 million Americans
remain in poverty,
and, disproportionately, those
Americans are

10:19.719 --> 10:23.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
blacks, Hispanics and children
of all races.

10:23.122 --> 10:26.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now to the third figure out
today: health
insurance.

10:26.359 --> 10:29.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obamacare is clearly covering
more people.

10:29.829 --> 10:35.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Four million more Americans were
covered last
year and more than 90 percent of
all documented

10:35.668 --> 10:37.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Americans were insured.

10:37.737 --> 10:40.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Obamacare raises other
concerns.

10:40.039 --> 10:44.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of people, 29 million,
still have no
insurance.

10:44.577 --> 10:48.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For those who are on Obamacare
exchanges,
premiums, out-of-pocket costs,
they are rising.

10:48.781 --> 10:52.185 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And their choices are shrinking.

10:52.218 --> 10:57.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Forecasts estimate that in a
third of all
U.S. counties, the exchange will
offer just

10:57.357 --> 11:00.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a single insurer to choose from.

11:00.059 --> 11:05.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for Americans, a day of
historic bright
news, but after climbing out of
a long recession

11:05.932 --> 11:11.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and while grappling with still
unsolved issues
like income inequality, they may
not feel

11:11.404 --> 11:13.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the sunshine yet.

11:13.239 --> 11:16.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

11:16.176 --> 11:21.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Recently, Hillary
Clinton has
been criticized for allegedly
giving special

11:21.714 --> 11:26.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
access to Clinton Foundation
donors when she
served as secretary of state.

11:27.020 --> 11:31.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now Donald Trump is catching
heat for
how his foundation has
functioned.

11:31.624 --> 11:36.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm joined by David Fahrenthold
of The Washington
Post, who has spent the past few
months digging

11:36.229 --> 11:43.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into the Republican nominee's
history of charitable
donations and his lack of
personal contributions

11:43.169 --> 11:45.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the Trump Foundation.

11:45.204 --> 11:47.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Fahrenthold, thank you for
talking with
us.

11:47.740 --> 11:50.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tell us first a little bit about
the foundation.

11:50.076 --> 11:51.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How is it set up?

11:51.344 --> 11:53.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How is it different from other
foundations?

11:53.146 --> 11:55.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVID FAHRENTHOLD, The
Washington Post: Well,
it's quite a small foundation.

11:55.214 --> 11:57.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Trump started it in 1987.

11:57.116 --> 12:00.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in contrast to other people
who have about
as much money as Trump has, it
doesn't have

12:00.787 --> 12:01.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
very much money in at all.

12:02.021 --> 12:06.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The most money it ever had was
about $3.3
million in 2009.

12:06.125 --> 12:08.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The most money it has now is
about $1 million
total.

12:08.962 --> 12:11.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, there's no paid staff.

12:11.664 --> 12:16.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The board of it is just four
Trumps, Donald,
Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka,
and one Trump

12:16.970 --> 12:18.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Organization employee.

12:18.137 --> 12:19.539 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They all work with no pay.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They work half-an-hour a week.

12:21.507 --> 12:26.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The most unusual thing about it
is not just
that it's small, but whose money
is in it.

12:26.045 --> 12:29.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump hasn't put any
money into his
own foundation until 2008.

12:29.148 --> 12:30.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Instead, he's got other people
to donate.

12:31.017 --> 12:34.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then he sort of gives their
money to away
to people who under the
impression that they're

12:34.554 --> 12:36.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
getting Donald Trump's money.

12:36.322 --> 12:40.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, when you say
other people
have put money in, what sort of
people are

12:40.126 --> 12:41.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we talking about?

12:41.427 --> 12:43.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID FAHRENTHOLD: Well, a lot
of them don't
want to talk.

12:43.196 --> 12:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the biggest donation you can
see in tax
filings is from Vince and Linda
McMahon, the

12:47.333 --> 12:49.268 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WWE moguls.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump was on WrestleMania in
2007.

12:51.037 --> 12:55.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in that year and 2009, the
McMahons gave
a total of $5 million.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, we know that wasn't Trump's
payment for
WrestleMania.

12:57.844 --> 13:02.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He got paid separately, but
about the same
time, they made this $5 million
donation.

13:02.281 --> 13:06.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other biggest donor has been
this guy
Richard Ebers, who is a sort of
high-end ticket

13:06.819 --> 13:09.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
broker, like tickets to events,
in New York
City.

13:09.122 --> 13:14.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He gives every year between
$450,000 and $600,000,
always in very odd amounts.

13:14.293 --> 13:15.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's never an even amount.

13:15.762 --> 13:19.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He also didn't want to talk
about why he gives
to the Trump Foundation.

13:19.499 --> 13:23.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the thing big gifts
has been from
NBC Universal, which televised
"Celebrity

13:23.703 --> 13:25.471 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Apprentice."

13:25.505 --> 13:28.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump often used his Trump
Foundation money
to give what he said were
personal gifts out

13:28.741 --> 13:30.510 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of his own pocket on the show.

13:30.543 --> 13:34.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NBC gave him a $500,000 gift,
which served
to cover the cost of all of
those -- quote,

13:34.781 --> 13:36.249 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
unquote -- "personal donations."

13:36.282 --> 13:39.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, what about
what the foundation
has given money to?

13:39.318 --> 13:43.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is there a pattern, is there a
mission, a
particular cause that Donald
Trump has been

13:44.023 --> 13:45.224 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
interested in?

13:45.258 --> 13:47.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID FAHRENTHOLD: Well, that's
really interesting
as well.

13:47.093 --> 13:49.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of times, you see rich
people who start
their own private foundations,
they are -- as

13:49.862 --> 13:51.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you said, there is an abiding
cause.

13:51.698 --> 13:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They give to their alma mater,
they give to
cancer research, they give to
something like

13:54.233 --> 13:55.401 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With Trump, there is no such
abiding cause
like that.

13:57.370 --> 14:01.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's always -- the money is
given out in relatively
small amounts, between $5,000
and $50,000,

14:01.107 --> 14:03.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and it's to a smattering of
groups.

14:03.342 --> 14:06.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Often, he's buying a table at a
gala or something
like that.

14:06.379 --> 14:11.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The biggest correlation you find
is with Trump's
own personal and business
interests.

14:11.417 --> 14:15.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He lives in Palm Beach part of
the year, where
charity galas are a big part of
the life.

14:15.254 --> 14:19.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he runs a club in Palm
Beach, Mar-a-Lago,
that depends a lot on being
rented out by

14:19.959 --> 14:24.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
charities, who can pay as much
as $275,000
per night to rent out his club.

14:24.564 --> 14:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So he gives to those charities
that do business
with him.

14:27.100 --> 14:30.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this enables him to sort of
give to those
groups without actually using
his own money.

14:30.670 --> 14:36.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You have also --
you also wrote,
David Fahrenthold, that the
Trump Foundation

14:36.542 --> 14:42.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at least in once instance,
actually in several
instances, to political causes
or political

14:42.582 --> 14:43.716 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
candidates.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID FAHRENTHOLD: Well, there's
one case
in particular.

14:45.418 --> 14:48.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, giving to a political group
is against
the law.

14:48.254 --> 14:50.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you're a nonprofit, you can't
give money
to a political group.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And in 2013, they did that.

14:52.592 --> 14:56.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They gave to this group called
And Justice
for All, which was a political
campaign committee

14:56.596 --> 15:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
helping Florida Attorney General
Pam Bondi,
who at the time just happened to
be considering,

15:00.833 --> 15:04.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her office was considering,
whether to pursue
an investigation against Trump
University.

15:04.437 --> 15:08.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They later on, after the money
came in, decided
not to pursue that
investigation.

15:08.641 --> 15:12.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump paid that money out of the
Trump Foundation,
which is against the law.

15:12.612 --> 15:17.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this year, after we pointed
it out, he
paid a penalty tax to the IRS of
$2,500, which

15:17.083 --> 15:18.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was 10 percent of the donation.

15:18.918 --> 15:22.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So they're not
under any legal
cloud at this point?

15:22.588 --> 15:26.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID FAHRENTHOLD: Well, what's
interesting
is, there is another side to
that gift, which

15:26.259 --> 15:30.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is, not only did Trump's
foundation make that
prohibited political gift, but
they also sent

15:30.763 --> 15:35.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
filing to the IRS which
contained an error
that served to cover up the
illegal gift that

15:35.468 --> 15:37.270 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they made.

15:37.303 --> 15:39.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, they said that error was
inadvertent,
but it was a great coincidence
that the same

15:39.372 --> 15:43.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year they made a $25,000 gift to
this group
they shouldn't have, they told
the IRS they

15:43.342 --> 15:46.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had given $25,000 to another
group, which
would have been legal if they
had actually

15:46.913 --> 15:47.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sent them any money.

15:47.914 --> 15:49.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's something the IRS could
investigate.

15:49.749 --> 15:51.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't know if it actually is.

15:51.617 --> 15:55.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, we have to
point out that
the Trump campaign, Mr. Trump
himself, says

15:55.855 --> 16:00.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
he's actually given away
millions of dollars
over the years.

16:01.027 --> 16:03.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do we know about that in
any form?

16:03.563 --> 16:05.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID FAHRENTHOLD: You're right.

16:05.364 --> 16:09.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's said over the years that
he's given the
proceeds of a variety of things,
books, TV

16:09.602 --> 16:11.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shows, to charity, and it adds
up to millions
of dollars.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said he gives millions of
dollars.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what I have done over the
last few months
is go looking for evidence that
those gifts

16:16.342 --> 16:17.310 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
exist.

16:17.343 --> 16:18.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm not trying the find all of
them.

16:18.678 --> 16:19.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm just trying to find some
evidence that
they're out there.

16:20.012 --> 16:22.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, so far, I have called 326
charities.

16:22.381 --> 16:26.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, these are charities that
seem closest
to Trump, people he's given
Trump Foundation

16:26.385 --> 16:30.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
money to, he's gone to their
galas, he's spoken
positively of these charities.

16:30.456 --> 16:33.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have called 326 looking for
evidence that
there were these personal gifts
from Trump

16:34.026 --> 16:35.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out of his pocket.

16:35.528 --> 16:39.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And between 2008 and this May, I
found just
one gift out of his own pocket.

16:39.365 --> 16:40.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That was in 2009.

16:40.466 --> 16:43.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was for less than $10,000.

16:43.069 --> 16:47.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, when you ask
the campaign
about that, what do they say,
when you have

16:47.673 --> 16:49.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
asked them for evidence of the
giving?

16:49.675 --> 16:51.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID FAHRENTHOLD: They have
been very slippery
on this.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The last couple of days, they
have said Trump
gives tens of millions of
dollars away, or

16:55.014 --> 16:57.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he has given tens of millions of
dollars away.

16:57.149 --> 17:02.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that answer includes gifts
from the foundation,
gifts of free rounds of golf
from his golf

17:02.588 --> 17:04.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
club to local charities.

17:04.457 --> 17:08.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They even sort of implied that
it might include
just the salaries that he gives
to his workers,

17:08.761 --> 17:11.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he's helping people by
paying them to
do work for him.

17:11.264 --> 17:15.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they haven't broken down how
much Trump
actually gives out of his
pocket, and they

17:15.268 --> 17:16.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seem to be determined not to do
that.

17:16.736 --> 17:17.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have asked for that a number
of times.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I have gotten no details on
that.

17:19.305 --> 17:23.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I know that
you will
continue to be reporting on
this.

17:23.542 --> 17:30.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
David Fahrenthold of The
Washington Post,
thanks very much.

17:30.383 --> 17:35.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID FAHRENTHOLD: Thank you.

17:36.022 --> 17:39.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

17:39.859 --> 17:45.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
sugar industry's
influence over its link to heart
disease;

17:45.498 --> 17:51.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rethinking College to include
more Latino
men; and acclaimed author Ann
Patchett's foray

17:51.137 --> 17:54.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into something closer to home.

17:54.273 --> 18:01.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: The European Union
has set aside
nearly $630 million for Italy to
cope with

18:01.480 --> 18:05.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the thousands of migrants coming
across the
Mediterranean from Africa.

18:05.584 --> 18:10.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With so much public money
available, opportunities
to profit from the migrant
crisis are substantial,

18:10.823 --> 18:13.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as, it appears, is the potential
for fraud.

18:13.926 --> 18:19.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In June, special correspondent
Malcolm Brabant
reported on the Italian mafia's
use of refugee

18:19.332 --> 18:24.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reception centers in Sicily to
cheat the state
out of more than $4 billion.

18:24.670 --> 18:28.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The E.U. is now working with the
Italians
to try to end that.

18:28.407 --> 18:33.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As part of that effort, on the
Italian island
of Sardinia, authorities are now
checking

18:33.112 --> 18:38.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into a scheme in which unused
and neglected
land was supposedly given to
migrant African

18:38.217 --> 18:41.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
farmers so they could become
self-sufficient.

18:41.487 --> 18:46.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From Platamona in Northern
Sardinia, Malcolm
Brabant and producer Alessandra
Maggiorani

18:46.192 --> 18:47.159 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
report.

18:47.193 --> 18:51.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: It's just
before sunrise.

18:51.530 --> 18:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the start of the working
week.

18:54.133 --> 18:59.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're heading out to the
land where these
50 or so African farmers are
supposed to be

18:59.038 --> 19:00.806 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
working.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the time of the day when
most farmers
out in the Mediterranean are
starting work

19:04.010 --> 19:05.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
because it's cooler.

19:05.411 --> 19:09.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They can get more done before
the heat of
the day really kicks in.

19:09.081 --> 19:15.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have been told that these
farmers work
from Monday to Thursday, so
let's go and see

19:15.154 --> 19:16.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
if they're there.

19:16.422 --> 19:18.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In the late summer heat, crops
need attention.

19:18.424 --> 19:22.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But dawn came in Platamona came
and went with
no sign of activity.

19:22.461 --> 19:25.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Right, well, it's just after
8:00.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have been waiting here for
more than an
hour.

19:27.233 --> 19:29.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it seems pretty clear that
nobody is going
to turn up.

19:29.535 --> 19:33.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to go for breakfast
because I
have a feeling it's going to be
a long day.

19:33.072 --> 19:36.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then we're going to come
back afterwards
to see if they are here.

19:36.675 --> 19:40.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if they're not, we're going
to try and
find them and see what's going
on.

19:41.013 --> 19:44.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We came back nearly two hours
later.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.218 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Nothing.

19:46.252 --> 19:52.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At this small vineyard next to
the African
workers cooperative supposed
location, we

19:52.324 --> 19:55.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
found a policeman and his father
who didn't
wish to be identified.

19:55.528 --> 19:59.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I live
in Porto
Torres and I go to Sassari for
work, so I

19:59.799 --> 20:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
would have seen the migrants.

20:00.833 --> 20:04.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the old man you see down
here is my father.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if he had seen something, he
would have
been alarmed and would have
asked me, what's

20:07.006 --> 20:08.174 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going on?

20:08.207 --> 20:09.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I
would have noticed
them.

20:09.942 --> 20:12.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's no cultivation going on
there and
no livestock.

20:12.578 --> 20:17.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: At another
vineyard opposite
the farm, we talked to an
agricultural worker

20:17.583 --> 20:20.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who'd known the owner's family
for decades.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here, people are wary.

20:22.555 --> 20:27.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He didn't wish to talk on
camera, but insisted
that there had been no sign of
any migrants

20:27.626 --> 20:29.328 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
working.

20:29.361 --> 20:33.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we started researching this
story, it
was being portrayed by the man
organizing

20:33.532 --> 20:39.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this cooperative as being a very
positive
story, that the African farmers
who'd come

20:39.071 --> 20:44.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from war-torn areas wanted to be
able to support
themselves and didn't want to be
reliant on

20:44.210 --> 20:45.377 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the state.

20:45.411 --> 20:47.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But then we got here, and he
stopped taking
our calls.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it all got a little bit
strange.

20:50.149 --> 20:52.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We were constantly probing for
more information.

20:52.718 --> 20:59.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
My colleague, Alessandra
Maggiorani, an experienced
freelance journalist and native
Italian speaker

20:59.191 --> 21:01.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
who has worked with the
"NewsHour" on many
occasions.

21:01.427 --> 21:04.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALESSANDRA MAGGIORANI, Freelance
Journalist:
I have just spoken with the
president of the

21:04.597 --> 21:06.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
farmers association of this
region.

21:06.699 --> 21:11.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was explaining that the
people involved
in this project have asked them
for help to

21:11.137 --> 21:16.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
transfer their know-how, their
knowledge,
and their expertise in
agriculture.

21:16.175 --> 21:20.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This connection
potentially
added more credibility to the
project.

21:20.446 --> 21:25.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Once we started asking
questions, though,
the union quickly distanced
itself.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're outside the offices of the
local farmers
union, and the organization has
made it clear

21:28.854 --> 21:31.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they don't want to give us
an on-camera
interview.

21:31.257 --> 21:34.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have spoken to a senior
official who
said that they were approached
about this

21:34.927 --> 21:35.895 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
project.

21:35.928 --> 21:37.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They liked it initially.

21:37.830 --> 21:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They liked the fact that food
produced by
the Africans was supposed to be
given to children

21:41.534 --> 21:44.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at local schools or sold in
local markets.

21:44.336 --> 21:48.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They wanted to investigate it
further, but
they weren't given any
documentation, and

21:48.374 --> 21:51.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so they didn't become officially
involved.

21:51.777 --> 21:56.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We continued looking into the
project and
its partners, landowner Luca
Pintus, and a

21:56.649 --> 22:01.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leading member of Sardinia's
immigrant community,
Cheikh Diankha, who's from
Senegal and the

22:01.987 --> 22:05.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
head of several organizations
involving integration.

22:05.991 --> 22:10.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Diankha's company, Janas
International, runs
a reception center for migrants.

22:10.362 --> 22:13.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he based himself in one with
a colorful
history.

22:13.132 --> 22:17.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALESSANDRA MAGGIORANI: The
reception center
is actually on the premises of
the Kiss Kiss,

22:17.436 --> 22:21.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a former disco, which had a very
bad reputation.

22:21.273 --> 22:24.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It was closed down for
prostitution, and more
than 10 people were arrested.

22:24.843 --> 22:31.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: As our phone
calls went unanswered,
we paid a visit to Cheikh
Diankha in his officer

22:31.650 --> 22:34.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at the former Kiss Kiss disco.

22:34.286 --> 22:41.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALESSANDRA MAGGIORANI (through
translator):
I have been trying to get in
touch with you.

22:41.860 --> 22:44.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I called you many times, and
you're not taking
my calls.

22:44.797 --> 22:47.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CHEIKH DIANKHA, Janas
International: Ah, OK,
Alessandra.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALESSANDRA MAGGIORANI: Yes,
Alessandra.

22:48.567 --> 22:50.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: I don't
understand.

22:50.302 --> 22:52.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just do not understand what's
going on here.

22:53.005 --> 22:54.907 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALESSANDRA MAGGIORANI: OK.

22:54.940 --> 22:57.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have to ask permission
before...

22:57.676 --> 23:01.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Yes, but we
have come all
this way to do a story about
farming, and

23:01.780 --> 23:03.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you -- and we don't see anything
going on.

23:03.716 --> 23:07.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALESSANDRA MAGGIORANI (through
translator):
We came all the way here because
he had an

23:07.319 --> 23:10.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
appointment to go with migrants
out into the
fields.

23:10.189 --> 23:12.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CHEIKH DIANKHA (through
translator): I didn't
vanish.

23:12.258 --> 23:13.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I sent you the number of Luca
Pintus.

23:13.926 --> 23:16.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALESSANDRA MAGGIORANI (through
translator):
Pintus never replies on that
number.

23:16.528 --> 23:20.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think the number is
active.

23:20.099 --> 23:25.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: We then tracked
down land
owner, Luca Pintus, at his
mother's cafe in

23:25.571 --> 23:29.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the main square of Sassari, a
town in Northern
Sardinia.

23:29.208 --> 23:32.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pintus tried to assure us that
the project
was above board.

23:32.177 --> 23:38.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He promised to show us all the
relevant documentation,
as well as the farmers at work.

23:38.117 --> 23:41.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This street in Sassari yielded
more questions.

23:41.320 --> 23:46.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were invited to a smart
address to meet
Luca Pintus, along with a
talented migrant

23:46.091 --> 23:51.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clothes designer, as well as
another director
of Diankha's company, and to see
paperwork

23:51.664 --> 23:53.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
related to the farm project.

23:53.432 --> 23:57.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the only one to turn up was
Diankha's
colleague, Giovanni Rossi, who
said he was

23:57.903 --> 23:59.805 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an accountant.

23:59.838 --> 24:03.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GIOVANNI ROSSI, Accountant
(through translator):
You need to know that only
authorized filming

24:03.876 --> 24:05.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in allowed in Italy.

24:05.377 --> 24:08.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So please lower your camera and
wait in a
decent way.

24:08.080 --> 24:11.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Rossi wanted us
to look at
their fashion work.

24:11.483 --> 24:14.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We wanted to talk on the record
about the
farm.

24:14.386 --> 24:17.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GIOVANNI ROSSI (through
translator): I believe
you are smart, so you can listen
to what I

24:17.256 --> 24:18.457 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have to say.

24:18.490 --> 24:20.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALESSANDRA MAGGIORANI: Let's sit
down and
ask him questions.

24:20.726 --> 24:22.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GIOVANNI ROSSI (through
translator): Alessandra,
let's sit down

24:22.995 --> 24:23.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: No.

24:23.996 --> 24:24.963 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

24:24.997 --> 24:25.964 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

24:25.998 --> 24:26.965 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

24:26.999 --> 24:27.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

24:28.000 --> 24:28.967 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

24:29.001 --> 24:30.269 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

24:30.302 --> 24:30.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GIOVANNI ROSSI (through
translator): No, a
written interview.

24:31.003 --> 24:31.970 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No, no.

24:32.004 --> 24:32.971 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Go out, please.

24:33.005 --> 24:33.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: OK.

24:34.006 --> 24:34.973 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK.

24:35.007 --> 24:35.974 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We will go out.

24:36.008 --> 24:39.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Briefly, I was invited back into
the room.

24:39.044 --> 24:40.879 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where are all the farmers?

24:40.913 --> 24:42.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where are all the farmers?

24:42.147 --> 24:44.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are trying to find the paper
trail for
this project.

24:44.316 --> 24:49.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have come to this office
on the outskirts
of the town of Sassari, where
they often deal

24:49.321 --> 24:51.757 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in E.U. projects and funding.

24:51.790 --> 24:55.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they say that they have no
record at all
of this particular project,
although they

24:55.861 --> 24:59.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do say that there are other
organizations
who have money available.

24:59.098 --> 25:02.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back at the former Kiss Kiss
disco, a question
for Cheikh Diankha.

25:02.901 --> 25:05.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I'm asking you, is this a
scam?

25:05.404 --> 25:09.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CHEIKH DIANKHA (through
translator): The cooperative
isn't standing yet.

25:09.575 --> 25:12.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So how can we have got some
money?

25:12.811 --> 25:15.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We haven't taken nor received
money from anyone.

25:15.147 --> 25:17.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This has to be clear.

25:17.816 --> 25:20.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Don't go to the BBC and tell
them that we
get E.U. money.

25:20.686 --> 25:24.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't even know what the E.U.
is.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't have any business with
them.

25:26.058 --> 25:28.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have business with the
farmers union in
Sardinia.

25:28.594 --> 25:34.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we have yet to receive a
single euro.

25:34.333 --> 25:37.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The money for the petrol to go
there comes
form our pockets.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.338 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is that clear?

25:39.371 --> 25:44.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We haven't taken money from the
Italians or
the E.U., and everyone should
hear me on this.

25:44.176 --> 25:49.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: After our
meeting with Rossi,
we came across Luca Pintus in
Sassari's main

25:49.681 --> 25:51.417 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
square.

25:51.450 --> 25:53.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUCA PINTUS, Landowner (through
translator):
Giovanni, I have found the
journalists in

25:53.118 --> 25:54.420 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the square.

25:54.453 --> 25:55.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you want, I will put her on,
so you can
make an arrangement.

25:55.854 --> 25:58.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: I just want to
ask a simple
question.

25:58.657 --> 26:01.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When was the last time your land
had farmers
on it?

26:01.393 --> 26:03.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LUCA PINTUS (through
translator): This morning,
they are picking.

26:03.829 --> 26:05.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have to make a gift of it
to the elderly.

26:05.297 --> 26:06.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALESSANDRA MAGGIORANI (through
translator):
Do you mean in Platamona?

26:06.865 --> 26:09.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LUCA PINTUS (through
translator): On the field
in Platamona, 15 days ago.

26:09.935 --> 26:11.737 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm not sure.

26:11.770 --> 26:14.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALESSANDRA MAGGIORANI (through
translator):
On the basis of these projects,
it is 32 euros

26:14.706 --> 26:16.041 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
per migrant?

26:16.074 --> 26:17.342 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LUCA PINTUS (through
translator): Yes, at
the reception centers.

26:17.376 --> 26:19.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I have nothing to do with
the reception
centers.

26:19.845 --> 26:26.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Pintus was
clarifying that
32 euros a day per migrant
wasn't a subsidy

26:26.151 --> 26:31.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the farming project, but a
standard fee
paid by the state to Diankha's
company and

26:31.457 --> 26:33.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
other reception centers.

26:33.358 --> 26:37.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's supposed to cover food and
clothing for
the 100 or so migrants at the
former Kiss

26:37.763 --> 26:39.531 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Kiss disco.

26:39.565 --> 26:43.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's potential income for his
company of
$3,600 a day.

26:43.235 --> 26:46.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LUCA PINTUS (through
translator): No filming,
no filming.

26:46.305 --> 26:50.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Or $1.3 million
a year.

26:50.642 --> 26:55.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to Luca Pintus, Cheikh
Diankha and
his colleague Giovanni Rossi
plan to open

26:55.280 --> 26:56.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a new refugee center.

26:56.715 --> 26:59.985 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LUCA PINTUS (through
translator): Understand,
I am the director.

27:00.018 --> 27:00.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You mustn't film.

27:01.019 --> 27:02.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You mustn't film.

27:02.087 --> 27:03.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You mustn't film.

27:03.155 --> 27:04.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Put this in your head.

27:04.256 --> 27:06.658 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: OK, fine.

27:06.692 --> 27:07.860 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We're going.

27:07.893 --> 27:10.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GIOVANNI ROSSI (through
translator): Sorry.

27:10.963 --> 27:12.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why are you so incorrect?

27:12.698 --> 27:15.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALESSANDRA MAGGIORANI: I'm
saying that he's
finding excuses not to do the
interview.

27:15.801 --> 27:17.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Yes.

27:17.236 --> 27:20.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So these farmers, do they exist?

27:20.138 --> 27:23.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do the farmers exist?

27:23.809 --> 27:31.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Luca Pintus insisted he wanted
to fight racism
and to help newcomers integrate
in Sardinia.

27:31.450 --> 27:35.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Migrants find it hard to leave
the island
because most are barred from
ferries to the

27:36.021 --> 27:37.823 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mainland.

27:37.856 --> 27:42.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While migrants are a moneymaking
opportunity
for some, many Sardinians are
weary of those

27:42.094 --> 27:45.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
selling cheap goods on the
beaches or begging.

27:45.597 --> 27:51.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But people hawking wares in
supermarket car
parks have little alternative,
because a career

27:51.436 --> 27:55.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in local agriculture doesn't
appear to be
a realistic option.

27:55.374 --> 27:59.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Sardinia.

27:59.077 --> 28:05.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Online, Malcolm
offers the
backstory of his peculiar
reporting odyssey.

28:05.450 --> 28:11.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's on our Web site,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

28:11.223 --> 28:23.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now: how the sugar
industry paid
experts to downplay health
risks.

28:23.569 --> 28:27.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Researchers have discovered
documents showing
the industry tried to influence
scientific

28:27.839 --> 28:30.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
studies back in the 1960s.

28:30.576 --> 28:35.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Early studies had found a link
between sugar
and fat and heart disease, but
it now appears

28:35.347 --> 28:40.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the sugar industry paid two
Harvard professors
to point the finger elsewhere.

28:40.586 --> 28:44.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the time, it wasn't routine
to disclose
such conflicts.

28:44.590 --> 28:48.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marion Nestle wrote an editorial
about the
latest research in "JAMA," "The
Journal of

28:48.527 --> 28:50.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the American Medical
Association."

28:50.562 --> 28:55.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's an author and professor of
nutrition,
food studies, and public health
at New York

28:55.701 --> 28:56.668 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
University.

28:56.702 --> 28:57.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, Marion Nestle.

28:57.703 --> 28:58.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's start by a few...

28:58.937 --> 28:59.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARION NESTLE, New York
University: Well,
glad to be here.

28:59.938 --> 29:01.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's start with a
few definitions.

29:01.707 --> 29:04.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What was the Sugar Research
Foundation?

29:04.209 --> 29:11.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARION NESTLE: Well, this was a
trade association
for the growers of sugarcane and
sugar beets.

29:11.249 --> 29:14.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's new called the Sugar
Association.

29:14.319 --> 29:16.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So it's a trade group.

29:16.188 --> 29:23.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Its job is to promote the sales
of sugar and
to lobby to make sure that
nobody does anything

29:23.195 --> 29:26.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
regulatory to reduce the
consumption of sugar.

29:26.865 --> 29:27.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a trade group.

29:27.866 --> 29:29.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: So, yes.

29:29.668 --> 29:32.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when all the years when we
were being
told that fat and cholesterol
were the prime

29:32.437 --> 29:37.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
culprits in obesity and early
death and heart
disease, it turns out that sugar
also played

29:37.576 --> 29:38.543 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a big role.

29:38.577 --> 29:40.245 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARION NESTLE: Well, it did.

29:40.278 --> 29:47.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look at the epidemiology,
at the time,
it was clear that both sugar and
fat were

29:47.386 --> 29:51.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
risk factors for coronary artery
disease.

29:51.289 --> 29:57.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But these investigators at
Harvard who were
paid by the Sugar Research
Foundation kind

29:57.195 --> 30:04.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of cherry-picked the data and
minimized the
problems with sugar and
maximized the problems

30:04.302 --> 30:06.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with saturated fat.

30:06.171 --> 30:12.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that was exactly what the
Sugar Association
wanted them to do, as the
documents show.

30:12.411 --> 30:16.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, the goal here
was to sway
public opinion, in much the same
way that

30:16.515 --> 30:18.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the tobacco industry did?

30:18.083 --> 30:22.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARION NESTLE: Yes, it followed
the playbook
of the tobacco industry.

30:22.187 --> 30:28.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The number one playbook rule is,
the first
thing you do is you attack the
science, you

30:28.960 --> 30:30.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cast doubt on the science.

30:30.862 --> 30:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Merchants of Doubt," the book
and the movie,
explain all that.

30:35.067 --> 30:38.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Sugar Association was
doing exactly
that.

30:38.804 --> 30:45.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was trying to get researchers
to produce
research that would minimize a
role for sugar

30:45.143 --> 30:47.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and shift the blame elsewhere.

30:47.946 --> 30:53.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they were very frank about
what they wanted,
and the investigators agreed
that that was

30:53.218 --> 30:55.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what they were going to do.

30:55.153 --> 30:56.888 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Pretty shocking.

30:56.922 --> 31:00.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: If they could shop
for experts
for something like this, to find
someone at

31:00.592 --> 31:05.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Harvard who could tell them what
they needed
in order to preserve the
industry, how do

31:05.363 --> 31:09.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we know that hasn't happened or
maybe it has
happened in other nutrition
areas?

31:09.167 --> 31:11.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARION NESTLE: Well, it has
happened.

31:11.536 --> 31:16.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And The New York Times last year
had a big
investigative report about
Coca-Cola's funding

31:16.908 --> 31:23.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of thee Global Energy Balance
Network, in
which they had e-mails that
showed that there

31:23.148 --> 31:29.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were very close associations
between the researchers
who were doing some of this work
and executives

31:29.821 --> 31:31.690 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at Coca-Cola.

31:31.723 --> 31:35.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's very hard to get
documentary evidence
of this.

31:35.093 --> 31:37.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I do want to say one thing
about it.

31:37.229 --> 31:41.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not a simple matter of
buying investigators.

31:41.900 --> 31:49.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These Harvard investigators, at
least one
of them, was really pretty
well-known for

31:49.574 --> 31:53.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his work linking fat to heart
disease risk.

31:53.578 --> 31:58.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so he probably believed that
that was
what it was, didn't think that
sugar was nearly

31:58.483 --> 32:01.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as important, and believed that.

32:01.620 --> 32:06.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it wasn't as simple as the
Sugar Research
Foundation just saying, this is
what we want

32:07.025 --> 32:08.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and we're going to pay for it.

32:08.827 --> 32:11.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: When you say it's
not as simple,
I'm going to ask you a question
that is a

32:11.663 --> 32:13.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
little -- leans towards
simplicity.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is the smoking gun?

32:15.300 --> 32:16.268 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is it sugar?

32:16.301 --> 32:17.803 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is it fat?

32:17.836 --> 32:22.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARION NESTLE: Oh, I think it's
both, because
both of them are nutrients.

32:22.707 --> 32:24.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we don't eat nutrients.

32:24.376 --> 32:29.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most people don't eat sugar on
its own, and
nobody eats saturated fat on its
own.

32:29.114 --> 32:33.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We eat foods that contain sugars
and saturated
fats.

32:33.518 --> 32:37.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Diets are much more complicated
to study than
individual nutrients.

32:37.856 --> 32:41.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that's really what everybody
ought to
be looking at.

32:41.193 --> 32:47.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And dietary guidelines tell you,
reduce consumption
of foods containing a lot of
added sugars,

32:47.132 --> 32:51.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and don't eat so much meat,
which is a major
source of saturated fat.

32:51.870 --> 32:58.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I say it's both, and you
have to always
take the number of calories into
consideration

32:58.443 --> 33:00.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when you're talking about these
things.

33:00.245 --> 33:05.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: How skeptical could
consumers
be about these reports, which
every year seem

33:05.884 --> 33:07.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to tell them to worry about a
different thing?

33:07.886 --> 33:11.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARION NESTLE: Well, I think
they should be
very skeptical.

33:11.957 --> 33:18.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first line of defense is
always to say,
does this research contradict
what I thought

33:18.263 --> 33:19.998 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I knew?

33:20.031 --> 33:24.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it does, you want to be a
little skeptical
about it and wait for some more
studies to

33:24.469 --> 33:25.604 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
come out.

33:25.637 --> 33:28.039 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The science is cumulative.

33:28.073 --> 33:32.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nutrition science is extremely
difficult to
do, because people are terrible
experimental

33:32.844 --> 33:34.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
animals, and diets are so
complicated.

33:34.880 --> 33:38.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are lots of different ways
to put together
healthy diets.

33:38.717 --> 33:43.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we know that diets that have
a lot of
vegetables, that balance
calories, and don't

33:43.121 --> 33:46.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a lot of junk food are
really good for
health.

33:46.124 --> 33:47.092 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We know that.

33:47.125 --> 33:48.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Marion Nestle, we
know it.

33:48.526 --> 33:50.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a question of paying
attention to it.

33:50.495 --> 33:56.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marion Nestle, professor of
nutrition, food
studies and public health at New
York University,

33:56.334 --> 34:01.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thank you very much.

34:01.373 --> 34:06.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARION NESTLE: My pleasure.

34:06.511 --> 34:13.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the second
installment
of our week-long series on ideas
to transform

34:13.551 --> 34:17.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
higher education for students
and provide
new opportunities.

34:17.923 --> 34:24.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, Hari Sreenivasan
reports why some
Latino males are being urged to
turn down

34:24.296 --> 34:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a job today in favor of four
years of college
tomorrow.

34:28.366 --> 34:32.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN LOPEZ, Project MALES: The
series is called
Rethinking College, and it's
part of our weekly

34:32.604 --> 34:35.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
education coverage, Making the
grade.

34:35.340 --> 34:39.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: If I can have the mentors
on one side
and the mentees on another.

34:39.644 --> 34:44.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Graduate
student Juan Lopez
wants to bring to college
campuses what he

34:44.049 --> 34:47.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sees as largely missing, Latino
males.

34:47.118 --> 34:52.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN LOPEZ: They're not seen as
people who
will succeed, especially
minority males of

34:52.557 --> 34:53.525 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
color.

34:53.558 --> 34:55.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I want to go to college.

34:55.393 --> 34:58.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, on this
day, Lopez and
undergraduates from the
university of Texas

34:58.496 --> 35:03.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at Austin are mentoring high
school freshman
boys as part of an initiative
called Project

35:03.735 --> 35:04.936 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
MALES.

35:04.970 --> 35:07.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUAN LOPEZ: Undergraduates
mentor high school
students.

35:07.472 --> 35:10.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Graduate students mentor
undergraduate students.

35:10.742 --> 35:16.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In this
exercise, college
and high school students move
together over

35:16.748 --> 35:18.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
shared experiences.

35:18.516 --> 35:22.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN LOPEZ: ®MD+IT /MD-IT /I want
to help
my family out financially after
I graduate

35:22.354 --> 35:23.855 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
high school.

35:23.888 --> 35:27.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One common
concern emerges
for both mentors and mentees.

35:27.325 --> 35:30.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMET CAMPOS, Director, Project
MALES: They're
expected to be the wage earner
in the family.

35:30.862 --> 35:34.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Emmet Campos
directs Project
MALES' school mentoring
programs.

35:34.265 --> 35:37.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EMMET CAMPOS: So, their
expectations that
they get from their family and
from their

35:37.836 --> 35:42.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
peers is that their goal is to
get a job,
and to earn an income.

35:42.707 --> 35:47.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so those factors are pulling
them away
from actually going to college.

35:47.078 --> 35:51.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Pablo Hall is
a high school
sophomore and the oldest boy in
his family.

35:51.583 --> 35:53.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PABLO HALL, High School Student:
I want to
make money after high school, so
that when

35:53.318 --> 35:57.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my mom gets older, I can put her
in a house,
and my brothers, like, keep them
good.

35:57.722 --> 36:01.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just want to help my family
after high school.

36:01.226 --> 36:06.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Even when
students get to
college, financial obligations
can continue

36:06.731 --> 36:08.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to haunt them.

36:08.533 --> 36:10.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANTONIO SALMERO, College
Student: When I was
doing the two job thing, it was
really hard,

36:10.669 --> 36:16.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and everybody was excelling on
their tests
and their homework and their
projects, and

36:16.274 --> 36:17.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was starting to fall behind.

36:17.675 --> 36:20.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Antonio
Salmero is a senior
at U.T. Austin.

36:20.779 --> 36:25.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO SALMERO: I felt really
discouraged
even to be in college, but, yes,
the reason

36:25.216 --> 36:29.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why, because someone's got to
pay bills, somebody
has got to help out at home.

36:29.788 --> 36:33.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of these kids in some of my
classes,
I know, haven't even worked a
day in their

36:33.191 --> 36:34.225 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

36:34.259 --> 36:37.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, that's always very stressful
and discouraging.

36:37.495 --> 36:42.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN LOPEZ: Our parents are
accustomed to
the traditions of Mexico, of
Latin America,

36:43.001 --> 36:45.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
El Salvador, Guatemala, et
cetera.

36:45.970 --> 36:48.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And over there, you got to work.

36:48.573 --> 36:51.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What puts food on the table is
work.

36:51.309 --> 36:58.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's this kind of mental
setback that
is instilled in our Latino males
that makes

36:58.750 --> 37:03.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them have to choose between an
education and
a job.

37:03.388 --> 37:09.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO SALMERO: Growing up,
there was always
this cultural belief that a
man's worth is

defined by his work.

37:11.429 --> 37:14.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's this sense of machismo
in the Mexican
culture.

37:14.332 --> 37:19.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And machismo is the belief that
being a man
is providing for your family.

37:19.170 --> 37:23.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the U.S.,
one in four
children are Latino.

37:23.174 --> 37:28.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Economists project that, within
four years,
two-thirds of all jobs will
require post-secondary

37:28.780 --> 37:31.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
education and training beyond
high school.

37:31.516 --> 37:35.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Victor Saenz, professor at the
University
of Texas, Austin, founded the
Project MALES

37:35.687 --> 37:37.555 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
initiative.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VICTOR SAENZ, Project MALES: The
demographic
reality of this country and the
future population

37:40.024 --> 37:45.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
projections suggests that the
current 55 million
Hispanics in this country is
poised to double

37:45.630 --> 37:47.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the next 40 to 50 years.

37:47.432 --> 37:52.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think our future economic
prosperity is
absolutely linked to the
educational outcomes

37:52.036 --> 37:53.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for Latino males.

37:53.805 --> 37:56.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: While
Hispanics are the
largest and fastest growing
minority in the

37:56.975 --> 38:01.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country, they have lowest
educational attainment
of any group.

38:01.579 --> 38:08.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The high school graduation rate
for Latinos
is 71 percent, but only 15
percent of Latinos

38:08.052 --> 38:09.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hold bachelor's degrees.

38:09.988 --> 38:15.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And despite significant
increases in college
enrollment among Hispanics, a
troubling trend

38:15.360 --> 38:16.794 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has emerged.

38:16.828 --> 38:19.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Latino men lag far behind women.

38:19.164 --> 38:23.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VICTOR SAENZ: The men of color
conversation
nationally has really taken root
and has gained

38:24.002 --> 38:25.470 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
great momentum.

38:25.503 --> 38:29.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Project MALES is rooted in this
larger social
justice agenda.

38:29.374 --> 38:34.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Project MALES
explores the
reasons why so many Latino boys
stop short

38:34.646 --> 38:36.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of four-year degrees.

38:36.314 --> 38:40.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VICTOR SAENZ: We see that Latino
boys are
over-represented in the special
education

38:40.051 --> 38:42.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ranks, over-represented in the
school discipline
pipeline.

38:42.453 --> 38:46.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And by the time they get to high
school and
college, their numbers have
dwindled to the

38:46.224 --> 38:50.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point where there's not enough
of them to
really look at student
populations.

38:50.328 --> 38:55.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Austin High
School principal
Ty Davidson says mentors are
especially important

38:55.967 --> 38:58.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for first-generation students
considering
college.

38:58.536 --> 39:02.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TY DAVIDSON, Principal, Austin
High School:
There's somebody there who looks
like you,

39:02.640 --> 39:07.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
may have the same experience as
you, about
anxiety over financial aid, the
anxiety of

39:07.645 --> 39:10.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
maybe moving away from home,
saying, it's
going to be OK.

39:10.648 --> 39:12.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's, we're going to do it
together.

39:12.784 --> 39:17.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Project MALES
mentors spend
a lot of time talking to young
men about the

39:17.288 --> 39:20.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
economic realities of being an
unskilled worker.

39:20.291 --> 39:22.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EMMET CAMPOS: We show them the
data.

39:22.126 --> 39:26.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We provide them with information
about degrees
and how they translate into
incomes, into

39:26.130 --> 39:27.665 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
salaries.

39:27.699 --> 39:31.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: At Gus Garcia
Middle School,
mentors talk dollars and cents.

39:31.069 --> 39:36.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: So, I just wanted to ask
you all if any
of you all have an idea of how
much the minimum

39:36.040 --> 39:37.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wage is right now?

39:37.141 --> 39:38.109 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: Twelve.

39:38.142 --> 39:39.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Twelve dollars an hour?

39:39.244 --> 39:40.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: Fifteen.

39:40.245 --> 39:41.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Fifteen an hour?

39:41.246 --> 39:42.213 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: Ten.

39:42.247 --> 39:43.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Ten dollars an hour?

39:43.581 --> 39:47.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I guess minimum wage is
probably a little
over $14,000.

39:47.051 --> 39:49.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Does that sound like a lot of
money?

39:49.354 --> 39:52.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: No, $14,000 is barely
enough to buy
a car.

39:52.290 --> 39:53.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: You think you could live
off of that?

39:53.992 --> 39:55.627 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: No.

39:55.660 --> 39:57.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMET CAMPOS: We talk about,
have you thought
of what that car's going to
cost?

39:57.295 --> 39:59.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Have you thought about what that
house is
going to cost?

39:59.364 --> 40:03.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PABLO HALL: There are times when
I felt I
want to drop out of school.

40:03.101 --> 40:07.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Pablo Hall,
who was thinking
of dropping out of high school
as a freshman,

40:07.705 --> 40:09.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
says Project MALES has made a
difference.

40:09.941 --> 40:12.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PABLO HALL: The mentors, they're
good.

40:12.110 --> 40:14.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When I need help, they help me
with it.

40:14.145 --> 40:16.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can tell the mentors what's
going on.

40:16.414 --> 40:20.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: At the same
time, Antonio
Salmero says mentoring high
school students

40:20.585 --> 40:23.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
helped him when he thought of
leaving college.

40:23.488 --> 40:30.595 align:left position:0%,start line:66.67% size:100%
ANTONIO SALMERO: I mean, I see
myself pushing
this idea of
self-responsibility, of
self-reliance,

40:30.628 --> 40:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and determination onto myself,
much like I
do want to make them realize
that as well.

40:35.400 --> 40:39.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The program
hopes some of
its graduate students will
return to college

40:39.404 --> 40:44.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campus as professors, a career
also largely
underrepresented by Latino men.

40:45.009 --> 40:52.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan for the
"PBS NewsHour."

and bookseller draws on her own
life story

41:06.130 --> 41:08.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for her latest tale.

41:08.266 --> 41:13.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown takes the
"NewsHour" Bookshelf
to Nashville to visit with
writer Ann Patchett.

41:13.838 --> 41:21.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: At the East
Nashville Farmers
Market recently, you could
listen to music,

41:21.379 --> 41:28.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down a cool drink, buy some
vegetables, and,
why not, grab yourself a new
book to read.

41:28.686 --> 41:30.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ANN PATCHETT, Author,
"Commonwealth": This
is where the people are.

41:30.355 --> 41:34.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can get a squash and a book,
a tomato
and a book.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.127 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's great.

41:36.160 --> 41:39.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You could also
meet a famous
local writer, Ann Patchett, who,
since 2011,

41:39.964 --> 41:44.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is co-owner of Nashville's
Parnassus Books
and its traveling bookmobile.

41:44.435 --> 41:47.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANN PATCHETT: So, we got a
little bit of everything.

41:47.572 --> 41:49.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lots of kids books, lots of
kids.

41:49.173 --> 41:50.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Kids love the bus.

41:50.174 --> 41:51.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Kids love the
bus.

41:51.976 --> 41:56.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANN PATCHETT: Kids cannot get
enough of the
bus, so the books that are down
low, those

41:56.414 --> 41:58.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are always really important.

41:58.249 --> 42:01.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You don't even
need, like,
kids' toys or anything to
attract them, huh?

42:01.686 --> 42:02.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANN PATCHETT: No, no, no bait.

42:03.020 --> 42:03.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Books are the bait.

42:04.021 --> 42:05.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's our message.

42:05.056 --> 42:06.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Books are the
bait.

42:06.924 --> 42:08.393 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:08.426 --> 42:11.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The 52-year-old
bookseller
is herself a bestselling author.

42:11.763 --> 42:17.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her novels include the 2001 "Bel
Canto" about
an opera singer taken hostage in
a terror

42:17.635 --> 42:23.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attack in an unnamed Latin
American country,
and 2011's "State of Wonder,"
centered on

42:23.641 --> 42:27.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pharmaceutical drug research in
the Amazon.

42:27.044 --> 42:32.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now she's done something closer
to home, writing
a novel about a family much like
the one she

42:32.116 --> 42:38.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
herself grew up in, two
families, in fact,
blended together after a chance
encounter

42:38.222 --> 42:40.725 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
leads to infidelity and divorce.

42:40.758 --> 42:45.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her new novel, "Commonwealth,"
follows four
adults and six children through
50 years of

42:45.630 --> 42:47.131 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ups and downs.

42:47.165 --> 42:50.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We spoke in her Nashville home,
not too far
from where she grew up.

42:50.802 --> 42:53.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANN PATCHETT: This is a story
that's very
close to home.

42:53.237 --> 42:56.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a story that is very
close to my life
and my family and...

42:56.607 --> 42:57.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: It is?

42:57.608 --> 42:58.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANN PATCHETT: It is.

42:58.609 --> 42:59.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I wasn't sure.

42:59.610 --> 43:00.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANN PATCHETT: It is.

43:00.611 --> 43:01.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, tell me,
how is it?

43:01.612 --> 43:03.347 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
In what ways is it close?

43:03.381 --> 43:09.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANN PATCHETT: I was one of two
girls, and
my mother left my father and
married someone

43:09.153 --> 43:11.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who had two boys and two girls.

43:11.322 --> 43:13.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they moved to the other side
of the country.

43:13.391 --> 43:16.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, this blended
family, geographically
spread out.

43:16.961 --> 43:17.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANN PATCHETT: Yes, exactly.

43:17.962 --> 43:18.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Parents in
different places.

43:18.963 --> 43:19.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANN PATCHETT: Exactly.

43:19.964 --> 43:21.599 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

43:21.632 --> 43:26.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I really talked to everyone
in my family
while I was working on this
book.

43:26.471 --> 43:27.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is this OK with you?

43:27.472 --> 43:28.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do you feel about this?

43:28.739 --> 43:31.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
When I finished, I gave
everybody a copy of
the manuscript.

43:31.209 --> 43:32.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Really?

43:32.210 --> 43:33.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANN PATCHETT: We talked about
it.

43:33.211 --> 43:34.612 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

43:34.645 --> 43:37.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Because you were
nervous about
how they would take it?

43:37.615 --> 43:38.583 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Or...

43:38.616 --> 43:40.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANN PATCHETT: Because I love and
respect them.

43:40.685 --> 43:42.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's their life too.

43:42.753 --> 43:46.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have always been so
careful to not write
this story.

43:47.024 --> 43:49.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have always written "Bel
Canto" instead.

43:50.027 --> 43:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when I wanted to write about
someone ripped
out of one family and put into
another family,

43:55.299 --> 43:57.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I put them in Peru.

43:57.969 --> 44:03.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I just said to everybody --
at this point,
I was probably 49 when I started
the book.

44:03.941 --> 44:09.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I said, I want to have
access to my life,
which also means having access
to your life.

44:09.514 --> 44:11.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And are you OK with this?

44:11.148 --> 44:14.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, this was a
completely different
writing experience for you.

44:14.118 --> 44:15.620 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANN PATCHETT: Totally, totally.

44:15.653 --> 44:18.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the book that I should
have written
when I was 25, instead of 52.

44:18.923 --> 44:21.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One of the
themes, obviously,
is chance, right...

44:21.559 --> 44:22.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANN PATCHETT: Yes.

44:22.927 --> 44:24.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: ... is how one
thing leads
to just everything.

44:24.962 --> 44:26.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANN PATCHETT: Right.

44:26.797 --> 44:32.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't believe in fate, as in,
which I -- as
a Catholic, I think, sort of
predestination.

44:32.503 --> 44:34.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I certainly believe in
chance.

44:34.338 --> 44:37.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I do think -- don't you ever
think that?

44:37.408 --> 44:41.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, if I had turned right this
morning,
instead of left, maybe
everything would have

44:41.078 --> 44:42.046 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been different?

44:42.079 --> 44:43.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

44:43.080 --> 44:44.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think we all do.

44:44.649 --> 44:47.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANN PATCHETT: Yes, you know, you
miss the
train, but then you meet the
person.

44:47.451 --> 44:49.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that that's --
that's what the
book is about.

44:49.654 --> 44:51.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, everybody believes in
chance.

44:51.756 --> 44:53.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, there's a lot of chance in
this book.

44:53.891 --> 44:59.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: But, as a
novelist, that gave
you a way into, sees what
happens?

44:59.730 --> 45:04.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Did you know where it was ending
up, or did
you start all this chance
happening and then

45:04.168 --> 45:05.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
see where it might lead?

45:05.336 --> 45:06.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANN PATCHETT: No, I always know
where it's
ending up.

45:06.604 --> 45:07.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: You do?

45:07.605 --> 45:08.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANN PATCHETT: That's the way I
work.

45:08.773 --> 45:13.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I get it all plotted in my mind,
and then
I write it down.

45:13.210 --> 45:16.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, sometimes, things change
a little
bit.

45:16.380 --> 45:19.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I always say it's like
taking a trip.

45:19.283 --> 45:21.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I know where I'm going.

45:21.752 --> 45:24.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if I don't know where I'm
going, I don't
tend to get anywhere.

45:24.789 --> 45:28.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Another theme in
this book
is time, right, the passage of
time.

45:28.893 --> 45:29.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANN PATCHETT: Yes.

45:29.894 --> 45:31.228 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

45:31.262 --> 45:32.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This book starts out with six
kids, and they're
not great kids.

45:32.830 --> 45:34.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have had a lot of upheaval
in their life.

45:34.932 --> 45:36.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're irritating.

45:36.701 --> 45:41.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then you see them in their
20s, their
30s, their 40s, their 50s, and
they grow on

45:41.706 --> 45:42.673 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

45:42.707 --> 45:43.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They grow into themselves.

45:43.708 --> 45:45.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They become the people they're
meant to be.

45:45.343 --> 45:48.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I liked the idea of having
enough time
to really see that.

45:48.179 --> 45:52.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: They're also
children who we
see who are kind of --
emotionally, they're

45:52.416 --> 45:53.417 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just kind of left on their own.

45:53.451 --> 45:54.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANN PATCHETT: Yes.

45:54.885 --> 45:57.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have had a lot of people
say, oh, these
are terrible parents.

45:57.555 --> 45:59.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm like, they're not
terrible parents.

45:59.290 --> 46:00.257 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It was the '60s.

46:00.291 --> 46:01.258 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It was the '70s.

46:01.292 --> 46:02.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

46:02.293 --> 46:03.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ANN PATCHETT: I mean, my
parents...

46:03.361 --> 46:04.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Go play outside,
right?

46:04.362 --> 46:05.329 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANN PATCHETT: Yes, exactly.

46:05.363 --> 46:06.330 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Dig a hole.

46:06.364 --> 46:07.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And when you're done, fill it up
again.

46:07.632 --> 46:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I actually think that's
really important
for creativity.

46:09.533 --> 46:16.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, if you want to grow a
novelist, for
that person to have a lot of
boring time trying

46:16.173 --> 46:18.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to entertain themselves is very
important.

46:18.609 --> 46:23.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Her partnership
in Parnassus
Books came after Patchett saw
Nashville losing

46:23.614 --> 46:28.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the last of its independent
bookstores and
decided she had no choice but to
enter the

46:28.185 --> 46:29.153 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
retail business.

46:29.186 --> 46:30.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANN PATCHETT: I had no idea.

46:30.921 --> 46:32.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I really thought that I was
going a good deed.

46:32.957 --> 46:37.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought it was like, the
symphony is going
under, I must save the symphony,
that kind

46:37.395 --> 46:38.362 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of thing.

46:38.396 --> 46:40.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I actually really love this
store.

46:40.998 --> 46:42.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I love being here.

46:42.199 --> 46:44.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I love telling people what to
read.

46:44.235 --> 46:49.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's my favorite thing in the
world, to buy
books and force books on people,
take bad

46:49.073 --> 46:51.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
books away from people, give
them better books.

46:51.308 --> 46:56.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You opened this
around the
time when the whole narrative of
bookstores

46:56.547 --> 46:57.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was, they're going away.

46:57.715 --> 46:59.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANN PATCHETT: Yes.

46:59.083 --> 47:00.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The narratives of
books, in
fact, were going away.

47:00.584 --> 47:01.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANN PATCHETT: Yes.

47:01.585 --> 47:03.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So what's the
story now?

47:03.821 --> 47:08.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANN PATCHETT: Independent
booksellers, independent
bookstores are on the rise
across the country.

47:08.693 --> 47:10.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The ones who've
survived.

47:10.561 --> 47:13.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANN PATCHETT: The ones who've
survived, but,
actually, a lot of new ones have
started since

47:13.798 --> 47:15.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we opened this store.

47:15.166 --> 47:19.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think that it had bottomed
out, and
then it was going up.

47:19.203 --> 47:21.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the other thing is, this is
my hometown.

47:21.272 --> 47:22.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I knew Nashville.

47:22.606 --> 47:26.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I knew that they loved the
bookstore that
they lost.

47:26.210 --> 47:28.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Nashville supports
everything local.

47:28.913 --> 47:33.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They would always rather buy
their coffee
at Fido than at Starbucks.

47:33.651 --> 47:38.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so this was a city that was
going to support
and independent bookstore.

47:38.222 --> 47:39.957 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it has.

47:39.990 --> 47:41.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And why do you
think the bookstores
are coming back across the
country?

47:41.992 --> 47:48.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANN PATCHETT: Because you can't
spend your
whole life in front of a screen.

47:48.632 --> 47:52.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you can't take your family
to anthropology
after dinner.

47:52.636 --> 47:56.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You need someplace to go and
hang out.

47:56.440 --> 47:58.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everybody can come here.

47:58.509 --> 48:01.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can come here if you're
lonely and you
want to talk to other people who
loves books.

48:01.912 --> 48:05.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you can come here if you're
overwhelmed
and want to be silent and sit
down in a chair

48:05.750 --> 48:09.019 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and read a book.

48:09.053 --> 48:13.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can bring your kid here for
story time.

48:13.157 --> 48:16.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can come here to listen to
your favorite
author.

48:16.227 --> 48:17.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, it's a community center.

48:17.895 --> 48:21.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can come here, spend time
here, not buy
a book here.

48:21.432 --> 48:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a beautiful place.

48:23.234 --> 48:25.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Or you can come here and buy a
book here.

48:25.636 --> 48:26.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's good, too.

48:26.637 --> 48:28.472 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We love that.

48:28.506 --> 48:31.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Ann Patchett's
latest novel,
"Commonwealth," is now on sale
at her bookstore

48:31.742 --> 48:34.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and, we hope, one near you.

48:34.411 --> 48:43.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From Nashville, I'm Jeffrey
Brown for the
"PBS NewsHour."

48:43.087 --> 48:53.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally to our
"NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught our eye
that might be

48:53.097 --> 48:55.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of interest to you, too.

48:55.366 --> 49:01.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Arizona photographer Mike
Olbinski is a storm
chaser whose time-lapse videos
have been used

49:01.272 --> 49:04.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in commercials, documentaries
and even feature
films.

49:04.608 --> 49:08.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE OLBINSKI, Photographer: My
name is Mike
Olbinski.

49:08.112 --> 49:13.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I am a professional storm
and wedding
photographer based out of
Phoenix, Arizona.

49:13.150 --> 49:15.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's kind of kind of a crazy
profession.

49:15.586 --> 49:21.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I got into it mainly because
I have loved
the weather ever since I was a
kid.

49:21.692 --> 49:25.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it wasn't until, you know,
early 30s that
I started seeing photos of
lightning, and

49:25.863 --> 49:27.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I just started getting
interested in it.

49:27.565 --> 49:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My time-lapses are still frames.

49:29.533 --> 49:34.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So my camera is taking a picture
every second,
every two seconds, every three
seconds, whatever

49:34.939 --> 49:39.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm out there trying to do, and
then those
get kind of put together into a
video.

49:39.710 --> 49:45.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It kind of goes back to the old
days of animation,
where people used to draw
cartoons on a piece

49:45.216 --> 49:48.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of paper on like a hundred
pages, and then
flip through it, and you would
get this motion

49:48.986 --> 49:49.954 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
happening.

49:49.987 --> 49:52.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I kind of have two chase seasons
in a way.

49:52.156 --> 49:56.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I chase out on the Plains in the
spring, and
then I live in Phoenix, so then
I just chase

49:56.460 --> 49:57.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the monsoon all summer.

49:57.461 --> 49:59.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, obviously, it's a lot
easier here.

49:59.263 --> 50:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is kind of where I
started, because
all I have to do is just drive
40 miles to

50:02.700 --> 50:07.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get somewhere to shoot a dust
storm, instead
of driving 16 hours to Oklahoma
to shoot a

50:07.404 --> 50:08.839 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
storm that might not happen.

50:08.873 --> 50:11.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the dust storms are
something that
are kind of unique to us.

50:11.742 --> 50:14.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Other people get them every now
and then,
but we get them all the time.

50:14.578 --> 50:19.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The lightning out here is just
-- is probably
better than most places, just
because our

50:19.416 --> 50:24.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
storms are really what they call
high-based,
where the bottom of the storms
are really

50:24.221 --> 50:27.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up high, so you see a lot more
of the lightning
hitting the ground.

50:27.424 --> 50:33.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Out on the Plains, these storms
just take
on otherworldly appearances
because they are

50:33.097 --> 50:34.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rotating as they go upwards.

50:34.865 --> 50:39.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And a lot of times, that
rotation ends up
turning the storm into looking
like a flying

50:39.737 --> 50:42.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saucer or the mother ship, as
everybody likes
to say.

50:42.873 --> 50:48.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have seen some pretty amazing
storms over
the course of the last seven or
eight years.

50:48.212 --> 50:51.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The first one was the big dust
storm that
hit Phoenix on July 5, 2011.

50:51.548 --> 50:56.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have lived here my whole life,
and I have
never -- I have seen dust storms
all the time,

50:56.820 --> 50:58.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but I have never seen one like
this.

50:58.122 --> 51:00.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It just looked like the end of
the world.

51:00.925 --> 51:07.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A couple years later, in 2013,
we were in
Texas, and we were shooting this
storm in

51:07.097 --> 51:10.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
front of a cornfield that had
been chopped
down.

51:10.167 --> 51:14.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then the sun was setting,
and so the whole
sky was orange.

51:14.071 --> 51:15.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this supercell was spinning.

51:15.205 --> 51:17.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was just sucking up dirt off
the ground.

51:17.541 --> 51:22.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just love this, like, solitude
of being
out there, being with nature,
seeing these

51:22.046 --> 51:26.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amazing storms, and trying to
get the best
footage and photos that I
possibly can.

51:26.917 --> 51:28.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All I can say is
wow.

51:28.752 --> 51:32.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Those pictures, the
dust storm
picture of Phoenix, amazing.

51:32.656 --> 51:34.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just -- I have
never seen anything
like it.

51:34.325 --> 51:35.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I wouldn't want to
be behind the
camera.

51:35.993 --> 51:36.961 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK.

51:36.994 --> 51:38.462 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

51:38.495 --> 51:40.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Tonight, PBS
launches a new series
on presidential campaigns.

51:40.698 --> 51:45.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"The Contenders: 16 for '16"
airs Tuesdays
for the next eight weeks on PBS.

51:45.769 --> 51:51.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight's episode, "The Straight
Talkers,"
features Senator John McCain's
run in 2000,

51:51.141 --> 51:55.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Shirley Chisholm, who, in
1972, was the
first woman and the first
African-American

51:55.946 --> 52:00.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to seek the Democratic
nomination.

52:00.884 --> 52:09.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Four thousand blacks, some
radical, some
conservative, met in Gary,
Indiana, for the

52:09.059 --> 52:11.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first National Black Political
Convention.

52:11.261 --> 52:16.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: A conference was called
in Gary to
discuss black political power.

52:16.600 --> 52:21.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Passage of the '65 Voting Rights
Act enabled
a lot of African-Americans to
believe that

52:21.338 --> 52:27.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they could play a greater role
in national
politics as an organized black
force.

52:27.845 --> 52:32.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When this conference takes
place, Mrs. Chisholm
decides not to go.

52:32.383 --> 52:34.184 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

52:34.218 --> 52:37.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES RANGEL (D), New York:
Listen, when
you have enough political
courage to do what

52:37.821 --> 52:44.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shirley Chisholm has done, which
I never had
this much of it, I'm not
prepared to give

52:44.395 --> 52:46.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
advice as to what she should
have done.

52:46.730 --> 52:51.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: And Chisholm chose not to
go because,
one, she had already announced
that she was

52:51.368 --> 52:56.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to run for president, and
she didn't
feel like catching flak, and she
didn't want

52:56.273 --> 52:59.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be there when there was a
vote of non-support
for her.

52:59.176 --> 53:05.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I went to the Gary,
Indiana, Black
Political Convention, and we
tried to get

53:05.182 --> 53:10.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an endorsement from the Black
Political Convention
delegates for Shirley Chisholm
for president.

53:10.654 --> 53:12.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We couldn't even get it there.

53:12.089 --> 53:15.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, the guys had it so sewed
up.

53:15.192 --> 53:22.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: They could not stand the
fact that
a black woman kind of
leapfrogged over them

53:22.132 --> 53:24.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and made the decision for
herself to run.

53:24.835 --> 53:29.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For many, they thought a black
man should
do this first.

53:29.306 --> 53:33.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MELISSA HARRIS-PERRY, Wake
Forest University:
She sees black men as awful
extremely hostile

53:33.143 --> 53:34.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to her candidacy.

53:34.945 --> 53:38.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bigger part of the joke for
them isn't
that she's an African-American
running, but,

53:38.449 --> 53:40.184 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like, she's a girl running.

53:40.217 --> 53:43.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're not going to have some
girl president,
right, much less a black girl
president.

53:43.954 --> 53:48.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: "The Contenders"

American women.

54:15.018 --> 54:15.986 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm Gwen Ifill.

54:16.019 --> 54:17.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.
