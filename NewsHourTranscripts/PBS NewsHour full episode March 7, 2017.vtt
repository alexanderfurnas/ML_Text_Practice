JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.272 --> 00:07.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.174 --> 00:11.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Republicans roll
out a new health care plan to
upend the Affordable

00:11.812 --> 00:13.280 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Care Act.

00:13.313 --> 00:18.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A look at how the new bill aims
to replace
President Obama's signature law.

00:18.785 --> 00:24.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Also ahead this Tuesday:
WikiLeaks releases
thousands of CIA documents
claiming to reveal

00:24.858 --> 00:27.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the agency's hacking tools.

00:27.661 --> 00:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we talk with the creators of
"The Americans"
about how the TV series
centering on Russian

00:33.567 --> 00:37.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spies in the United States back
in the '80s
is more current than ever.

00:37.938 --> 00:41.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOEL FIELDS, Executive Producer,
"The Americans":
What better time to humanize
Russian espionage

00:41.742 --> 00:44.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than the time that we're the
victims of it?

00:44.444 --> 00:48.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, that's the time when
you're most
inclined to dehumanize it.

00:48.749 --> 00:51.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:51.852 --> 00:56.023 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:56.056 --> 01:09.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The battle over
the Affordable
Care Act, or Obamacare, is now
joined in earnest.

01:09.703 --> 01:14.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans in the House of
Representatives
pressed forward today, in the
face of resistance

01:14.775 --> 01:18.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from Democrats and from inside
their own party.

01:18.111 --> 01:20.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins reports from
Capitol Hill.

01:20.881 --> 01:26.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It was day one
of Republicans'
push to sell their long-awaited
replacement

01:26.887 --> 01:31.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
plan for the Affordable Care
Act, or Obamacare.

01:31.258 --> 01:34.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Greg Walden chairs the Energy
and Commerce
Committee and helped author the
bill.

01:34.394 --> 01:36.196 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:36.229 --> 01:38.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GREG WALDEN (R), Oregon:
Introduction of this
bill is just the first step in
helping American

01:38.231 --> 01:44.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
families across the country
obtain truly affordable
health care and we're eager to
get started.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: I encourage you to read the
bill.

01:46.173 --> 01:50.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Named the
American Health
Care Act, Republicans are
keeping some and

01:50.243 --> 01:52.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
changing some of the Affordable
Care Act.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The first big change?

01:54.848 --> 01:56.650 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Medicaid.

01:56.683 --> 02:02.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obamacare expanded Medicaid to
include roughly
12 million more people,
lower-income adults.

02:02.756 --> 02:08.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans would end that
expansion in 2020,
but allow those enrolled at that
time to stay

02:08.095 --> 02:09.830 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on Medicaid.

02:09.863 --> 02:15.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the rest of Medicaid, some
55 million
people, there is potentially
sweeping change.

02:15.769 --> 02:20.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans would move from
paying for all
health care costs now to setting
a limit on

02:20.340 --> 02:22.342 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
spending per person.

02:22.376 --> 02:27.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Democrats like Kentucky
Congressman John Yarmuth
are outraged, saying that will
cut benefits

02:27.614 --> 02:28.582 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to millions.

02:28.615 --> 02:30.317 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:30.350 --> 02:32.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YARMUTH (D), Kentucky: Over
the long
term, what it's going to mean
is, the people

02:32.185 --> 02:37.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who need the care the most,
people who are
working hard and need the
coverage, will get

02:37.190 --> 02:42.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
less of it, and the states will
have to shoulder
more of the burden.

02:42.162 --> 02:47.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But Republican
leaders mounted
an all-out offensive, with Vice
President

02:47.200 --> 02:52.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mike Pence visiting senators at
the Capitol,
and President Trump meeting with
House leaders

02:52.039 --> 02:53.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at the White House.

02:53.907 --> 02:56.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
I think, really, we're going to
have something

02:56.043 --> 03:01.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's much more understood and
much more
popular than people can even
imagine.

03:01.982 --> 03:06.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The largest
issue for the
Republican bill is what we don't
know.

03:06.219 --> 03:09.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't yet know if this bill
will mean fewer
people with health insurance.

03:10.023 --> 03:15.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We also don't know how much
anything will
cost, including new tax credits.

03:15.529 --> 03:19.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those tax credits are another
big issue and
change.

03:19.066 --> 03:24.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Affordable Care Act gives
direct tax subsidies
for low- and middle-income
Americans.

03:24.971 --> 03:30.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans would instead give
refundable
tax credits and rework who gets
them.

03:30.677 --> 03:36.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Individuals making under $75,000
would get
a full credit based on age,
$2,000 dollars

03:36.316 --> 03:41.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the youngest, increasing to
$4,000 for
those over 60.

03:41.688 --> 03:45.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But those tax credits are
raising concern
from the right.

03:45.592 --> 03:49.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Congressman Dave Brat
says the
credits are more massive
government spending.

03:49.729 --> 03:50.831 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:50.864 --> 03:51.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVE BRAT (R), Virginia: Where
is it coming
from?

03:51.798 --> 03:53.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's coming from the federal
government.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's a new entitlement
program.

03:55.902 --> 04:00.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so for the folks out there,
they may not
know -- go Google it -- we have
a $100 trillion

04:00.474 --> 04:01.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
entitlement problem.

04:01.475 --> 04:03.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: He's not alone.

04:03.143 --> 04:08.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Congressman Justin
Amash called
the bill Obamacare 2.0 in a
tweet.

04:08.381 --> 04:12.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Kentucky Senator Rand Paul
and other Republicans
held a news conference to push
back.

04:12.719 --> 04:13.787 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:13.820 --> 04:14.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAND PAUL (R), Kentucky: We are
united on
repeal.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But we are divided on
replacement.

04:16.890 --> 04:20.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That could be a
serious issue
in the Senate, where the GOP can
afford to

04:20.894 --> 04:25.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lose only two votes and still
pass their bill
without help from Democrats.

04:25.765 --> 04:30.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as some raised doubts,
others in the
party moved to Answer them, like
Health and

04:30.470 --> 04:32.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Human Services Secretary Tom
Price.

04:32.405 --> 04:34.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM PRICE, U.S. Health and Human
Services
Secretary: This is all about
patients, and

04:34.908 --> 04:38.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in order to provide that
transition and in
order to make it so that nobody
falls through

04:38.111 --> 04:41.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the cracks, we have got to have
a system that
allows for individuals to gain
the kind of

04:41.615 --> 04:43.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
coverage that they want.

04:43.416 --> 04:46.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And House
Speaker Paul Ryan
insisted that the bill will get
the votes

04:46.887 --> 04:47.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it needs in the House.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.623 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

04:49.656 --> 04:50.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: We
will have 218 when this comes to
the floor.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.125 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I can guarantee you that.

04:52.159 --> 04:55.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Tomorrow, day
two, may be
more important, as the bill
heads to possible

04:55.529 --> 04:56.997 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
committee votes.

04:57.030 --> 05:00.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins
at the Capitol.

05:00.100 --> 05:03.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: The
nominee for the number two
position at the

05:03.870 --> 05:09.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Justice Department faced close
questioning
about investigating Russian
meddling in the

05:09.342 --> 05:10.477 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
2016 election.

05:10.510 --> 05:14.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rod Rosenstein would oversee the
probe if
he is confirmed.

05:14.047 --> 05:18.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is because Attorney General
Jeff Sessions
recused himself last week.

05:18.552 --> 05:24.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At his Senate confirmation
hearing, Rosenstein
fended off Democrats urging that
he recuse

05:24.357 --> 05:27.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
himself, too, and appoint a
special outside
counselor.

05:27.360 --> 05:31.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROD ROSENSTEIN, Deputy Attorney
General Nominee:
I know this is the issue du jour
on Capitol

05:31.231 --> 05:32.999 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Hill.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I anticipate that, if I were
the deputy
attorney general, we'd have a
lot of matters

05:35.602 --> 05:39.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coming before the department
over time, and
I would approach them all the
same way.

05:39.272 --> 05:45.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would evaluate the facts and
the law, consider
the applicable regulations,
consult with career

05:45.078 --> 05:48.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
professionals in the department,
and then
exercise my best judgment.

05:48.181 --> 05:52.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At least one
Democrat, Connecticut's
Richard Blumenthal, said that he
will try

05:52.886 --> 05:58.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to block the Rosenstein
nomination unless
he does commit to a special
counsel.

05:58.491 --> 06:03.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New threats at Jewish Community
Centers and
the Anti-Defamation League
today.

06:03.196 --> 06:08.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Phoned-in claims of bombs and
even a sniper
came in at least eight cities.

06:08.101 --> 06:13.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In response, all 100 U.S.
senators wrote to
the FBI and the Departments of
Justice and

06:13.740 --> 06:15.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Homeland Security.

06:15.642 --> 06:20.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said -- quote -- "Failure
to address
these and deter these threats
will place innocent

06:20.180 --> 06:22.082 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
people at risk."

06:22.115 --> 06:27.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A federal judge has refused to
stop completion
of the Dakota Access oil
pipeline, as American

06:27.754 --> 06:29.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Indian tribes wanted.

06:29.589 --> 06:35.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today's ruling coincided with
the start of
a four-day protest on the
National Mall.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will culminate in a march on
the White
House.

06:37.831 --> 06:43.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The court fight will continue,
but the pipeline
builders say the oil could begin
flowing next

06:43.737 --> 06:45.438 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
week.

06:45.472 --> 06:49.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Emergency crews struggled today
to contain
fast-moving wildfires that have
killed six

06:49.676 --> 06:51.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people in four states.

06:51.478 --> 06:56.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fires are sweeping across
hundreds of
square miles in Kansas,
Oklahoma, Texas, and

06:56.850 --> 06:58.084 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Colorado.

06:58.118 --> 07:01.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have already forced more
than 10,000
people to flee.

07:01.921 --> 07:06.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Elsewhere, hundreds of homes
were damaged
overnight by severe storms
across the Midwest.

07:07.027 --> 07:12.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 30 twisters were
reported in Kansas,
Missouri, Iowa and Illinois.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DUANE COFFEY, Storm Victim:
We're lucky.

07:15.402 --> 07:19.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Small children and two adults,
they were scared.

07:19.906 --> 07:25.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everybody was scared, but we
stuck together
and made it through it.

07:25.178 --> 07:29.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This afternoon,
the governor
of Missouri declared a state of
emergency

07:29.249 --> 07:31.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the wake of the storms.

07:31.551 --> 07:36.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S.-backed forces scored gains
against Islamic
State fighters on two fronts
today.

07:36.856 --> 07:42.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Syria, militia groups cut a
main road out
of Raqqa, the de facto ISIS
capital.

07:42.095 --> 07:48.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in Iraq, army units pushed

09:43.383 --> 09:47.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now let's go back to the big
debate emerging
over the health care law, and
explore some

09:47.887 --> 09:51.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the key ideas behind the
Republicans' plans.

09:51.558 --> 09:56.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The House bill does keep some of
the most
popular provisions of the law,
like preventing

09:56.796 --> 10:00.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
insurers from denying coverage
for preexisting
conditions.

10:00.900 --> 10:06.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It still has penalties for a
lapse in coverage,
but it doesn't mandate coverage
in the same

10:06.973 --> 10:08.675 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

10:08.708 --> 10:12.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It also shifts how the
government would provide
financial help, while eventually
reducing

10:12.979 --> 10:15.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the number of people on
Medicaid.

10:15.548 --> 10:17.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Yang picks it up from
there.

10:17.383 --> 10:21.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: To help break down
the impact of
these proposed changes, I'm
joined by two

10:21.254 --> 10:23.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
experts who watch health care
closely.

10:23.690 --> 10:29.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lanhee Chen is a fellow at the
Hoover Institution
who advised Mitt Romney and
Marco Rubio in

10:29.562 --> 10:31.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their presidential campaigns.

10:31.431 --> 10:36.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Sabrina Corlette is a
professor at Georgetown
University's Health Care Policy
Institute.

10:36.836 --> 10:38.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thank you for joining us to you
both.

10:38.505 --> 10:40.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

10:40.340 --> 10:43.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think you can both agree that,
as this moves
through the legislative process,
the details

10:43.543 --> 10:49.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will change, but I think the
philosophical
changes in direction are clear
now.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lanhee Chen, let me start with
you.

10:51.918 --> 10:57.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This shifts -- what we're seeing
proposed
is to shift from requiring that
everyone have

10:57.957 --> 11:03.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
insurance, to have a series of
carrots, really,
to get people to buy insurance
themselves

11:03.730 --> 11:05.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the open market.

11:05.164 --> 11:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why is that the better approach?

11:06.933 --> 11:08.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LANHEE CHEN, Former Policy
Director, Mitt
Romney Campaign: Well, one of
the issues,

11:08.935 --> 11:13.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
frankly, with the Affordable
Care Act is that
you had situations where
insurance was become

11:13.106 --> 11:14.908 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unaffordable.

11:14.941 --> 11:20.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, if you look at 2015 as
an example,
19.2 million Americans either
could not afford

11:20.513 --> 11:24.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health insurance because they
got what was
known as a hardship exemption,
or they paid

11:24.517 --> 11:28.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the penalty relating to
Obamacare's individual
mandate.

11:28.288 --> 11:32.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So one of the things that this
tries to do
is to encourage the purchase of
insurance,

11:32.125 --> 11:35.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but, as you say, to do it as an
encouragement,
rather than as a penalty.

11:35.361 --> 11:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, where a penalty does apply
is when an
individual doesn't make the
decision to acquire

11:39.699 --> 11:43.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coverage and that coverage
lapses, and then
they would be subject to a
penalty to get

11:43.970 --> 11:45.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
back into the system.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the approach, as you note,
is fundamentally
different.

11:47.473 --> 11:51.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But, Lanhee, how does
this -- how
does this move premiums down?

11:51.811 --> 11:54.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LANHEE CHEN: Well, I think
there's a couple
of things.

11:54.781 --> 12:00.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, the idea is to
create marketplaces
that are healthier by providing
more competition

12:00.320 --> 12:02.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and a greater choice of plans.

12:02.121 --> 12:07.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, obviously, this provision
alone doesn't
do that, but the idea behind the
Republican

12:07.327 --> 12:09.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
approach is to move in that
direction.

12:09.262 --> 12:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, some of that lowering of
costs is constrained
in this piece of legislation
because it has

12:14.233 --> 12:17.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to comply with this budgetary
oddity known
as reconciliation.

12:17.904 --> 12:23.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, overall, the Republican
strategy is to
lower costs by expanding choice
and reducing

12:23.409 --> 12:24.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the number of mandates on plans.

12:25.011 --> 12:26.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Sabrina Corlette, is
that effective?

12:26.980 --> 12:28.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that going to work?

12:28.781 --> 12:29.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SABRINA CORLETTE, Center on
Health Insurance
Reforms, Georgetown University:
Well, here's

12:29.949 --> 12:31.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of those things where
details really do
matter.

12:31.884 --> 12:39.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, I would argue that
this requirement
they have in there that is an
attempt to replace

12:39.225 --> 12:44.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the ACA's individual mandate
will actually
drive premiums up, because I
think more young

12:44.364 --> 12:48.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people will look at that and
say, I'm not
going to face a penalty if I
don't sign up

12:48.635 --> 12:50.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for coverage, so I'm going to
hold off on
buying insurance.

12:50.803 --> 12:55.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the only people buying
insurance will
be those who are sick.

12:55.108 --> 12:59.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if insurers have to just
cover sick people,
they will raise premiums, and
those will go

12:59.278 --> 13:01.080 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

13:01.114 --> 13:04.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Lanhee Chen, that
gets to a point
that many critics are saying,
that the federal

13:04.550 --> 13:11.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
help to buy for these insurance
premiums favors,
they say, the young and the
healthy over the

13:11.791 --> 13:13.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sick and the old.

13:13.359 --> 13:15.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you say to that?

13:15.194 --> 13:17.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LANHEE CHEN: Well, I have a
tough time with
that argument, John, frankly,
because, first

13:17.797 --> 13:23.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of all, the tax credits in the
Republican
plan are based, first of all, on
age.

13:23.102 --> 13:25.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is the primary factor on
which they're
differentiated.

13:25.371 --> 13:29.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Therefore, those who are older
will get more
assistance than those who are
younger.

13:29.742 --> 13:35.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Furthermore, the broader idea
here is to lower
the cost of plans to get more
people in.

13:35.248 --> 13:39.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is the case in the previous
regime, under
Obamacare, that you did have
fewer people

13:39.819 --> 13:45.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the marketplace because
premiums were increasing,
for example, from 2015 to 2016
by an average

13:45.391 --> 13:47.193 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of 25 percent.

13:47.226 --> 13:50.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the goal here, again,
lowering the cost
of plans, so that the help that
is provided

13:50.630 --> 13:52.732 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by the government will buy more
coverage.

13:52.765 --> 13:55.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is the idea and the concept
behind the
Republican proposal.

13:55.768 --> 14:02.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Sabrina Corlette,
he's correct
that the tax breaks go up with
age, but, also,

14:02.775 --> 14:09.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
it allows the insurance
companies to charge
much higher premiums for older
insured people.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SABRINA CORLETTE: Right, right.

14:11.517 --> 14:16.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this bill would allow
insurance companies
to charge older people up to
five times the

14:16.723 --> 14:18.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
amount of a younger person.

14:18.091 --> 14:21.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the tax credits only go up
two times.

14:21.094 --> 14:26.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you're essentially handing
an older person
a two-foot rope to get
themselves out of a

14:26.466 --> 14:28.101 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
10-foot hole.

14:28.134 --> 14:31.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The other thing is that,
overall, the tax
subsidies are much less generous
than they

14:31.337 --> 14:32.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are under the Affordable Care
Act.

14:32.839 --> 14:34.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they're not income-related.

14:34.540 --> 14:39.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So lower-income people get less,
relative
to their income, and many of
them will not

14:39.846 --> 14:41.714 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be able to afford this coverage.

14:41.748 --> 14:45.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't have numbers yet from
the Congressional
Budget Office about how many
people will end

14:45.818 --> 14:47.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
up losing coverage.

14:47.687 --> 14:52.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we do have numbers that --
from Wall Street
analysts that estimate up to 10
million people

14:52.158 --> 14:53.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will lose coverage under this
bill.

14:54.026 --> 14:57.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Lanhee Chen, how do
you respond
to that, about the number of
people who will

14:57.296 --> 14:59.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
go uncovered by this?

14:59.065 --> 15:00.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LANHEE CHEN: I think there are a
couple of
things.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will have to wait and see
what the Congressional
Budget Office ends up deciding
on this.

15:04.337 --> 15:08.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it is the case, first of
all, that the
Republican philosophy, the
conservative philosophy

15:08.641 --> 15:12.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has always been that you expand
access by
lowering costs.

15:12.178 --> 15:15.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it is the case that if you
are able to
get some of these regulation out
of the way

15:15.815 --> 15:19.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- now, granted, the House bill
doesn't actually
do a lot of that, because,
again, it has to

15:19.452 --> 15:21.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
comply with these arcane
budgetary rules.

15:21.988 --> 15:26.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But were there to be
legislation, let's say,
in phase two, as Donald Trump
says, of health

15:26.426 --> 15:30.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
reform that got these
regulations out of the
way, the idea would be to lower
the cost of

15:30.730 --> 15:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plans, to expand access, and
therefore affect
that number of uninsured.

15:34.534 --> 15:38.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another thing they could do,
briefly, is,
they could look at trying to
create a steeper

15:38.704 --> 15:43.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
means test on the tax credits,
such that poorer
people would benefit more than
they do under

15:43.376 --> 15:45.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the current proposal.

15:45.111 --> 15:49.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Lanhee Chen, what do
you say to
the conservatives who worry that
these tax

15:49.081 --> 15:52.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
credits are essentially a new
entitlement?

15:52.051 --> 15:55.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LANHEE CHEN: Well, I would make
a couple of
arguments.

15:55.388 --> 15:59.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, we already have a
tax code that
subsidizes health care, largely
through the

15:59.158 --> 16:03.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
purchase of health insurance
through your
employer; 160 million Americans
take advantage

16:03.563 --> 16:05.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of this tax break already.

16:05.398 --> 16:09.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What Republicans are trying to
do with this
proposal is to equalize, to a
certain degree,

16:09.202 --> 16:13.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the treatment of health
insurance purchased
individually vs. through
employers.

16:13.206 --> 16:17.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would also say that it's
just a reality
that we have got to deal with
questions of

16:17.543 --> 16:19.278 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coverage.

16:19.312 --> 16:22.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you don't help people who
are outside
of the employer marketplace, you
are going

16:22.381 --> 16:24.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to see even more significant
degradations
in coverage.

16:24.951 --> 16:26.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So this is an important step
forward in that
regard.

16:27.019 --> 16:32.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And then, finally,
Sabrina Corlette,
what's your view on the changes
that are coming

16:32.091 --> 16:35.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Medicaid, or would be coming
in Medicaid
if this plan is passed?

16:35.328 --> 16:38.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SABRINA CORLETTE: Well, this is
one thing
that I think is really important
for people

16:38.865 --> 16:44.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to know, is that this bill goes
way beyond
repealing the ACA's Medicaid
expansion.

16:44.670 --> 16:49.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This really is a radical
restructuring of
a program that's been around for
50 years.

16:49.642 --> 16:54.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a financial lifeline for
not just low-income
families, but families who have
people with

16:54.647 --> 16:58.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- kids with disabilities, older
people who
need long-term care.

16:58.317 --> 17:02.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Close to 50 percent of births in
this country
are funded by the Medicaid
program.

17:02.788 --> 17:09.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we are looking at potentially
cutting this
program that will affect far
beyond the people

17:09.362 --> 17:11.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just that got coverage through
the ACA.

17:11.130 --> 17:13.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Sabrina Corlette,
Lanhee Chen,
thank you very much.

17:13.733 --> 17:17.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LANHEE CHEN: Thank you.

17:17.737 --> 17:30.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Today, the
chairman of the
House Intelligence Committee
announced that

17:30.216 --> 17:35.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the first public hearing on the
investigation
into Russian interference in the
election

17:35.221 --> 17:37.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would begin on March 20.

17:37.390 --> 17:41.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, Democrats in
the Senate
are calling for a special
counsel to investigate.

17:42.028 --> 17:46.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have heard recently from
Democrats on the
Senate Intelligence Committee.

17:46.265 --> 17:48.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Tonight, we turn to a
Republican.

17:48.434 --> 17:50.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is Senator James Lankford of
Oklahoma.

17:50.736 --> 17:53.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Lankford, thank you very
much for
being with us.

17:53.806 --> 17:57.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the House committee has
announced when
its hearing beginnings.

17:57.310 --> 17:58.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What about the Senate?

17:58.311 --> 17:59.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is the House going to go first?

17:59.345 --> 18:00.880 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD (R), OKLAHOMA:
Well, the House
was doing an open meeting there.

18:02.682 --> 18:06.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have actually done hearings
for several
months now behind closed doors,
as most of

18:06.052 --> 18:08.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Intelligence hearings are
held.

18:08.421 --> 18:12.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are dealing with highly
classified documents,
procedures, people, that remain
classified

18:12.992 --> 18:14.393 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and should remain classified.

18:14.427 --> 18:18.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So a lot of work will be held
behind closed
doors, quite frankly.

18:18.064 --> 18:21.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we will actually bring
things out
when it's appropriate and when
we have actually

18:21.300 --> 18:23.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some things to be able to
contribute to the
national conversation.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are you
subpoenaing witnesses?

18:25.938 --> 18:27.440 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

18:27.473 --> 18:29.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: We are working
through the
process of getting witnesses.

18:29.108 --> 18:32.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not going to say whether we
have to subpoena
any of them at this point.

18:32.044 --> 18:34.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I would say the witnesses
that we have
asked for, we have been able to
get access

18:34.780 --> 18:36.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to without having to do a
subpoena.

18:36.882 --> 18:38.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we will work through that
process.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is very similar.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know you will remember, in
December, President
Obama in his press conference
was asked about

18:43.789 --> 18:49.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the administration investigation
into all
this process, and he said at
that time, in

18:49.161 --> 18:52.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
December, the American people
are going to
be somewhat frustrated by an
investigation

18:52.531 --> 18:55.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that deals with intelligence,
because we can't
put out all the sources and
methods.

18:55.735 --> 18:59.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want to still be able to
guard what we're
doing in foreign intelligence in
the days

18:59.171 --> 19:00.973 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ahead.

19:01.007 --> 19:04.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we will put out what we can
possibly put
out, but a lot of the work will
be very quiet.

19:04.110 --> 19:09.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you think it
is a good idea
to look at President Trump's tax
records in

19:09.882 --> 19:14.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
order to get an understanding of
his possible
business connections with
Russia?

19:14.520 --> 19:16.288 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: So, that's been
an accusation
that has sat out there, but it
has had no

19:18.557 --> 19:20.393 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
validity.

19:20.426 --> 19:22.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have yet to have anyone who
has been able
to point to anything, because
the description

19:22.995 --> 19:26.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there is that he had some sort
of secret business
dealings with Russia.

19:26.966 --> 19:29.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No one has stepped forward to be
able to actually
make that accusation.

19:29.468 --> 19:31.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Typically, it's people saying,
hey, we want
to go search.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We want to go look.

19:33.606 --> 19:36.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I know that there are people
that are
frustrated that he didn't put
his tax records

19:36.175 --> 19:37.943 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think this is kind of
their vehicle
to get it and then hopefully to
be able to

19:39.745 --> 19:43.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- once they get it in their
hands, to be
able to slip it out into the
media at some

19:43.049 --> 19:44.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
point and leak it out.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, right now, there's no
reason to even
go do that.

19:46.852 --> 19:51.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's a constitutional
issue between
the Congress reaching to a
sitting president

19:51.190 --> 19:53.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and requiring him to turn over
personal documents.

19:53.426 --> 19:57.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you're
saying, at this
point, you and others, the
majority on the

19:57.563 --> 20:00.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
committee, assume the tax
records are not
relevant?

20:00.266 --> 20:01.901 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: Yes, I have yet
to see anything
that would say those are
relevant.

20:03.769 --> 20:06.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, there are a lot of issues
we have got
to delve into, but I have not
seen that that's

20:06.539 --> 20:08.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a relevant document for us to
get.

20:08.374 --> 20:13.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump,
in connection
with all this, tweeted over the
weekend that

20:13.913 --> 20:21.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama ordered a
wiretap of him during
the campaign in his offices in
New York.

20:21.754 --> 20:24.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He suggests that he has evidence
of this.

20:24.290 --> 20:25.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are you aware of any evidence of
that?

20:25.991 --> 20:27.726 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: I would just say
to the White
House, if they have evidence of
that, they

20:29.528 --> 20:32.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can turn that over to our
committee and we
will follow that up as part of
our ongoing

20:32.398 --> 20:34.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
evaluation.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that would be something the
president
should turn over to Congress as
we're walking

20:35.734 --> 20:37.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
through our investigation

20:37.570 --> 20:42.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you take the
president at
his word, then, that there is
indeed evidence?

20:42.108 --> 20:46.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because -- I'm asking because
the president
has in turn called on Congress
to investigate

20:46.745 --> 20:47.713 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

20:47.746 --> 20:49.582 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:49.615 --> 20:50.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: Well, it would
help, obviously,
if the White House turned those
document over,

20:50.683 --> 20:52.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so we could include that into
our investigation.

20:52.885 --> 20:56.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're walking through a very
thorough process,
multiple different agencies in
an extremely

20:56.689 --> 20:57.990 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bipartisan way.

20:58.023 --> 21:00.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Intelligence Committee is
not a partisan
committee.

21:00.526 --> 21:01.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We work behind closed doors.

21:01.727 --> 21:03.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not showboating.

21:03.329 --> 21:04.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're not trying to actually get
some kind
of leverage.

21:04.864 --> 21:06.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a national security
issue.

21:06.432 --> 21:10.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is an issue we dealt
with, with Russia
for decades.

21:10.069 --> 21:13.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have tried to manipulate
elections all
around the world.

21:13.239 --> 21:17.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They go back in the United
States as far as
putting a KGB person onto
President Carter's

21:17.843 --> 21:19.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
campaign decades ago.

21:19.512 --> 21:23.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they have never done it so
overt and so
aggressive as they did this
time.

21:23.516 --> 21:28.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it is to our national benefit
to get this
right and to be able to have a
good investigation,

21:28.154 --> 21:30.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because this is not a partisan
issue.

21:30.189 --> 21:32.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a security issue for a
very long time,
and we have got to address it.

21:32.925 --> 21:36.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, have you
asked the White
House to turn such evidence over
to the committee?

21:36.662 --> 21:38.330 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:38.364 --> 21:39.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: Yes, I would say
what you
and I have just talked about
before, I have

21:39.732 --> 21:40.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
said plenty of places publicly.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I won't say what we have done
privately.

21:42.101 --> 21:44.003 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
How about that?

21:44.036 --> 21:47.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you think it
was appropriate
for President Trump to say this
without providing

21:47.106 --> 21:48.073 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that evidence?

21:48.107 --> 21:49.875 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: I think it's
difficult to
say that, because the natural
question from

21:51.310 --> 21:54.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
every one of the American people
is, really,
when did that happen?

21:54.046 --> 21:55.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How did that happen?

21:55.848 --> 21:57.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's something the
president is
going to have to address in the
days ahead.

21:57.983 --> 22:00.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I will allow the White House
to be able
to respond to that.

22:00.152 --> 22:04.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, there is
a new story
today you're aware of, WikiLeaks
releasing

22:04.490 --> 22:10.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thousands of pages of these
documents which
we're only beginning, really, to
see what's

22:10.329 --> 22:17.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in that material, looking at
what the CIA's
methods are for hacking,
allegedly hacking,

22:17.436 --> 22:22.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into everything from iPhones to
cars, televisions.

22:22.875 --> 22:25.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you know about that?

22:25.144 --> 22:28.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And how serious a security
breach could this
be?

22:28.314 --> 22:29.615 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

22:29.648 --> 22:30.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: So, let me give
you a series
of things to this.

22:30.616 --> 22:32.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WikiLeaks is not saying where
they got it.

22:32.451 --> 22:36.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are just saying that they
have this information
and that it was out there.

22:36.088 --> 22:39.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would remind people there's a
tremendous
amount of fake news out there.

22:39.558 --> 22:43.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not making an accusation
here, but there
is quite a bit out there that
people create,

22:43.862 --> 22:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being able to release out and to
say this
looks genuine and so we will put
this out.

22:47.666 --> 22:51.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Quite a few of these documents
like this,
we get a chance to look at later
and find

22:51.337 --> 22:53.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out they're really not genuine
after all.

22:53.706 --> 22:57.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I would caution people first
to be able
to jump to conclusions of this.

22:57.676 --> 23:02.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Second, when we deal with any
kind of what
is actually an intelligence
process, any time

23:02.214 --> 23:07.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anyone, WikiLeaks or anyone
else, releases
out, gets access to this, it
does two things.

23:07.853 --> 23:11.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It always asks the question of,
how did it
come from, where did it come
from at any point,

23:11.824 --> 23:13.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
if it's proved to be genuine?

23:13.525 --> 23:15.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That has to be corrected.

23:15.294 --> 23:20.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second part of it is, it
means that any
adversary out there anywhere in
the world,

23:20.132 --> 23:24.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether it be any government,
whether it be
any terrorist organization
suddenly gets information.

23:24.703 --> 23:27.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is toxic to the American
people.

23:27.806 --> 23:31.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The folks in the intelligence
community are
not targeting American citizens.

23:31.910 --> 23:37.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are very strict, clear
laws that protect
U.S. persons from anyone in the
intelligence.

23:37.249 --> 23:39.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I would be very frank with
you.

23:39.118 --> 23:43.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are very aggressive to try to
get information
about terrorist organizations,
foreign entities

23:43.622 --> 23:45.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that mean to do us harm.

23:45.157 --> 23:46.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I'm glad that we do.

23:46.992 --> 23:50.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If someone means to do harm to
the United
States, to any United States
citizen, we should

23:50.929 --> 23:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
try to find out first, rather
than react to
it after the fact.

23:54.300 --> 23:58.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And people who try to release
out any methods
that are out there are damaging
the national

23:58.470 --> 24:00.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
security of the United States.

24:00.439 --> 24:07.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator James
Lankford, Republican
on the Senate Intelligence
Committee, we thank

24:07.713 --> 24:08.814 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

24:08.847 --> 24:09.948 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

24:09.982 --> 24:14.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: Thank you.

24:14.553 --> 24:20.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As we just
discussed, WikiLeaks
today did publish thousands of
pages of what

24:20.426 --> 24:24.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it says are files about the CIA
and its hacking
activities.

24:24.897 --> 24:26.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our further
look.

24:26.598 --> 24:30.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The material
comes from the
CIA's Center for Cyber
Intelligence.

24:30.736 --> 24:36.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It includes a range of documents
from 2013
to 2016 which describe
cyber-tools for hacking

24:36.308 --> 24:39.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
cell phones, computers,
television, and even
vehicles.

24:39.878 --> 24:42.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The documents also contain
computer code.

24:42.815 --> 24:48.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One program, dubbed Weeping
Angel, entails
infecting Samsung smart TVs,
turning them

24:48.654 --> 24:50.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into bugging devices.

24:50.522 --> 24:55.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another program is aimed at
hacking Apple
and Android cell phones,
undercutting encryption

24:55.160 --> 24:59.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on services like WhatsApp,
Signal, and Telegram.

24:59.098 --> 25:03.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WikiLeaks also says these
documents show that
when the CIA discovered flaws in
computer

25:03.936 --> 25:09.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
code written by Apple, Google or
Samsung,
it failed to notify those
companies about

25:09.541 --> 25:13.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the vulnerabilities to allow
fixes to be made.

25:13.078 --> 25:16.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Mazzetti of The New York
Times has been
covering this, and joins us now.

25:16.915 --> 25:17.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mark, welcome to you.

25:17.916 --> 25:20.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, the CIA hasn't said much so
far.

25:20.352 --> 25:25.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do we know about the
authenticity of
the documents and where they
came from?

25:25.057 --> 25:29.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK MAZZETTI, The New York
Times: Well, we're
still trying to confirm the
authenticity.

25:29.361 --> 25:34.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have several people we have
spoken to today
who say they believe they're
authentic.

25:34.066 --> 25:39.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have heard nothing thus far
from the government
indicating that they are not.

25:39.838 --> 25:44.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some people we have spoken to
have said that
some of the code names that were
cited in

25:44.209 --> 25:46.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the documents are, indeed,
legitimate.

25:46.945 --> 25:52.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it does appear at the moment
-- and I should
say at the moment -- that they
are legitimate.

25:52.117 --> 25:57.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, when you
look at the
totality, Mark, of all of these
cyber-tools

25:57.389 --> 26:01.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that being described, help us
understand,
what are they aimed at?

26:01.727 --> 26:03.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is this program about?

26:03.529 --> 26:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK MAZZETTI: Well, they're a
series of -- and
we're talking about thousands of
documents

26:08.167 --> 26:15.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are laying out some of the
tools the
CIA allegedly has to carry out
hacking of

26:15.073 --> 26:24.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any number of different devices,
as you said,
cars, against foreign
adversaries or people

26:24.750 --> 26:26.485 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
overseas.

26:26.518 --> 26:33.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I should stress that there is --
unlike the
Snowden disclosures, there were
not specific

26:33.659 --> 26:36.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mentions of where these have
been used.

26:36.495 --> 26:39.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they're more sort of like
the toolkit
the CIA has.

26:39.898 --> 26:44.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's pretty expansive, if
the documents
are to be believed.

26:44.970 --> 26:47.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in terms of where they came
from, you
asked.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, that's another thing
we're still trying
to figure out.

26:50.476 --> 26:56.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WikiLeaks said today that they
had a source
come to them who was concerned
about the use

26:56.815 --> 26:58.884 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of these tools.

26:58.917 --> 27:01.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't know anything about the
source.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's a lot of questions
still at the
moment.

27:03.322 --> 27:09.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: WikiLeaks said
that it had
redacted some names and some
information in

27:09.394 --> 27:10.462 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
its release.

27:10.496 --> 27:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But how potentially damaging is
this to the
CIA?

27:14.199 --> 27:23.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK MAZZETTI: Well, again, if
they're confirmed
to be true, any revelations
about actual capabilities

27:23.308 --> 27:29.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the CIA or any other
intelligence agency
has would limit the ability of
the agency

27:29.815 --> 27:33.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to continue to do those
activities.

27:33.285 --> 27:38.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You saw that to a degree with
Snowden and
others.

27:38.223 --> 27:44.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that is where the concern
is, that
you will have a lot of -- these
tools may

27:44.096 --> 27:46.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not be used because they're now
revealed.

27:46.865 --> 27:52.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, again, we have to -- we
still have to
report out exactly, you know,
what has been

27:52.538 --> 27:57.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
used and, to a large extent, how
much of this
is actual truth.

27:57.709 --> 27:59.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, and I
realize so much
of that is going on.

27:59.778 --> 28:05.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mentioned one particular
program, which
is the Weeping Angel, using
Samsung smart

28:05.083 --> 28:08.754 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
televisions as covert listening
devices.

28:08.787 --> 28:12.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that's one concrete example
that's come
out today.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK MAZZETTI: Yes.

28:14.326 --> 28:19.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the -- in a nutshell, the
idea was that
the Samsung smart TVs have a
feature that

28:19.865 --> 28:26.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allowed access to the Internet,
and by having
this -- you're basically turning
this smart

28:26.505 --> 28:28.140 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
feature on.

28:28.173 --> 28:33.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The CIA is turning it into a
microphone and
allowing eavesdropping in a
home.

28:33.612 --> 28:40.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And another thing you cited was
questions
about the ability of the
agency's hackers

28:40.385 --> 28:47.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to sort of sort of bypass
traditional encryption
and very popular encryption
software like

28:47.459 --> 28:49.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Signal or WhatsApp.

28:49.461 --> 28:53.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The idea is not that the
programs themselves
are hacked or compromised.

28:53.565 --> 28:58.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's that, if you're in the
phone, if the
CIA were to be in the phone,
they would be

28:58.203 --> 29:02.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
able to get the data before it
was then encrypted
by these applications.

29:02.641 --> 29:06.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And just, Mark,
in 10 seconds,
in a word here, so much of the
attention has

29:06.345 --> 29:09.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been on the NSA programs in the
past.

29:09.214 --> 29:14.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it a surprise to learn that
the CIA may
have its own program?

29:14.419 --> 29:18.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK MAZZETTI: Well, it's pretty
well known
that the CIA has been building
up this capability

29:18.690 --> 29:24.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and are determined to because
they see computer
hacking and computer
cyber-warfare as the

29:24.730 --> 29:25.697 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
future.

29:25.731 --> 29:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, they are very much in that
game.

29:27.499 --> 29:29.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Mark
Mazzetti of
The New York Times, thank you
very much.

29:29.468 --> 29:34.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK MAZZETTI: Thank you.

29:34.306 --> 29:47.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How child care
for the U.S.
military families came to be
among the best

29:47.285 --> 29:48.453 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the country.

29:48.487 --> 29:51.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It now serves an estimated
200,000 children.

29:51.990 --> 29:56.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The average service member
spends about 9
percent of their income on child
care.

29:56.995 --> 30:00.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The average civilian spends 25
percent.

30:00.098 --> 30:05.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Kavitha
Cardoza with
our partner Education Week
traveled to North

30:05.737 --> 30:16.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Carolina to see what the
civilian sector can
learn for our weekly series
Making the Grade.

30:16.181 --> 30:20.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Discipline,
strength, endurance,
traits that define the Marine
Corps.

30:20.419 --> 30:22.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're also known for babies?

MARLA TALLEY, Child Care Worker:
Marines do
two things really, really,
really well.

30:28.927 --> 30:31.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They shoot their guns, and they
make a lot
of babies.

KAVITHA CARDOZA: At Camp
Lejeune, North Carolina,
Marla Talley oversees the child
care centers.

30:38.136 --> 30:43.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARLA TALLEY: We usually see a
great increase
in our request for infant care
nine months

30:43.642 --> 30:46.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after a unit comes back from a
deployment.

30:46.111 --> 30:50.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Camp Lejeune is
one of the
country's largest Marine Corps
installations,

30:50.449 --> 30:53.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
seven times the size of
Manhattan.

30:53.785 --> 30:59.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The child development centers,
or CDCs, can
accommodate 1,800 children under
the age of

30:59.558 --> 31:00.525 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

MICHAEL SCALISE, U.S. Marine
Corps: Everything
that we do as Marines is linked
with readiness.

31:04.096 --> 31:05.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CDCS are a part of that.

31:05.897 --> 31:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Colonel Michael
Scalise is
deputy commander.

COL.

31:10.435 --> 31:14.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL SCALISE: When you think
in terms of
a Marine that is focused, he's
focused on

31:14.706 --> 31:17.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
training, he's focused on
deploying.

31:17.809 --> 31:21.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anything that he has to worry
about, from
his family's standpoint, whether
that's his

31:21.313 --> 31:26.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children or his spouse, or her
children or
spouse, deviate from that
Marine's ability

31:26.885 --> 31:27.853 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to focus.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.688 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STAFF SGT.

31:29.721 --> 31:30.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN HARGROVE, U.S. Marine
Corps: I start
my day at 05:45 at the barracks,
which means

31:30.989 --> 31:33.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have to drop Annabelle off at
day care no
later than 5:30.

31:33.258 --> 31:36.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Staff Sergeant
Kathleen Hargrove
is a single mother.

31:36.828 --> 31:38.363 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STAFF SGT.

31:38.396 --> 31:39.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN HARGROVE: I can't
really use excuses
to be late in the Marine Corps.

31:39.998 --> 31:43.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's not an acceptable answer.

31:43.068 --> 31:45.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They expect you to be there when
you're told
to be.

31:45.537 --> 31:49.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Across all
branches of service,
members of the U.S. military
have about two

31:50.008 --> 31:54.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
million children, more than 40
percent of
them under the age of 5.

31:54.880 --> 31:58.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But child care in the military
hasn't always
been this good.

31:58.617 --> 32:02.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBORAH PHILLIPS, Georgetown
University: In
the '70s, the military child
care system was

32:02.154 --> 32:05.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
really a system in crisis.

32:05.157 --> 32:10.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were very few inspections
done of the
program, so even basic safety
and health wasn't

32:10.662 --> 32:12.430 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
protected.

32:12.464 --> 32:15.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Deborah
Phillips is a professor
of psychology at Georgetown
University.

32:15.534 --> 32:20.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBORAH PHILLIPS: The child care
teachers
in the military, child care
centers were paid

32:20.105 --> 32:23.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on a par with the garbage
collectors in the
military system.

32:23.909 --> 32:28.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: The dismal
state of child
care led to congressional
hearings, and eventually

32:28.647 --> 32:32.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the child care budget increased
62 percent.

32:32.851 --> 32:37.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Barbara Thompson recently
retired from the
Pentagon as director of military
family readiness.

32:37.389 --> 32:40.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARBARA THOMPSON, Retired
Pentagon Director
of Military Family Readiness:
That was earth-shattering,

32:40.392 --> 32:43.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would say, for those of us in
the military
child development system.

32:43.361 --> 32:47.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It gave us the opportunity to
hire training
and curriculum specialists.

32:47.365 --> 32:53.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It provided federal dollars, so
that the cost
of care would be subsidized by
the federal

32:53.605 --> 32:55.373 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government.

32:55.407 --> 32:57.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBORAH PHILLIPS: People have
referred to
what happened with military
child care as

32:57.976 --> 33:04.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Cinderella story, because you
had this system
going from a system in crisis to
a model for

33:04.449 --> 33:06.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the nation in under five years.

33:06.551 --> 33:10.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Federal
subsidies meant more
teachers were hired, they were
more qualified,

33:10.455 --> 33:12.657 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and they were paid better.

33:12.691 --> 33:18.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's no surprise, then, 97
percent of military
centers are independently
certified as high-quality,

33:18.463 --> 33:23.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
compared to less than 10 percent
of civilian
centers.

33:23.268 --> 33:25.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: This is a loft.

33:25.237 --> 33:27.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I absolutely love these.

33:27.072 --> 33:31.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Unlike many
civilian centers,
where the focus is primarily on
health and

33:31.543 --> 33:34.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
safety, the military goes one
step further.

33:34.546 --> 33:36.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARLA TALLEY: We're in the
business of building
brains.

33:36.381 --> 33:40.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It looks like the children are
doing nothing
but playing, and that couldn't
be further

33:40.318 --> 33:42.087 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from the truth.

33:42.120 --> 33:46.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the activities that they
have are all
designed to promote some portion
of that child's

33:46.925 --> 33:48.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
growth and development.

33:48.126 --> 33:50.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Even infants
have lesson
plans.

33:50.795 --> 33:51.763 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: You want some bubbles?

33:51.796 --> 33:53.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We like to watch the bubbles.

33:53.598 --> 33:58.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It helps us work on our focusing
and tracking
skills and learning that things
are here one

33:58.703 --> 34:00.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
moment and they're gone the
next.

34:00.238 --> 34:04.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Educators use
every chance
to teach, even during mealtimes.

34:04.609 --> 34:06.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: By pouring, that's
measuring.

34:06.278 --> 34:07.879 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're learning how much milk.

34:07.913 --> 34:10.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sometimes, they will say it's
full or it's
half.

34:10.448 --> 34:12.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, they're learning math.

34:12.384 --> 34:15.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Because
teachers are paid
about a third more than their
civilian counterparts,

34:15.587 --> 34:17.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there's very little turnover.

34:17.989 --> 34:20.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The military pays for all their
training.

34:20.592 --> 34:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This child care system also
focuses on the
unique needs of military
children.

34:29.134 --> 34:32.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is an age where children
are forming
and solidifying parental
attachments.

34:33.004 --> 34:38.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when a mother or father
leaves for extended
periods of time, it can be very
upsetting.

34:38.910 --> 34:44.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
META JACKSON, Teacher: This is
when mommies
and daddies may leave and go
far, far away.

34:44.416 --> 34:48.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Most children
here have had
parents who've deployed more
than once.

34:48.453 --> 34:51.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
META JACKSON: Now, when your
mommies and daddies
go away, are you sad?

34:51.589 --> 34:56.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of kids will come back and
say: Dad
don't want to talk.

34:56.528 --> 34:58.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Dad is not home yet.

34:58.663 --> 35:01.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Each classroom
has a safe
space.

35:01.333 --> 35:06.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And teachers help children
identify emotions,
breathing techniques, and how to
ask for help.

35:07.005 --> 35:13.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARLA TALLEY: For a lot of young
children,
the child care facility that
they go to, especially

35:13.244 --> 35:18.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here, becomes the one stable
thing in their
life during that period of time.

35:18.616 --> 35:23.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They can come in here, and they
can forget
that mom or dad has deployed or
that things

35:23.388 --> 35:27.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are a little topsy-turvy at
home, because,
when I come here, my same
friends are going

35:27.993 --> 35:31.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be here, my teachers are
going to be here,
I have a routine.

35:31.763 --> 35:35.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's really crucial, then,
because those
children can then take that
security back

35:35.867 --> 35:38.403 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
home with them.

35:38.436 --> 35:43.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Gunnery
Sergeant Craig Skinner
and Master Sergeant Bergen
Skinner, who have

35:43.808 --> 35:48.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
three children in this child
care center,
say they see evidence every day
that their

35:48.713 --> 35:49.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
children are learning.

35:49.714 --> 35:51.449 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GUNNERY SGT.

35:51.483 --> 35:53.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRAIG SKINNER, U.S. Marine
Corps: About a
week ago, Preston came in, and
he actually

35:53.485 --> 35:54.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just wrote his name down.

35:54.719 --> 35:56.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were doing something and he
started spelling
his name.

35:56.921 --> 35:58.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're like, OK, so you
actually know how
to do this.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.592 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MASTER SGT.

36:00.625 --> 36:02.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BERGEN SKINNER, U.S. Marine
Corps: They actually
helped potty train my children.

36:02.427 --> 36:06.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: These Marines
say child care
centers give them the assurance
that their

36:06.631 --> 36:13.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children are safe and loved, an
assurance
most civilian parents have a
harder time finding.

36:13.038 --> 36:14.039 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MASTER SGT.

36:14.072 --> 36:15.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BERGEN SKINNER: We both work
really long hours.

36:15.840 --> 36:19.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I can't explain the feeling
that I get
when I go pick up my children
and they run

36:19.611 --> 36:22.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to me because they're happy
because they had
such a great day.

36:22.680 --> 36:23.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They love being there.

36:23.948 --> 36:26.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: There's only four targets
out here, four
individuals.

36:26.384 --> 36:27.352 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Make sense?

36:27.385 --> 36:29.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Yes, Sergeant.

36:29.220 --> 36:33.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: For Marines and
other service
members, this peace of mind
means more than

36:33.158 --> 36:35.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
being just a satisfied parent.

36:35.760 --> 36:40.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It means they can concentrate on
their mission
wherever it may take them.

I'm Kavitha Cardoza of Education

JUDY WOODRUFF: Now a look at the
intersection
between fiction and reality.

37:00.385 --> 37:05.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As investigations continue into
Russia's role
in last year's election, the
highly acclaimed

37:05.356 --> 37:10.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TV series "The Americans" has
been giving
an intimate fictional look at
the old Cold

37:10.862 --> 37:16.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
War and the lives of two Russian
spies working
undercover in the U.S.

The show's fifth season gets
under way tonight
on the FX Channel.

William Brangham recently went
visited the

KERI RUSSELL, Actress: We're
going to watch
the Olympics.

37:25.243 --> 37:26.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Want to watch with us?

37:26.678 --> 37:28.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ACTRESS: No thanks.

37:28.513 --> 37:32.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: On the
surface, they appear
to be a typical American family
from the 1980s,

37:33.017 --> 37:36.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mom and dad raising two kids in
a house in
the suburbs.

37:36.187 --> 37:40.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But Elizabeth and Philip
Jennings are anything
but typical.

37:40.358 --> 37:47.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're undercover KGB agents,
living in secret
in America, gathering
intelligence for the

37:47.599 --> 37:50.301 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Soviet Union.

37:50.335 --> 37:53.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're the central characters
in the FX series
"The Americans."

37:53.638 --> 37:59.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Set at the tail end of the Cold
War, Ronald
Reagan is president, the Soviet
Union is still

37:59.110 --> 38:01.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
intact, and nuclear tensions are
at a peak.

38:01.913 --> 38:07.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KERI RUSSELL: How does it feel
to be alive,
but know that you're going to
die?

38:07.585 --> 38:12.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As Soviet
spies, the Jennings
do whatever it takes, lie.

38:12.123 --> 38:17.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW RHYS, Actor: I can't see
a thing without
them, and I need to see you.

38:17.562 --> 38:23.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Seduce, or
dispatch anyone
that stands in their way.

38:23.868 --> 38:26.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE WEISBERG, Creator, "The
Americans": They're
working to undermine America, to
fight against

38:26.905 --> 38:31.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ronald Reagan, to promote the
Soviet cause
and defend the motherland.

38:31.843 --> 38:35.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: "The
Americans" is the brainchild
of former CIA officer Joe
Weisberg, who spent

38:35.947 --> 38:38.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years working as a Russia
expert.

38:38.416 --> 38:43.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He teamed up with longtime TV
producer Joel
Fields to create the series,
which is loosely

38:43.488 --> 38:49.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
based around the true story of a
set of Russian
spies caught operating in the
U.S. in 2010,

38:49.494 --> 38:51.296 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and deported.

38:51.329 --> 38:57.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE WEISBERG: It's about trying
to live and
work and prosper while working
deep undercover,

38:57.769 --> 39:02.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
while lying to your family, and
what that's
like, the strains that that puts
on a marriage.

39:02.307 --> 39:04.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's very much a show about a
marriage.

39:04.242 --> 39:08.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The strains it puts on a family,
because it's
very much about lying to your
kids, and what

39:08.546 --> 39:10.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that does to you as spies.

39:10.181 --> 39:13.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KERI RUSSELL: Most of what you
have heard
about the Soviet Union isn't
true.

39:13.251 --> 39:17.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE WEISBERG: It tries to say to
the audience,
look at these people who we
think of as the

39:17.889 --> 39:18.856 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
enemy, right?

39:18.890 --> 39:19.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're KGB spies.

39:19.891 --> 39:21.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was nobody we hated worse
than the KGB.

39:21.392 --> 39:24.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those were the worst of the
worst, the most
evil people you could find.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're trying to take those
people and
say, well, is that all they
were?

39:26.965 --> 39:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Or can we actually relate to
them?

39:28.600 --> 39:32.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KERI RUSSELL: Well, what we do
isn't so different
from what you do.

39:32.537 --> 39:36.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOEL FIELDS, Executive Producer,
"The Americans":
It's also a show about how we're
all spies

39:36.841 --> 39:40.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in our own lives, how we all
can't really
know the other people in our
lives, and have

39:41.012 --> 39:44.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to trust what we see and what we
experience
with other people.

39:44.148 --> 39:48.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The struggle
of living dual
lives is a recurrent theme in
the series,

39:48.519 --> 39:51.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one beautifully portrayed by
actors Keri Russell
and Matthew Rhys.

39:52.023 --> 39:54.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW RHYS: Don't you enjoy
any of this
sometimes?

39:54.425 --> 39:55.860 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
This house?

39:55.893 --> 39:57.328 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
The clothes?

39:57.362 --> 40:00.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
All these beautiful shoes?

40:00.265 --> 40:05.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Like here,
when the comforts
of capitalism test their
communist beliefs.

40:05.570 --> 40:08.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW RHYS: It doesn't make
you bad at what
you do.

40:08.873 --> 40:10.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It just makes you a human being.

40:10.275 --> 40:14.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KERI RUSSELL: We have to live
this way for
our job, for our cover.

40:14.312 --> 40:18.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOE WEISBERG: Philip and
Elizabeth Jennings
have both been in America for
almost 20 years.

40:18.650 --> 40:25.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Philip, over that time, had
become somewhat
Americanized and gone --
although he's still

40:25.123 --> 40:29.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
faithful to the Soviet Union and
faithful
to the motherland, he had become
very attracted

40:29.961 --> 40:30.928 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to America.

40:30.962 --> 40:33.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He had gone a little bit soft in
that regard.

40:33.231 --> 40:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His wife wasn't like that at
all.

40:35.933 --> 40:41.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was 100 percent completely
committed to
communism and to the way things
were, and

40:41.139 --> 40:44.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to fighting for that cause, no
matter what.

40:44.175 --> 40:45.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And she was really more
political than he
was.

40:46.010 --> 40:49.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: One of the
things that's
obviously the key for both of
you is to create

40:49.714 --> 40:53.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
characters that we want to keep
coming back
to and see every day.

40:53.051 --> 41:00.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you also have them do awful,
awful things,
oftentimes to innocent people,
kill them,

41:00.425 --> 41:02.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
treat them terribly.

41:02.226 --> 41:07.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Have you ever felt a tension,
thinking, we
can't have them go this far
because it will

41:07.532 --> 41:09.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
turn the audience off?

41:09.200 --> 41:12.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOEL FIELDS: Well, first season,
we asked
that question really overtly to
ourselves

41:12.637 --> 41:14.539 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as writers.

41:14.572 --> 41:19.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we can take all of those
moral hypotheticals
and just create the dramas for
the characters.

41:19.577 --> 41:28.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Would you poison a child in
order to save
your country, if you felt that
you could and

41:28.186 --> 41:33.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that tens of thousands, hundreds
of thousands,
millions of people could live in
peace if

41:33.925 --> 41:35.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you paid this -- if somebody
made that sacrifice?

41:35.993 --> 41:40.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE WEISBERG: Well, a lot of the
drama of
this show has been about
watching Philip's

41:40.098 --> 41:44.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
answers to those questions
change, while Elizabeth's
have remained the same.

41:44.669 --> 41:49.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Since the show
began filming,
Rhys and Russell have become a
couple in real

41:50.007 --> 41:51.843 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
life as well.

41:51.876 --> 41:56.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russell's worked in both films
and TV, first
achieving fame as the lead in
the TV series

41:56.347 --> 41:57.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"Felicity" in the late '90s.

41:57.815 --> 42:02.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rhys is a Welsh actor, having
also spent a
career in TV and movies.

42:02.887 --> 42:07.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We talked at the premiere for
the new season
of "The Americans," and I asked
how they humanize

42:07.725 --> 42:12.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
characters who are forced to do
such terrible
things.

42:12.163 --> 42:13.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You want us to love you.

42:14.031 --> 42:17.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You want us to come back and see
you every
week and to portray yourselves
as decent people,

42:17.435 --> 42:20.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and yet we also have to see you
do these awful
things.

42:20.571 --> 42:23.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is it difficult to manage that
balance?

42:23.408 --> 42:29.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW RHYS: Yes, I think
landing the -- the
show in a place that's credible
has always

42:29.080 --> 42:35.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been the challenge of it, for
the exact reasons
you say.

42:35.186 --> 42:38.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's what I have always
slightly struggled
with, is that, you know, we kill
people and

42:38.689 --> 42:40.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then we make, you know, the
school lunch and
the school run.

42:40.525 --> 42:42.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KERI RUSSELL: I think, at its
core, it really
is a relationship and family
drama, and the

42:42.760 --> 42:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spy stuff makes it a television
show.

42:49.634 --> 42:53.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: With new
tensions between
Russia and the U.S. triggering
what many are

42:53.337 --> 42:59.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
calling a second Cold War, the
creators defend
their nuanced portrayal of
Russian espionage.

42:59.944 --> 43:05.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What has it been like to watch
tensions between
the U.S. and Russia suddenly
surge back to

43:05.650 --> 43:08.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the fore, when you have got this
show under
way?

43:08.219 --> 43:13.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOE WEISBERG: It's been
disheartening, upsetting,
shocking.

43:13.391 --> 43:17.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't have any good words to
describe it.

43:17.428 --> 43:19.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I can't think of one good thing
about it.

43:19.497 --> 43:24.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, as we talked about
endlessly at
the beginning, telling a show
where you try

43:24.402 --> 43:31.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to humanize the enemy and say
they're just
like us in so many ways is easy
to do at a

43:31.542 --> 43:33.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time when the enemy is no longer
considered
the enemy.

43:33.811 --> 43:35.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That's a very fruitful
environment to do that
in.

43:35.580 --> 43:38.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Soviet
Union is this
distant thing that we know of,
the Reagan

43:38.883 --> 43:39.851 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
era.

43:39.884 --> 43:40.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOE WEISBERG: Yes.

43:40.885 --> 43:42.687 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's -- that's all over.

43:42.720 --> 43:46.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOEL FIELDS: I actually think --
I can't believe
I'm going to say this -- what
better time

43:46.190 --> 43:51.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to humanize Russian espionage
than the time
that we're the victims of it?

43:51.329 --> 43:55.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, that's the time when
you're most
inclined to dehumanize.

43:55.900 --> 44:01.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And also, for me, one of the
most dangerous
things we can do when under
attack is to dehumanize

44:01.739 --> 44:02.940 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the enemy.

44:02.974 --> 44:04.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOE WEISBERG: Because, as Joel
said, they're
soldiers.

44:04.275 --> 44:05.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Soldiers do horrible things.

44:05.743 --> 44:06.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They kill people.

44:06.744 --> 44:08.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They blow people up.

44:08.513 --> 44:11.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How they deal with it and what
happens in
their own conscience is what was
interesting

44:11.315 --> 44:12.950 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to us.

44:12.984 --> 44:14.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's what we have really
continued to
explore throughout the whole
series.

44:14.519 --> 44:17.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And that
series continues.

44:17.154 --> 44:20.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Season five of "The Americans"
begins tonight
on the FX Channel.

44:20.558 --> 44:27.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham
in New York.

44:27.498 --> 44:39.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will be
back shortly
with a look at a man who lived
inside a boulder

44:39.377 --> 44:40.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the sake of art.

44:40.711 --> 44:44.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, take a moment to
hear from your
local PBS station.

44:44.215 --> 44:54.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a chance to offer your
support, which
helps keep programs like ours on

44:54.258 --> 45:08.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a chance to offer your
support, which
helps keep programs like ours on

45:08.205 --> 45:09.173 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the air.

45:09.206 --> 45:10.174 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

45:10.207 --> 45:20.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to
our "NewsHour" Shares.

45:20.051 --> 45:28.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
French artist Abraham Poincheval
makes a living
by performing unexpected feats
of endurance

45:28.559 --> 45:29.527 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and isolation.

45:29.560 --> 45:32.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His latest work, stone, was no
different.

45:32.363 --> 45:36.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s Julia Griffin
explains.

45:36.634 --> 45:42.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: For an entire
week, Abraham
Poincheval was quite literally
stuck between

45:42.807 --> 45:44.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a rock and a hard place.

45:44.842 --> 45:50.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In his latest solo act, the
performance artist
stepped inside a body-shaped
nook carved into

45:50.314 --> 45:53.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two halves of a giant limestone
rock, and
sealed himself in.

45:53.351 --> 46:03.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The goal, he said beforehand,
was to become
the beating heart of a massive
boulder.

46:03.961 --> 46:10.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABRAHAM POINCHEVAL, Performance
Artist (through
translator): The purpose is to
feel the aging

46:10.735 --> 46:12.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
stone inside the rock.

46:12.236 --> 46:23.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is that flow, that coming
and going
between myself and the stone.

46:23.280 --> 46:29.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: To survive his
confinement,
Poincheval lived off water,
dried meats and

46:29.320 --> 46:31.155 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cartons of soup.

46:31.188 --> 46:43.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His rock was outfitted with air
holes, a heart
rate monitor and, in case you
are wondering,

46:43.834 --> 46:46.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a small amount of storage for
bathroom waste.

46:46.637 --> 46:54.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For seven days, spectators
viewed Poincheval
on a TV monitor, and responded
with mixed

46:54.211 --> 46:55.813 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
reactions.

46:55.846 --> 47:01.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAYLIS BOXBERGER, Spectator
(through translator):
It is rather extraordinary.

47:01.552 --> 47:12.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are asking ourselves, what
will he do for
a week?

47:12.863 --> 47:14.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How will he live?

47:14.632 --> 47:19.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANCINE NICOLAS, Spectator
(through translator):
It is a happening.

47:19.270 --> 47:28.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is how I see it.

47:29.013 --> 47:31.415 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is no art present there.

47:31.449 --> 47:37.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: His captivity
complete, the
artist emerged dazed, but happy.

47:37.488 --> 47:42.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a quick medical check later,
he reflected
on his entombment.

47:42.059 --> 47:51.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAYLIS BOXBERGER (through
translator): I thank
the stone very much for having
been so enthusiastic

47:51.202 --> 48:05.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about welcoming, and I think
that it took
great care of me.

48:05.116 --> 48:11.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are very big moments of
loss of oneself,
where suddenly it is, bam, and
you no longer

48:11.889 --> 48:15.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are very big moments of
loss of oneself,
where suddenly it is, bam, and
you no longer

48:44.522 --> 48:57.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know where you are, but you are
there.

48:57.868 --> 49:01.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what is great.

49:01.505 --> 49:08.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: In his next
artistic endeavor,
Poincheval plans to sit on a
dozen eggs

JULIA GRIFFIN: In his next
artistic endeavor,
Poincheval plans to sit on a
dozen eggs

50:45.276 --> 50:55.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for 20 days to see if they
hatch.

50:55.319 --> 51:04.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for 20 days to see if they
hatch.

51:04.929 --> 51:10.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
For

51:10.100 --> 51:14.939 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
For

51:31.822 --> 51:37.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the "PBS NewsHour," I'm

51:37.294 --> 51:41.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

Julia Griffin.

52:29.313 --> 52:34.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we

52:34.785 --> 52:39.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we

53:54.231 --> 53:55.265 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
will cover that.

53:55.299 --> 53:56.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:56.600 --> 53:57.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:57.768 --> 54:00.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening.

54:00.070 --> 54:06.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We will see you soon.

54:06.143 --> 54:10.981 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Thanks.
