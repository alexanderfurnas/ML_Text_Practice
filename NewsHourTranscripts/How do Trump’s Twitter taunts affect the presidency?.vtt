JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump's
use of Twitter has often brought
praise from supporters for

00:05.533 --> 00:08.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reaching out directly
to the American people.

00:08.266 --> 00:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Mr. Trump has also
managed to spark controversy
in 140 characters,
and, today, his tweets

00:14.433 --> 00:17.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
prompted some of the
harshest criticism yet.

00:17.566 --> 00:19.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Our John Yang has more.

00:19.166 --> 00:22.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MIKA BRZEZINSKI,
Co-Host, "Morning Joe":
President Donald Trump.

00:22.166 --> 00:27.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: As Mika Brzezinski
wrapped up her MSNBC show this
morning, President Trump had

00:28.600 --> 00:31.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a few choice words for her
and co-host Joe Scarborough.

00:31.466 --> 00:36.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump said the hosts, whom
he called "low I.Q. Crazy Mika
and Psycho Joe," were speaking

00:38.500 --> 00:43.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
badly of him, even though
they insisted on joining
him at Mar-a-Lago.

00:43.466 --> 00:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump adding that, at the
time, Brzezinski was "bleeding
badly from a face-lift."

00:48.300 --> 00:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Within minutes, Brzezinski
responded, resurrecting
the little hands insult
that had been directed

00:53.200 --> 00:57.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at him during the 2016
presidential primaries.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump's words ignited
a firestorm, even from
his Republican allies.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:03.666 --> 01:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM (R),
South Carolina: I thought
it was inappropriate,
beneath the office,

01:04.333 --> 01:06.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and not helpful.

01:06.233 --> 01:07.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:07.733 --> 01:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ORRIN HATCH (R), Utah: I wish,
I wish he hadn't made the tweet.

01:08.266 --> 01:10.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:10.366 --> 01:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of
the House: I don't see that
as an appropriate comment.

01:12.400 --> 01:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, look, what we're trying
to do around here is improve
tone, the civility of debates.

01:15.866 --> 01:17.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And this obviously
doesn't help do that.

01:17.933 --> 01:22.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: Did you see the
president's tweets about
Mika Brzezinski this morning?

01:24.100 --> 01:24.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do you have any
reaction to that?

01:24.633 --> 01:26.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:26.133 --> 01:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO (R),
West Virginia: Distasteful.

01:27.066 --> 01:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And from Democrats.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:29.566 --> 01:31.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRENDA LAWRENCE (D),
Michigan: This is not
acceptable, Mr. President.

01:31.600 --> 01:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Principal Deputy
White House Press Sarah Huckabee
Sanders insisted the president

01:33.133 --> 01:35.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was just defending himself.

01:35.166 --> 01:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, Deputy
White House Press Secretary:
I don't think that it's a

01:36.666 --> 01:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
surprise to anybody that
he fights fire with fire.

01:39.266 --> 01:43.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he's not going to sit back
and be attacked by the liberal
media, Hollywood elites, and

01:43.633 --> 01:46.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
when they hit him,
he's going to hit back.

01:46.233 --> 01:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It recalled
Mr. Trump's past comments
about women, in 2015,
talking about journalist

01:52.166 --> 01:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Megyn Kelly, then of FOX
News, after she moderated
the first Republican debate.

01:56.233 --> 01:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: She gets out
and she starts asking me all

01:59.433 --> 02:03.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sorts of ridiculous questions,
and, you know, you could see
there was blood coming out of

02:03.066 --> 02:07.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
her eyes, blood coming
out of her whatever.

02:07.200 --> 02:10.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But she was -- in my
opinion, she was off-base.

02:10.966 --> 02:15.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: "Rolling
Stone" quoted him saying
of rival candidate
Carly Fiorina: "Look at

02:17.600 --> 02:18.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that face.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Would anyone vote for that?"

02:20.866 --> 02:22.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And there was the 2005
"Access Hollywood" tape.

02:22.566 --> 02:24.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: I just
start kissing them.

02:24.566 --> 02:26.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's like a magnet, kiss, kiss.

02:26.266 --> 02:27.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't even wait.

02:27.466 --> 02:30.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And when you're a star,
they let you do it.

02:30.266 --> 02:31.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You can do anything.

02:31.466 --> 02:33.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Grab them by the
(EXPLETIVE DELETED).

02:33.433 --> 02:35.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You can do anything.

02:35.533 --> 02:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Name-calling was a
staple of Mr. Trump's campaign.

02:39.566 --> 02:41.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: Lyin'
Ted Cruz came today.

02:41.800 --> 02:43.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I watched little Marco.

02:43.500 --> 02:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I would say the co-founder would
be crooked Hillary Clinton.

02:50.500 --> 02:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And it continued
today, as the president of
the United States taunted two

02:53.600 --> 02:55.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cable television hosts.

02:55.466 --> 02:57.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm John Yang.

02:57.966 --> 03:02.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For more now on
the president's comments today
and earlier and the implications

03:04.400 --> 03:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of what he says publicly,
we turn to Matthew Dowd.

03:06.400 --> 03:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's the former chief strategist
for President George W. Bush
in 2004 and author of "A New

03:12.366 --> 03:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Way: Embracing the Paradox
as We Lead and Serve."

03:15.800 --> 03:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Beverly Gage, she's
professor of American
history at Yale University.

03:20.133 --> 03:22.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you
back to the "NewsHour."

03:22.966 --> 03:25.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Matt Dowd, I'm going
to start with you.

03:25.300 --> 03:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know we have seen
politicians get into some
tough language over the years.

03:32.233 --> 03:35.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How does what we heard from
President Trump today on
Twitter fit into all of that?

03:35.166 --> 03:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW DOWD, Former Bush
Campaign Strategist: Well, we
have come a long way from when I

03:38.933 --> 03:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
worked for George W. Bush in
2000, when he pledged to bring
honor and dignity back to

03:42.800 --> 03:46.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Oval Office and won as that
as being part of his platform.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Judy, I think this
is a bigger problem.

03:48.233 --> 03:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, as you know, in this
democracy, in order to have
a healthy democracy, we have

03:51.833 --> 03:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to get to the common good.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the only way to get to
the common good is if we have
a common set of facts, which

03:56.966 --> 04:00.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
we don't seem to have
today, and we have a
common level of decency.

04:00.266 --> 04:04.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And my problem with the
president and what happened
today and why I think it affects

04:04.166 --> 04:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the country as a whole
is, first, we bring up
our kids better than this.

04:07.466 --> 04:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We teach them not to do this.

04:09.433 --> 04:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We tell them not to do
this, and it is not the
right standard of behavior.

04:11.933 --> 04:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But for a president -- secondly,
but, for a president, he
sets the pattern of behavior

04:15.966 --> 04:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the entire country and what
we can expect for how we each
other act and how we should

04:20.266 --> 04:22.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be in politics.

04:22.333 --> 04:26.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, third, just from
a practical aspect of
it, just totally looking
at it pragmatically,

04:28.300 --> 04:30.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his behavior in this, in the
midst of what he is trying
to do on health care and the

04:30.566 --> 04:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
votes he is trying to get, is
incredibly counterproductive.

04:33.366 --> 04:37.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, from all of those avenues,
one from a history of our
democracy that is dependent

04:37.700 --> 04:41.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on a level of decency
that doesn't seem to
be apparent here, but,
two, just practically,

04:41.766 --> 04:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if he wants to get something
done, this makes it harder.

04:44.333 --> 04:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I
want to ask you about that
latter part in a moment.

04:46.933 --> 04:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, Beverly Gage, how does what
this president is saying when
these kinds of tweets go out,

04:53.866 --> 04:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how does it compare from
what we have heard from
other presidents over time?

04:57.000 --> 05:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEVERLY GAGE, Yale University:
Unfortunately, I don't think
that American presidents have

05:01.100 --> 05:06.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
always lived up to the standard
of decency that we have
tended to expect of them, but

05:08.100 --> 05:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think presidents before Trump,
when those moments happened,
they tended to be the exception,

05:11.866 --> 05:13.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rather than the rule.

05:13.966 --> 05:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there was a famous moment
in 1950 when Harry Truman was
president, and a music critic

05:19.500 --> 05:24.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wrote a very critical piece
about Truman's daughter, who had
just given a singing recital.

05:26.133 --> 05:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Truman fired off this
ferocious letter threatening to
punch the guy out, and telling

05:29.633 --> 05:33.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him that he was a gutter
snipe and an idiot and he was
going to kick him in the nuts.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

05:34.333 --> 05:36.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, it was pretty
aggressive language.

05:36.366 --> 05:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there was a big reaction to
that at the time, a president
kind of attacking a private

05:41.266 --> 05:42.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
citizen.

05:42.533 --> 05:44.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Many people thought
it wasn't dignified.

05:44.633 --> 05:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But nobody would have said
that this is Harry Truman's
mode of being all the time.

05:48.700 --> 05:53.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was seen as a kind
of authentic moment of
outrage, and not a kind
of permanent presidential

05:54.533 --> 05:57.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
style.

05:57.066 --> 05:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Matt
Dowd, is there a level
of dignity that Americans
expect from a president?

05:59.566 --> 06:04.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, is there a defined
or undefined line over which
presidents shouldn't go?

06:07.433 --> 06:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW DOWD: Well, Americans
expect our president to be human
beings, and as imperfect as all

06:13.766 --> 06:15.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of us are.

06:15.033 --> 06:17.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They expect us to make
mistakes and all that.

06:17.033 --> 06:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But one thing the American
public likes is, if you make a
mistake, you do that, you cross

06:20.533 --> 06:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that line that they expect
you to behave under,
then you apologize or
then you correct that

06:25.100 --> 06:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
behavior and said you have
learned, you are going to do
better, you are going to achieve

06:28.233 --> 06:30.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
better, and you are
going to serve a higher
purpose than that.

06:30.800 --> 06:34.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Let's keep in mind that
Donald Trump didn't
win because of himself.

06:34.866 --> 06:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He won in spite of himself.

06:37.400 --> 06:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A quarter of his voters
voted for Donald Trump
believing he wasn't
presidential and he didn't

06:41.400 --> 06:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have the temperament, but they
had hope that he would grow
into the office and become more

06:46.033 --> 06:48.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
presidential.

06:48.100 --> 06:51.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That doesn't seem to have
happened, and I don't think it
will happen for a 71-year-old

06:51.100 --> 06:53.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
man.

06:53.133 --> 06:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Beverly,
you know, apropos of what just
Matt just said and what you said

06:55.133 --> 06:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a moment ago, clearly, there
are moments when presidents
have grown angry, they have been

06:59.166 --> 07:01.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
upset because they
have been criticized.

07:01.633 --> 07:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So is there some kind of
standard, written or otherwise,
for how a president is to speak

07:07.366 --> 07:09.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the American people?

07:09.366 --> 07:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEVERLY GAGE: I don't think
there is a written standard,
but I think up until this moment

07:13.400 --> 07:18.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there have been some
sort of accepted norms
that the president in
particular -- on the

07:19.566 --> 07:21.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
campaign trail, it's
one thing, right?

07:21.633 --> 07:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is a place where people
attack each other when they have
differences of opinion or maybe

07:25.300 --> 07:27.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
even personal attacks
in that venue.

07:27.533 --> 07:29.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is sort of expected.

07:29.100 --> 07:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There, Trump took it to a
new level as well, I think.

07:32.833 --> 07:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when you are the president,
the idea that you cannot rise
to the office, that you would

07:39.800 --> 07:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attack private citizens, I think
that that is something that a
lot of people find troubling

07:43.966 --> 07:45.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and sort of unworthy
of the office.

07:45.933 --> 07:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Matt Dowd,
clearly this was part and parcel
of the president lashing out

07:50.400 --> 07:52.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at the news media.

07:52.866 --> 07:56.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was reacting to, I guess,
some of the conversation
this morning on that
program, on cable news.

07:58.833 --> 08:03.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But what is it that the
president -- in any way
does this further the
agenda of the president?

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You mentioned a minute ago
his health care plan, the fact
that he is trying to get this

08:12.966 --> 08:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
health care plan through the
Senate, through the Congress,
and this takes all the attention

08:16.100 --> 08:18.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
away from that.

08:18.200 --> 08:22.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MATTHEW DOWD: Well, I
think attributing any
every time somebody --
Donald Trump does this,

08:23.900 --> 08:25.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
President Trump does
this, people attribute
some grand strategy.

08:25.833 --> 08:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think what the president
really has is a lack
of impulse control.

08:28.400 --> 08:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has done this throughout,
and it has actually
hurt him in the process.

08:31.533 --> 08:34.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He won the election,
but, as I say, he won
it in spite of himself.

08:34.566 --> 08:39.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Keep in mind, Judy, that there's
votes, three key votes that
are needed in the health care

08:39.066 --> 08:44.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
plan, Shelley Moore Capito, Lisa
Murkowski, and Susan Collins.

08:45.466 --> 08:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he attacks a woman
basically in a sexist way.

08:47.533 --> 08:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can't argue any otherwise
in the midst of this, a woman
who serves as an anchor on

08:51.333 --> 08:52.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a television program.

08:52.900 --> 08:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
None of that is going to be
helpful in getting those votes.

08:55.266 --> 08:57.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, I think it is
counterproductive.

08:57.266 --> 09:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But anybody that goes to Donald
Trump, first of all, nobody
seems like they go to Trump

09:00.466 --> 09:02.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to correct his behavior.

09:02.533 --> 09:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But anyone that goes to Donald
Trump would have to make the
argument, this doesn't help

09:04.533 --> 09:05.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

09:05.700 --> 09:07.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't think
Donald Trump cares.

09:07.766 --> 09:11.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Beverly
Gage, does history
shows that Americans are
forgiving of a president

09:11.133 --> 09:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when they, I don't know,
go off the rails or however
you want to describe this?

09:18.133 --> 09:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEVERLY GAGE: Well, I think
Americans have often warmed
to a kind of pugilistic style.

09:23.366 --> 09:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So Trump is not the first
president to kind of marshal
this hyper-masculinity, right?

09:29.400 --> 09:32.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You think of someone
like Theodore Roosevelt
bringing wrestlers into
the White House, et

09:32.466 --> 09:37.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cetera, or even a figure like
Ronald Reagan, who we tend to
have a much more benign view

09:37.000 --> 09:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of now, but actually
could be quite aggressive
in his rhetoric.

09:40.600 --> 09:45.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think what is different for
Trump is that he is specifically
demeaning women, and he's

09:46.666 --> 09:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
demeaning particular women.

09:48.400 --> 09:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's hard to see how that is
going to be a benefit to him.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the other hand I do think
the record is that often this
has worked as a kind of form

09:56.633 --> 09:58.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of entertainment.

09:58.733 --> 10:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Certainly, it is one of the
things that people liked about
Teddy Roosevelt, this kind of

10:02.600 --> 10:05.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
man who wasn't going
to take it from anyone.

10:05.033 --> 10:07.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

10:07.100 --> 10:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEVERLY GAGE: So, unfortunately,
I don't think it's clear that
this is going to be something

10:12.500 --> 10:14.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that there is a lot
of incentive to stop.

10:14.533 --> 10:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Matt, what does
this mean for the president and
his allies in the Republican

10:17.433 --> 10:19.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Party?

10:19.500 --> 10:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW DOWD: Well, I'm just
going to -- one response is,
is, yes, the president -- yes,

10:23.300 --> 10:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the American public
loves a fighter, but they
want a fighter that is
fighting on their behalf,

10:27.266 --> 10:28.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not on their own behalf.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, he has not
connected the dots.

10:30.233 --> 10:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And these tweets are no
connection, as we talked about.

10:32.966 --> 10:36.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is going to actually make
it worse for him to achieve
any legislative platform, as

10:36.466 --> 10:37.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
opposed to better.

10:37.966 --> 10:40.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is no connection in
fighting on Americans' behalf.

10:40.166 --> 10:44.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think you saw today,
and as your piece laid
out, is Republicans
are upset about this,

10:44.166 --> 10:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have grown weary of
this, they know it has made
it more difficult on them.

10:48.033 --> 10:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, as his numbers, as
his approval numbers continue
to drop -- they're at the

10:51.500 --> 10:55.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lowest level of any president
in his first term or any -- in
any term at this point without

10:55.866 --> 11:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a scandal involved -- I think
it makes it much harder and
it sets up a problem for the

11:01.766 --> 11:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
midterm elections in 2018.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think all of that,
Republicans are nervous about.

11:05.366 --> 11:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But quickly,
Matt, they are still sticking
with him for the most part,

11:08.800 --> 11:09.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
aren't they?

11:09.800 --> 11:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATTHEW DOWD: For the most part.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that is one of the
frustrations by many of us.

11:13.966 --> 11:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think you can say, oh, just
discount his words and all that.

11:16.933 --> 11:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At some point, they are
going to have to hold Donald
Trump's feet to the fire.

11:19.933 --> 11:21.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they can do that.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Senators can do that and
House members can do it.

11:23.300 --> 11:25.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They can basically say,
we are not going to
pass an appointment, we
are not going to pass

11:25.700 --> 11:29.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
legislation until you
correct your behavior.

11:29.200 --> 11:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is no way right
now we know, or there
is no evidence that we
have that they're willing

11:33.533 --> 11:35.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do that.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that is in the end what
they have control over.

11:36.200 --> 11:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you're right.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have not seen that yet.

11:39.366 --> 11:43.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Matthew Dowd, Beverly
Gage, we thank you both.
