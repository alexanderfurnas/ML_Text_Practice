HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.
I'm Hari Sreenivasan. Gwen Ifill
and Judy Woodruff are away.

00:10.110 --> 00:13.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: A
British report points the finger
at Russian President Vladimir

00:13.614 --> 00:18.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Putin for the radioactive
poisoning of a former KGB agent.

00:18.652 --> 00:22.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also ahead: what Republican
presidential candidate Rand Paul
says are the differences between

00:22.356 --> 00:25.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
him and front-runner
Donald Trump.

00:25.492 --> 00:29.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY),
Presidential Candidate: Trump
wants power. And he thinks he's
so smart

00:29.363 --> 00:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he will fix everything in
the country; just give him
power. And I understand the

00:32.266 --> 00:34.701 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
corrupting influence of power.

00:34.701 --> 00:39.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And how a
place can inspire genius in its
people.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICARDO HAUSMANN, Harvard Center
for International Development:
Genius is not really about
individuals.

00:42.910 --> 00:46.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's really about a collective.
It's about a community of
practice.

00:46.313 --> 00:48.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's "PBS
NewsHour."

00:48.982 --> 00:53.987 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:53.987 --> 01:05.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast
braced today for a blizzard that
could affect

01:05.432 --> 01:08.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
50 million people.

01:08.402 --> 01:13.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The storm is set to start
tomorrow afternoon and continue
into Sunday. Forecasts call for

01:13.073 --> 01:16.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up to two feet of snow in the
Washington, D.C., area. That has
sent people rushing to

01:16.743 --> 01:21.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
grocery stores, as road crews
ready their equipment.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And governors in Virginia, North
Carolina and Maryland have
declared emergencies.

01:24.384 --> 01:29.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GOV. LARRY HOGAN (R), Maryland:
Our focus will be on clearing
all of the main state

01:29.489 --> 01:37.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
highways, but a great deal will
also be demanded of local
authorities in the coming days.
They

01:37.230 --> 01:44.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
will almost certainly be
overwhelmed by the amount of
snow and the effects of this
storm.

01:44.538 --> 01:51.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It could take days, or even up
to a week, for them to dig out
all local roads.

01:51.378 --> 01:55.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Even before
the blizzard, the Washington,
D.C., area was crippled
overnight,

01:55.482 --> 01:59.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when a dusting of snow turned to
ice on untreated roads.
Thousands of commuters,
including President

01:59.953 --> 02:04.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Obama's motorcade, were
stuck in long backups.

02:04.524 --> 02:09.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary of State John Kerry
acknowledged today that Iran may
use money from sanctions

02:09.563 --> 02:14.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
relief to support terror. The
country is receiving billions of
dollars in newly unfrozen
assets,

02:14.935 --> 02:19.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in exchange for curbing
its nuclear program.

02:19.139 --> 02:23.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On CNBC today, Kerry said
there's no way to stop funds
flowing to the hard-line Iran
Revolutionary

02:23.310 --> 02:25.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Guard Corps, for example.

02:25.812 --> 02:32.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: I think that some of it
will end up in the hands of

02:32.185 --> 02:38.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the IRGC or other entities, some
of which are labeled terrorists.
To some degree, I'm

02:38.792 --> 02:44.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not going to sit here and tell
you that every component of that
can be prevented. But I

02:44.398 --> 02:51.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can tell you this. Right now, we
are not seeing the early
delivery of funds going to that

02:51.872 --> 02:55.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
kind of endeavor at
this point in time.

02:55.042 --> 02:58.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Kerry was in
Davos, Switzerland, at the World
Economic Summit. He said he
hopes

02:58.745 --> 03:03.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iran will put sanctions money
into rebuilding its economy. But
several Senate Republicans

03:03.650 --> 03:08.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said it was always obvious that
terror groups would benefit.

03:08.055 --> 03:13.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, in Iran, President
Hassan Rouhani appealed for free
and fair elections next

03:13.226 --> 03:17.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
month. Thousands of moderate
candidates, who would support
Rouhani's reform agenda, have

03:17.631 --> 03:23.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
been disqualified by the
Guardian Council, made up of
Islamic clerics and jurists. The

03:23.336 --> 03:27.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
council ruled they were not
loyal enough to the ruling
system.

03:27.774 --> 03:32.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pakistan observed a nationwide
day of mourning today for 21
people killed at a university

03:32.245 --> 03:36.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by Taliban attackers. Students
held a protest and vigil in
Islamabad, urging the government

03:36.783 --> 03:41.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do more to fight extremism.
They carried signs and lit
candles to honor the dead.

03:41.988 --> 03:47.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: The fact that such
incidents continue to happen and
that these terror groups
continue

03:47.727 --> 03:57.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to act with such impunity is
clear evidence of the fact that
this state is willfully being

03:57.204 --> 04:00.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
negligent of its duties.

04:00.207 --> 04:03.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Pakistani army
officials say yesterday's attack
was orchestrated from

04:03.210 --> 04:07.280 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
inside neighboring Afghanistan.

04:07.280 --> 04:13.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Israel confirmed today that it
plans to appropriate 380 acres
of land in the occupied West
Bank.

04:13.353 --> 04:18.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is the largest such action
since 2014, and it's already
being denounced by Palestinian

04:18.291 --> 04:23.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
officials. The tract is located
near Jericho at the northern tip
of the Dead Sea. Israeli

04:23.296 --> 04:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
authorities say the site is
already under Israeli control,
and no Palestinians live

04:26.233 --> 04:28.702 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

04:28.702 --> 04:32.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in this country, the Obama
administration is dialing back
new rules that required visas

04:32.939 --> 04:38.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for European travelers if they
had been to Iran, Iraq, Syria or
Sudan in the last five

04:38.478 --> 04:43.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years. An announcement today
said journalists, aid workers
and others may still be allowed

04:43.583 --> 04:49.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to enter the U.S. without visas.
The new requirements had
prompted objections from
European states.

04:49.489 --> 04:55.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Wall Street, stocks
managed a rebound, as oil prices
surged higher, and the European

04:55.061 --> 04:60.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Central Bank raised hopes for
additional stimulus efforts. The
Dow Jones industrial average

04:60.000 --> 05:06.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gained nearly 116 points to
close at 15882. The Nasdaq rose
a fraction of a point, and

05:06.072 --> 05:10.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the S&amp;P 500 added nine.

05:10.277 --> 05:14.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Could Russian President Vladimir
Putin be on the hook for

05:14.614 --> 05:20.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a poisoning?; presidential
candidate Rand Paul on the race
and the NSA; the first female

05:20.187 --> 05:36.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be hired as a full-time
NFL coach; and much more.

05:36.636 --> 05:41.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The death by poisoning of a
former Russian spy in London was
thrust back into the headlines

05:41.074 --> 05:45.779 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today, as a British inquiry into
his killing released its report.

05:45.779 --> 05:50.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Alexander Litvinenko fled Russia
nearly 20 years ago and accused
the former chief of

05:50.951 --> 05:56.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Russia's spy agency,
now-President Vladimir Putin, of
corruption. In 2006, he met two

05:56.256 --> 06:00.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian spies at a London hotel,
and three weeks later, he was
dead.

06:00.560 --> 06:03.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chris Ship of Independent
Television News begins our
coverage.

06:03.763 --> 06:08.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS SHIP: We were reminded
today that the radioactive
poison inside Alexander
Litvinenko's

06:08.668 --> 06:14.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
body was so strong, he had to be
buried in a lead-lined coffin.
Today, the Russian security

06:14.374 --> 06:19.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
service the FSB was blamed for
his killing. And the orders,
concluded the man who led

06:19.446 --> 06:23.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the inquiry, most likely came
from the top, the very top, he
said.

06:23.783 --> 06:29.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIR ROBERT OWEN, Litvinenko
Inquiry Chairman: The operation
to kill Mr. Litvinenko was
probably

06:29.756 --> 06:40.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
approved by Mr. Patrushev, then
head of the FSB, and also by
President Putin.

06:40.934 --> 06:45.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS SHIP: The FSB agents did
it by pouring a deadly
substance, polonium-210, into
this

06:45.872 --> 06:49.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
teapot from which Mr.
Litvinenko was drinking.

06:49.809 --> 06:54.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was him in a hotel lobby a
few moments before the meeting.
He took just three or

06:54.414 --> 06:59.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
four sips of tea, he later told
police, but after he'd left the
hotel, the radiation had

06:59.052 --> 07:02.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
already started to
spread through his body.

07:02.789 --> 07:08.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the inquiry, the poisoning in
a meeting room at the hotel here
was referred to as

07:08.561 --> 07:13.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a mini-act of nuclear terrorism
on the streets of London. And
because the orders likely came

07:13.967 --> 07:17.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from the Kremlin, Mr.
Litvinenko's widow has demanded
today the strongest possible
response

07:17.871 --> 07:20.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from the British government.

07:20.507 --> 07:25.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARINA LITVINENKO, Widow of
Alexander Litvinenko: It's time
for David Cameron. I'm calling
immediately

07:25.378 --> 07:31.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for complete expulsion from the
U.K. of all Russian intelligence
operatives.

07:31.084 --> 07:35.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS SHIP: Later, she told me
she hopes justice would catch up
with President Putin.

07:35.955 --> 07:39.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARINA LITVINENKO: Yes, we know
not all dictators exist forever,
and, one day, you need to answer

07:39.626 --> 07:41.761 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for everything, what you did.

07:41.761 --> 07:45.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THERESA MAY, British Home
Secretary: This was a blatant
and unacceptable breach of the

07:45.465 --> 07:50.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most fundamental tenets of
international law and of
civilized behavior.

07:50.570 --> 07:55.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS SHIP: If there was any
doubt Litvinenko was a target of
the Russian state, watch this

07:55.475 --> 08:01.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
video of Russian special forces
in training, their target,
Alexander Litvinenko.

08:01.014 --> 08:06.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the man accused of the
poisoning, Andrei Lugovoi, now,
by the way, a senior Russian

08:06.419 --> 08:11.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
politician, said today, "The
accusations against me are
absurd and once again confirm
London's

08:11.458 --> 08:15.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
anti-Russian stance."

08:15.161 --> 08:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nothing from President Putin
himself today, but Britain's
reliance on him in the fight

08:19.666 --> 08:24.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against I.S. in Syria may
limited the U.K.'s response for
a murder which turned this man

08:24.637 --> 08:28.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
into this one days
before his death.

08:28.007 --> 08:32.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We dig deeper
into the story with Michael
McFaul, U.S. ambassador to
Russia

08:32.379 --> 08:37.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from 2012 to 2014. He's now a
professor at Stanford
University. And Steven Lee
Myers,

08:37.951 --> 08:41.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he covers foreign affairs and
national security at The New
York Times. He was based in
Russia

08:41.521 --> 08:46.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from 2002 to 2007. He's also the
author of "The New Tsar: The
Rise and Reign of Vladimir

08:46.159 --> 08:48.128 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Putin."

08:48.128 --> 08:53.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Steven Lee Myers, I want to ask
you first, who was this
individual that was killed?

08:53.199 --> 08:58.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVEN LEE MYERS, The New York
Times: Alexander Litvinenko was
a fairly obscure intelligence

08:58.738 --> 09:05.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
officer in the KGB and then
later the FSB in the '90s,
wasn't very well-known until

09:05.278 --> 09:11.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he very sensationally came
forward with accusations that
the unit that he worked for was
involved

09:11.451 --> 09:15.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in corrupt activities and in
fact an assassination plot.

09:15.021 --> 09:19.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When he came forward at the time
-- this was in 1998 -- the
director of the FSB at the

09:19.459 --> 09:23.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
time, the federal security
service, was Vladimir Putin.

09:23.463 --> 09:27.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, Steven,
staying with you for a second,
in your reporting at the

09:27.834 --> 09:32.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time, a lot of people suspected
this. What did we learn today
from this report?

09:32.138 --> 09:36.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN LEE MYERS: You know,
people who followed this
inquiry, which really was an
extraordinary

09:36.309 --> 09:43.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
process, might not be that
surprised by the conclusions
that were in it.

09:43.183 --> 09:49.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think the tone of it and
the accusation linking it,
though, with a caveat, to the

09:49.355 --> 09:55.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kremlin and Putin himself is
really what was so striking, to
see all these facts laid out.

09:55.295 --> 09:59.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of what was known about
this case dates back to the
investigation that happened in

09:59.799 --> 10:03.102 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
2006 and 2007.

10:03.102 --> 10:08.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when the British originally
charged the two suspects, you
know, many of the details

10:08.441 --> 10:12.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were you know, many of the
details were already known at
that time, but I think that
there

10:12.111 --> 10:17.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was an eagerness inside the U.K.
especially to learn more about
this case and who did

10:17.784 --> 10:24.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
order it, and, you know, the
judge's report today took that
to the top of the Kremlin.

10:24.023 --> 10:26.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Michael
McFaul, does this change your
understanding of the events?

10:26.526 --> 10:31.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL MCFAUL, Former U.S.
Ambassador to Russia: No.

10:31.064 --> 10:35.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I, too, like Steven, have
followed this case for a long
time both as an academic and
then

10:35.668 --> 10:40.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the government. I have only
had a chance to skim the entire
report. I haven't read

10:40.740 --> 10:44.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
everything, but I have read the
conclusions closely, and I want
to applaud them for doing

10:44.944 --> 10:50.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
this. I think it's very
important, even if nothing more
comes of it, that somebody went

10:50.049 --> 10:56.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the trouble to document all
this for history and so that
this has been recorded.

10:56.222 --> 11:02.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Having looked at it, there is no
new smoking gun. There is no
secret tape that recorded

11:02.695 --> 11:07.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Putin giving the order or Mr.
Patrushev giving the order, but
it just puts together the
circumstantial

11:07.734 --> 11:12.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
evidence, which is to say that
these two agents came from
Moscow.

11:12.872 --> 11:17.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They had polonium, something you
can't just buy on the streets.
They poisoned him. They

11:17.510 --> 11:20.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
went back to Moscow and they
have been protected by the
Russian state ever since. In
fact,

11:20.880 --> 11:25.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mr. Putin has given Mr.
Lugovoi a state award.

11:25.718 --> 11:29.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's based on that, that
they come to their conclusions,
and it's pretty damning

11:29.789 --> 11:34.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conclusions, therefore, for both
President Putin and at the time
the head of the FSB,

11:34.360 --> 11:37.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mr. Nikolai Patrushev.

11:37.096 --> 11:42.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Steven Lee
Myers, does this almost bolster
Putin's image as a tough guy,

11:42.602 --> 11:46.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as someone that get things done,
even having this out there?

11:46.072 --> 11:50.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVEN LEE MYERS: I don't think
anybody inside the Kremlin
welcomes this kind of attention

11:50.944 --> 11:56.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or the accusations which again
have been out there the last 10
years.

11:56.082 --> 12:01.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have vigorously fought
them. Putin doesn't want to be
portrayed as somebody who would

12:01.187 --> 12:07.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
carry out this kind of attack,
ordering this kind of
assassination. That said,
Litvinenko

12:07.594 --> 12:12.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was widely reviled in the
Russian elite, especially among
the security services.

12:12.699 --> 12:17.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And even in the testimony that
is included in the report today,
one of the suspects said

12:17.370 --> 12:21.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the killing was meant to
send a message to others who
might betray their oath to the

12:21.007 --> 12:23.643 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
state in Russia.

12:23.643 --> 12:26.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Michael
McFaul, I see you agreeing
there. This was a killing that
was

12:26.212 --> 12:30.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
meant to send a message by
that slow, painful death?

12:30.083 --> 12:36.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MCFAUL: Oh, absolutely.
I mean, he was a traitor.
Remember, he worked for the

12:36.289 --> 12:42.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KGB, then the FSB, the same
organizations that Mr. Putin and
Patrushev worked for.

12:42.061 --> 12:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He then defected. He then made
these claims -- that's in the
report again -- that the

12:47.133 --> 12:54.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FSB orchestrated terrorist
attacks against Russian citizens
back in the fall of 1989

12:54.273 --> 12:58.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as a way to rally Russians
around the flag and support
ultimately President Putin. That

12:58.578 --> 13:01.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was the first time that
he ran for president.

13:01.414 --> 13:06.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there's no doubt that they
hated him. They made that very
clear. And they were sending

13:06.019 --> 13:10.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a signal. And I want to point
out, there's been a lot of
assassinations, there's been

13:10.823 --> 13:17.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of killings. Just last
year, the leading figure of the
opposition, Boris Nemtsov, was

13:17.330 --> 13:22.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
murdered, assassinated just a
few feet from the Kremlin walls,
again, with all this ambiguous

13:22.368 --> 13:27.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
notion, actually who
ordered it, who didn't.

13:27.173 --> 13:31.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's a pattern. It's not
just a one-off. And the last
thing I want to remind you of,

13:31.978 --> 13:38.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even if they didn't make these
calls, right, even if somehow
this was a rogue operation,

13:38.818 --> 13:43.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's also pretty damning. That
means that President Putin is
not in charge of his state

13:43.589 --> 13:48.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that people within the
regime can carry out
assassinations without his
blessing. That's

13:48.294 --> 13:52.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also not a very good message
about his control within Russia.

13:52.598 --> 13:55.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Steven, what's
the response been from Russia
today?

13:55.368 --> 13:59.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVEN LEE MYERS: You know, as
you would expect, and as it has
been from the very beginning,

13:59.806 --> 14:05.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
they have denounced this
investigation. They say that the
accusations that the Russian

14:05.278 --> 14:10.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state was involved at all is
part of a politically motivated
smear campaign against Russia
and

14:10.516 --> 14:13.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
against Putin himself.

14:13.986 --> 14:21.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you know, it's hard for
them, I think, in Russia to
understand this or accept this

14:21.260 --> 14:25.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as an independent inquiry. They
say the whole thing was
politicized to come to a
predetermined

14:25.665 --> 14:27.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
conclusion.

14:27.533 --> 14:31.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally,
Michael McFaul, what about the
diplomatic consequences of

14:31.871 --> 14:35.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this? The U.K. and the U.S. are
kind of in a delicate dance with
Russia right now, especially

14:35.608 --> 14:38.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
when it comes to Syria.

14:38.244 --> 14:44.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MCFAUL: Well, I think
for Prime Minister Cameron, it's
going to be very difficult,

14:44.383 --> 14:51.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because they took years to get
over this big interruption in
their bilateral relationship.

14:51.591 --> 14:55.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they were just slowly
creeping towards a better
relationship when I was
ambassador,

14:55.328 --> 14:59.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and then the invasion of
Ukraine set that back.

14:59.065 --> 15:03.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're now in this moment, as you
just noted, of trying to
cooperate with Russia on Syria,

15:03.536 --> 15:08.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
both on a political solution,
but also on the fight against
ISIS. And, therefore, I

15:08.241 --> 15:13.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think they're going to try to do
damage control. That would be my
prediction.

15:13.980 --> 15:15.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Michael McFaul, Steven Lee
Myers, thanks so much.

15:15.782 --> 15:18.251 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEVEN LEE MYERS: Thank you.

15:18.251 --> 15:26.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MCFAUL: Thank you.

15:26.492 --> 15:32.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The crowded
Republican field running for
president faces the first real

15:32.698 --> 15:37.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
test in less than two weeks,
when voting begins in Iowa and
New Hampshire.

15:37.069 --> 15:39.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky is
hoping young people show up in
big numbers and help him

15:39.972 --> 15:42.141 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stand out.

15:42.141 --> 15:45.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gwen Ifill sat down with him
earlier today as part of our
Running series.

15:45.845 --> 15:48.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Senator Paul, thank
you so much for joining us.

15:48.848 --> 15:49.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY),
Presidential Candidate: Thanks
for having me.

15:49.382 --> 15:50.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It seems like
the longest race ever.

15:50.016 --> 15:51.717 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

15:51.717 --> 15:54.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And here we are,
about two weeks out before the
first voting in Iowa and then

15:54.086 --> 15:57.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in New Hampshire.

15:57.023 --> 16:01.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump is surging. Ted
Cruz is surging. How do you
assess the race today?

16:01.227 --> 16:04.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. RAND PAUL: I think a lot
will be told the night of the
election.

16:04.530 --> 16:09.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, in some ways, this
is the first election I have
really seen led so much by

16:09.502 --> 16:14.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
polling. And I think polling is
getting more and more inaccurate
over time, because more

16:14.207 --> 16:18.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and more people are on cell
phones and not really included.
A lot of our support comes

16:18.077 --> 16:21.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from younger voters, college-age
voters. And I have yet to meet a
college student who has

16:21.347 --> 16:23.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ever been included in a poll.

16:23.950 --> 16:28.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think we have to wait and
see how the voters vote. We have
a really good ground

16:28.054 --> 16:33.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
game. Our goal is to get 10,000
students to vote in Iowa.
They're in school for the first

16:33.960 --> 16:38.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time in several presidential
election cycles, so we think we
have a real shot.

16:38.097 --> 16:41.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, explain to me a
little bit more how you do that
in Iowa and how you duplicate

16:41.367 --> 16:44.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something like that if you
need to in New Hampshire.

16:44.036 --> 16:47.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. RAND PAUL: President Obama
did very well with students, and
he won the student vote

16:47.506 --> 16:50.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
probably 3-1, and he energized
them and got them out.

16:50.309 --> 16:54.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have been doing a lot of the
same thing, working in dorms, on
campus, really trying

16:54.680 --> 16:59.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to organize dorm by dorm, get
the kids out. We think a lot of
these students aren't wedded

16:59.118 --> 17:04.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to one party or another yet. But
they're interested in being left
alone.

17:04.056 --> 17:08.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And part of the theme of my
campaign is, the government
ought to leave people alone. The

17:08.561 --> 17:12.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government ought shouldn't be
collecting everyone's phone
records. I think young people,
their

17:12.064 --> 17:14.200 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
life revolves
around their phone.

17:14.200 --> 17:18.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If I want to talk to my kids and
they're in the basement, I have
to send them a text to

17:18.204 --> 17:22.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talk to them sometimes. And I
think that they understand as
much or more than anybody else

17:22.341 --> 17:25.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the government really
shouldn't have access to all
their records.

17:25.144 --> 17:28.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And when they pick
up their phones and they want to
look up political news, they

17:28.414 --> 17:30.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
yesterday only read about
Sarah Palin and Donald Trump.

17:30.950 --> 17:32.585 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

17:32.585 --> 17:34.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Sucks all the air
out of the room, including on
those little devices.

17:34.020 --> 17:35.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SEN. RAND PAUL: Yes.

17:35.321 --> 17:37.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: How do you
break through that?

17:37.556 --> 17:40.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. RAND PAUL: Maybe not quite
as bad as you would think,
because young people aren't

17:40.559 --> 17:43.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really watching the traditional.
They're getting things from
their friends. They're getting

17:43.062 --> 17:46.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things passed around that
are funny or humorous.

17:46.132 --> 17:51.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're not really wedded to
the cable news so much. And I
think it is a disservice,

17:51.137 --> 17:56.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
though, that the news, I think,
has really dumbed the whole
thing down, because it's

17:56.409 --> 18:00.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been a nonstop Trump circus for
months and months now. If you
add up all the coverage

18:00.646 --> 18:04.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of all the other candidates,
he's getting 25 times more.

18:04.250 --> 18:08.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, is it any surprise that he's
leading in the polls? Which came
first? Was he leading

18:08.788 --> 18:13.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the polls or the coverage?
It's been a little bit of both.
But I think it's a disservice

18:13.926 --> 18:18.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really to the country and to
getting a serious debate,
because, see, I think it's
important

18:18.030 --> 18:22.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to know who's going to be in
charge of the nuclear weapons.

18:22.301 --> 18:26.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump doesn't seem -- in the
last debate, the CNN debate, he
didn't seem to understand

18:26.372 --> 18:31.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what the nuclear triad was, that
we have land missiles, sea and
air. And then a week after

18:31.877 --> 18:35.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the debate, his campaign was
asked, and they said, well, yes,
we knew about nuclear weapons,

18:35.481 --> 18:40.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and our problem is we haven't
been willing enough to use
nuclear weapons.

18:40.586 --> 18:43.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's a pretty profound and
scary thought, that we would
have someone running who thinks

18:43.990 --> 18:46.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we need to use our
nuclear weapons more.

18:46.158 --> 18:47.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Which used to
be a disqualifying thing.

18:47.426 --> 18:48.594 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEN. RAND PAUL: You would think.

18:48.594 --> 18:50.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But it doesn't
seem like that this year.

18:50.696 --> 18:55.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It seems that you have said
Donald Trump would destroy the
party. You have said that Ted

18:55.735 --> 19:00.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cruz is not authentic. Yet, none
of that seems to -- none of
those criticisms, at least for

19:00.006 --> 19:02.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you, seem to grab on.

19:02.508 --> 19:05.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. RAND PAUL: Well, I think we
have simplified the debate too
much and we have made it all

19:05.644 --> 19:10.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about, well, we're just going to
show -- there was -- I bet you,
of the eight or 10 hours

19:10.616 --> 19:14.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that people were awake yesterday
they could watch the news that
Trump was on probably

19:14.687 --> 19:17.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the majority of the time, maybe
80 to 90 percent of the news
cycle, all day long, repeated

19:17.857 --> 19:19.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over and over again.

19:19.859 --> 19:24.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as a consequence, we're not
breaking through to think about.
And I have made the point

19:24.263 --> 19:29.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is, is that the difference
between Trump and myself is,
Trump wants power. And he thinks

19:29.001 --> 19:33.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's so smart that he will fix
everything in the country; just
give him power.

19:33.439 --> 19:38.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I understand the corrupting
influence of power and that it
is our American tradition

19:38.444 --> 19:43.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to worry about having too much
power to gravitate to any
person, and that I want more
power

19:43.182 --> 19:46.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be dispersed among the states
and the people, and that I want
the power in Washington to

19:46.819 --> 19:49.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be constrained by
the Constitution.

19:49.855 --> 19:53.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a completely different
tradition. But I think there
could be an intellectual debate

19:53.826 --> 19:58.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about which is the better
proposition, give one person all
of the power and let them fix

19:58.230 --> 20:01.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the country, or acknowledge that
maybe power has a corrupting
influence.

20:01.534 --> 20:05.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: An intellectual
debate sometime in the next two
weeks.

20:05.438 --> 20:08.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Depending on the turnout of
young people, who we don't know
if they would turn out for

20:08.774 --> 20:12.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something like an Iowa caucus --
sounds like a tough proposition.

20:12.244 --> 20:16.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. RAND PAUL: It may be. But
we're working very hard. We have
1,000 precinct chairs in

20:16.182 --> 20:19.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Iowa. I think that's more than
anyone else has announced.

20:19.852 --> 20:24.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We announced last week when I
was there that we had made
500,000 phone calls. That's an

20:24.356 --> 20:27.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
enormous project. So, we have
put a lot of work and effort in
it. We will know February

20:27.593 --> 20:30.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
1 whether it works or not.

20:30.429 --> 20:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think I guess what's
disappointing to us is that
people think that the election

20:34.333 --> 20:36.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is already over, it's been
pre-decided. And we haven't even
started. We haven't even had

20:36.535 --> 20:38.838 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
one vote yet.

20:38.838 --> 20:42.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, that's been
written, especially about your
campaign. And you weren't on the

20:42.007 --> 20:44.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
debate stage last weekend. And
that raised that question.

20:44.877 --> 20:51.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I looked at this. And I do
wonder what your grand plan is,
especially -- you have

20:51.217 --> 20:54.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got a lot of endorsements in New
Hampshire. As you point out, you
have a lot of endorsements

20:54.753 --> 20:58.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Iowa. One endorsement like
Sarah Palin seems to blow all
that out of the water.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.659 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
SEN. RAND PAUL:
Maybe, maybe not.

21:00.659 --> 21:04.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
See, I still think there is a
question of whether Donald Trump
is a conservative. He

21:04.864 --> 21:08.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spent most of his life as a
progressive Democrat. He was
pro-choice for the vast majority
of

21:08.968 --> 21:13.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
life -- of his life, and now
he says now he's pro-life.

21:13.606 --> 21:17.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, really, some of the things
that really energize
conservatives -- when the Tea
Party

21:17.143 --> 21:21.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
movement arose, one of the
things that we were very annoyed
with was bailing out the

21:21.213 --> 21:24.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
big banks, that the middle class
shouldn't have to bail out the
big banks in New York,

21:24.316 --> 21:27.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and yet Donald Trump
supported that.

21:27.419 --> 21:33.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most of us were opposed to
centralizing the control of
health insurance and health in

21:33.058 --> 21:37.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our country, and the idea that
there would be a single-payer
was something that really

21:37.596 --> 21:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was the opposite of what we
believed in. And he's been for
that as well.

21:41.500 --> 21:45.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, really, there are a lot of
things about Donald Trump that
aren't conservative, his

21:45.204 --> 21:49.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
belief in eminent domain, that
the government should take
private property from one
property

21:49.875 --> 21:53.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
owner, and give it to Donald
Trump, basically, for a casino.
That goes against what most

21:53.445 --> 21:55.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
conservatives believe.

21:55.814 --> 21:59.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk about
what you believe. You are not
pro-war, anti-war, I think is

21:59.618 --> 22:01.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
fair to say, in a
libertarian sense.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SEN. RAND PAUL: Right.

22:03.022 --> 22:06.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You also believe
that -- you advocate for
privacy, on behalf of privacy,
as you

22:06.859 --> 22:09.195 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
alluded to.

22:09.195 --> 22:11.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this the year where that
debate is actually happening,
where people are listening to
that

22:11.931 --> 22:12.765 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
debate?

22:12.765 --> 22:15.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SEN. RAND PAUL: I
think very much so.

22:15.501 --> 22:19.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, when the NSA, when it
was discovered that the NSA was
collecting all of our phone

22:19.939 --> 22:23.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
records, I think people
responded. And the vast majority
of particularly young people

22:23.842 --> 22:28.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were opposed to it. If you --
there was a poll of those taken
under 40; 83 percent of

22:28.847 --> 22:32.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those under 40 thought the
government went too far in
collecting all our phone
records.

22:32.952 --> 22:36.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It also hasn't worked. Two
bipartisan commissions have
looked at it and said, you know
what?

22:36.722 --> 22:41.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We haven't stopped any terrorist
attacks by doing this. Now, I do
think, since the recent

22:41.427 --> 22:44.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terrorist attacks, people are
like, oh, what are we going to
do? How do we protect ourselves?

22:44.763 --> 22:48.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But I think there is a
significant amount of people in
my party who do believe, you

22:48.334 --> 22:52.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know what, the answer isn't to
give up our liberty. The answer
isn't to trade liberty

22:52.037 --> 22:55.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a false sense of security.
So, I think we actually are
still winning that debate,

22:55.674 --> 22:59.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but it is a more difficult
environment because people are
fearful.

22:59.311 --> 23:02.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You're running for
your Senate seat at the same
time as you run for the
nomination.

23:02.615 --> 23:08.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A couple things that raises.
Among them, you're running to be
an insider again, which is not

23:08.654 --> 23:11.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going over well so far, and also
some people say you're trying to
have your cake and eat

23:11.123 --> 23:13.092 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it, too.

23:13.092 --> 23:16.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. RAND PAUL: I wouldn't be
the first. Paul Ryan ran last
year, and ran for both Congress

23:16.428 --> 23:17.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and the vice presidency.

23:17.363 --> 23:17.796 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

23:17.796 --> 23:18.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Joe Lieberman.

23:18.931 --> 23:21.333 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
SEN. RAND PAUL:
LBJ, Joe Lieberman.

23:21.333 --> 23:26.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think there's a long list
of people who have run for two
offices. And it turns

23:26.605 --> 23:29.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out that that is the way -- the
only way forward for me to put
the message forward and become

23:29.508 --> 23:31.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
part of the national debate.

23:31.810 --> 23:35.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we have been very pleased
with the response to this. And I
think I have a unique voice

23:35.481 --> 23:39.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the Republican Party. You
have got people like Ted Cruz,
who says he's going to make

23:39.418 --> 23:42.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the sand glow, once again, sort
of the Donald Trumpism. I think
he's trying to one-up Donald

23:42.588 --> 23:45.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trump on how tough
he's going to be.

23:45.090 --> 23:49.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, really, we ought to think
through the ramifications of
what happens in the Middle

23:49.261 --> 23:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
East, because, so often, our
interventions in the Middle East
have led to consequences

23:54.066 --> 23:56.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that were unintended, but,
actually, I think, have made us
less safe.

23:56.568 --> 24:00.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Senator Rand Paul,
good luck on the campaign trail.

24:00.372 --> 24:05.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

24:05.144 --> 24:11.817 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
SEN. RAND PAUL:
Thank you. Thanks.

24:11.817 --> 24:16.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

24:16.055 --> 24:22.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
What does a city need to promote
genius within its community?;

24:22.361 --> 24:27.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the challenges migrant women
face making the journey to
safety; and an anti-smoking
campaign

24:27.032 --> 24:31.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's using real people
and their stories.

24:31.136 --> 24:35.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Next, a bit of NFL history was
made this week, and not the
usual records book statistic
that

24:35.774 --> 24:38.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sports announcers
spout on Sunday.

24:38.877 --> 24:43.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yesterday, the Buffalo Bills
announced they'd hired the
league's first full-time female

24:43.849 --> 24:48.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coach. Kathryn Smith is the
team's new special teams quality
control coach. She comes to

24:48.620 --> 24:53.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the job with 13 years of NFL
experience, first with the New
York Jets, then the Bills.

24:53.025 --> 24:55.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more on the move and its
implications, I spoke a short
time ago to sports writer

24:55.828 --> 25:00.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Christine Brennan of USA Today.

25:00.432 --> 25:06.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Christine Brennan, it seems
strange to have this
conversation in 2016, but the
first full-time

25:06.004 --> 25:12.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NFL coach position going to a
woman. Why is this so
significant, besides what I just
said?

25:12.878 --> 25:16.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN, USA Today:
Yes, well, I think that's it,
and also that I think it's

25:16.815 --> 25:20.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the beginning of what we're
going to see, Hari, as a big
trend over the next 10, 15,

25:20.586 --> 25:23.088 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
20 years.

25:23.088 --> 25:29.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is Title IX in all of its
manifestations. And it's not
just about girls playing sports

25:29.161 --> 25:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and women playing sports, but
it's about that neighborhood
girl who you watch play sports

25:34.833 --> 25:40.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who grows up loving sports and
goes to college, as Kathryn
Smith did and works for the
men's

25:40.005 --> 25:44.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
basketball team at St. John's,
as she did, and wants to have a
career in sports.

25:44.810 --> 25:49.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she's working in the NFL for
the Jets as an intern. And so
she has over 10, 12 years

25:49.848 --> 25:54.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of experience already. And Rex
Ryan hires her to be a coach.
And this is her career,

25:54.453 --> 25:57.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this is her life. She
loves sports that much.

25:57.923 --> 26:01.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, there are millions of
girls and women like that in
this country who are playing

26:01.427 --> 26:05.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sports and loving it and wanting
to have a career in some form in
the sports world or

26:05.798 --> 26:09.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at least nearby. And I think
this shows that this is just the
beginning of what I think

26:09.401 --> 26:12.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will be a very significant
trend moving forward.

26:12.037 --> 26:15.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tell me a
little bit about her job. There
are several types of coaches

26:15.674 --> 26:18.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the NFL. This doesn't mean
she's the head coach wearing the
stuff on the sidelines.

26:18.343 --> 26:20.579 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But what is she going to do?

26:20.579 --> 26:23.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Well, she's
in quality control with the
special teams.

26:23.549 --> 26:26.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm sure people are saying,
what? There's a lot of coaches.
There are a lot of assistant

26:26.819 --> 26:31.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coaches on that sideline, a lot
of assistant coaches in the
booth, and even maybe more

26:31.723 --> 26:35.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
important the practices and
working with the players,
working behind the scenes.

26:35.694 --> 26:39.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so while it's a little
unclear exactly where she will
be on game day -- my sense

26:39.198 --> 26:43.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is, she probably will be on the
field -- but she will be working
with the special teams

26:43.702 --> 26:48.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
assistant coach. She will be
probably looking at film,
looking at all kinds of patterns

26:48.941 --> 26:52.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and schemes and figuring out
what they're doing well on
special teams, deciding if there

26:52.878 --> 26:56.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a player or two that should
be moved to special teams or
moved away.

26:56.014 --> 27:01.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, special teams are the
kicks and the punts, kickoffs,
punts, an integral role

27:01.653 --> 27:06.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in any NFL game and with any NFL
team. So, it's an important
role. And I think, even

27:06.892 --> 27:09.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
more important, she is a
full-fledged assistant coach,
will be in all meetings with the
entire

27:09.661 --> 27:13.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
staff and Rex Ryan,
who hired her.

27:13.031 --> 27:16.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that, in and of
itself, Hari, is the
achievement, that she is now at
that

27:16.935 --> 27:21.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
level with all these men who
have been doing this for many
years as well.

27:21.006 --> 27:23.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And there have
been -- there are women in
high-ranking front office
positions

27:23.475 --> 27:26.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
around the league,
just not on the field.

27:26.512 --> 27:29.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Well, that's
right. And women have owned
teams. Georgia Frontiere

27:29.448 --> 27:33.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
comes to mind with the Rams,
so many others over the years.

27:33.886 --> 27:38.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In baseball, Marge Schott
controversially owned the
Cincinnati Reds. That is not so

27:38.891 --> 27:42.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unusual. The difference is here
that this is someone who has
obviously grown up playing

27:42.961 --> 27:47.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sports and loving sports, and
didn't come in via the ownership
door or for the boardroom,

27:47.699 --> 27:52.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but -- from the boardroom -- but
the way men have for years, by
working her way up as an

27:52.538 --> 27:55.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
intern through the system.

27:55.140 --> 27:58.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you think about it, watch
when players are injured, and
you often now see -- with

27:58.911 --> 28:04.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
college games, you will see a
woman running out as one of the
trainers and working to

28:04.316 --> 28:08.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
assist that player on the
football field, men's
basketball, women's basketball,
et cetera.

28:08.720 --> 28:13.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, again, this shouldn't
surprise us. These women are out
there doing these jobs. And

28:13.058 --> 28:18.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so from that standpoint, yes,
she has worked her way up the
way so many other people have,

28:18.063 --> 28:21.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and legitimately deserves this
job. This is no gift. This is
not political correctness.

28:21.767 --> 28:24.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rex Ryan would be doing this --
wouldn't be doing that. This is
all about someone who

28:24.803 --> 28:27.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
deserves this job.

28:27.205 --> 28:30.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Well, while
we're talking about gender
diversity, the question is back

28:30.142 --> 28:35.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the NFL again about racial
diversity. It's this time of the
year, when coaches lose their

28:35.581 --> 28:40.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
jobs, or as coaches move teams,
and while we see the hashtag on
the Oscars trending

28:40.352 --> 28:44.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Oscars so white, NFL is going to
have maybe a similar one coming
up.

28:44.156 --> 28:49.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Well, there
were six minority coaches last
year. And it looks like there

28:49.061 --> 28:54.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will be six minority coaches
this year out of 32 teams.
That's not even 20 percent,
Hari.

28:54.232 --> 28:59.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when you think that the
league itself is 67 percent,
two-thirds, minority players,

28:59.271 --> 29:03.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
boy, if that isn't a disparity
between the players and then the
fact that there is no

29:03.241 --> 29:07.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trickling up at all to getting
the opportunity to have the head
coaching job.

29:07.312 --> 29:12.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, though, what we were
taking about a moment ago with
Smith, working your way up,

29:12.150 --> 29:16.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these players need to -- in my
opinion, need to be given the
signal that they are wanted

29:16.755 --> 29:20.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the coaching ranks and they
are wanted in administrations.

29:20.392 --> 29:25.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Often, we see in sports that the
people doing the hiring are
picking those people who look

29:25.931 --> 29:31.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like them. And as long as it's
white owners, a majority, of
course, white owners, and in

29:31.370 --> 29:35.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
athletic departments, it's a lot
of men picking men now to coach
women's sports, which are

29:35.774 --> 29:39.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lucrative jobs in college, it's
a very big deal in women's
college sports, losing those

29:39.411 --> 29:41.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
opportunities for women,
having men coach women.

29:41.947 --> 29:45.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that should be
unacceptable in 2016.

29:45.517 --> 29:47.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Christine Brennan joining us
from Minnesota today, thanks so

29:47.386 --> 29:48.286 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

29:48.286 --> 29:54.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN:
And thank you, Hari.

29:54.493 --> 30:03.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, what
helps foster genius,
particularly geography and the
close proximity

30:03.568 --> 30:06.705 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of other talented minds?

30:06.705 --> 30:10.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman, has a look, part of
his weekly Making Sense

30:10.442 --> 30:13.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
series, which airs every
Thursday on the "NewsHour."

30:13.145 --> 30:17.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So we're in the
National Gallery of Art, genius
clusters galore. You want to

30:17.916 --> 30:19.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
explain some to me?

30:19.651 --> 30:21.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ERIC WEINER, Author, "The
Geography of Genius": Sure.

30:21.019 --> 30:25.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: That's journalist
Eric Weiner. For his new book,
"The Geography of Genius,"

30:25.357 --> 30:30.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he traveled the world and back
in time. So, a museum seemed a
fitting backdrop to hear

30:30.228 --> 30:33.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what he found. First
stop, ancient Athens.

30:33.398 --> 30:40.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC WEINER: Athens was one of
the first real global cities in
the world. And so they would

30:40.505 --> 30:45.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
open their doors to foreigners
-- they called them Metics --
they were essentially resident

30:45.077 --> 30:47.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aliens, who, even though they
knew they posed somewhat of a
national security risk, they

30:47.946 --> 30:50.248 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
invited them in.

30:50.248 --> 30:54.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: And became
cosmopolitan, the first
necessary ingredient for the
genius

30:54.586 --> 30:58.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cluster every place would
like to have, says Weiner.

30:58.924 --> 31:03.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unsurprisingly, the head of
Harvard's Center for
International Development
agrees.

31:03.195 --> 31:06.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICARDO HAUSMANN, Harvard Center
for International Development: I
study how places become good

31:06.098 --> 31:08.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at different things, and how the
things that they're good at
evolve.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Professor
Ricardo Hausmann.

31:11.470 --> 31:16.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICARDO HAUSMANN: And what I
find is that they tend to
diversify into things that are

31:16.174 --> 31:21.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
somewhat related, but somewhat
more complex or more advanced.
And in the process of
diversifying,

31:21.046 --> 31:25.584 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they rely enormously on talent
that came from the outside.

31:25.584 --> 31:29.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Although note, says
Weiner, that these places have
to be big and wealthy enough

31:29.321 --> 31:32.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to attract top talent.

31:32.824 --> 31:38.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC WEINER: Almost all of these
genius clusters throughout
history have been cities. And
Athens

31:38.997 --> 31:45.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wasn't a huge city, but it was
very dense, there were lots of
interactions, and it was

31:45.137 --> 31:50.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an urban life that we might
recognize today, people trading
and gossiping and getting
together

31:50.609 --> 31:55.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for these drunken symposia where
they would recite poetry and
drink wine.

31:55.614 --> 32:00.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, do you believe
it takes a Socrates to make a
Plato?

32:00.485 --> 32:04.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC WEINER: And a Plato to make
an Aristotle, and an Aristotle
to make an Alexander, if

32:04.523 --> 32:08.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you will. The point is
that genius is contagious.

32:08.727 --> 32:12.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Professor
Hausmann's research bears this
out.

32:12.030 --> 32:17.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICARDO HAUSMANN: Genius is not
really about individuals. It's
really about a collective.

32:17.235 --> 32:19.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's about a community
of practice.

32:19.404 --> 32:24.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: To Eric Weiner, a
prime example was Renaissance
Florence.

32:24.209 --> 32:29.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC WEINER: It cannot be a
coincidence that you had not
only a Leonardo da Vinci and a

32:29.114 --> 32:33.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michelangelo doing incredible
work in Florence at this
particular time, but you had
Ghiberti

32:33.485 --> 32:38.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Brunelleschi and Filippo
Lippi and all of these others.

32:38.723 --> 32:42.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People were living out of each
other's intellectual pockets.
They were sharing ideas. There
was

32:42.527 --> 32:48.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
enough trust to share your
ideas, but enough tension to
create some sparks.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.402 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
PAUL SOLMAN:
Competition, you mean?

32:50.402 --> 32:55.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC WEINER: Absolutely. All of
these golden ages were
competitive places.

32:55.574 --> 32:59.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Graham Greene once famously said
about Switzerland 500 years of
peace and stability and what

32:59.311 --> 33:02.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have they brought the
world? The cuckoo clock.

33:02.047 --> 33:06.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Fractious, but
wealthy Florence, by contrast,
brought the world a painter we

33:06.651 --> 33:12.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still know by one name, Leonardo
-- the National Gallery boasts
America's only painting by

33:12.991 --> 33:17.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him -- and a rival with whom
we're also on a first-name
basis, Michelangelo.

33:17.963 --> 33:22.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC WEINER: Michelangelo was
younger, and he was the upstart,
and he was threatening

33:22.334 --> 33:27.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Leonardo. But it brought out
the best in both men, and that's
often the case.

33:27.539 --> 33:29.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Well, I think the
first thing I learned about
Leonardo da Vinci is that

33:29.374 --> 33:33.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he was a renaissance man, right?

33:33.311 --> 33:38.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC WEINER: He was the original
renaissance man, actually. All
genius is interdisciplinary,

33:38.350 --> 33:45.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to some degree. They cross
boundaries. And today we have
pigeonholed ourselves so much,

33:45.290 --> 33:49.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that it's hard to break out.
It's hard for a biologist to
write about physics. It's hard

33:49.628 --> 33:53.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for an art historian to talk
about aeronautical engineering.

33:53.298 --> 33:59.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: One more stop on
the National Gallery tour of
genius geography, the capital

33:59.070 --> 34:05.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the Austro-Hungarian Empire,
Vienna, circa 1900,, home to
painters like Gustav Klimt,

34:05.043 --> 34:07.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Egon Schiele, Oskar Kokoschka.

34:07.946 --> 34:13.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, this is our approximation of
a Viennese coffee shop right?

34:13.385 --> 34:17.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC WEINER: Pretty close. We
have got the coffee. We have got
the desserts.

34:17.422 --> 34:20.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: That's true. So
what was it about Vienna?

34:20.659 --> 34:24.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC WEINER: The Viennese coffee
house was a classic case of
what's known as a third

34:24.996 --> 34:30.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
place. Third places, unlike work
or home, first and second
places, third places like

34:30.435 --> 34:35.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this are places you go where you
can converse with friends, and
you can converse with strangers,

34:35.941 --> 34:39.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and people who may not share
your exact political point of
view or your exact intellectual
point

34:39.544 --> 34:41.846 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of view.

34:41.846 --> 34:47.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it's this mixing of
divergent points of view that
came together in the Vienna of

PAUL SOLMAN: For Eric Weiner,
the final ingredients of genius
seem pretty clear: a rich city
with

34:54.025 --> 35:00.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
bustle, competition,
cooperation, and, above all,
openness to the new, the
foreign.

35:00.665 --> 35:05.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC WEINER: Vienna was a city
of immigrants in 1900, a lot of
immigrants from throughout

35:05.337 --> 35:10.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Austro-Hungarian Empire,
including Sigmund Freud, who was
an immigrant, and they came

35:10.175 --> 35:14.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
together and they brought fresh
ideas, and they shook up the
status quo.

35:14.579 --> 35:18.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was a demographic earthquake
that changed Vienna and that
made it, at the time, the

35:18.883 --> 35:21.252 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
greatest city in the world.

35:21.252 --> 35:24.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Much as America,
because of our openness to fresh
ideas and people, has been

35:24.656 --> 35:27.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
called the greatest country.

35:27.993 --> 35:33.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But can we afford to stay so
open in an increasingly
menacing, terror-mad world?

35:33.999 --> 35:37.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Development expert Hausmann
responded with data.

35:37.369 --> 35:43.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICARDO HAUSMANN: In the U.S.,
25 percent of employers are
foreign-born. In Silicon

35:43.508 --> 35:48.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Valley, over 50 percent of
start-ups created by people who
were born abroad.

35:48.947 --> 35:54.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: As we left
Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government, where Venezuelan
Hausmann

35:54.085 --> 35:58.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and so many other immigrants
teach, I had one last question:
How bad would it be for

35:58.656 --> 36:02.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the economy if America
became less open?

36:02.494 --> 36:06.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICARDO HAUSMANN: Well, it
definitely is going to cost. We
should remember that Steve Jobs'

36:06.598 --> 36:10.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
parents were Syrian. And there
are plenty of Syrians we're not
letting in.

36:10.235 --> 36:16.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Well, only the dad
was from Syria. Still, some of
those we're not letting in

36:16.107 --> 36:23.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
may father or be potential
geniuses. Others, well, who
knows? The fact is, when it
comes

36:23.615 --> 36:30.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to cooking up genius clusters
anywhere, from ancient Greece to
Renaissance Italy to high-tech

36:30.188 --> 36:36.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
America, there may be key
ingredients, but the recipe is
awfully hard to follow.

36:36.961 --> 36:46.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Economics correspondent Paul
Solman, reporting for the "PBS
NewsHour."

36:46.237 --> 36:55.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now we
continue our look at the
desperate journey facing
refugees seeking

36:55.013 --> 36:58.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
safe haven in Europe.

36:58.583 --> 37:02.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, President Obama spoke
with German Chancellor Angela
Merkel about how significant a
challenge

37:02.854 --> 37:07.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the wave of new refugees pose.
The two leaders agreed to
galvanize global support at a
conference

37:07.659 --> 37:11.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in London next month and call
for a global refugee summit at
the U.N. General Assembly

37:11.429 --> 37:13.598 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in September.

37:13.598 --> 37:16.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Judy Woodruff recently recorded
this look at the crisis.

37:16.768 --> 37:21.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last year saw
more than one million refugees
and migrants enter Europe

37:21.773 --> 37:26.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from the Middle East, from
Southwest Asia and Africa.

37:26.277 --> 37:32.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many are fleeing brutal wars and
violence at home, and making
often perilous journeys

37:32.283 --> 37:36.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in search of safety. There are
serious risks along the route,
but these are often harsher

37:36.154 --> 37:38.990 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for women.

37:38.990 --> 37:44.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To explore the challenges and
dangerous faced by women amid
this refugee crisis, I'm joined

37:44.362 --> 37:49.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by Sarah Costa. She's the
executive director of the
Women's Refugee Commission. It's
a

37:49.367 --> 37:55.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nonprofit advocacy and awareness
group that focuses on the needs
of women and children

37:55.340 --> 38:00.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in humanitarian emergencies. She
returned from a fact-finding
mission in Greece and

38:00.011 --> 38:03.281 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Macedonia just
before the new year.

38:03.281 --> 38:06.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Sarah Costa, welcome.

38:06.251 --> 38:12.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tell us what is known about the
women who are making this
journey right now.

38:12.590 --> 38:14.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH COSTA, Executive Director,
Women's Refugee Commission:
Well, what we know in all
humanitarian

38:14.893 --> 38:21.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
crisis -- and this is no
exception -- that women face
heightened risks of violence and

38:21.199 --> 38:27.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exploitation and heightened
risks of all forms of
gender-based violence.

38:27.305 --> 38:32.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what we have also seen in
our journey -- in fact, we have
been in Greece, Macedonia,

38:32.443 --> 38:39.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Serbia and Slovenia -- what we
have seen is that
systematically, the protection
risks

38:39.050 --> 38:43.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
for women and girls in
particular are not being taken
into account.

38:43.621 --> 38:49.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are not adequate
protection services on the
ground to both identify and
prioritize

38:49.994 --> 38:52.397 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
women's needs.

38:52.397 --> 38:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And is this
something that has grown worse
during this crisis, or has

38:54.866 --> 38:57.602 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it been like this all along?

38:57.602 --> 39:02.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SARAH COSTA: This is an
unprecedented crisis. I mean,
the magnitude and the speed of
the

39:02.574 --> 39:07.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
migration, we haven't
seen in other times.

39:07.378 --> 39:13.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what's failing here are the
services and the countries
responsible for those services

39:13.084 --> 39:19.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to put in place the protection
pieces that need to be put in
place. I mean, what we have

39:19.557 --> 39:23.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seen is that the humanitarian
agencies were quite slow to come
into this crisis, because

39:23.995 --> 39:28.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think governments
felt they could manage.

39:28.733 --> 39:34.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But they're not managing
particularly well. We are
failing women and girls on this
route.

39:34.138 --> 39:38.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it is, as you said in your
introduction, a very treacherous
route.

39:38.643 --> 39:42.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But how much is
known about what portion, what
proportion of these refugees

39:42.780 --> 39:46.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are women and where
they're coming from?

39:46.384 --> 39:51.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH COSTA: Well, we do know,
from the statistics of the
International Organization on
Migration,

39:51.022 --> 39:55.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the number of women has
been increasing steadily.

39:55.493 --> 40:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think when we saw those first
pictures right at the beginning
of the coverage by the media,

40:02.500 --> 40:07.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people were only focused on the
men, and there certainly were a
lot of men. But what we have

40:07.105 --> 40:12.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seen during our assessment is
that more and more women are
coming, and women with families,

40:12.310 --> 40:16.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
women traveling alone, women
traveling alone with children.

40:16.080 --> 40:23.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we think it's probably now
about 40 percent are women. And
we know that at least 37 percent

40:23.021 --> 40:28.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are coming directly from Syria,
which tells us about the
worsening conditions in Syria.

40:28.693 --> 40:30.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And their stories are horrific.

40:30.895 --> 40:33.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Give us a sense
of that. What are they saying?

40:33.931 --> 40:39.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH COSTA: Well, what we hear
is that they basically have had
very little food, very

40:39.671 --> 40:45.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
little access to water. They are
fearful of violence every day.
They have seen their families

40:45.310 --> 40:48.746 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
killed around them.

40:48.746 --> 40:54.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they have made this choice
that it would be better to take
a rubber dinghy across the

40:54.319 --> 41:00.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Aegean Sea than stay in their
hometowns in Syria. But we have
also heard stories from

41:00.491 --> 41:05.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
women who have been in Lebanon
and Jordan that their conditions
have deteriorated over

41:05.897 --> 41:08.099 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

41:08.099 --> 41:14.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're not legally allowed, as
you probably know, to work. And
their savings have diminished.

41:14.706 --> 41:19.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're finding it very,
very difficult to survive.
There's a huge funding gap in

41:19.577 --> 41:24.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
humanitarian aid, I should add.
But they're unable to survive.
Their children are not

41:24.048 --> 41:26.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in school. And they're
pretty desperate.

41:26.818 --> 41:33.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You will hear from women that
they feel that they have no
option than to put themselves

41:33.157 --> 41:36.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in harm's way by getting
into a rubber dinghy.

41:36.227 --> 41:40.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What needs to
happen? What do these women
need?

41:40.198 --> 41:45.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH COSTA: Well, first, we
need, you know, safe and legal
alternatives. I mean, the fact

41:45.837 --> 41:49.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that people are taking such a
treacherous journey, I think
there are other ways of
addressing

41:49.340 --> 41:51.709 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this issue.

41:51.709 --> 41:57.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But while they are on the route,
we need to make sure that there
are protection services

41:57.115 --> 42:05.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in place. We need to make sure
that we do have gender and
gender-based violence experts

42:05.156 --> 42:13.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who can identify those who are
most vulnerable, who can try and
prioritize services for them.

42:13.030 --> 42:19.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we need to make sure that
they have access to some of the
most basic services such as

42:19.937 --> 42:26.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reproductive health care. A very
large number of the women that
we interviewed are pregnant.

42:26.277 --> 42:31.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know that, in this kind of
crisis, probably one in five
could be pregnant. And at least

42:31.716 --> 42:36.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
15 percent are going to have
complications during that
pregnancy.

42:36.687 --> 42:42.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what we saw are women giving
birth on route, not really being
able to stop at a

42:42.727 --> 42:50.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
health care center, feeling
that, if they stop and recover
from giving birth, that they

42:50.001 --> 42:56.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will miss the opportunity to
migrate to the destination
countries, which, as you know,

42:56.140 --> 43:02.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are Germany -- for a lot of
people, Germany and Sweden. And
they just feel that they cannot,

43:02.346 --> 43:07.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cannot stop, and they will be
separated from their family
members.

43:07.018 --> 43:12.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But one of the key factors for
people is to get the right
information. What we see that

43:12.123 --> 43:18.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
increases the protection risks
for women and children, for that
matter, is that they do

43:18.496 --> 43:24.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not know anything about where
they're going, what time trains
will be going, what time

43:24.068 --> 43:28.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the buses that are going to take
them over the border are going
to arrive.

43:28.039 --> 43:31.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so when there are some
services available, they're not
using them.

43:31.242 --> 43:34.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it
sounds terribly chaotic.

43:34.879 --> 43:39.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And just finally, I would say
that all this is happening as
European countries are
increasingly

43:39.617 --> 43:44.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
either closing or tightening
their borders because of the
rising fear of terrorism.

43:44.021 --> 43:49.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH COSTA: You know, we have
to remember and we must remember
in this discussion about

43:49.427 --> 43:54.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terrorism that refugees are
fleeing violence, they're
fleeing the kind of terror we're
talking

43:54.799 --> 44:02.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about, and that they are the
first victims of this violence,
and that they are not the

44:02.974 --> 44:05.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
source of the violence.

44:05.877 --> 44:11.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, when we talk about security
-- obviously, security is a
very, very legitimate concern

44:11.115 --> 44:16.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- we must also think about the
safety and the human rights of
the refugees.

44:16.787 --> 44:21.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sarah Costa, the
executive director of the
Women's Refugees Commission,

44:21.392 --> 44:22.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we thank you very much.

44:22.527 --> 44:27.598 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SARAH COSTA: Well, thank you.

44:27.598 --> 44:38.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Next: getting
smokers to quit and the impact
of a government campaign

44:38.543 --> 44:41.379 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
against tobacco.

44:41.379 --> 44:45.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Five years ago, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention
launched the first federal

44:45.316 --> 44:51.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
education campaign against
smoking. That includes an ad
campaign called "Tips From
Former Smokers."

44:51.923 --> 44:55.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Five years later, the government
says it has helped 400,000
smokers quit for good, and

44:55.927 --> 44:59.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
led millions of others
to try quitting.

44:59.697 --> 45:02.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown spoke with CDC
Director Dr. Thomas Frieden
about it and tobacco as a public

45:02.967 --> 45:04.936 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
health problem.

45:04.936 --> 45:08.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Dr. Frieden,
welcome once again.

45:08.239 --> 45:13.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Tips From Former Smokers," now,
why do you think this approach
and this kind of ad is

45:13.511 --> 45:15.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the right way to go?

45:15.446 --> 45:17.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. THOMAS FRIEDEN, Director,
Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention: Most Americans

45:17.181 --> 45:22.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who have ever smoked have
already quit. Most people who
still smoke want to quit.

45:22.787 --> 45:27.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hard-hitting ads like these help
them quit. And over the past
five years, hundreds of

45:27.925 --> 45:32.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thousands of Americans have
stopped smoking because these
courageous people have been

45:32.296 --> 45:36.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
willing to share their stories
of pain and suffering, so other
people don't have to go

45:36.167 --> 45:38.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
through the same problem
that they're going through.

45:38.903 --> 45:41.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, I want
to show one, so our audience can
get a flavor for what

45:41.172 --> 45:42.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you're talking about.

45:42.473 --> 45:46.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a woman from Tennessee.
Let's take a look at that.

45:46.711 --> 45:51.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KRISTY, Tennessee: I'm Kristy.
As a truck driver, I had a lot
of time to smoke. I also

45:51.315 --> 45:54.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
had severe shortness of
breath and a smoker's cough.

45:54.952 --> 46:01.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I knew I had to quit. So, for
six months, I used e-cigarettes.
Then I stopped. But the

46:01.058 --> 46:06.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whole time, I kept smoking
regular cigarettes, right up
until my lung collapsed. My tip
is,

46:06.163 --> 46:09.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
just cutting down on
cigarettes isn't enough.

46:09.400 --> 46:14.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Dr. Frieden,
what's the argument here, that
these ads work better than
anything

46:14.338 --> 46:17.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
else or in conjunction with
other things? How much of a
factor are you suggesting they

46:17.875 --> 46:19.076 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are?

46:19.076 --> 46:22.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. THOMAS FRIEDEN: These
ads are important.

46:22.113 --> 46:27.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A comprehensive tobacco control
program drives smoking rates
down the most and protects kids

46:27.351 --> 46:32.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the best. That includes high
prices for tobacco through tax
or minimum price. That includes

46:32.990 --> 46:38.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
making public places smoke-free,
so people don't get exposed to
secondhand smoke. That

46:38.629 --> 46:44.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
includes helping smokers quit,
because medications can double
or triple your odds of
succeeding

46:44.035 --> 46:47.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
if you try to quit, and
hard-hitting ads like this.

46:47.538 --> 46:51.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And hard-hitting ads like this
work. We have proven time and
again. And they work and at

46:51.342 --> 46:52.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an amazing cost-effectiveness.

46:52.543 --> 46:54.145 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

46:54.145 --> 46:58.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Explain that,
though, if I could interrupt
you.

46:58.449 --> 47:02.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you measure success?
Because you know there has been
a lot of debate about the
effectiveness

47:02.753 --> 47:05.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of this kind of advertising.

47:05.056 --> 47:08.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. THOMAS FRIEDEN: And this
kind of advertising is actually
very well proven to work. There

47:08.859 --> 47:12.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is no scientific doubt about it.

47:12.363 --> 47:18.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have different ways of
surveying people, of monitoring
behavior. We track the calls

47:18.269 --> 47:24.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to quit lines. Every time these
ads are on the air, quit line
calls skyrocket. And then

47:24.075 --> 47:27.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have analyzed people who call
the quit line and try to quit,
people who don't call

47:27.778 --> 47:32.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the quit line and try to quit
when these ads are on and when
these ads are off.

47:32.016 --> 47:38.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we have shown really
definitively in the prior year
campaigns that the impact is
quite

47:38.956 --> 47:49.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
large and life-saving. In fact,
for every $400 we spend on these
ads, we prevent -- we

47:49.567 --> 47:53.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prolong someone's life by at
least a year. And for every
$3,000 we spend on these ads,

47:53.037 --> 47:55.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we save somebody's life.

47:55.372 --> 47:59.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And so the
evidence is that it lasts
long-term? Surely, some of these

47:59.443 --> 48:05.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people would call the quit line,
try to give up, and then not
succeed and go back to smoking.

48:05.049 --> 48:07.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. THOMAS FRIEDEN: A lot of
people don't succeed the first
time, so we have looked

48:07.585 --> 48:10.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at long-term quitting.

48:10.621 --> 48:13.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you stay off cigarettes
for six or 12 months, the
likelihood is, you're going

48:13.991 --> 48:18.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to stay off for life and for a
much healthier life as well.

48:18.129 --> 48:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The woman in that
ad mentioned e-cigarettes. And
that, for you, is part of

48:22.600 --> 48:25.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this as well, right, as more
people turn to that. You are
also trying to say that is not

48:25.669 --> 48:27.471 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a solution?

48:27.471 --> 48:32.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. THOMAS FRIEDEN: Well, on
e-cigarettes, first off, for
kids, no form of tobacco is

48:32.710 --> 48:36.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
safe. They shouldn't be using
e-cigarettes or any form of
tobacco.

48:36.781 --> 48:43.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For adults who try to quit, it
will only really make a
difference in your health and
make

48:43.087 --> 48:47.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you avoid the problems of --
allow you to avoid the problems
of smoking if you quit

48:47.792 --> 48:51.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
completely. The key is
to quit completely.

48:51.662 --> 48:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If e-cigarettes allow you to
quit completely, great for you.
But for most people who are

48:56.100 --> 48:59.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
using e-cigarettes, they're
still smoking, and that's a
problem.

48:59.537 --> 49:03.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, finally,
when you put this in the big
picture, the general trends

49:03.073 --> 49:06.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for smoking in the U.S. still
heading in the right direction?

49:06.811 --> 49:10.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. THOMAS FRIEDEN: We have made
progress, but, still, more than
40 million Americans

49:10.447 --> 49:12.550 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
smoke.

49:12.550 --> 49:19.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And every year, 480,000
Americans are killed by tobacco.
And for everyone who dies,
another

49:19.390 --> 49:26.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
30 live with disabling,
disfiguring conditions from
tobacco. It remains the leading
preventable

49:26.530 --> 49:31.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cause in this country, and we
can do more to reduce smoking
rates and protect our kids.

49:31.135 --> 49:35.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Dr. Thomas
Frieden of the CDC, thanks so
much.

49:35.072 --> 49:45.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DR. THOMAS FRIEDEN:
Thank you very much.

49:45.716 --> 49:51.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And now
another in our Brief But
Spectacular series, where we ask
interesting

49:51.021 --> 49:54.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people to describe
their passion.

49:54.158 --> 49:59.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from writer
A.J. Jacobs, an editor at
"Esquire" and the author of
several

49:59.063 --> 50:03.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
books, including "My Life as an
Experiment: One Man's Humble
Quest to Improve Himself."

50:03.634 --> 50:07.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He explains his unique brand
of immersive journalism.

50:07.204 --> 50:07.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A.J. JACOBS, Author, "My Life as
an Experiment: One Man's Humble
Quest to Improve Himself":

50:07.972 --> 50:12.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One of the secrets I have
learned is self-deception.

50:12.209 --> 50:16.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you pretend to be a little
bit of a better person, you
actually become a better person.

50:16.547 --> 50:20.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's easier to act your way into
a new way of thinking than to
think your way into a

50:20.618 --> 50:31.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
new way of acting. I didn't make
that up, by the way, but I love
it.

50:31.395 --> 50:37.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have been called the human
guinea pig, and I don't mind. I
think it's a fine title. I'm

50:37.201 --> 50:40.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a writer. And what I like to do
is just dive into my topics,
totally immerse myself, and

50:40.404 --> 50:43.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
change my lifestyle.

50:43.607 --> 50:48.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have done dozens of
experiments over the years. One
I did was called, what would
George

50:48.512 --> 50:54.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Washington do? I followed the
list of 110 rules of life that
the father of our country

50:54.618 --> 50:58.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wrote when he was a young man.
Some of them you might expect,
like honor your elders,

50:58.322 --> 51:00.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
others not so expected.

51:00.991 --> 51:06.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The second rule in this list is,
do not adjust your private parts
in public, solid rule.

51:06.597 --> 51:11.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have no problem with the rule,
but I would have put it a little
bit lower, like 85, 86.

51:11.535 --> 51:17.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I did one experiment called
radical honesty, the idea that
whatever is on your brain should

51:17.474 --> 51:22.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
come out of your mouth, no
filter. That was one of the
worst months of my life. I feel

51:22.313 --> 51:26.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very lucky that I'm still
married and I still have a job,
because you can't believe the

51:26.984 --> 51:31.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
number of lies that we
tell on a daily basis.

51:31.422 --> 51:37.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I also did an experiment where I
tried to follow all the rules of
the Bible for a year.

51:37.094 --> 51:44.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I had to wear no mixed fibers. I
did stone adulterers, although I
used very small stones,

51:44.835 --> 51:48.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
like pebble-sized,
so no one got hurt.

51:48.839 --> 51:55.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My latest project, I'm helping
to build a family tree of the
entire world. I have learned

51:55.112 --> 52:01.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about all these distant cousins,
including Barack Obama, who is
literally my fifth great

52:01.385 --> 52:06.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aunt's husband's brother's
wife's seventh great nephew.
That is true and verifiable.

52:06.657 --> 52:11.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I actually think everyone should
try experimenting with their
lives. You don't need to grow a

52:11.895 --> 52:17.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
huge beard and live by the rules
of the Bible. You can try not
gossiping for a week, or try

52:17.201 --> 52:23.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to -- a different toothpaste or
a new way to get to work,
anything to jostle the neurons

52:23.107 --> 52:28.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and create these new pathways,
and just make your life a little
more interesting.

52:28.512 --> 52:35.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My name is A.J. Jacobs, and this
is my Brief But Spectacular take
on my life as an experiment.

And a news update before we
leave you tonight. The water
crisis in Flint, Michigan, has
forced

52:58.776 --> 53:04.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the regional director of the
Environmental Protection Agency
to resign. The EPA also

53:04.314 --> 53:07.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issued an emergency order to
ensure the state and city
immediately take actions to
protect

53:07.851 --> 53:11.455 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
human health.

53:11.455 --> 53:16.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online: Najat
Abdul Samad was a young girl in
Syria when she began writing

53:16.894 --> 53:22.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
poems and stories. Today, she is
one of the literary voices
speaking out from the war-torn

53:22.166 --> 53:26.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country about what she calls
Syria's threat to existence. You
can find an interview with

53:26.637 --> 53:32.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her, and two of her newly
translated pieces, on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:32.709 --> 53:35.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
