04:12.767 --> 04:13.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFFICERS AND POLICE EXPERTS WILL

04:13.967 --> 04:15.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGREE THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH

04:15.667 --> 04:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRAINING AMONG POLICE OFFICERS,

04:19.800 --> 04:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE SHOT

04:22.833 --> 04:25.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE IN CHASES AND THEY

04:25.167 --> 04:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE ARMED.

04:27.033 --> 04:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRAINING IS DEFINITELY

04:28.500 --> 04:29.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NECESSARY.

04:29.300 --> 04:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I'M GOING TO QUOTE FROM THE

04:31.000 --> 04:32.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPORT, IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES

04:32.867 --> 04:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN WHICH POLICE SHOT AND KILLED

04:35.233 --> 04:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A PERSON WHO HAD ATTACKED, THE

04:38.233 --> 04:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERSON WHO WAS SHOT WAS WHITE.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT ONLY TELLS PART OF THE

04:42.033 --> 04:42.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STORY, RIGHT?

04:42.467 --> 04:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> CORRECT, THAT IS PART OF THE

04:43.433 --> 04:44.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STORY.

04:44.167 --> 04:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE KNOW THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

04:45.933 --> 04:47.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY ARE WHITE.

04:47.667 --> 04:49.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN MAKE UP

04:49.367 --> 04:50.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT 6% OF THE POPULATION AND

04:50.767 --> 04:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN IT COMES TO UNARMED

04:52.833 --> 04:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSPECTS BLACK MEN MAKE UP ABOUT

04:54.433 --> 04:55.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
40% OF BOTH MEMBERS.

04:55.567 --> 04:58.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THERE IS A DISPROPORTIONATE

04:58.100 --> 05:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NUMBER THERE IN TERMS OF UNARMED

05:00.500 --> 05:01.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN THAT WERE

05:01.567 --> 05:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KILLED BY POLICE.

05:02.233 --> 05:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT

05:03.633 --> 05:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THE ROLE THAT VIDEO LAST

05:05.200 --> 05:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLAYED IN THESE SHOOTINGS.

05:07.133 --> 05:09.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> VIDEO IS VERY INTERESTING

05:09.267 --> 05:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE TEN YEARS AGO, YOU AT

05:10.400 --> 05:12.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANY TIME HAVE PEOPLE TAKING

05:12.467 --> 05:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PICTURES ON CELL PHONE CAMS CAM

05:13.833 --> 05:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAST AND NOW YOU DO.

05:14.933 --> 05:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE

05:16.733 --> 05:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRIMARY REASONS IN THE INCREASE

05:18.733 --> 05:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN INDICTMENTS FROM OFFICERS

05:20.733 --> 05:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THERE IS EVIDENCE.

05:21.700 --> 05:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO QUESTION

05:22.733 --> 05:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WORD OF NOT ALL POLICE

05:23.933 --> 05:24.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFFICERS BUT SOME POLICE

05:24.633 --> 05:27.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFFICERS IN THIS CASE.

05:27.667 --> 05:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THERE IS EVIDENCE TO

05:28.733 --> 05:29.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROSECUTE.

05:29.267 --> 05:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IS AN UPTICK

05:31.033 --> 05:33.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE NUMBER OF INDICTMENTS.

05:33.067 --> 05:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS YEAR TWO OR THREE TIMES

05:34.933 --> 05:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE INDICTMENTS OF OFFICERS

05:36.300 --> 05:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAN THERE HAVE BEEN IN YEARS

05:37.800 --> 05:38.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAST.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRIOR THERE HAVE BEEN FOUR EVERY

05:40.700 --> 05:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEAR, FOUR OR FIVE A YEAR IN THE

05:42.400 --> 05:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAST DECADE AND NOW YOU SEE IN

05:43.833 --> 05:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LAST YEAR ABOUT 18.

05:45.100 --> 05:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE DIFFERENCE THAT WE SEE

05:46.400 --> 05:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE SEEING MORE

05:50.233 --> 05:51.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDICTMENTS MORE CHARGES OF

05:51.000 --> 05:52.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFFICERS YOU'RE ACTUALLY SEEING

05:52.167 --> 05:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OUTCOMES ARE A LITTLE LESS

05:54.400 --> 05:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEVERE BECAUSE MOST OF THOSE

05:55.700 --> 05:57.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFFICERS ARE EITHER BEING

05:57.167 --> 05:58.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACQUITTED, THEIR CASES ARE

05:58.867 --> 05:59.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISMISSED OR THE CHARGES ARE

05:59.967 --> 06:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DROPPED.

06:00.633 --> 06:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> AND I UNDERSTAND THAT

06:02.333 --> 06:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATISTICS ABOUT THESE FATAL

THAT?

06:08.833 --> 06:11.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

BY THE FBI AND THE BUREAU OF

06:32.500 --> 06:33.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHAT WE FOUND AT THE

06:33.667 --> 06:34.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WASHINGTON POST IS THAT OUR

06:34.967 --> 06:36.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NUMBER IS NEARLY TWICE THAT OF

06:36.167 --> 06:37.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NUMBER THAT'S ACTUALLY PUT

OUT BY THE FBI.

06:38.700 --> 06:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TRADE IN YOUR FOOD-STAMPS FOR

09:34.133 --> 09:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASH, AND THAT'S THE KIND OF

09:35.300 --> 09:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BARTER THAT WE MOST COMMONLY

09:36.000 --> 09:37.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THEY FEEL THAT IT'S ACTUALLY A

09:42.267 --> 09:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRIMINAL THING TO DO, AND

09:43.300 --> 09:45.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY IT IS PUNISHABLE BY LAW

AT QUITE A SEVERE DEGREE, BUT

10:01.400 --> 10:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOING SO MUCH, HOW IS IT THAT

10:03.733 --> 10:05.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE STILL THIS MANY PEOPLE

10:05.767 --> 10:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

CRACKS?

10:08.300 --> 10:09.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO THIS IS THE REAL STORY

10:09.167 --> 10:11.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE, RIGHT?

10:11.900 --> 10:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

MILLION ADULTS AND ABOUT 10

10:14.933 --> 10:16.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILLION CHILDREN ON WELFARE.

10:16.867 --> 10:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE REFORMED WELFARE IN 1996.

10:19.400 --> 10:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE REPLACED IT WITH A PROGRAM

10:20.633 --> 10:22.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CALLED TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE TO

10:22.067 --> 10:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEEDY FAMILIES.

10:23.933 --> 10:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE ONLY HAVE NOW A MILLION

10:25.700 --> 10:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADULTS LEFT ON THE ROLLS, HALF

10:27.733 --> 10:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

MEDICAID IS VITAL, THESE ARE

10:39.700 --> 10:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINGS THAT SEPARATE US FROM THE

>> Sreenivasan: IF SOMEONE WAS

10:43.500 --> 10:44.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO LOOK AT THOSE NUMBERS

10:44.433 --> 10:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SAY, LISTEN, ISN'T THAT A

10:45.200 --> 10:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIGN OF SUCCESS?

10:49.333 --> 10:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIDN'T WE-- GETTING PEOPLE OFF

10:50.133 --> 10:50.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WELFARE ROLLS, ISN'T THAT

10:50.967 --> 10:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE END GOAL?

10:52.000 --> 10:53.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IF WE HAVE FEWER PEOPLE ON

10:53.767 --> 10:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELFARE THAN WE HAVE TODAY,

10:55.333 --> 10:56.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AREN'T WE BETTER OFF AS A

10:56.067 --> 10:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRY?

10:57.333 --> 10:58.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO YES, IF THOSE PEOPLE WENT

10:58.100 --> 10:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO WORK.

10:59.800 --> 11:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WAS THE GOAL OF THE

11:01.233 --> 11:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND WORK

11:02.833 --> 11:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 1996-- THE

11:05.200 --> 11:06.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELFARE REFORM BILL, THAT PEOPLE

11:06.067 --> 11:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD TAKE PERSONAL

11:07.400 --> 11:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESPONSIBILITY AND GO TO WORK.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WE DO SEE A LOT OF WORK

11:10.400 --> 11:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTIVITY AMONG THE TWO DOLLAR A

11:11.133 --> 11:12.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAY POOR.

11:12.500 --> 11:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF YOU LOOK AT CHILDREN IN THAT

11:14.433 --> 11:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CATEGORY, 70% OF THEM HAVE A

11:16.233 --> 11:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORKER IN THE HOUSEHOLD AT SOME

11:17.600 --> 11:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POINT DURING THE YEAR.

11:19.400 --> 11:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THESE ARE FAMILIES HANGING ON

11:21.600 --> 11:23.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO THE RAGGED END OF WORK.

11:23.967 --> 11:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONLY 10% CLAIM EVEN A DIME FROM

11:27.000 --> 11:29.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUR WELFARE PROGRAM, SO THEY'RE

11:29.467 --> 11:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT A DEPENDENT CLASS OF PEOPLE.

11:31.933 --> 11:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT'S STRIKING IS THAT THESE

11:34.533 --> 11:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOLKS REALLY SEE THEMSELVES AS

11:36.000 --> 11:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORKERS AND THEY FEEL VERY PROUD

11:37.600 --> 11:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THAT DESIGNATION.

11:39.233 --> 11:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WE CAN'T DENY THAT AT THE

11:41.100 --> 11:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOTTOM OF THE LABOR MARKET THERE

11:42.533 --> 11:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIMPLY AREN'T ENOUGH JOBS, MUCH

11:44.033 --> 11:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LESS GOOD JOBS TO GO AROUND.

11:46.233 --> 11:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: SO DID THE

WELFARE REFORM THAT WE TRIED TO

11:49.400 --> 11:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO IN '96 HAD ANY POSITIVE

11:50.433 --> 11:52.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BENEFITS?

11:52.067 --> 11:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT DID, AND IN FACT I THINK

11:53.400 --> 11:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE.

11:59.333 --> 12:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRIOR TO WELFARE REFORM, WE

12:00.600 --> 12:01.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PASSED SOMETHING CALLED THE

12:01.767 --> 12:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
E.I.T.C., THIS IS A WAGE SUBSIDY

12:03.400 --> 12:04.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR LOW-WAGE WORKERS, THAT

INCOME TAX CREDIT?

12:06.600 --> 12:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> ...YES, THE EARNED INCOME TAX

12:07.733 --> 12:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CREDIT, THAT IF YOU WORK FULL-

12:09.767 --> 12:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU WON'T BE POOR.

12:11.100 --> 12:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT IS A TREMENDOUS POLICY

12:12.200 --> 12:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUCCESS.

12:16.433 --> 12:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S MAYBE ONE OF THE MOST

12:17.433 --> 12:18.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUCCESSFUL POLICIES WE'VE EVER

GEOGRAPHICALLY THIS IS HAPPENING

12:35.533 --> 12:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO ONE GROUP MORE SO THAN
