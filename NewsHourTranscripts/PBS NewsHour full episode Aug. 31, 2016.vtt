so they have a tougher time
being taken seriously.

00:42.042 --> 00:47.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, having our support in terms
of, you know,
having someone to bounce ideas
off of, check

02:39.793 --> 02:43.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

the first elected woman
president of Brazil.

02:53.407 --> 02:56.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was no constitutional
reason to do it.

02:56.143 --> 03:00.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is just the beginning of a
coup that
will indiscriminately beat back
any progressive

03:00.380 --> 03:03.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

fired back

03:30.477 --> 03:31.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with rubber bullets.

03:31.611 --> 03:34.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

a 1945 food fight among local
children.

04:21.561 --> 04:27.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Revelers pelted each other with
160 tons of
tomatoes and left the town
covered in red

04:27.701 --> 04:28.668 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pulp.

04:28.702 --> 04:31.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some 20,000 locals and tourists
took part.

04:31.471 --> 04:35.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN (through translator): This
was crazy.

04:35.142 --> 04:38.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The tomatoes hit you very hard,
but it's an
experience that has to be lived.

04:38.945 --> 04:41.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This doesn't happen in any other
place.

04:41.114 --> 04:44.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many tomatoes hit my face, but
I'm happy I
have experienced it.

analyzing Donald Trump's meeting
with Mexico

04:57.230 --> 05:03.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Enrique Pena Nieto; a
glimpse into
life on the U.S.-Mexico border;
the controversy

05:03.670 --> 05:12.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
surrounding actor Nate Parker
ahead of his
new film "Birth of a Nation";
and much more.

05:12.245 --> 05:22.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We begin with
Donald Trump's
day trip to Mexico City.

05:22.956 --> 05:27.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It dominated the political
headlines and drew
even more attention to a
high-profile speech

05:27.160 --> 05:31.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he gives tonight on immigration.

05:31.765 --> 05:36.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was the unlikeliest of
summits, Donald
Trump, who launched his campaign
by speaking

05:36.770 --> 05:41.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Mexican immigrants as rapists
and criminals
and made other inflammatory
remarks.

05:41.041 --> 05:44.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
It is a great honor to be
invited by you,

05:44.844 --> 05:46.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. President, a great, great
honor.

05:46.746 --> 05:48.515 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

05:48.548 --> 05:51.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And President
Enrique Pena
Nieto, who's compared him to
Adolf Hitler.

05:51.985 --> 05:55.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ENRIQUE PENA NIETO, Mexican
President (through
translator): I have also voiced
the grievances

05:56.022 --> 05:59.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we have felt in Mexico
because of the
statements that have been
issued.

05:59.826 --> 06:04.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I'm sure that his interest
is genuine
in wanting to build a
relationship and lead

06:04.164 --> 06:05.999 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our societies to stability.

06:06.032 --> 06:09.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Trump agreed
today on building
a relationship, but he has also
repeatedly

06:10.003 --> 06:12.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
called for building a wall along
the border.

06:12.339 --> 06:14.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We did discuss the
wall.

06:14.140 --> 06:15.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We didn't discuss payment of the
wall.

06:15.842 --> 06:17.877 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That will be for a later date.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This was a very preliminary
meeting.

06:19.479 --> 06:21.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it was an excellent
meeting.

06:21.281 --> 06:25.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Lately, he's
seemed to suggest
his stance on immigration could
soften.

06:25.552 --> 06:30.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his visit today came hours
before he delivers
a major speech on the subject
this evening

06:30.290 --> 06:32.092 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Phoenix.

06:32.125 --> 06:38.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: This is a
humanitarian disaster,
the dangerous treks, the abuse
by gangs and

06:38.898 --> 06:46.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cartels and the extreme physical
dangers,
and it must be solved.

06:46.673 --> 06:48.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It must be solved quickly.

06:48.308 --> 06:52.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Trump's visit
to Mexico
City sparked protests there
today.

06:52.746 --> 06:58.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It also turned up the political
heat on Pena
Nieto, who's already widely
unpopular in Mexico.

06:58.652 --> 07:03.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A political rival, former
President Vicente
Fox, condemned the invitation to
Trump and

07:03.356 --> 07:04.791 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
even apologized.

07:04.824 --> 07:08.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VICENTE FOX, Former Mexican
President: He
is not welcome to Mexico.

07:08.762 --> 07:16.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By 130 million people, we don't
like him,
we don't want him, we reject his
visit.

07:16.303 --> 07:20.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Pena Nieto has
invited Democratic
nominee Hillary Clinton as well.

07:20.940 --> 07:25.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her campaign says she will meet
with him at
the appropriate time.

07:25.111 --> 07:30.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Today, she addressed the
American Legion Convention
in Cincinnati, and dismissed
Trump's Mexican

07:30.083 --> 07:32.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
trip as too little, too late.

07:32.052 --> 07:35.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
You don't build a coalition by
insulting our

07:35.355 --> 07:39.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
friends or acting like a loose
cannon.

07:39.592 --> 07:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it certainly takes more than
trying to
make up for a year of insults
and insinuations

07:46.666 --> 07:51.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by dropping in on our neighbors
for a few
hours and then flying home
again.

07:51.671 --> 07:55.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Clinton also
called for
strong American leadership in
the world, and

07:55.241 --> 07:57.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
accused Trump of advocating
retreat.

07:57.077 --> 08:03.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON:
Threatening to walk
away from our alliances,
ignoring the importance

08:03.550 --> 08:09.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they still are to us, is
not only wrong;
it's dangerous.

08:09.055 --> 08:18.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If I'm your president, our
friends will always
know America will have your
backs, and we

08:18.164 --> 08:19.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
expect you to have ours.

08:20.033 --> 08:23.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Trump is
scheduled to address
the same American Legion
Convention tomorrow.

08:23.303 --> 08:29.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For more on the
Mexico City meeting
between that nation's president
and GOP nominee

08:29.676 --> 08:33.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump, how it came to be,
and how it
was received, we turn now to
Ambassador Roger

08:34.013 --> 08:38.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Noriega, former assistant
secretary of state
in the George W. Bush
administration, and

08:38.985 --> 08:43.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dan Nowicki, national political
reporter for
The Arizona Republic.

08:43.089 --> 08:47.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dan Nowicki, since Donald Trump
is going to
be in your town tonight giving
this big immigration

08:47.260 --> 08:51.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speech, maybe you can answer
what Donald Trump
was hoping to accomplish with
the surprise

08:51.898 --> 08:54.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trip to Mexico, as well as with
the speech
tonight.

08:54.501 --> 08:56.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAN NOWICKI, The Arizona
Republic: Right.

08:56.403 --> 09:01.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well I think it gave him an
opportunity to
look presidential and kind of
look more serious

09:01.274 --> 09:03.009 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on immigration.

09:03.042 --> 09:07.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's been criticized a lot, and
a lot of the
criticism has focused on his
proposals as

09:07.046 --> 09:10.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
just not very serious or
realistic.

09:10.283 --> 09:14.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And first and foremost is his
significant
signature issue of building the
wall and having

09:14.687 --> 09:15.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mexico pay for it.

09:15.688 --> 09:17.323 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it was a little interesting.

09:17.357 --> 09:22.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He went down to Mexico and
didn't raise the
issue of Mexico paying for the
wall.

09:22.996 --> 09:28.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So I think it's a little
interesting to see
if kind of the soft-spoken tone
that Trump

09:28.501 --> 09:32.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
took in Mexico City will carry
over across
the border when he comes here in
Phoenix.

09:32.372 --> 09:39.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have covered several Trump
rallies here
in Arizona and one in Las Vegas,
and, you

09:39.579 --> 09:44.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
know, one of the biggest
applause lines is
building the wall, where he
leads the audience

09:44.050 --> 09:46.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in asking them who's going to
pay for the
wall.

09:46.386 --> 09:47.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They yell Mexico.

09:47.787 --> 09:49.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I wonder if he's going to
use that line
tonight in Phoenix.

09:49.989 --> 09:50.957 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Hmm.

09:50.990 --> 09:52.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, we will be listening to
see.

09:52.792 --> 09:57.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ambassador Noriega, if Donald
Trump was trying
to look presidential with this
trip, what

09:57.530 --> 09:59.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was President Pena trying to do?

09:59.399 --> 10:05.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROGER NORIEGA, American
Enterprise Institute:
I think Pena Nieto was taking a
big risk taking

10:05.038 --> 10:06.239 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on this meeting.

10:06.272 --> 10:09.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's extraordinarily unpopular
already in
Mexico.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And in the last 24 hours...

10:11.044 --> 10:13.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: His popularity
somewhere in the
20s.

10:13.713 --> 10:17.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROGER NORIEGA: In the 20s,
mid-20s perhaps,
probably going down.

10:17.250 --> 10:22.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the last 24 hours, Mexican
pundits were
saying, you know, he'd better
confront Trump

10:22.922 --> 10:28.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on some of the uglier things
that he has said,
he better defend the dignity of
the Mexican

10:28.962 --> 10:31.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people and Mexican immigrants.

10:31.464 --> 10:35.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He should make it very clear
that Mexico will
have nothing to do with paying
for whatever

10:35.935 --> 10:37.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kind of wall Trump wants to
build.

10:37.937 --> 10:39.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And none of that happened.

10:39.239 --> 10:42.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, he did talk
about respecting
Mexican people.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He did talk about that.

10:44.277 --> 10:48.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROGER NORIEGA: Right, but
nothing in the form
of an apology or some kind of
acknowledgment

10:48.615 --> 10:50.416 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from Trump.

10:50.450 --> 10:55.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think, quite frankly, if
you're a Trump
supporter today, you would have
to say that

10:55.922 --> 11:00.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he achieved his objective by
swooping into
town with this kind of drive-by
diplomacy,

11:00.326 --> 11:03.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but Pena Nieto had a very bad
day.

11:03.596 --> 11:06.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Do we think that
Pena Nieto maybe
had a change of heart?

11:06.733 --> 11:09.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is the man who likens
Donald Trump
to Mussolini and Hitler.

11:09.903 --> 11:14.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROGER NORIEGA: Well, there is no
telling what
-- how the discussions went.

11:14.574 --> 11:23.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I'm sure that pundits, the
Mexican people
would have expected a much more
forceful public

11:23.616 --> 11:31.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
statement from their president
while Trump
was there as a guest of the
president in Mexico

11:31.491 --> 11:33.259 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
City.

11:33.293 --> 11:37.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Dan Nowicki, we know
that Donald
Trump isn't very popular among
Hispanics in

11:37.664 --> 11:43.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
general, Mexican-Americans
perhaps in particular,
and I wonder whether this kind
of appearance,

11:43.336 --> 11:49.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this kind of joint appearance,
might open
up lines of communication, or is
everything

11:49.208 --> 11:50.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
set in stone at this point
politically?

11:50.944 --> 11:55.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN NOWICKI: Yes, I don't really
think his
audience is, you know, the
Latinos in the

11:55.715 --> 11:57.483 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
United States.

11:57.517 --> 12:01.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think he's kind of aiming more
at some of
the moderate Republican white
people who he's

12:01.955 --> 12:04.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lost, especially here in
Arizona.

12:04.424 --> 12:09.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's hemorrhaged a lot of a
moderate Republicans
who normally would be backing
the presidential

12:09.829 --> 12:15.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nominee of their party, but this
year are
making a pretty close race with
Hillary Clinton

12:15.034 --> 12:18.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in what is usually,
traditionally, a red state,
Arizona.

12:18.605 --> 12:23.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We talked a bit
about the building
the wall idea, the border
discussion, but

12:23.476 --> 12:26.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there were other issues which
apparently were
raised during this conversation.

12:26.512 --> 12:30.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of them that they don't
agree about, Roger
Noriega, is NAFTA.

12:30.950 --> 12:34.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump says he thinks it's
a disaster
and has stolen American jobs.

12:34.220 --> 12:36.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's not what we heard
from President
Pena Nieto.

12:36.155 --> 12:44.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROGER NORIEGA: Well, the very
superficial
joint press conference really
didn't touch

12:44.430 --> 12:51.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on any detail on the terms of
NAFTA and the
mutual beneficial relationships.

12:51.371 --> 12:55.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's because Trump, quite
frankly, I
think, is incapable of carrying
on a serious

12:55.908 --> 13:01.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conversation about the details
of the benefits
that accrue to the United States
in terms

13:02.015 --> 13:11.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of our national security, our
economic security,
the number of jobs created by
NAFTA, six million

13:11.357 --> 13:16.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
jobs in the United States
created by trade
with Mexico alone.

13:16.996 --> 13:22.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that there was a
failure on Pena
Nieto to make that in a strong
way.

13:22.168 --> 13:27.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As a matter of fact, his
suggestion that there
are parts of NAFTA that could be
renegotiated

13:27.440 --> 13:33.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think was kind of a
capitulation because,
there was a failure to address
the genuine

13:33.613 --> 13:44.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
benefits that we accrue from
NAFTA and, frankly,
challenge Trump's failure to
command the details

13:44.090 --> 13:45.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and understand those details.

13:45.925 --> 13:48.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Dan Nowicki, let's
talk politics
for a minute, because you had a
big primary

13:48.895 --> 13:50.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in your state yesterday.

13:50.697 --> 13:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John McCain, who has endorsed
Donald Trump,
but not enthusiastically, did
very well.

13:54.634 --> 13:57.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeff Flake, the other senator,
has been very
anti-Trump.

13:57.870 --> 14:02.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in a moment like this today
and in a turn
like that he pulled off today,
did he manage

14:02.575 --> 14:07.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to trump Hillary Clinton on a
day when there
was very little attention paid
to her big

14:07.480 --> 14:08.448 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
speech?

14:08.481 --> 14:09.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAN NOWICKI: Well, I think he
did.

14:09.916 --> 14:11.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think he certainly stole the
spotlight.

14:11.684 --> 14:15.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think if you're in Hillary
Clinton's
campaign, you have got to be
scratching your

14:15.221 --> 14:19.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
head a little bit and wondering
if you missed
an opportunity here as well.

14:19.459 --> 14:22.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, whether or not he's
going to win
over something like Jeff Flake,
who has been

14:23.029 --> 14:24.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very critical of him, remains to
be seen.

14:25.031 --> 14:30.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think Flake has kind of
been encouraging
him to go in this direction and
kind of reach

14:30.269 --> 14:35.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out to Latinos in the United
States and also
kind of cut back on the
anti-Mexico rhetoric.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So it might help a little bit on
that end.

14:38.010 --> 14:42.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And what are the
expectations,
Dan, tonight for tonight's
speech in Phoenix?

14:42.215 --> 14:47.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN NOWICKI: Well, I think
everyone really
wants to know what Trump is
going to say about

14:47.820 --> 14:52.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the estimated 11 million
undocumented immigrants
who have settled in the United
States.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, that's kind of a big
question.

14:54.227 --> 14:59.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't think any of the
immigration reformers
are really expecting him to
change much.

14:59.132 --> 15:02.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think they see this as a lot
of more of
the same.

15:02.902 --> 15:08.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think if you hear him saying
something like,
oh, we're going to enforce the
laws, we're

15:08.407 --> 15:12.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to secure the border, I
think you're
just going to see him basically
sticking with

15:12.578 --> 15:17.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what he's been saying all along,
maybe wording
it a little bit more moderately.

15:17.483 --> 15:23.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But no one really expects him to
go too far
in terms of embracing any kind
of, you know,

15:23.523 --> 15:25.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
comprehensive immigration reform
or anything
like that.

15:25.458 --> 15:28.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, finally,
Ambassador Noriega,
was today in the end a
discipline test for

15:28.761 --> 15:32.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
both the Mexican president and
the Republican
presidential nominee?

15:32.265 --> 15:34.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROGER NORIEGA: Right.

15:34.100 --> 15:40.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think certainly Trump passed
that test in
being able to sort of carry on
this moderate

15:40.740 --> 15:44.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
discourse and not offend anybody
in particular.

15:44.043 --> 15:47.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the other hand, I think, for
Pena Nieto,
a bad day.

15:47.213 --> 15:48.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's already very unpopular.

15:48.815 --> 15:52.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that the political
implications in
Mexico will be bad for his
party.

15:52.518 --> 15:54.220 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: OK.

15:54.253 --> 15:57.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ambassador Roger Noriega and Dan
Nowicki of
The Arizona Republic, thank you
both very

15:57.056 --> 15:58.024 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

15:58.057 --> 15:59.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAN NOWICKI: Thanks.

15:59.859 --> 16:02.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Online, we take
another look at
the stakes behind Donald Trump's
immigration

16:02.562 --> 16:04.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
speech in Arizona tonight.

16:04.230 --> 16:15.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can watch a stream of that
speech on our
home page, PBS.org/NewsHour.

16:15.775 --> 16:28.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Perhaps the
most repeated
theme in Republican nominee
Donald Trump's

16:28.421 --> 16:31.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaign is building a bigger,
better, border
wall.

16:31.858 --> 16:37.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Currently, a fence runs along
652 miles of
the almost 2,000-mile border.

16:37.864 --> 16:43.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And many residents on both sides
doubt a new
wall is a solution to the
problems they face.

16:43.302 --> 16:48.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Angela
Kocherga with
Arizona PBS' Cronkite News
reports from Nogales.

16:48.941 --> 16:55.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGELA KOCHERGA: Every evening,
Melissa Biskofsky
and her dog take a walk.

16:55.448 --> 16:59.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MELISSA BISKOFSKY, Arizona: I
love my walks,
and my dog loves them too.

16:59.452 --> 17:03.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGELA KOCHERGA: Her favorite
route runs along
the border fence in Arizona.

17:03.489 --> 17:08.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MELISSA BISKOFSKY: The fence --
well, yes,
there is a fence, but I say to
hello to everybody

17:08.494 --> 17:11.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on the other side of the fence.

17:11.063 --> 17:18.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
We're going to have a strong
border.

17:18.838 --> 17:19.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're going to have the wall.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're going to have the wall.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA KOCHERGA: With all the
talk of building
a big wall, some Americans may
not realize

17:23.342 --> 17:27.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
illegal immigration from Mexico
is at a historic
low.

17:27.647 --> 17:34.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there has never been
security on the Southwest
border, including hidden ground
sensors, cameras.

17:34.553 --> 17:39.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This one offers a view from a
blimp high above
West Texas.

17:39.692 --> 17:46.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Border Patrol has never
had more agents,
21,000 in all.

17:46.399 --> 17:53.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
About 650 miles of fence exist
in strategic
spots along the nearly
2,000-mile Southwest

17:53.906 --> 17:59.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
border, from California, where
the structure
extends into the Pacific Ocean,
to Texas,

17:59.812 --> 18:03.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where it runs parallel to the
Rio Grande.

18:03.182 --> 18:07.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fernando Flores Barrera can see
the fence
in Tijuana from his front yard.

18:07.253 --> 18:13.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The construction worker has
crossed back and
forth for decades to work on
U.S. job sites.

18:13.125 --> 18:17.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says Donald Trump should
think twice about
building a border wall.

18:17.463 --> 18:22.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FERNANDO FLORES BARRERA,
Immigrant (through
translator): He should let
immigrants work,

18:22.902 --> 18:25.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
instead of blocking their path.

18:25.404 --> 18:32.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just as we help them, the
Americans, by working,
they should give us a hand.

18:32.745 --> 18:34.613 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You need us too.

18:34.647 --> 18:38.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA KOCHERGA: On the U.S.
side of the border,
Callai Hernandez also questions
the need for

18:38.818 --> 18:43.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump's $25 billion wall, since
there's a
big fence in place now.

18:43.856 --> 18:47.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CALLAI HERNANDEZ, Arizona: I
don't think there's
a need for it.

18:48.027 --> 18:49.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We don't feel unsafe or
anything.

18:49.929 --> 18:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA KOCHERGA: Her son's
soccer team practices
in Eagle Pass right near the
international

18:54.834 --> 18:57.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
border, the banks of the Rio
Grande.

18:57.970 --> 19:03.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of longest sections of
border fence cuts
through the Desert Southwest.

19:03.676 --> 19:08.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fence is found in the middle
of bustling
border cities like Nogales,
where, here, it's

19:08.848 --> 19:13.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
part of the landscape, a
fixture, a fact of
life.

19:13.452 --> 19:18.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Biskofsky has a view of the
rust-colored fence
from her home perched on a hill
in Nogales,

19:18.357 --> 19:20.059 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Arizona.

19:20.092 --> 19:22.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MELISSA BISKOFSKY: When they
have parties
on the other side, you can hear
the music

19:22.695 --> 19:25.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on Saturdays or Fridays.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're pretty loud.

19:27.366 --> 19:32.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA KOCHERGA: She's so close
to the border,
people trying to sneak into the
U.S. sometimes

19:32.038 --> 19:35.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cut through her backyard.

19:35.541 --> 19:41.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During our interview, Yemmi (ph)
and other
neighborhood dogs noticed this
man.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Before long, Border Patrol
agents spotted
him too.

19:45.017 --> 19:50.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many border residents doubt a
new wall will
keep people from trying to
cross, or deter

19:50.823 --> 19:52.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
drug traffickers at all.

19:52.691 --> 19:56.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Biskofsky doesn't have to look
far for proof.

19:56.162 --> 20:02.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two years ago, authorities
discovered a 481-foot
drug smuggling tunnel in the
basement of the

20:02.668 --> 20:04.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
home she now rents.

20:04.036 --> 20:07.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MELISSA BISKOFSKY: Well, this is
where they
would get the drugs.

20:07.306 --> 20:09.909 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANGELA KOCHERGA: The entrance is
now sealed.

20:09.942 --> 20:14.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The previous tenant chose the
property because
of its proximity to the border.

20:14.280 --> 20:18.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MELISSA BISKOFSKY: Well, when he
first arrived,
the neighbors told me that he
was dressed

20:18.584 --> 20:21.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in white and he was carrying a
Bible.

20:21.921 --> 20:24.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He had a dog called El Chapo.

20:24.723 --> 20:31.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, yes, the neighbors, after
everything
transpired, yes, that's when
they found it

20:32.031 --> 20:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
suspicious that his dog was
called El Chapo.

20:34.533 --> 20:39.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA KOCHERGA: As in convicted
drug trafficker
Chapo Guzman, who authorities
say has used

20:39.972 --> 20:45.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tunnels, including the one in
this house,
to move tons of drugs into the
U.S., in spite

20:45.578 --> 20:47.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of a border fence.

20:47.746 --> 20:51.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
These days, Biskofsky is
patching up holes
in her own fence.

20:51.217 --> 20:57.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MELISSA BISKOFSKY: If you go
along the fence,
every so often, you see a hole,
because she's

20:57.089 --> 21:01.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been digging all along the fence
to see where
she can get out.

21:01.994 --> 21:07.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGELA KOCHERGA: More proof
fences everywhere
are not 100 percent effective.

21:07.900 --> 21:13.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MELISSA BISKOFSKY: Building a
wall, and being
against building the wall, I
think it's still

21:13.372 --> 21:16.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not addressing the real problem.

21:16.041 --> 21:21.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA KOCHERGA: So far, there
has no political
will to deal with the root
causes of immigration

21:21.514 --> 21:23.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the growing demand for
drugs.

21:23.682 --> 21:29.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, during this hotly
contested presidential
race, much of the talk has been
about building

21:29.121 --> 21:35.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a bigger border wall, a
questionable solution,
according to many of those who
live in the

21:35.194 --> 21:37.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shadow of the border fence.

21:37.496 --> 21:43.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MELISSA BISKOFSKY: Because it
cannot separate
these communities.

21:43.269 --> 21:54.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA KOCHERGA: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm
Angela Kocherga in Nogales,
Arizona.

21:54.713 --> 22:02.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

22:02.521 --> 22:08.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
college students
become inventors, solving
crucial world problems;

22:08.194 --> 22:12.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and an author's take on what he
calls the
end of white Christian America.

22:13.032 --> 22:18.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: The filmmaker behind
one of the
more widely anticipated and
potentially controversial

22:18.971 --> 22:24.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
movies of the year is now at the
center of
his own controversy touching on
sexual assault,

22:24.944 --> 22:26.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
consent, and race.

22:26.845 --> 22:31.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a year when Hollywood's
troubles with diversity
have been well-chronicled, actor
and director

22:31.083 --> 22:35.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nate Parker film "Birth of a
Nation" promised
to be a breakthrough.

22:35.988 --> 22:40.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Parker's own tangled past
has changed
the conversation.

22:40.125 --> 22:47.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has
the story.

22:47.533 --> 22:52.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "The Birth of a
Nation" tells
the story of Nat Turner, who led
a bloody

22:52.137 --> 22:54.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
slave rebellion in Virginia in
1831.

22:54.206 --> 22:57.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATE PARKER, Actor/Director,
"The Birth of
a Nation": The lord has spoken
to me, visions

22:57.743 --> 23:00.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of what's to come, a rise of
good against
evil.

23:00.646 --> 23:02.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTOR: What are we going to do?

23:02.114 --> 23:03.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATE PARKER: We will fight.

23:03.415 --> 23:05.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Once it begins, our brothers and
sisters will
join.

23:05.751 --> 23:08.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will number in the
hundreds, thousands
even.

23:08.954 --> 23:13.425 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
JEFFREY BROWN:
Thirty-six-year-old Nate Parker
wrote, directed and starred in
the movie,

23:13.459 --> 23:17.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which first wowed audiences last
January at
the Sundance Film Festival.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Parker spoke of his motivation.

23:19.331 --> 23:23.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATE PARKER: When people asked
me who I wanted
to be like, I would say Nat
Turner.

23:23.369 --> 23:27.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, about two years ago, I
stepped away from
acting and said, the next film
I'm involved

23:27.740 --> 23:29.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with will be "The Birth of a
Nation."

23:29.508 --> 23:34.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The film won the
audience award
and the grand jury prize at
Sundance.

23:34.046 --> 23:40.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fox Searchlight bought its
rights for a festival
record $17.5 million, and its
national release

23:40.219 --> 23:41.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is due in October.

23:41.954 --> 23:48.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, earlier this month,
headlines emerged
about a 1999 rape allegation
made against

23:48.193 --> 23:51.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Parker when he was a student at
Penn State.

23:51.664 --> 23:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The alleged victim claimed she'd
been unconscious.

23:54.733 --> 23:57.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Parker was charged and later
acquitted.

23:57.303 --> 24:02.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parker's friend and "Birth of a
Nation" co-writer
Jean Celestin was also accused
in the case.

24:02.841 --> 24:06.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was convicted, but the
verdict was overturned
on appeal.

24:06.845 --> 24:11.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a recent interview with
"Variety" magazine,
Parker reiterated his claim that
the sex was

24:11.917 --> 24:13.585 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
consensual.

24:13.619 --> 24:18.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Seventeen years ago," he said,
"I experienced
a very painful moment in my
life.

24:18.524 --> 24:20.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It resulted in it being
litigated.

24:20.526 --> 24:21.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was cleared of it.

24:21.994 --> 24:22.961 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's that.

24:22.995 --> 24:25.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Seventeen years later, I'm a
filmmaker."

24:25.497 --> 24:30.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The remarks struck a nerve,
especially after
the revelation days later that
the alleged

24:30.402 --> 24:33.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
victim had killed herself in
2012.

24:33.739 --> 24:38.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Last week, in his first
interview since learning
about the suicide, Parker
changed his tone,

24:38.610 --> 24:43.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
telling "Ebony" magazine: "I was
acting as
if I was the victim, and that's
wrong.

24:43.615 --> 24:46.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
My only thought was, I'm
innocent and everyone
needs to I know.

24:46.885 --> 24:50.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I didn't even think for a second
about her."

24:50.656 --> 24:56.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also last week, the American
Film Institute
canceled a screening of the
movie.

24:56.362 --> 25:01.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we explore some of the
issues surrounding
this with Roxane Gay,
writer/author of the

25:01.500 --> 25:07.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
essay collection "Bad Feminist,"
and associate
professor at Purdue University,
and Mike Sargent,

25:07.172 --> 25:13.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chief film critic for Pacifica
Radio and co-president
of the Black Film Critics
Circle.

25:13.045 --> 25:14.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to both of you.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let me start with you, Roxane
Gay.

25:15.881 --> 25:20.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You wrote recently: "I am
struggling to have
empathy for Nate Parker, a man
experiencing

25:20.652 --> 25:24.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the height of his career, while
being forced
to reckon with his past."

25:24.089 --> 25:25.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, explain that.

25:25.391 --> 25:28.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Was there a conflict of emotions
when you
first learned of this?

25:28.627 --> 25:30.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROXANE GAY, Purdue University:
Absolutely.

25:30.929 --> 25:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, when you follow
someone's career
trajectory, and you see them at
the height

25:35.334 --> 25:40.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of their career with a
critically acclaimed
film that sold for a record
amount of money

25:40.672 --> 25:47.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at Sundance, of course I want
him to do very
well, I want the movie to
succeed.

25:47.579 --> 25:52.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I cannot overlook these
allegations against
him.

25:52.184 --> 25:58.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was acquitted, yes, but his
handling of
the incident troubles me.

25:58.957 --> 26:02.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fact that the incident
occurred at all
troubles me.

26:02.528 --> 26:08.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That he's still friends with the
man with
whom he was accused troubles me.

26:08.400 --> 26:14.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I want to have empathy
for him, but
I have far more empathy for the
victim and

26:14.907 --> 26:16.642 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for the truth.

26:16.675 --> 26:20.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Mike Sargent, I
assume you
were first aware of the film as
a filmmaker

26:20.746 --> 26:22.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
yourself and film critic.

26:23.015 --> 26:24.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What were your thoughts when you
learned about
this?

26:24.817 --> 26:28.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE SARGENT, Film Critic,
Pacifica Radio:
Well, I was conflicted on many
levels, because,

26:28.587 --> 26:34.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a filmmaker, you know, it's
great to see
a black filmmaker get to make
something.

26:34.760 --> 26:39.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Black historical dramas are not
easy to, A,
get made, and they don't
generally do too

26:39.765 --> 26:41.099 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
well.

26:41.133 --> 26:44.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As a film critic, of course, I
want to support
black filmmakers.

26:44.470 --> 26:48.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I'm also a father of a
daughter who's
in college.

26:48.140 --> 26:51.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So this strikes a particular
chord with me.

26:51.076 --> 26:56.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And similar to Roxane, his
handling of it
and his attitude about it, I
mean, he is,

26:56.582 --> 26:57.983 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
after all, a storyteller.

26:58.016 --> 27:02.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And very often, we tell
ourselves stories
that we begin to believe.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, I am conflicted.

27:04.490 --> 27:06.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I can't say I won't see the
film.

27:06.658 --> 27:08.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I definitely will.

27:08.460 --> 27:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, no, I don't think that he's
doing what
he could and probably should in
terms of atoning

27:15.133 --> 27:16.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for what has happened.

27:16.468 --> 27:20.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so, Roxane
Gay, what
should he be doing?

27:20.506 --> 27:23.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what should we as audience
members do?

27:23.141 --> 27:28.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You and others have said this
raises an old
question, right, about what --
can you love

27:28.180 --> 27:33.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the art, even while you hate or
disdain, or
whatever, the artist?

27:33.952 --> 27:35.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROXANE GAY: Absolutely.

27:35.554 --> 27:37.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's really challenging.

27:37.389 --> 27:41.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I myself, as I wrote in my
editorial for
The Times, cannot separate the
art and the

27:41.059 --> 27:43.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
artist, or I choose not to.

27:43.262 --> 27:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do think we have to have a
conversation
about restorative justice,
because, as a culture,

27:48.166 --> 27:53.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we do not know how to achieve
justice for
victims of sexual violence.

27:53.839 --> 27:59.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't think that someone's
life should
end because they commit a crime,
but I do

27:59.411 --> 28:01.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
want to see atonement.

28:01.346 --> 28:08.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do want to see him having more
self-examination
about the role that he played
that night,

28:08.587 --> 28:13.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because there was a third man
there, and he
recognized that it was a bad
situation and

28:13.091 --> 28:17.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that this young woman was
probably in no position
to consent, and he walked away.

28:17.396 --> 28:20.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But he -- but can
I say -- but
can I just interrupt you for a
second?

28:20.098 --> 28:21.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ROXANE GAY: Yes.

28:21.934 --> 28:26.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Because a bad
situation, but,
at least legally, no crime
committed, because

28:26.038 --> 28:28.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's worth saying again found
not guilty.

28:28.907 --> 28:35.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROXANE GAY: Well, legally, lots
of things
are allowed that shouldn't be
allowed.

28:35.280 --> 28:36.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was more than a mistake.

28:36.281 --> 28:38.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I consider it to have been a
crime.

28:38.283 --> 28:44.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that, when a woman is
passed out drunk,
she cannot consent, and that sex
shouldn't

28:44.823 --> 28:46.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be on the table in any way,
shape or form.

28:46.792 --> 28:48.560 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I call it rape.

28:48.594 --> 28:53.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, we don't know what
happened that
night, but I do think that I
would like to

28:53.532 --> 28:56.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
see just more acknowledgment.

28:56.535 --> 29:01.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the interview that Parker
did with "Ebony"
is a step in the right
direction, but it was

29:01.273 --> 29:07.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also the kind of interview where
you can tell
that he was really well-coached
by a publicist,

29:07.412 --> 29:12.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and he was saying most of the
right things,
while also just acknowledging
that he has

29:12.551 --> 29:18.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
never really thought about
gender, and that
he didn't really think about the
victim ever.

29:18.490 --> 29:20.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that troubles me.

29:20.425 --> 29:25.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Mike Sargent,
what about this
question of the art vs. the
artist, and especially

29:25.497 --> 29:31.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a case like this, as you both
have said,
that the role of race in both
the film and

29:31.403 --> 29:32.638 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the filmmaker?

29:32.671 --> 29:35.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE SARGENT: Well, I think the
role of race
is undeniable.

29:35.040 --> 29:42.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you know, there are
definitely filmmakers
who have done very, very more
than questionable

29:42.614 --> 29:47.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things, whether it's a Roman
Polanski or a
Woody Allen, and they have gone
to not only

29:47.285 --> 29:50.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have long careers, but win
Oscars.

29:50.355 --> 29:56.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the question does become,
can you separate
the artist from the art, and
should you?

29:56.228 --> 29:58.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And at what point have you
atoned?

29:58.130 --> 30:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At what point -- what could and
should he
be doing?

30:01.600 --> 30:03.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is a good question.

30:03.435 --> 30:06.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I have my own ideas of
what I think
he should do and how I think he
should address

30:06.471 --> 30:07.539 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

30:07.572 --> 30:09.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, again, like Roxane said,
he's being coached.

30:10.008 --> 30:17.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's being held -- there is a
way he needs
to present himself, so that they
can still

30:17.382 --> 30:19.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
do well with this film.

30:19.317 --> 30:23.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Mike Sargent, it
was announced
today that there is going to be
a press conference

30:23.455 --> 30:26.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he's speaking at, at the
Toronto Film
Festival in a few weeks.

30:26.692 --> 30:28.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What would you like him to say?

30:28.460 --> 30:33.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE SARGENT: Well, for me, I
would him to
-- as Roxane mentioned, I would
like some

30:33.765 --> 30:34.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more self-examination.

30:34.800 --> 30:37.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, let's look at this for a
little bit.

30:37.536 --> 30:44.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, even if he himself feels
that he didn't
commit this act, and if he felt
it was consensual,

30:44.976 --> 30:51.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, she went under, after
that, what
would be termed bullying after
that.

30:51.216 --> 30:52.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She became a victim.

30:52.984 --> 30:57.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, that is something that, as
a man and
as a father -- and he's got
daughters -- you

30:57.055 --> 31:00.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know, this is something he needs
to address,
all of it.

31:00.192 --> 31:01.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do we handle these things?

31:02.027 --> 31:03.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How should young men treat
themselves?

31:03.929 --> 31:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a lot of things that
he could be
doing and a lot of things he
could be addressing

31:08.533 --> 31:14.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in regards to this whole matter,
because this
matter is something that it's
not just about

31:14.406 --> 31:16.174 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
race.

31:16.208 --> 31:21.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's specifically about gender,
but it's also
about, you know, once you have,
let's say,

31:21.680 --> 31:24.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been acquitted of this, that
doesn't mean
you can turn your back on it.

31:24.616 --> 31:30.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was still something he was
involved
in that ended up contributing to
a woman's

31:30.522 --> 31:32.290 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
death.

31:32.324 --> 31:34.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so, let me
just ask,
finally, Roxane Gay, will you
see the film?

31:34.626 --> 31:36.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you think others should see
the fill?

31:36.795 --> 31:40.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROXANE GAY: I am not going to
see the film,
no.

31:40.732 --> 31:45.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I do think that people
should do what
they want to do.

31:45.871 --> 31:49.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The reality is that he's not the
only person
that worked on this movie.

31:49.107 --> 31:54.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is an entire cast and crew
that put
a lot of work and a lot of
really thoughtful

31:54.246 --> 31:56.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
work into the making of this
movie.

31:56.414 --> 31:59.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I am in no way suggesting
that other
people shouldn't.

31:59.317 --> 32:05.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just cannot personally do it,
for many reasons,
both personal and just ethical.

32:05.891 --> 32:08.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, Mike
Sargent, briefly,
will you see the film?

32:08.827 --> 32:12.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE SARGENT: Well, as a film
critic, I really
have to see the film.

32:13.031 --> 32:14.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have to be able to see the
film.

32:14.499 --> 32:17.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have to be able to judge it on
its own merits
as a film.

32:17.435 --> 32:24.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I can't ignore what happened
behind it,
and I can't ignore the history
behind the

32:24.176 --> 32:25.610 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
filmmaker.

32:25.644 --> 32:28.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Mike Sargent and
Roxane Gay,
thank you both very much.

32:28.246 --> 32:29.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROXANE GAY: Thank you.

32:29.548 --> 32:34.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MIKE SARGENT: Thank you.

32:34.186 --> 32:45.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: As students head
back to college
this year, some will be doing
more than just

32:45.497 --> 32:47.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the usual course work.

32:47.265 --> 32:52.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Cat Wise
has a story
about a group of student
inventors trying

32:52.370 --> 32:58.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make their mark, part of our
weekly series
covering the Leading Edge of
science and technology.

32:58.977 --> 33:05.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Music, wine, and ideas
were flowing
at an event in Portland, Oregon,
that brought

33:05.350 --> 33:09.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
together college students from
around the
country who have all been hard
at work, between

33:09.588 --> 33:14.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
classes and tests, inventing the
next big
thing.

33:14.860 --> 33:20.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
While the atmosphere was
festive, there was
some serious business going on.

33:20.899 --> 33:25.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fourteen teams pitched their
inventions to
invited guests, who were playing
the role

33:25.203 --> 33:30.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of venture investors for the
evening, with
venture bucks to invest in the
ballot boxes

33:30.208 --> 33:31.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of their favorite start-ups.

33:31.576 --> 33:34.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Back the team that you
think is going
to change the world.

33:34.379 --> 33:39.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: There were plenty of
cool ideas
to choose from, like a low-cost
water contamination

33:39.718 --> 33:44.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
detection system from an
all-women team of
engineers at Santa Clara
University, and a

33:44.789 --> 33:49.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
device to help babies with
respiratory distress
syndrome in low-resource
hospitals developed

33:49.794 --> 33:52.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by students at Western Michigan
University.

33:52.097 --> 33:57.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there was even a group from
a local high
school trying to tackle another
common problem

33:57.802 --> 34:01.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in many parts of the world, lack
of electricity
to charge cell phones.

34:01.339 --> 34:05.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM WU, West Salem High
School: We made
a thermoelectric generator that
can be used

34:05.710 --> 34:09.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in open fire to generate
electricity while
cooking.

34:09.147 --> 34:15.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The metal rod right here will go
directly
into the pot they're using for
cooking, and

34:15.987 --> 34:22.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the heat will go from the rod
into the thermal
electric generators that will
generate electricity

34:22.093 --> 34:23.828 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from the heat.

34:23.862 --> 34:26.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Many of the products
on display
are still in the early stages of
development,

34:26.965 --> 34:29.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and some build on ideas that are
already out
in the marketplace.

34:29.601 --> 34:37.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But a few of the teams have
created things
never invented before.

34:37.709 --> 34:41.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Katherine Jin is part of the
Kinnos team from
Columbia University.

34:41.379 --> 34:45.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She and her two co-founders, who
are also
her classmates, were inspired
when they saw

34:45.116 --> 34:48.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a need for better disinfection
methods during
the Ebola crisis in Africa.

34:48.887 --> 34:51.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN TYAN, Columbia University:
One of the
current problems with the way
people decontaminate

34:51.723 --> 34:56.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today is that the disinfectants
are clear
and transparent, so you can't
see where you're

34:56.661 --> 34:58.063 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
spraying.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They bounce off waterproof
surfaces, just
like rain off an umbrella.

34:59.931 --> 35:04.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: After some late nights
and a lot
of trial and error, they
developed Highlight,

35:04.569 --> 35:09.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a powder that adds temporary
color to bleach
and enhances adhesion to
surfaces.

35:09.307 --> 35:13.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Jason Kang, a biomedical
engineering major,
gave me a demo.

35:13.144 --> 35:15.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JASON KANG, Columbia University:
What we're
going to do is, we're going to
add highlight

35:15.513 --> 35:16.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
directly to the bleach.

35:16.514 --> 35:19.250 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I have poured it in here.

35:19.284 --> 35:21.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, once you add the powder,
it's really simple.

35:21.653 --> 35:23.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You just mix it, and it just
dissolves instantly.

35:24.022 --> 35:26.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: OK, so what's this
surface here
that you are going to spray?

35:26.157 --> 35:29.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JASON KANG: Yes, so this is
actually a square
cut from one of the suits that
doctors will

35:29.894 --> 35:32.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wear when they are treating
patients in the
field.

35:32.197 --> 35:33.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I'm going to spray it on
here.

35:33.598 --> 35:36.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, you can see that it fully
covers the surface.

35:36.601 --> 35:38.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's really easy to see where
you sprayed.

35:38.436 --> 35:40.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It has a nice sticky coverage.

35:40.705 --> 35:43.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will trap the viruses and
bacteria and
kill them.

35:43.608 --> 35:48.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: The event was
sponsored by a nonprofit
called VentureWell that provides
financial

35:48.079 --> 35:50.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
backing and training for
student-run start-ups.

35:50.949 --> 35:56.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The organization is funded by
the Lemelson
Foundation, which also helps
fund the "NewsHour."

35:56.054 --> 36:01.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over the course of two days
leading up to
the competition, students and
supportive faculty

36:01.292 --> 36:03.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
attended a variety of
skill-building workshops.

36:03.561 --> 36:09.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: The theme of today is
really around
communication and managing how
you are perceived.

36:09.667 --> 36:12.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, our theme here is how to
help your ideas
shine.

36:12.670 --> 36:18.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every single person is going to
have a one-minute
pitch and a five-word pitch.

36:18.143 --> 36:21.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Teams mixed up and
shared their
ideas with their peers.

36:21.513 --> 36:26.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Luke Neese is a former police
officer, and
a recent Texas A&amp;M grad, who has
developed

36:26.885 --> 36:30.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a system to detect gunshots
using sound waves.

36:30.121 --> 36:32.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUKE NEESE, Inventor: I started
off looking
at what was available in the
gunshot detection

36:32.123 --> 36:35.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
market, and everything was
ridiculously expensive.

36:35.393 --> 36:39.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEETH SMART, PHYSICLO: What
PHYSICLO does
is, we integrate resistance
bands and panels

36:39.130 --> 36:40.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into compression tights.

36:40.932 --> 36:44.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Keeth Smart developed
his sportswear
product while at Columbia
Business School.

36:44.736 --> 36:49.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also happens to be a former
professional
fencer who won silver at the
Beijing Olympics.

36:49.441 --> 36:54.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Smart launched his company last
year with
the help of $150,000 in
crowd-funding.

36:54.479 --> 36:57.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, he says, it's still hard to
get the word
out.

36:57.749 --> 37:02.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEETH SMART: We know that, like,
once we show
this product to people, they
will love it,

37:02.987 --> 37:05.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but getting it out there is a
big challenge
for most entrepreneurs.

37:05.757 --> 37:11.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Christina Tamer knows
well the challenges
that student entrepreneurs face.

37:11.729 --> 37:13.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's a program officer with
VentureWell.

37:13.598 --> 37:16.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINA TAMER, VentureWell:
First of all,
they're young, so they have a
tougher time

37:16.668 --> 37:18.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
being taken seriously.

37:18.470 --> 37:22.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, having our support in terms
of, you know,
having someone to bounce ideas
off of, to

37:22.674 --> 37:25.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
check their assumptions, look
through their
materials, and be a coach and a
mentor.

37:26.010 --> 37:31.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: For their part, the
Kinnos team
is moving full steam ahead with
Highlight,

37:31.349 --> 37:34.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
which they have been
field-testing in West
Africa.

37:34.719 --> 37:38.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We caught up with them in New
York as they
were making a new batch in a
Columbia University

37:38.656 --> 37:39.724 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
engineering lab.

37:39.757 --> 37:42.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They also had upcoming exams to
think about.

37:42.227 --> 37:45.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KATHERINE JIN, Columbia
University: I think
all of us have, at this point,
sacrificed

37:45.830 --> 37:49.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a test grade or even a class at
the end of
the day to complete something we
need to get

37:49.734 --> 37:50.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
done for the company.

37:50.969 --> 37:53.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: All of their hard work
is starting
to pay off.

37:53.438 --> 37:58.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have got their first
customer, not overseas,
as you might expect, but here in
the U.S.,

37:58.543 --> 38:02.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the New York City Fire
Department, which had
its own Ebola scare.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.781 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

38:03.815 --> 38:07.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID PREZANT, FDNY; As New York
City, we
are one of the entry points for
world travelers,

38:07.685 --> 38:09.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
especially world travelers from
West Africa.

38:09.854 --> 38:15.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, clearly, this was on our
agenda to prepare,
to be able to respond
effectively and safely.

38:15.293 --> 38:19.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Doctor David Prezant
is the chief
medical officer for the FDNY.

38:19.464 --> 38:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says Highlight has filled a
big need for
the department.

38:21.699 --> 38:23.434 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

38:23.468 --> 38:28.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID PREZANT: Now you have an
EMS worker
in full protective equipment,
knowing that

38:28.640 --> 38:33.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
protective equipment is really
good, but now,
when he is sprayed or she is
sprayed with

38:34.012 --> 38:39.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the bleach, they're able to look
at their
equipment, their hand, their
glove, and they

38:39.884 --> 38:41.719 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
see it's blue.

38:41.753 --> 38:46.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Back in Portland, as
the evening
competition wrapped up, the
teams who received

38:46.157 --> 38:48.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the most venture bucks were
announced.

38:48.092 --> 38:52.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: OK, this is what we have
been waiting
for.

38:52.997 --> 38:59.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first prize, with $96
million venture
bucks, they will be getting
$1,000, and it

38:59.837 --> 39:03.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
goes to -- it goes to Kinnos.

39:03.708 --> 39:05.777 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

39:05.810 --> 39:13.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: The team enjoyed their
win and then
quickly got back to work.

39:13.685 --> 39:17.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A few days later, they were
headed to Europe
to meet with the World Health
Organization

39:17.522 --> 39:19.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and Doctors Without Borders.

39:19.824 --> 39:23.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Cat
Wise in Portland
Oregon.

39:23.194 --> 39:27.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Kinnos team
recently graduated
from Columbia University, and
the three are

39:27.732 --> 39:30.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now working full-time on their
product.

39:30.401 --> 39:34.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The story is part of our regular
Breakthrough
coverage of invention and
innovation.

39:34.572 --> 39:39.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now to the
latest addition
to the "NewsHour" Bookshelf.

39:39.077 --> 39:42.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Religion has played a
significant role in
American culture and politics
for more than

39:42.880 --> 39:44.048 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
200 years.

39:44.082 --> 39:46.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the country's demographics
are rapidly
changing.

39:46.484 --> 39:51.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is the thesis put forward
by Robert Jones
in his new book, "The End of
White Christian

39:51.556 --> 39:52.657 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
America."

39:52.690 --> 39:54.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Judy Woodruff sat down with him
recently.

39:54.492 --> 39:57.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Robert Jones,
welcome to the
program.

39:57.495 --> 40:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, provocative title, "The End
of White Christian
America."

40:01.866 --> 40:07.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you say in the book what
you're really
asking is why white Protestant
America has

40:07.272 --> 40:09.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
experienced such a dramatic
decline.

40:09.574 --> 40:11.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why did you want to tackle that
question?

40:11.376 --> 40:13.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT JONES, Author, "The End
of White Christian
America": Well, thanks for
having me.

40:13.144 --> 40:19.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, when I was looking at
the data,
I realized that we had really
crossed this

40:19.250 --> 40:21.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very significant threshold in
American culture.

40:21.619 --> 40:27.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is that we had moved,
just in the
last eight years, from being a
majority white

40:27.692 --> 40:31.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Christian country, 54 percent in
2008, when
Barack Obama was running for
president the

40:31.829 --> 40:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first time, to being a minority
white Christian
country.

40:35.833 --> 40:39.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, we are 45 percent white
and Christian.

40:39.270 --> 40:43.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, when I use the term white
Christian America,
I am really referring to this
cultural and

40:43.841 --> 40:46.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
institutional world built
primarily by Protestants.

40:46.944 --> 40:52.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you think about the
cultural center
of the U.S. being a kind of
Waspy, white,

40:52.216 --> 40:55.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anglo-Saxon, Protestant culture,
that's the
culture that I'm talking about
and that has

40:55.720 --> 40:57.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really faded from the center of
American culture.

40:57.755 --> 41:01.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you talk --
excuse me -- and
you talk about how influential,
how powerful

41:01.693 --> 41:03.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's been in the history of this
country.

41:03.561 --> 41:05.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBERT JONES: Yes, absolutely.

41:05.363 --> 41:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, one of the books when I
was doing
the historical research put it
this way, from

41:09.233 --> 41:12.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an historian, said, if you were
in charge
of something big and important
in the middle

41:12.904 --> 41:17.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the 20th century, chances
are, you were
white, you were Protestant, and
you were male.

41:17.108 --> 41:20.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that really held sway all
the way up through
the latter part of the 20th
century.

41:20.878 --> 41:26.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And then what
started happening
in the -- you say roughly in the
'60s, 1970s

41:26.217 --> 41:28.119 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and beyond?

41:28.152 --> 41:30.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT JONES: Yes, we started
seeing some
of the shift with the kind of
cultural revolution

41:30.088 --> 41:34.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the 1960s, but we really see
it seize demographically
in the 1990s.

41:34.359 --> 41:36.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so just a couple of
examples.

41:36.060 --> 41:41.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the 1990s, for example, nine
in 10 Americans
claimed a religious affiliation.

41:41.232 --> 41:45.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, less than one in 10 said
they claimed
no religious affiliation at all.

41:45.670 --> 41:50.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Today, that number is 23
percent, and among
young people, it's 34 percent.

41:50.541 --> 41:55.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have seen this kind of
move away from
particularly white Christian
churches really

41:55.947 --> 41:57.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
since the 1990s to the present.

41:57.949 --> 42:01.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, that's the --
and that's
a change from previous
generations, that may

42:02.019 --> 42:08.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have moved away from churches
for a time during
their 20s, but came back to
establishment

42:08.359 --> 42:09.560 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
religion.

42:09.594 --> 42:10.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you're saying that didn't
happen -- hasn't
happened.

42:10.862 --> 42:12.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBERT JONES: That's right.

42:12.630 --> 42:15.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a really critical thing,
that every
generation has been less
affiliated in their

42:15.333 --> 42:17.001 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
20s.

42:17.034 --> 42:21.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's different about this
generation is
that it's much more unaffiliated
than any

42:21.272 --> 42:23.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
previous generation.

42:23.241 --> 42:27.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you compare them to the
baby boomers,
for example, this generation,
even if a proportion

42:27.345 --> 42:31.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of them comes back, they will
still be the
most unaffiliated generation
that the country

42:31.916 --> 42:33.651 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has ever seen.

42:33.684 --> 42:35.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Robert
Jones, you also
write, of course, about the
birth rate being

42:35.653 --> 42:39.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lower among white Protestants
and about the
phenomenon of immigration.

42:39.524 --> 42:40.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBERT JONES: Yes, that's right.

42:40.725 --> 42:42.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is an internal factor.

42:42.560 --> 42:46.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That is this kind of
disaffiliation, but the
external factors are important
here as well,

42:46.664 --> 42:52.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that it is rising numbers of
Latinos immigrating
particularly from Mexico, and
lower birth

42:52.437 --> 42:54.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rates among whites compared to
non-whites
as well.

42:54.138 --> 42:56.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so what are
the consequences
of this?

42:56.374 --> 42:58.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT JONES: Yes.

42:58.209 --> 43:03.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Well, I think it's very
important to understand
the heat that we're seeing in
our politics

43:03.481 --> 43:05.216 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

43:05.249 --> 43:08.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the things that I -- that
put me to
writing the book is, it always
seemed to me

43:08.085 --> 43:13.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, even when there were
controversial issues,
the rhetoric, the apocalyptic
rhetoric, the

43:13.825 --> 43:19.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
visceral nature of the rhetoric
always outstripped
the actual issues we were
talking about.

43:19.464 --> 43:23.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what I think is going on is
that many
-- the anxieties that many
particularly white

43:23.634 --> 43:29.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conservative Christians are
feeling is being
driven by this real sense of
loss and grief

43:29.807 --> 43:35.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this cultural world that they
and their
ancestors built and that used to
hold sway

43:35.246 --> 43:38.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the center of American
culture, and is
now really passing from the
scene.

43:38.649 --> 43:42.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're explaining
part of what's
going on in the support for
Donald Trump.

43:42.854 --> 43:44.589 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBERT JONES: That's right.

43:44.622 --> 43:50.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I should say that this book was
written and
closed before Donald Trump
really ascended

43:50.161 --> 43:53.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into the -- you know, to be the
nominee for
the Republican presidency.

43:53.264 --> 43:55.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which is what
makes it even
more fascinating.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why is it important that we
understand this?

43:58.135 --> 43:59.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT JONES: Yes.

43:59.904 --> 44:04.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, one way of putting it is
that I think
that we're at a moment where we
really are

44:04.375 --> 44:08.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
having to come to terms with the
passing of
this era.

44:08.946 --> 44:11.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is really a cultural era.

44:11.115 --> 44:16.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, to understand Trump
supporters
and the grief, the anger that we
see from

44:16.387 --> 44:21.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them and why he's been able to
appeal to them,
really, his appeal to him has
not been that

44:21.125 --> 44:22.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he's one of them.

44:22.960 --> 44:27.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His appeal to them has been this
-- to appeal
to the sense of nostalgia and
loss and grief.

44:27.632 --> 44:32.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when he says make America
great again,
he's saying, I'm going to
restore power to

44:32.203 --> 44:35.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Christian churches, says
things like,
I'm -- we can be -- we're going
to say merry

44:35.640 --> 44:36.807 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Christmas again in this country.

44:36.841 --> 44:38.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're not going to be saying
happy holidays.

44:38.643 --> 44:43.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are all about kind of big
cultural shifts
that I think are driving a lot
of anxiety

44:43.381 --> 44:45.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
among conservative white
Christians today.

44:45.316 --> 44:48.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you make the
point clearly
really throughout the book, and
especially

44:48.519 --> 44:53.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the end, that this is really
-- the country
is really moving on from this to
something

44:53.124 --> 44:55.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
else, and that there is no going
back.

44:55.893 --> 44:57.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBERT JONES: That's right.

44:57.662 --> 45:00.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I begin the book with an
obituary for
white Christian America, and I
end the book

45:00.598 --> 45:02.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with a eulogy.

45:02.366 --> 45:05.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what I hope I'm doing at the
end is sort
of thinking about presiding over
this very

45:05.970 --> 45:12.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
complicated loss and death in
American culture,
with some people who are
grieving, but some

45:12.209 --> 45:16.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who are very much ready
to move on
and ready to say good riddance
to this era.

45:17.014 --> 45:22.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think the real challenge
for us is to
figure out how we tell a story
about who America

45:22.386 --> 45:27.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is and where we're going as a
country that
is sort of faithful to its past,
but makes

45:27.592 --> 45:32.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
room, I think, for the new
demographics and
the new place that the country
is going.

45:32.930 --> 45:37.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And to understand
that this
is so much of -- that this is a
big part of

45:37.134 --> 45:38.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what's behind it.

45:38.135 --> 45:39.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBERT JONES: Absolutely.

45:39.670 --> 45:43.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Robert Jones, the
book is "The
End of White Christian America."
