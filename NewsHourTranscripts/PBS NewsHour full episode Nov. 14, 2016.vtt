JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:24.191 --> 00:26.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

00:26.326 --> 00:31.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Our lead tonight
is news that
we hoped we would never have to
report.

00:31.698 --> 00:38.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Our managing editor, my
co-anchor and dear
friend, Gwen Ifill, died earlier
today after

00:38.105 --> 00:40.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an almost yearlong battle with
cancer.

00:41.008 --> 00:46.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She was a supernova in a
profession loaded
with smart and talented people.
So, it's no

00:46.747 --> 00:52.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
surprise that messages of
condolence have
flooded in all afternoon from
across the journalism

00:52.920 --> 00:55.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and political spectrum.

00:55.289 --> 00:57.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Obama said this at the
White House:

00:57.391 --> 01:01.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Michelle and I want to offer our
deepest condolences

01:01.728 --> 01:07.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Gwen Ifill's family and all
of you, her
colleagues, on her passing.

01:07.968 --> 01:12.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gwen was a friend of ours. She
was an extraordinary
journalist. She always kept
faith with the

01:12.906 --> 01:18.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fundamental responsibilities of
her profession,
asking tough questions, holding
people in

01:18.345 --> 01:23.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
power accountable, and defending
a strong
and free press that makes our
democracy work.

01:23.784 --> 01:28.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I always appreciated Gwen's
reporting, even
when I was at the receiving end
of one of

01:28.255 --> 01:30.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
her tough and thorough
interviews.

01:30.724 --> 01:35.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether she reported from a
convention floor
or from the field, whether she
sat at the

01:36.029 --> 01:41.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
debate moderator's table or at
the anchor's
desk, she not only informed
today's citizens,

01:41.335 --> 01:44.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but she also inspired tomorrow's
journalists.

01:44.338 --> 01:48.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was an especially powerful
role model
for young women and girls, who
admired her

01:48.342 --> 01:53.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
integrity, her tenacity and her
intellect,
and for whom she blazed a trail
as one-half

01:53.814 --> 01:58.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the first all-female anchor
team on network
news.

01:58.652 --> 02:04.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Gwen did her country a great
service.
Michelle and I join her family
and her colleagues

02:04.891 --> 02:09.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and everybody else who loved her
in remembering
her fondly today.

02:09.196 --> 02:12.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
today at the
White House.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're devoting most of tonight's
show to Gwen.

02:15.035 --> 02:18.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we start with this look at
her remarkable
life.

02:18.171 --> 02:20.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill.

02:20.140 --> 02:25.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And with those
words each evening,
Americans knew they were in good
hands, Gwen

02:26.013 --> 02:27.848 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Ifill's hands.

02:27.881 --> 02:33.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was the heart and soul of
PBS' "NewsHour"
and "Washington Week." She was
also beloved,

02:33.854 --> 02:40.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sister, aunt, godmother many
times over and
friend to legions.

02:40.127 --> 02:45.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The daughter of a minister, Gwen
graduated
from Simmons College in
Massachusetts, got

02:45.298 --> 02:50.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her start in journalism at The
Boston Herald-American,
before moving on to The
Baltimore Evening

02:50.637 --> 02:57.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Sun in 1981, then to The
Washington Post,
followed by several years as a
politics reporter

02:58.011 --> 03:00.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and White House correspondent
for The New
York Times.

03:00.781 --> 03:04.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Even marginal
progress could be
affected by investigations in
Little Rock

03:05.018 --> 03:06.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and in Washington.

03:06.353 --> 03:09.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: She moved to
television and
NBC News in 1994.

03:09.823 --> 03:14.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: They have to find a
way to work
with this president for the next
two years

03:14.194 --> 03:15.462 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
-- Tom.

03:15.495 --> 03:18.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM BROKAW, NBC News: NBC's Gwen
Ifill on
Capitol Hill tonight.

03:18.165 --> 03:24.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Then, in October
1999, she
came to PBS to host "Washington
Week," the

03:24.738 --> 03:26.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
long-running political
roundtable...

03:26.540 --> 03:28.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Good evening.

03:28.308 --> 03:32.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... and to become
senior correspondent
on "The NewsHour With Jim
Lehrer."

03:32.579 --> 03:36.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIM LEHRER: And to our new
senior correspondent,
Gwen Ifill, welcome, Gwen.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Thanks, Jim.

03:37.818 --> 03:41.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, for a preview of the
Supreme Court's
1999 term...

03:41.555 --> 03:43.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How would you prioritize the
needs at the
border right now?

03:43.890 --> 03:50.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There, she added
to her lengthy
and accomplished body of work.

03:50.397 --> 03:57.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2013, Gwen and I were honored
to assume
the great responsibility, and
joy, of co-anchoring

03:57.070 --> 03:58.171 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this program.

03:58.205 --> 04:00.207 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Good evening. I'm Judy Woodruff.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.808 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

04:01.842 --> 04:05.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those are just some of the
stories we're covering
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

04:05.512 --> 04:11.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On this, the
first night of
the new "PBS NewsHour," we have
a lot of news

04:11.051 --> 04:12.953 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for you.

04:12.986 --> 04:16.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We also have a new
look, but Judy
and I will be bringing you the
news and analysis

04:16.857 --> 04:18.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you have come to trust.

04:18.658 --> 04:23.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it was that
trust, her
dedication, that was her stock
in trade. She

04:23.563 --> 04:28.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was the gold standard in our
business, known
for a fierce allegiance and
loyalty to her

04:28.768 --> 04:33.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
family, friends, and colleagues,
but also
to the facts.

04:33.507 --> 04:36.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Her range was limitless. Here
are some highlights.

04:36.977 --> 04:44.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: How do we as a
nation cope with
race conflict and our inability
to see each

04:44.217 --> 04:46.019 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
other?

04:46.052 --> 04:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let me turn this on its head,
because when
we talk about race in this
country, we always

04:59.933 --> 05:01.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
talk about African-Americans,
people of color.

05:01.868 --> 05:04.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to talk to you about
white people,
OK?

05:04.304 --> 05:05.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: White people.

05:05.705 --> 05:08.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Why don't you
mention Donald Trump
by name?

05:08.842 --> 05:12.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: You know, he seems
to do a good
job mentioning his own name.

05:12.612 --> 05:13.947 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

05:13.980 --> 05:18.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: So, I think I will
let him do
his advertising for him.

05:18.151 --> 05:23.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Susana Flores, the
owner, is a
legal resident who tried
unsuccessfully to

05:24.024 --> 05:26.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
teach me how to make tortillas.

05:26.459 --> 05:35.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Susana's sister, Rocina
Sandoval, who works
as a waitress, is not here
legally. She could

05:35.202 --> 05:36.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
easily be deported.

05:36.536 --> 05:39.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Gwen is in Des
Moines for Iowa's
State Fair.

05:39.472 --> 05:44.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: This weekend, the
political yin
and yang of a crowded field all
descended

05:44.110 --> 05:47.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Iowa at once and brought it
into especially
sharp focus.

05:47.681 --> 05:51.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I),
Vermont: The American
people are growing extremely
unhappy with

05:51.651 --> 05:57.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
establishment politics, with
establishment
economics, and you know what
else?

05:57.057 --> 05:58.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: What?

05:58.225 --> 05:59.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Even with
establishment
media.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.026 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: No!

06:00.060 --> 06:01.828 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Yeah!

06:01.861 --> 06:03.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I think every single
conversation
we have had with a Republican in
this booth,

06:03.697 --> 06:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when we asked them about these
issues, they
have always turned it back to
talking about

06:06.399 --> 06:08.168 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hillary Clinton.

06:08.201 --> 06:14.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that does seem to be the
most persuasive
argument, David, that
Republicans in this

06:14.474 --> 06:16.142 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
room have.

06:16.176 --> 06:20.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can you see a scenario right now
in which
he would step back from the
border at all

06:20.080 --> 06:22.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a way that you can trust?

06:22.082 --> 06:24.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Well, I think you have asked
exactly the right

06:24.184 --> 06:25.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
question, as you often do, Gwen.

06:25.952 --> 06:28.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM BROKAW: NBC's Gwen Ifill has
our in-depth
report.

06:28.755 --> 06:32.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Even marginal
progress could be
affected by investigations in
Little Rock

06:32.592 --> 06:42.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and in Washington involving the
president,
the first lady and their
political supporters.

06:42.636 --> 06:47.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fifty years later, though, if
King were able
to stand in that spot and look
out, what is

06:47.107 --> 06:53.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the legacy of that day that some
people say,
we have a black president,
everything is much

06:53.079 --> 06:55.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
better, and some people say, we
have so much
farther to go?

06:55.949 --> 07:01.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Gwen raised
questions others
wouldn't or that wouldn't even
occur to them.

07:01.755 --> 07:06.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here's one example from the vice
presidential
debate she moderated in 2004.

07:06.126 --> 07:10.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I want to talk to
you about AIDS,
and not about AIDS in China or
in Africa,

07:10.964 --> 07:16.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but AIDS right here in this
country, where
black women between the ages of
25 and 44

07:16.069 --> 07:20.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are 13 times more likely to die
of the disease
than their counterparts.

07:20.073 --> 07:24.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What should the government's
role be in helping
to end the growth of this
epidemic?

07:25.011 --> 07:29.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Four years later,
she sat down
with another set of candidates.

07:29.749 --> 07:34.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Welcome to the first
and the only
2008 vice presidential debate.

07:34.287 --> 07:39.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Throughout that
2008 campaign,
Gwen wasn't only reporting for
the "NewsHour"

07:39.259 --> 07:43.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and "Washington Week"; she was
writing about
that moment in history.

07:43.363 --> 07:49.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As the nation's first
African-American president
was elected, she marked it with
"The Breakthrough,"

07:49.936 --> 07:53.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the story of a new generation of
black politicians.

07:53.907 --> 07:57.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it wasn't just politics that
moved her.

07:57.143 --> 08:04.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: This is fun. Now,
this is the
way I always wanted to do the
"NewsHour."

08:04.050 --> 08:05.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Have a little fun.

08:05.785 --> 08:11.157 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
HARRY BELAFONTE,
Singer/Actor/Civil Rights
Activist: I woke up one day and
the whole

08:11.191 --> 08:14.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world was singing "Banana Boat."
And I didn't
really understand how powerful I
was until

08:14.260 --> 08:19.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I stood before an audience of
50,000 Japanese
trying to sing Day-O.

08:19.265 --> 08:20.367 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

08:20.400 --> 08:23.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARRY BELAFONTE: And I was like,
yes, I have
arrived.

08:23.269 --> 08:24.938 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

08:24.971 --> 08:27.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, I would say
you have managed
over the years to sing your
song.

08:27.607 --> 08:32.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Gwen's spirit,
nourished by
her connection to her church,
was on full

08:32.212 --> 08:36.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
display when she sat down with
Aretha Franklin
just one year ago tomorrow.

08:36.883 --> 08:41.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, is part of you,
you know,
always going to be Reverend C.L.
Franklin's

08:41.121 --> 08:42.088 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
daughter?

08:42.122 --> 08:43.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARETHA FRANKLIN, Musician:
Absolutely.

08:43.189 --> 08:44.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I'm a preacher's
kid, too, so
I...

08:44.124 --> 08:45.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARETHA FRANKLIN: I knew you --
P.K., OK.

08:45.492 --> 08:48.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But I -- I am a P.K.
But I don't
sing quite like you.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARETHA FRANKLIN: Oh, well, we
don't all sing.

08:50.663 --> 08:51.631 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

08:51.664 --> 08:52.632 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We have other gifts.

08:52.665 --> 08:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARETHA FRANKLIN: Yes, you have
other gifts.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Indeed, she did.

08:56.403 --> 09:02.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of her last stories was
about the new
National Museum of African
American History

09:02.108 --> 09:03.777 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and culture.

09:03.810 --> 09:07.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: This is an amazing
place, chockful
of the expected and the
unexpected.

09:07.814 --> 09:12.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Recently, Gwen
talked about
her love for the "NewsHour" and
what it means

09:13.019 --> 09:14.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in today's world:

09:14.687 --> 09:19.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We occupy a role
that we know
they appreciate. They tell us
this.

09:19.359 --> 09:24.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's not too much to tell
them back how
much we love them back. There is
-- the world

09:25.031 --> 09:28.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
is split into a million
different little ways
of consuming your information.

09:28.168 --> 09:33.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of young people say, I get
my profession
from "The Daily Show." Or a lot
of young people

09:33.339 --> 09:37.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say, I only read what I see on
my phone browser.

09:37.076 --> 09:42.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But we have a dedicated,
committed audience
who want to know more, who want
us to dig

09:42.415 --> 09:46.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a little deeper on their behalf.
And so, if
they weren't there, if they
weren't supporting

09:46.953 --> 09:48.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the work we do, we couldn't
exist.

09:48.455 --> 09:53.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it's kind of vital
to democracy
that we do exist.

09:53.226 --> 09:58.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Gwen touched
so many lives.
And there has been a tremendous
outpouring

09:58.131 --> 09:59.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of remembrances today.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Attorney General Loretta Lynch
had this to
say.

10:02.168 --> 10:05.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORETTA LYNCH, U.S. Attorney
General: Gwen
Ifill was a pioneering figure in
American

10:05.839 --> 10:10.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
journalism who quite literally
changed the
face of the evening news.

10:10.777 --> 10:15.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She met discrimination and
bigotry with talent
and focus, rising to become one
of the most

10:15.682 --> 10:21.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prominent journalists of her
generation. She
pursued her reporting with
grace, intelligence

10:21.120 --> 10:26.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and integrity, earning her the
trust of countless
Americans who counted on her to
present the

10:26.826 --> 10:30.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
facts of the story without slant
or spin.

10:30.163 --> 10:35.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She asked tough questions and
told hard truths,
but she always did so in a way
that elevated,

10:35.668 --> 10:39.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rather than coarsened, our
national discourse.

10:39.205 --> 10:44.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our country is a better place
because of her
commitment to the truth, and she
will be sorely

10:44.511 --> 10:47.547 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
missed, both on the air and off.

10:47.580 --> 10:53.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're joined now
by some who
knew Gwen well, Charlayne
Hunter-Gault, a

10:53.753 --> 10:59.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
colleague and friend of Gwen's
and a longtime
member of our "NewsHour" family,
John Dickerson

10:59.259 --> 11:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of CBS News, also a regular
panelist and occasional
host for "Washington Week,"
Kevin Merida,

11:06.699 --> 11:13.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a longtime colleague and now
with the Web
site ESPN's Undefeated, and Amy
Walter, also

11:13.773 --> 11:19.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of our "NewsHour" and
"Washington Week" families.
She's with The Cook Political
Report.

11:19.679 --> 11:25.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a tough night for all of
us. I know
you each are -- have so much you
want to say

11:25.385 --> 11:27.186 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about Gwen.

11:27.220 --> 11:31.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm going to start with you,
Kevin Merida,
because I think you have known
Gwen the longest

11:31.324 --> 11:33.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in this group. Tell us about
meeting her.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEVIN MERIDA, ®MD-BO /ESPN: Well,
it was
incredible.

11:35.628 --> 11:41.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was a -- I was editor of a
black publication
at Boston University, a black
student newspaper.

11:41.568 --> 11:47.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we did a piece on Gwen,
because here she
was, this hot shot journalist
right out of

11:47.273 --> 11:50.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
college who got hired by The
Boston Herald-American.

11:50.677 --> 11:56.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And for many young black
journalists or aspiring
black journalists, we didn't
know many people

11:56.382 --> 12:04.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like Gwen. And so she felt a
little bit like
a unicorn then. And so we became
friends after

12:04.257 --> 12:07.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that. But that was my first
introduction to
her.

12:07.260 --> 12:12.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was a wonderful friend,
obviously, and
inspired many of us throughout
our careers.

12:12.498 --> 12:17.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: John
Dickerson, you met
Gwen on the campaign trail
covering politics,

12:17.870 --> 12:18.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and then you became friends.

12:18.938 --> 12:20.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN DICKERSON, CBS News: Yes.

12:20.707 --> 12:23.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, all I have been thinking
about today
is her smile.

12:23.376 --> 12:24.611 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

12:24.644 --> 12:26.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DICKERSON: You could read
by the light
of Gwen's smile.

12:26.312 --> 12:27.747 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

12:27.780 --> 12:33.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DICKERSON: And it felt sort
of like it
greeted you before she did.

12:33.286 --> 12:37.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she was a tough, great
journalist. When
we were in the company of other
journalists,

12:38.024 --> 12:42.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her question was always the one
that just
kind of cut through the fog and
sometimes

12:42.462 --> 12:44.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was a little impolitic.

12:44.297 --> 12:51.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the thing I will remember
first is just
what a great and warm person she
was and how,

12:51.371 --> 12:56.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whatever mood you were in before
you were
with Gwen, you left it with joy
in your heart.

12:56.876 --> 12:59.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in Washington, there is not
a lot of
that.

12:59.145 --> 13:01.614 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's for sure.

13:01.648 --> 13:05.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Charlayne Hunter-Gault, you were
obviously
a regular right here on the
"NewsHour" for

13:05.752 --> 13:09.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many, many years. And you have
known Gwen
for a long time.

13:09.288 --> 13:13.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: I have
known Gwen
for a long time, but I had left
to go to Africa

13:13.292 --> 13:16.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to live and work by the time
Gwen got to the
"NewsHour."

13:16.829 --> 13:22.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what's so amazing is that,
you know, she's
of a generation younger than
mine, but I,

13:22.735 --> 13:28.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as an older-generation
journalist, used to
look back on Gwen for
inspiration, because,

13:28.174 --> 13:33.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as everybody has just said, I
mean, she knew
how to cut through the
you-know-what.

13:33.079 --> 13:39.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet she maintained such an
air of professionalism.
She didn't put people off. She
welcomed them

13:39.452 --> 13:44.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into her space. But, at the same
time, when
she got to the "NewsHour," she
was already

13:44.357 --> 13:50.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doing what we believed in, and
that was to
present news that could be used
by people,

13:50.196 --> 13:54.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so that, if they got good
information, they
would make the right decisions
about how to

13:54.767 --> 13:58.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
live as a good citizen in a
democratic nation.

13:58.604 --> 14:01.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Amy Walter,
you have done
so many of these Politics
Mondays just in

14:01.808 --> 14:04.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this most recent cycle, but you
have known
her for much longer.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Right.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What is it
about her political
acumen, her skill that all of
these folks

14:08.147 --> 14:10.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are talking about, the ability
to cut through
the...

14:10.216 --> 14:14.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: I'm so glad that you
asked that,
because that's what I was trying
to remember,

14:14.554 --> 14:16.289 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
too.

14:16.322 --> 14:19.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's, honestly, very hard
sitting at this
desk and not having her across
from me. Her

14:19.492 --> 14:26.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
love for politics and her love
for the process
of it is what I have always
admired about

14:26.232 --> 14:33.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her. She wanted to do the stuff
that a lot
of journalists didn't want to
get to, right,

14:34.006 --> 14:38.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because it's a lot easier
staying on the surface.
It's a lot easier to go for the
shiny objects.

14:38.144 --> 14:43.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she wanted to really get
into it, what
does it mean, how did we get
here, which is

14:43.116 --> 14:48.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why it was such an honor for me
to work with
her and work with this show, so
that, every

14:48.087 --> 14:51.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time I got on, I felt better and
smarter for
that.

14:51.791 --> 14:55.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you can see, too, with
everybody who is
talking here, she created a
family around

14:55.661 --> 15:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her of all of these people. And
she -- I felt
like we were a little menagerie,
that she

15:00.366 --> 15:04.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
put together all these
incredible people and
took care of all of them.

15:04.771 --> 15:09.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kevin Merida, you
talked about
meeting Gwen early on and what a
-- I think

15:09.175 --> 15:14.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you said unicorn, how rare it
was to see an
African-American journalist
succeeding as

15:14.147 --> 15:15.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
early as she did.

15:15.882 --> 15:21.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She told me the story -- and I
assume she
told you -- about first time at
the Boston

15:21.821 --> 15:26.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
newspaper, what happened to her.
Do you remember
that story?

15:26.125 --> 15:30.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN MERIDA: You know, I
remember there was
some -- I don't remember the
specifics.

15:30.797 --> 15:35.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she was in Boston. We were
both in Boston
at the same time. It was a
really racially

15:35.468 --> 15:40.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tense city then. I had been an
intern at The
Boston Globe. And anybody who
worked at Boston

15:40.973 --> 15:46.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
newspapers back in that day, and
you were
African-American, many times,
you felt like

15:46.445 --> 15:51.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you were kind of under this
racial -- almost
racial terror sometimes.

15:52.018 --> 15:58.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was really difficult to
do the job.
The fact that she was able to be
in the newsroom,

15:58.491 --> 16:03.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reporting in Boston at that
time, was extraordinary,
in and of itself.

16:03.062 --> 16:10.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think she was always one
that, in each
level of her career, there were
never obstacles

16:10.970 --> 16:18.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that she was going to allow to
block her.
And that kind of professionalism
and the ability

16:18.211 --> 16:26.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to wear success well was awfully
inspiring,
as we both watched each
generation, you know,

16:26.319 --> 16:30.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
new, young journalists come up
and look toward
her for that model.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Charlayne?

16:32.491 --> 16:36.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Judy,
yes, I remember
what the incident was, because I
was speaking

16:36.796 --> 16:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at one of the many awards
ceremonies Gwen
was being honored.

16:40.633 --> 16:45.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I looked it up. And a
co-worker had written
to her, "N-word, go home."

16:45.738 --> 16:47.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right. Right.

16:47.607 --> 16:52.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And she
had to survive
that and prosper and not pay a
lot of attention

16:52.678 --> 16:54.547 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to it.

16:54.580 --> 17:00.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, let me very
quickly say
that, while you and Gwen were
noted for becoming

17:00.219 --> 17:05.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the first two women to anchor a
news program,
you know, Gwen identified as a
woman, she

17:05.791 --> 17:10.997 align:left position:25%,start line:80% size:75%
identified as an
African-American, and she
identified as a human being.

17:11.030 --> 17:17.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, she brought all of those
things to bear
in becoming one of the many
consciences of

17:17.570 --> 17:19.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the news business and the
"NewsHour."

17:19.572 --> 17:27.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, she championed my series
Race Matters
looking at solutions to racism.
She used to

17:27.146 --> 17:33.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
send me little notes encouraging
me. So, she
could be all of those things and
still reach

17:33.052 --> 17:38.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out in a universal way to
people, regardless
of race, creed, color, or
national origin.

17:38.391 --> 17:42.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: John
Dickerson, she had
a reputation, as you point out,
to be tough

17:42.795 --> 17:47.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on both -- in the field, as well
as debates
that she's moderator. Even the
president pointed

17:47.800 --> 17:50.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out that she was tough, but she
was fair.

17:50.636 --> 17:52.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN DICKERSON: Yes, that was
her reputation.

17:52.672 --> 17:56.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, you know, even with
journalists, she
-- you know, there is a thing
that happens

17:56.776 --> 18:00.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sometimes when journalists get
together and
everybody kind of gallops along,
sort of saying

18:00.813 --> 18:03.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the same -- believing in the
same thing.

18:03.716 --> 18:11.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Gwen often kind of would
say, now, wait
a minute. And, sometimes, it was
kind of pointed.

18:12.024 --> 18:15.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that was because she was
always questioning
what was going on.

18:15.561 --> 18:21.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And when you prepare for
"Washington Week,"
in the conversation before the
show, you could

18:21.467 --> 18:26.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
always expect that, whatever
fancy thing you
had polished up and thought was
so brilliant,

18:26.339 --> 18:30.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that she would, you know,
puncture it in -- not
in a mean way.

18:30.409 --> 18:32.178 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

18:32.211 --> 18:34.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DICKERSON: But she wasn't
going to let
you just get by with something
that sounded

18:34.814 --> 18:38.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
good and maybe had a couple of
clever phrases
in it.

18:38.517 --> 18:43.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, if you could
get her to
laugh and hear her laugh, that
was a special

18:43.622 --> 18:49.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
joy. It wasn't a chuckle. It was
a laugh to
be remembered and to fill up an
entire room.

18:49.462 --> 18:53.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And with an
office right next
to hers, John, that is what I
guarantee you

18:53.632 --> 18:55.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I am going to miss the most.

18:55.701 --> 18:59.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amy Walter, but talk about that.
I mean, you
have talked about how much she
loved politics

18:59.205 --> 19:04.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and she wasn't satisfied with
the surface.
I mean, but she was always on a
quest to get

19:04.643 --> 19:07.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more and -- but to do it in a
way that wasn't
so...

19:07.313 --> 19:08.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And to do it -- that
was joyful.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes. Yes.

19:10.049 --> 19:13.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And that, I think --
sometimes,
we, especially in the political
press, get

19:13.786 --> 19:20.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so cynical about the same
candidates and the
same promises and the same
election year after

19:20.793 --> 19:22.595 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

19:22.628 --> 19:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she always had a -- just a
joy in covering
it, a responsibility in covering
it, but she

19:27.099 --> 19:32.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also believed that we could make
it better,
right? We could be smarter about
this, and

19:32.671 --> 19:39.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we didn't just have to live
with whatever
was put on the table by others.

19:39.812 --> 19:44.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, going on John's
point, too,
I mean, she didn't suffer fools
at all, no

19:44.884 --> 19:45.851 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
matter...

19:45.885 --> 19:46.852 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

19:46.886 --> 19:48.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: No, she did not.
She did not.

19:48.587 --> 19:50.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: No matter who you
were, you have
been caught in the Gwen look
of...

19:50.990 --> 19:54.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All of us -- all
of us have
experienced this.

19:54.160 --> 19:55.127 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

19:55.161 --> 19:56.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Have gotten the Gwen
look.

19:56.929 --> 20:02.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's because she truly
believed in the
process itself that she could
cover it so

20:02.868 --> 20:09.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well. You don't have to believe
that everything
is going to work out perfectly
in covering

20:09.642 --> 20:13.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
politics, but you have to
believe that the
process is important. And she
did.

20:13.245 --> 20:16.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Kevin Merida,
one of the
things that you pointed out
earlier, for young

20:17.016 --> 20:21.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
journalists of color who were
coming up at
the time, and even today, she
has been a role

20:21.720 --> 20:23.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
model throughout her
professional life.

20:24.023 --> 20:31.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN MERIDA: You know, she
always made time
for people. She was never too
big. You know,

20:31.130 --> 20:33.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
achievement never got away from
her.

20:33.833 --> 20:41.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she understood what people
went through.
And she was very helpful in
letting other

20:41.107 --> 20:46.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
young journalists know her
story. And she
brought people together. I mean,
many of the

20:46.645 --> 20:54.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
panelists know that she had a
really well-received
open house every New Year's Day.

20:54.687 --> 20:58.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I watched over the years how
that open
house got bigger and bigger, and
because she

20:58.858 --> 21:03.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
let more and more people into
the circle because
she thought it was also
important to bring

21:03.295 --> 21:09.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people together. And that was
one of the ways,
among many others, that she did
that.

21:09.201 --> 21:14.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Charlayne
Hunter-Gault, talk
a little bit about what she
meant to journalists

21:14.773 --> 21:17.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of color, to people of color.

21:17.810 --> 21:24.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would be with her walking down
the street
or in a restaurant or at an
airport. And I

21:24.984 --> 21:32.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
would see the immediate
connection that she
had with all people, but there
was -- of course,

21:32.091 --> 21:35.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because she had fans across all
the spectrums.

21:35.361 --> 21:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there was a connection for
her in the
African-American community that
was really

21:41.100 --> 21:42.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- it was really remarkable.

21:42.434 --> 21:44.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Well,
absolutely.

21:44.370 --> 21:49.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I remember, when I spoke at
the National
Press Club when she was honored
there with

21:49.074 --> 21:55.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their highest award, I talked
about how she
reminded me a little bit of
Viola Davis, because,

21:55.047 --> 22:00.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when she went through, there
weren't a whole
lot of women even then, when she
began to

22:00.986 --> 22:05.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
achieve national recognition and
status.

22:05.524 --> 22:11.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she would look across that
line, like
Viola Davis said, and reach out
to bring others

22:11.664 --> 22:17.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in. So, she inspired those she
met. But she
also inspired those just by her
appearance

22:17.136 --> 22:23.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and by her competence and her
extraordinary
capacity to do all the things
that you have

22:23.342 --> 22:27.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
heard all of her colleagues, old
and new,
talk about.

22:27.379 --> 22:31.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other thing about Gwen was,
they say that
she could give you a look. And
that was true.

22:31.517 --> 22:32.718 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

22:32.751 --> 22:33.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But she
was not full
of herself.

22:33.786 --> 22:35.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: No.

22:35.588 --> 22:37.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: I mean,
we -- the
last time -- and I'm so glad I
had this moment

22:37.723 --> 22:43.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with her on Martha's Vineyard
this past summer,
with Michele Norris, the NPR
correspondent.

22:43.095 --> 22:50.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The three of us were at dinner.
And she just
sat back and let us yammer and
talk and chat.

22:50.102 --> 22:53.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we would say something, and
she would
say, "Oh, I didn't know that."
And she would

22:53.439 --> 22:57.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pick up a pen and start writing
it down to
remind herself to look at that.

22:57.142 --> 23:00.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we were talking about
something else,
and she went right on her phone
and said:

23:00.579 --> 23:03.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"No, that's not right. It was
such and such
and such a thing."

23:03.582 --> 23:11.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she was humble, even as she
presented
this very strong and powerful
person. So,

23:11.423 --> 23:18.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think that what young
African-American people
saw in her was what they could
be. And it

23:18.097 --> 23:22.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was a wonderful. And I could see
what I could
be, even being older than she.

23:22.668 --> 23:24.403 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

23:24.436 --> 23:27.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So, I'm
just saying
that she appealed to all
generations in the

23:27.573 --> 23:29.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
most wonderful way.

23:29.375 --> 23:32.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: John
Dickerson, she also
seemed to be a journalist that
was willing

23:32.745 --> 23:34.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to continue learning.

23:34.513 --> 23:38.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, she didn't take to
Twitter quickly,
but, once she got in, she was
in, and the

23:38.617 --> 23:39.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
world knew about it.

23:39.618 --> 23:41.387 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

23:41.420 --> 23:44.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DICKERSON: Well, she had to
be somewhere
to tell everybody about
"Hamilton" and every

23:44.056 --> 23:45.924 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
song that she was listening to.

23:45.958 --> 23:47.159 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

23:47.192 --> 23:48.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I was waiting for
somebody
to bring that up.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.828 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

23:49.862 --> 23:53.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DICKERSON: Well, I felt as
though I had
to do it for Gwen. Talk about a
woman who

23:53.432 --> 23:56.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
didn't throw away her shot.

23:56.168 --> 24:02.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was an enthusiast, you know?
She was an
enthusiast about Twitter,
although skeptical

24:02.074 --> 24:07.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at first, you know, because --
in part because
I think she probably thought it
was just a

24:07.713 --> 24:13.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
place for people to just kind of
toss off
opinions that might not be
considered.

24:13.952 --> 24:19.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then, when she took to it
with her normal
enthusiasm -- and that
enthusiasm, as we said,

24:19.358 --> 24:26.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
often was in the form of either
glory to "Hamilton"
or lyrics from it -- it was just
a perfect

24:26.632 --> 24:29.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
venue for her enthusiasm to come
through.

24:29.234 --> 24:34.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's what I think about
all today, was
just her enthusiasm in all of
its different

24:34.907 --> 24:38.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forms. And, certainly, in the
new world of
social media, it was there, too.

24:38.944 --> 24:43.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kevin Merida, I
want to come
back to you on, you know, we --
all of us

24:43.415 --> 24:48.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
lived through journalism
changing rapidly.
Twitter is a part of that.

24:48.287 --> 24:53.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How did you see Gwen adapting as
journalism
changed right in front of all
our eyes?

24:53.726 --> 24:58.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN MERIDA: Well, she grasped
it like she
did everything. It was a
challenge and something

24:58.464 --> 25:00.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
interesting for her.

25:00.299 --> 25:03.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would see, sometimes, I
would tweet
something, and then she would
come back with

25:03.135 --> 25:06.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an even pithier reply, you know?

25:06.505 --> 25:10.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the things that -- I
remember we were
talking about debates -- and she
certainly

25:10.909 --> 25:15.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did the vice presidential
debates and the
Democratic primary debate. But I
was an advocate

25:15.647 --> 25:20.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for her that she should have
been in one of
the presidential general
election debates

25:20.185 --> 25:21.987 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as a moderator.

25:22.020 --> 25:27.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I remember writing that, you
know, early
on. And she sent, "I love you,
Kevin Merida,"

25:27.426 --> 25:28.394 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you know?

25:28.427 --> 25:29.795 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

25:29.828 --> 25:31.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEVIN MERIDA: And it was just a
little funny,
you know, rejoinder.

25:31.964 --> 25:39.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that she was so
accomplished and
so well-regarded by so many
other people,

25:39.571 --> 25:43.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but, for her, she always wanted
to keep learning
and getting better.

25:43.342 --> 25:49.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as Charlayne said and
others, she was
willing to learn from others.
She just soaked

25:49.648 --> 25:54.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up -- the passion in her for
knowledge was
just amazing.

25:54.653 --> 26:00.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And she was that
rare competitor
in -- at least in Washington,
that wasn't

26:00.826 --> 26:02.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
moving ahead by putting somebody
else down.

26:02.628 --> 26:04.530 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEVIN MERIDA: That's right.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: If she was going to
get the moderator
job, if she was going to get the
big interview,

26:07.199 --> 26:11.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she was going to get it because
of the work
that she did, not because she
made somebody

26:11.370 --> 26:15.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
else feel bad or pushed them
down in any way.

26:15.307 --> 26:22.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that, especially in this
town, is a remarkable
-- first of all, it's been a
remarkable gift

26:22.848 --> 26:26.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for so many of us, but it's not
something
that you see very often.

26:26.084 --> 26:27.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KEVIN MERIDA: So incredibly
classy.

26:28.020 --> 26:32.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I would just say,
in our final
minute with you and Amy Walter
and John Dickerson,

26:32.624 --> 26:38.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know Gwen really hated, when I
talked to
her, missing covering the end of
this amazing,

26:38.297 --> 26:43.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one-of-a-kind presidential
campaign. That
was hard for her to miss it.

26:43.135 --> 26:47.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: To not be -- to not
spend an election
night -- I have spent a lot of
election nights

26:47.172 --> 26:48.140 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Gwen Ifill.

26:48.173 --> 26:49.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John?

26:49.775 --> 26:51.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Judy,
can I just -- can
I just say one final thing?

26:51.977 --> 26:53.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fifteen seconds.
Sure.

26:53.245 --> 26:55.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And I
hope -- I hope
I don't cry.

26:55.581 --> 27:01.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I saw her on the air one
night, and she
looked so amazing. And, at 10:00
at night,

27:01.086 --> 27:06.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I couldn't help but write to
her. And that's
when she wrote me back and told
me how -- what

27:06.124 --> 27:07.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
she had been going through.

27:07.960 --> 27:12.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's another thing
that we should
absolutely think so highly of
her, because

27:12.498 --> 27:19.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she worked through all of her
illness without
letting on to anyone about what
was going

27:19.705 --> 27:21.440 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The "NewsHour" would say, she's
away, and
everybody thought she was away
working. And

27:23.542 --> 27:27.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she was suffering mightily. And
she bore it
with such grace.

27:27.212 --> 27:28.881 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

27:28.914 --> 27:30.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thank you,
Charlayne.

27:30.616 --> 27:32.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you,
Charlayne.

27:32.384 --> 27:36.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Absolutely, she was a pillar of
strength for
everybody out there and for all
of us here

27:36.121 --> 27:37.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at the "NewsHour."

27:37.923 --> 27:43.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Charlayne Hunter-Gault, Kevin
Merida, John
Dickerson, Amy Walter right
here, we thank

27:43.595 --> 27:45.631 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you all.

27:45.664 --> 27:52.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KEVIN MERIDA: Thank you.

27:52.738 --> 28:01.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Thank you, Judy.

28:01.613 --> 28:09.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now more
remembrances of
Gwen from Rick Berke. He's
executive editor

28:09.454 --> 28:15.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at STAT News, and worked with
Gwen at The
Baltimore Evening Sun in the
1980s. Pete Williams,

28:15.627 --> 28:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he is justice correspondent for
NBC News,
where Gwen and he used to cover
Congress and

28:20.966 --> 28:25.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
politics. Karen Tumulty is
national political
correspondent for The Washington
Post. She

28:25.537 --> 28:30.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Gwen covered the Jesse
Jackson presidential
campaign together in 1988.

28:30.442 --> 28:35.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reverend William Lamar IV is
pastor of the
Metropolitan African Methodist
Episcopal Church

28:35.547 --> 28:40.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Washington. He has known the
Ifill family
going back decades. And Yamiche
Alcindor of

28:40.319 --> 28:43.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The New York Times, Gwen was a
mentor to her.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pastor Lamar, I want to start
with you. You
knew Gwen in a way that none of
us at the

28:46.758 --> 28:52.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
table did. Besides the church
every weekend,
coming up through the church,
the Ifill name

28:52.998 --> 28:54.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
meant something.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. WILLIAM LAMAR IV, Pastor,
Metropolitan
African Methodist Episcopal
Church: Indeed.

28:56.702 --> 29:00.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Gwen's father was the
secretary-general of
our denomination. So, all
official denominational

29:00.272 --> 29:03.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
literature and statistical
reports carried
his name.

29:04.009 --> 29:10.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I don't remember a time not
seeing or
knowing the Ifill name. And as I
came through

29:10.048 --> 29:14.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the ranks of ordained ministry,
her brother,
Presiding Elder Earle Ifill of
the Atlanta

29:15.020 --> 29:20.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North-Georgia annual conference,
was a tremendous
voice and leader in our
denomination.

29:20.759 --> 29:26.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when I had the privilege of
pastoring
her, I knew her pedigree and
knew her ancestry.

29:26.164 --> 29:27.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And she was a
woman of deep
faith.

29:28.000 --> 29:32.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. WILLIAM LAMAR IV: Oh, she
was there every
week. She was generous. She was
loving. She

29:32.638 --> 29:38.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was accessible. She was a
mentor. And little
girls could come to her and hug
her, and she

29:38.510 --> 29:41.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would share and she would
encourage. She was
a great gift to our community.

29:41.480 --> 29:46.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Rick Berke, you
were -- as
we just said, you knew Gwen
going back to

29:46.518 --> 29:51.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the 1980s as a young reporter.
Tell us a little
bit about that.

29:51.256 --> 29:54.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD BERKE, Executive Editor,
STAT: Gwen
and I covered City Hall together
35 years

29:54.393 --> 29:58.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago at The Baltimore Evening
Sun. Then, years
later, we covered the White
House together

29:58.497 --> 30:00.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at The New York Times.

30:00.399 --> 30:04.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have covered a lot of
politicians together.
And she had them quaking in
their boots.

30:04.870 --> 30:06.672 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

30:06.705 --> 30:10.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD BERKE: I mean, she would
look at them,
and they would be intimidated,
from mayors

30:10.342 --> 30:12.077 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to presidents.

30:12.110 --> 30:17.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it was because she was
whip-smart, she
knew what to ask, and she was
relentless.

30:17.315 --> 30:23.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she would always come back
with her big
smile that would just melt
everyone. So, she

30:23.088 --> 30:28.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was tough, but she was
accessible. And she
always knew what she was talking
about. She

30:28.827 --> 30:33.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would be able to synthesize the
news in a
way no one else I have ever seen
was able

30:33.832 --> 30:35.167 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Pete Williams,
what about
your time at NBC News?

30:36.902 --> 30:39.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETE WILLIAMS, NBC News: I think
you also
have to say, not only was she a
great person

30:39.771 --> 30:40.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of faith, but she loved to sing.
Right?

30:40.872 --> 30:42.240 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

30:42.274 --> 30:44.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETE WILLIAMS: She was a great
singer at church
and everything else.

30:44.209 --> 30:49.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was at NBC when she came
there. Those of
us in television would say it's
very difficult,

30:49.381 --> 30:53.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what we do, but she made it look
very easy.
She made the transition very
quickly from

30:53.585 --> 30:55.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
print journalism to television.

30:55.387 --> 31:00.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, today, I went back and
looked at one
of her first appearances on NBC
in 1994. And

31:00.992 --> 31:05.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it takes a while to get sort of
the odd little
things, the way we put stories
together, but

31:05.163 --> 31:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she had that spark, that smile.
There was
a lot more hair then.

31:08.300 --> 31:09.267 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

31:09.301 --> 31:10.268 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETE WILLIAMS: A lot of us had
more hair...

31:10.302 --> 31:11.269 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

31:11.303 --> 31:13.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A lot of us did.

31:13.238 --> 31:17.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETE WILLIAMS: But that spark
that drove "Washington
Week," that made politics
interesting, but

31:17.476 --> 31:22.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fun, you wanted to pay attention
to, because
you felt you would learn
something in a pleasant

31:22.481 --> 31:24.282 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
way. And she had that even then.

31:24.316 --> 31:29.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Karen Tumulty, as
Hari said,
you knew Gwen even before Pete
did. You covered

31:29.254 --> 31:31.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Jesse Jackson campaign in
1988.

31:31.523 --> 31:33.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAREN TUMULTY, The Washington
Post: Right.

31:33.492 --> 31:35.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What was that
like? You were
two women covering from
different news organizations.

31:35.827 --> 31:39.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREN TUMULTY: And months on end
trapped in
airplanes and buses.

31:39.865 --> 31:41.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

31:41.700 --> 31:45.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KAREN TUMULTY: It's
extraordinary -- and I
think Rick would agree -- that,
even in those

31:45.203 --> 31:52.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- 30 years ago, there was a
presence to Gwen
that you would very much
recognize in Gwen

31:52.611 --> 31:58.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today. She was grounded. She
understood that
she was there looking for the
facts and looking

31:58.917 --> 32:00.652 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for the truth.

32:00.685 --> 32:05.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I do think, though, when she
did make
that transition to television,
one of the

32:05.524 --> 32:12.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
reasons that she was so
successful at it was
that I just always felt like her
honesty just

32:12.164 --> 32:13.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
came right through that lens.

32:13.999 --> 32:18.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETE WILLIAMS: I think a lot of
journalists
look for answers about
themselves, but I think

32:18.870 --> 32:24.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gwen knew who she was. And that
is something
that always came through and was
a -- I am

32:24.309 --> 32:25.944 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from Wyoming.

32:25.977 --> 32:28.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I was at a hardware store in
Jackson,
Wyoming, a couple of summers
ago, and the

32:28.980 --> 32:31.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
man who checked me out said,
"Boy, you must
really be special that Gwen
Ifill would have

32:32.017 --> 32:32.984 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you on."

32:33.018 --> 32:34.820 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

32:34.853 --> 32:37.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETE WILLIAMS: And I told her --
I said, "You
are big at Ace Hardware in
Jackson, Wyoming."

32:37.255 --> 32:38.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, of course, that was a big
thrill.

32:38.390 --> 32:40.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREN TUMULTY: I ran into a pit
boss in Las
Vegas.

32:40.859 --> 32:41.960 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

32:41.993 --> 32:43.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We have all got
stories like
this.

32:43.762 --> 32:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN TUMULTY: I was over at a
presidential
debate. And as I walking through
the casino

32:48.366 --> 32:52.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- but the pit boss goes, "Gwen
Ifill."

32:52.404 --> 32:54.206 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

32:54.239 --> 32:58.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD BERKE: The thing about
Gwen, you talk
about a transition to
television. She was

32:58.877 --> 33:04.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
resistant for months, if not
years, to go
from The New York Times to
television, because

33:04.716 --> 33:07.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she would always say: "I am a
journalist.
I am a journalist."

33:07.452 --> 33:13.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TV, forgive me, in her mind,
wasn't always
journalism. But she's the one
who carried

33:13.625 --> 33:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the tradition of fine
reporting, and
not punditry. Don't ever call
her a pundit,

33:20.999 --> 33:26.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because she would shriek at
that. She wanted
to talk about the news. And the
people on

33:26.571 --> 33:28.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Washington Week" would talk
about stories,
not...

33:28.807 --> 33:31.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREN TUMULTY: Because they were
actually
covering them.

33:31.276 --> 33:32.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

33:32.277 --> 33:33.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RICHARD BERKE: Right.

33:33.278 --> 33:34.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yamiche -- go
ahead.

33:34.946 --> 33:35.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yamiche
Alcindor, I want
to bring you into the
conversation.

33:35.947 --> 33:37.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How did you meet her? How did
she mentor you?

33:37.449 --> 33:37.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YAMICHE ALCINDOR, The New York
Times: I met
Gwen Ifill under a hair drier.

33:42.187 --> 33:44.055 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

33:44.089 --> 33:46.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YAMICHE ALCINDOR: We had the
same hairdresser.
And I was telling my hairdresser
so much stuff

33:47.025 --> 33:50.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about wanting to be a
journalist. And she
said, "You should really meet
Gwen Ifill and

33:50.328 --> 33:52.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her -- and one of her really
good friends,
Adalia (ph)."

33:52.697 --> 33:57.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I basically endeared myself
to both her
and her friend Adalia (ph). And
from that

33:57.535 --> 34:02.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moment -- I was about 19 when I
met her -- she
mentored me and her friends
mentored me. And

34:02.574 --> 34:07.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they really welcomed me into
what I learned
later was really like a circle
of black women

34:07.913 --> 34:12.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who were in news and were living
in D.C. at
the time, because I went to
Georgetown.

34:12.083 --> 34:16.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to come full circle, she
spoke at my graduation.
And that was the first time that
I remember

34:16.554 --> 34:20.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thinking, like, wow, I could
really do this
journalism thing. It was 2009. I
didn't know

34:20.992 --> 34:24.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if I was going to be able to
have a job. And
to be able to see her, to be
able to steadied

34:24.696 --> 34:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by her voice as I was walking
across the stage
really meant something.

34:28.366 --> 34:32.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the first memories I
remember of,
like, us actually talking, I
told her: "Hi,

34:32.304 --> 34:34.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my name is Yamiche, but you can
call me Niche
if you want to."

34:34.773 --> 34:38.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she said, "Well, do you like
being called
Niche? Like, what do you want to
be called?"

34:38.076 --> 34:39.277 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

34:39.311 --> 34:41.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YAMICHE ALCINDOR: "Don't let
people give you
nicknames."

34:41.146 --> 34:43.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it really stuck with me,
because she was
telling me then -- and I think
something that

34:43.715 --> 34:48.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
holds true now -- like, be who
you are. Be
very steady in what you believe
and be an

34:48.453 --> 34:53.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
honest journalist. Know your
name. Know what
you want people to call you and
really believe

34:53.458 --> 34:55.226 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in that.

34:55.260 --> 34:58.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for my entire career, which
hasn't been
that long, she has really been
someone who

34:58.997 --> 35:03.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not just -- not just someone
I could admire,
but someone who would watch my
"Meet the Press"

35:03.535 --> 35:05.337 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
interviews.

35:05.370 --> 35:07.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I remember the first time I was
going to be
on "Meet the Press." I called
her, somewhat

35:07.105 --> 35:10.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
frazzled, saying: "I'm going to
be doing the
show. Like, what do I do?"

35:10.608 --> 35:13.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she was like: "You know what
you're doing.
You know the information."

35:13.411 --> 35:17.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to have someone like that,
to have someone
of that caliber want to give
back to you,

35:18.016 --> 35:21.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then to speak to me, I
thought, meant
a lot to me, because it showed
me that not

35:21.853 --> 35:26.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only was she someone that I
wanted to imitate,
but she was also someone that
taught me to

35:26.124 --> 35:28.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also bring other journalists
that are younger
than me up.

35:28.593 --> 35:32.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is something that, even
in my busiest
days, I try to remember that she
took the

35:32.230 --> 35:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time out to talk to me, so I
need to take
the time out to talk to other
people.

35:35.533 --> 35:40.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I am just devastated by
hearing of her
loss, because I know that I'm
not just -- we're

35:40.038 --> 35:43.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not just losing a journalist,
but we're losing
someone who has really believed
in mentoring

35:43.575 --> 35:45.343 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
journalists coming behind her.

35:45.377 --> 35:51.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Pastor Lamar, you
talked about
Gwen mentoring younger women at
the church.

35:51.449 --> 35:53.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What was it about her? How did
those connections
work?

35:53.918 --> 35:59.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. WILLIAM LAMAR IV: Well, I
think it's
important to say, Judy, that
Gwen comes from

35:59.657 --> 36:07.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a long line of women who had
great dignity
and great grace in the midst of
turmoil and

36:07.732 --> 36:11.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tumultuous situations that would
shrink the
average human being.

36:11.469 --> 36:17.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, she comes from Barbados, the
West Indies,
and there's a great tradition of
excellence,

36:17.842 --> 36:23.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a great tradition of making sure
that you
make your presence known and
your gifts are

36:23.415 --> 36:25.150 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
used.

36:25.183 --> 36:28.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, coming from Barbados,
being a part
of the African Methodist
Episcopal Church,

36:28.420 --> 36:33.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
which has always been an
incubator of excellence
for persons of African descent,
and what I

36:33.091 --> 36:38.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
appreciated about Gwen is, as
she rose in
stature and prominence, she
didn't abandon

36:38.530 --> 36:41.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the institutions that had shaped
and created
her.

36:41.232 --> 36:47.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, she strengthened the church
by her presence
and by her participation, when
she was able,

36:47.705 --> 36:54.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taking the battleground when
necessary, offering
financial gifts, offering
mentorship, always

36:54.079 --> 36:55.880 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a smile.

36:55.914 --> 37:01.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I just think she was
incredibly graceful,
incredibly stern, and just a joy
to be around.

37:01.986 --> 37:09.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We talked about books. We talked
about food.
We talked about travel. And she
could expose

37:09.127 --> 37:12.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all that she had done and the
persons that
she knew in a way that wasn't
off-putting.

37:12.730 --> 37:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: She often talked
about being
a P.K., preacher's kid.

37:14.966 --> 37:16.768 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REV. WILLIAM LAMAR IV: Oh, yes.

37:16.801 --> 37:21.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I was teasing that many
preachers' kids
do not turn out to be the most
well-adjusted...

37:21.339 --> 37:22.307 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:22.340 --> 37:24.142 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

37:24.175 --> 37:25.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. WILLIAM LAMAR IV: And many
of them abandon
the church, because it can be a
very painful

37:25.510 --> 37:27.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
existence for children.

37:27.312 --> 37:33.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Gwen's love of the church
and her faith
wasn't something that was
cordoned off in

37:33.518 --> 37:39.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a personal kind of piety kind of
situation,
but it moved her into the world
to make the

37:39.357 --> 37:41.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
world a better place, a more
truthful place.

37:41.793 --> 37:47.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what I am amazed about is
the number of
deep personal relationships that
she was able

37:47.532 --> 37:55.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to maintain. The persons who
have been gathering
today as she was with us for her
last moments,

37:55.507 --> 37:59.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she touched them in deep, deep
ways. And I
felt that.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Rick Berke,
one of the things
that she said about being a
preacher's kid

38:01.846 --> 38:05.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that it actually put her into
different
situations over and over again,
as she had

38:05.316 --> 38:10.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to move, which is traumatic for
a young person.
But she figured out a way to get
comfortable

38:10.188 --> 38:11.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in these situations.

38:11.990 --> 38:15.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD BERKE: She knew how to
make people
comfortable and just to talk
truth to people.

38:15.960 --> 38:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think one of the things I
have learned
about Gwen through the last year
is -- that's

38:21.199 --> 38:27.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so inspirational to all of us --
and, Judy,
you have seen it close up -- is
her resilience

38:27.172 --> 38:35.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in dealing with health issues,
but never shrinking
for one second from doing the
debates and

38:35.847 --> 38:37.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the convention coverage.

38:37.649 --> 38:45.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the toughness and the drive
and the energy
it takes to do her job was
nothing short of

38:45.623 --> 38:47.425 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
inspirational.

38:47.458 --> 38:49.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Only about a
minute left, but
Pete and Karen, she -- and we
heard Amy Walter

38:49.594 --> 38:53.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say this in the last panel --
she -- Gwen
really wanted to be a part of
covering this

38:53.631 --> 38:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
election. And she fought hard.

38:55.733 --> 38:59.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It wasn't meant to be. She
wasn't there at
the end. But she hung in as long
as she could.

38:59.337 --> 39:03.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETE WILLIAMS: And how much we
would have
-- how much we would have
benefited from her

39:03.741 --> 39:05.510 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
analysis.

39:05.543 --> 39:09.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The thing that strikes me is,
you know, a
lot of people in Washington, as
they become

39:09.314 --> 39:12.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
successful, they shed their old
friends and
move into upper circles.

39:12.584 --> 39:16.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not Gwen. She added to them and
just kept
adding to them. And I would pick
up on your

39:16.754 --> 39:18.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
point there about that.

39:18.489 --> 39:23.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we are just
incredibly
grateful to all of you, to all
of you for

39:23.695 --> 39:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being here with us on this day
that we never
wanted to have arrive.

39:28.499 --> 39:31.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Yamiche Alcindor, thank you.

39:31.269 --> 39:33.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Pete Williams,
thanks to you.

39:33.671 --> 39:36.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Karen Tumulty, Rick Berke, and
Pastor Lamar,
thank you all.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REV. WILLIAM LAMAR IV: Thank
you.

39:38.142 --> 39:42.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we know that
Gwen would
have wanted us to report the
other news of

39:42.447 --> 39:45.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this very full day, too. And
that's what we
are going to do next.

39:45.750 --> 39:50.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we will be back at the end
of the program
with a conversation Gwen had
with her dear

39:50.288 --> 39:56.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
friend, former NPR host Michele
Norris.

39:56.060 --> 40:00.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
friend, former NPR host Michele
Norris.

40:18.082 --> 40:20.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
To that other news now.

40:20.151 --> 40:24.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President-elect Donald Trump ran
into growing
criticism today of one of his
first transition

40:24.822 --> 40:30.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
appointments. On Sunday, he
named conservative
media executive Steve Bannon as
his chief

40:30.094 --> 40:35.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strategist. Bannon's been
accused of racist
and anti-Semitic sentiments, and
Democrats

40:35.800 --> 40:38.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
condemned the choice, while the
Trump team
defended it.

40:38.703 --> 40:42.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REP. BETTY MCCOLLUM (D),
Minnesota: The fact
that Republicans have been
silent on Bannon's

40:42.040 --> 40:44.909 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
appointment is a disturbing
sign.

40:44.942 --> 40:50.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It shows that the Republican
Party has embraced
Trump's campaign agenda blatant
sexism, racial

40:50.882 --> 40:53.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bigotry and of religious
intolerance.

40:53.451 --> 40:58.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY, Trump Campaign
Manager:
I'm personally offended that you
would think

40:58.056 --> 41:03.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would manage a campaign where
that would
be one of the going
philosophies. It was not.

41:03.594 --> 41:06.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, as you know,
66-million-plus Americans
or so saw something else.

41:06.364 --> 41:10.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also today, the
president-elect
spoke by phone with Russian
President Vladimir

41:10.968 --> 41:16.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Putin, and told him he looks for
a strong
and enduring relationship with
Moscow.

41:16.074 --> 41:21.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, protests continued
against his
election. In East Los Angeles
today, students

41:21.612 --> 41:25.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
left class and marched toward
City Hall to
demonstrate.

41:25.049 --> 41:29.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The election
and transition
dominated President Obama's
White House news

41:29.420 --> 41:34.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conference today. It lasted well
over an hour,
and came before he left on his
final overseas

41:35.026 --> 41:36.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
trip as president.

41:36.794 --> 41:41.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The president said both
Americans and world
leaders need to give his
successor time to

41:41.366 --> 41:43.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
show what he means to do.

41:43.201 --> 41:48.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
In my conversation with the
president-elect,

41:48.106 --> 41:58.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he expressed a great interest in
maintaining
our core strategic
relationships.

41:58.249 --> 42:02.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so one of the messages I
will be able
to deliver is his commitment to
NATO and the

42:02.754 --> 42:07.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Transatlantic Alliance. I think
that's one
of the most important functions
I can serve

42:07.492 --> 42:14.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at this stage during this trip
is to let them
know that there is no weakening
of resolve

42:14.532 --> 42:20.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when it comes to America's
commitment to maintaining
a strong and robust NATO
relationship and

42:20.872 --> 42:28.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a recognition that those
alliances aren't
just good for Europe. They are
good for the

42:28.045 --> 42:30.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
United States, and they are
vital for the
world.

42:30.581 --> 42:37.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been encouraged by his
statements on
election night about the need
for unity and

42:37.488 --> 42:44.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his interest in being the
president for all
people. And that how he staffs,
the first

42:44.829 --> 42:52.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
steps he takes, the first
impressions he makes,
the reset that can happen after
an election,

42:52.203 --> 42:55.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all those things are important
and should
be thought about.

42:55.606 --> 43:04.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's important to
give him the
room and the space to do that.
It takes time

43:05.016 --> 43:06.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to put that together.

43:06.884 --> 43:11.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would not be appropriate for
me to comment
on every appointment that the
president-elect

43:11.422 --> 43:17.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
starts making, if I want to be
consistent
with the notion that we are
going to try to

43:18.029 --> 43:20.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
facilitate a smooth transition.

43:20.431 --> 43:27.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the people have spoken.
Donald Trump will
be the next president, the 45th
President

43:27.371 --> 43:35.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the United States. And it
will be up to
him to set up a team that he
thinks will serve

43:36.013 --> 43:45.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
him well and reflect his
policies. And those
who didn't vote for him have to
recognize

43:45.122 --> 43:48.559 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that that's how democracy works.

43:48.593 --> 43:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Regardless of what experience or
assumptions
he brought to the office, this
office has

43:54.899 --> 44:05.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a way of waking you up. And
those -- those
aspects of his positions or
predispositions

44:05.009 --> 44:10.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a way of waking you up. And
those -- those
aspects of his positions or
predispositions

44:10.948 --> 44:22.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that don't match up with
reality, he will
find shaken up pretty quick,
because reality

44:22.193 --> 44:25.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has a way of asserting itself.

44:25.463 --> 44:30.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: Mr. President, you had
talked specifically
about his temperament. Do you
still have any

44:30.668 --> 44:32.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
concern about his temperament?

44:32.336 --> 44:37.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: There are going to
be certain
elements of his temperament that
will not

44:37.575 --> 44:48.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
serve him well, unless he
recognizes them
and corrects them, because when
you're a candidate

44:48.719 --> 44:56.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and you say something that is
inaccurate or
controversial, it has less
impact than it

44:56.627 --> 45:00.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
does when you're president of
the United States.

45:00.865 --> 45:03.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everybody around the world's
paying attention.
Markets move.

45:03.801 --> 45:10.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the deferred action program
that we have,
known as DACA, that relates to
dreamers who

45:10.942 --> 45:19.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are currently benefiting from
these provisions,
I will urge the president-elect
and the incoming

45:19.784 --> 45:32.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration to think long and
hard before
they are endangering the status
of what, for

45:32.496 --> 45:35.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all practical purposes, are
American kids.

45:36.000 --> 45:40.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we will try to share the
lessons that
we have learned over these last
eight years

45:40.805 --> 45:47.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the incoming president. And
my hope is,
he makes things better. And, if
he does, we

45:47.411 --> 45:49.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will all benefit from it.

45:49.213 --> 45:52.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: The
contest for chair of the
Democratic National

45:52.984 --> 45:58.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Committee heated up.
Representative Keith
Ellison of Minnesota, the first
Muslim elected

45:58.322 --> 46:00.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Congress, announced he's
running.

46:00.625 --> 46:05.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former Vermont Governor Howard
Dean is also
in the race, and several others
may join.

46:05.062 --> 46:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Congress
returned to work
today for the first time since
the election,

46:09.233 --> 46:13.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chief on the agenda, keeping the
government
open past December 9, when
current funding

46:13.871 --> 46:15.673 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
expires.

46:15.706 --> 46:19.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans are expected to push
a short-term
bill, delaying a comprehensive
measure until

46:19.510 --> 46:22.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president-elect Trump is
inaugurated.

46:22.480 --> 46:26.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In New Zealand, the military
worked today
to rescue some 1,200 people from
a town hit

46:26.350 --> 46:32.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hard by an earthquake on Sunday.
It registered
magnitude-7.8 and left tourists
and locals

46:32.456 --> 46:38.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stranded in Kaikoura on the
coast. Highways
into the town were destroyed by
landslides

46:38.429 --> 46:43.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and homes were leveled. The
government sent
ships and helicopters to rescue
those who

46:43.100 --> 46:44.902 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are stranded.

46:44.935 --> 46:48.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KEY, Prime Minister of New
Zealand: The
only way through is flying
people in and out.

46:48.272 --> 46:49.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's quite a number of
tourists now who
also could be stuck with
international connections.

46:49.273 --> 46:51.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we will have to think about
that.

46:51.142 --> 47:02.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's also the longevity of
the businesses
here, that, short term, aren't
getting a lot

47:02.086 --> 47:03.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of customers, because, again,
you know, because
there's no access point in and
out.

47:03.921 --> 47:06.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The quake
killed two people,
and the prime minister estimated
damage in

47:06.724 --> 47:08.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the billions of dollars.

47:08.492 --> 47:12.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In economic news,
the chair
of the Securities and Exchange
Commission,

47:12.096 --> 47:16.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mary Jo White, says that she
will step down
in the coming weeks. She's been
in the position

47:16.667 --> 47:18.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nearly four years.

47:18.469 --> 47:23.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial
average gained 21 points to
close at 18868.

47:23.274 --> 47:29.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 18 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
slipped a quarter-of-a-point.

47:29.647 --> 47:34.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And the
brightest moon in
almost 70 years lit up the sky
overnight.

47:34.318 --> 47:38.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The so-called supermoon appeared
much bigger
and brighter than usual, as its
orbit brought

47:38.989 --> 47:45.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it within 221,000 miles of
Earth. That's the
closest since 1948. It won't
happen again

47:45.196 --> 47:52.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for another 18 years.

47:52.269 --> 48:02.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally, a
final word
from our unforgettable Gwen
Ifill.

48:02.313 --> 48:09.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally, a
final word
from our unforgettable Gwen
Ifill.

48:09.386 --> 48:13.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gwen was interviewed by her
close friend and
fellow journalist Michele Norris
for an episode

48:13.991 --> 48:19.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of the PBS series "The
HistoryMakers" which
first aired in January 2015.

48:19.730 --> 48:25.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We close tonight with Gwen's own
thoughts
about political history,
journalism, and her

48:25.069 --> 48:26.170 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
own role.

48:26.203 --> 48:29.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHELE NORRIS, NPR: When you
went to television...

48:29.173 --> 48:30.941 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

48:30.975 --> 48:33.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELE NORRIS: ... we heart
from Pete Williams
that you took to it almost
immediately.

48:33.210 --> 48:35.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That's so not true.

48:35.212 --> 48:39.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was -- I love Pete. And it's
so sweet that
he thought at. But it was really
hard making

48:39.550 --> 48:42.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- and you know this -- making
the transition
from print to television.

48:42.887 --> 48:46.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You had to figure out how to
write differently.
You had to figure out how
present differently.

48:46.457 --> 48:49.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you had to settle on the
right shade of
lipstick, which was huge.

48:49.593 --> 48:51.362 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:51.395 --> 48:54.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It turned out that
everybody had
something to say about you when
you're in

48:54.765 --> 48:56.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
front of a television.

48:56.500 --> 48:59.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the other thing is, you get
your phone
calls returned. People felt they
knew you.

48:59.570 --> 49:03.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That accessibility quotient came
to work.
And you reached a much broader
audience.

49:03.541 --> 49:07.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when I left The Times, I
remember going
to the then publisher, Arthur
Sulzberger,

49:07.878 --> 49:11.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at The Times and told him I was
thinking of
leaving to go to work for NBC.

49:11.282 --> 49:14.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said: "Why would you go
to work in
television? I don't watch
television."

49:14.852 --> 49:15.786 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:15.820 --> 49:18.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Well, that's
changed.

49:18.355 --> 49:22.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the point was, I wanted to
make sure,
another important lesson for the
children,

49:22.326 --> 49:26.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is, I didn't burn bridges.
I made sure,
in case I failed in television,
I could go

49:26.363 --> 49:28.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
back to print.

49:28.966 --> 49:33.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I didn't fail for the same
reasons why
you don't fail. You work hard.
It's not how

49:33.804 --> 49:37.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you get in the door. It's what
you do once
you are through the door. And
you make sure

49:37.775 --> 49:43.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you make friends and learn
lessons from
the people who are willing to
help and ignore

49:43.681 --> 49:45.449 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the haters.

49:45.482 --> 49:47.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELE NORRIS: But, you know,
and one thing
that I can say, having worked in
television

49:47.451 --> 49:52.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also, is that everywhere I would
go, I would
find camera crews who loved them
some Gwen

49:52.990 --> 49:56.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ifill, that you remembered that
it was a team
that got you on the air.

49:56.560 --> 50:00.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, I would flirt
with the camera
crews, too, I should say, to
this day.

50:00.698 --> 50:01.765 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

50:01.799 --> 50:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHELE NORRIS: You covered a
lot of conventions.

50:02.700 --> 50:04.568 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

50:04.602 --> 50:06.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELE NORRIS: And you have
said that covering
the conventions is actually one
of your favorite

50:06.837 --> 50:07.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
parts of covering politics.

50:07.838 --> 50:09.073 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

50:09.106 --> 50:10.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHELE NORRIS: What do you love
so much about
conventions?

50:10.741 --> 50:13.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I'm one of the last
holdouts who
think conventions kind of
matter.

50:13.777 --> 50:18.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I like a room full of people who
are enthusiastic
about the process. I like -- I
think it's

50:18.349 --> 50:20.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
important that we hear from the
future leaders
of our party.

50:20.985 --> 50:27.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was standing on the podium --
the podium
-- the dais in 2004 when the
keynote speaker

50:27.391 --> 50:32.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
finished speaking. And when
Barack Obama walked
over to me with the -- you know,
place was

50:32.129 --> 50:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
crazy, and the confetti was
flying and balloons.

50:36.533 --> 50:38.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHELE NORRIS: The balloons and
all that.

50:38.068 --> 50:40.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And there was this
electricity,
you will remember, that night.

50:40.571 --> 50:43.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I asked him how he thought
he did. And
he says, "Ah, I think I did OK."

50:43.107 --> 50:45.042 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

50:45.075 --> 50:48.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now, I found out
later that Michelle
had said to him in advance,
"Just don't screw

50:48.679 --> 50:49.647 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up."

50:49.680 --> 50:50.648 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

50:50.681 --> 50:52.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, you know what?
He didn't.

50:52.449 --> 50:56.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was great to be there in
that moment
at that time, and to talk to him
about it,

50:56.487 --> 51:01.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and to capture that sparkle that
came off
him as he was bursting on to the
scene.

51:01.158 --> 51:03.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELE NORRIS: Your brother has
said that
you, as a kid, used to watch
conventions.

51:04.028 --> 51:07.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Yes, don't believe
everything
my brother says, but that's
right.

51:07.965 --> 51:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHELE NORRIS: You did? You
did?

51:09.266 --> 51:12.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: We watched
conventions kind of
for recreation.

51:12.803 --> 51:16.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Once again, this was an
extension of the fact
that my parents thought that
what happened

51:16.907 --> 51:21.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in American politics and
government mattered.
So -- and, also, keep in mind
that, when we

51:21.478 --> 51:24.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were growing up and watching
conventions,
we didn't know how they were
going to end.

51:24.415 --> 51:26.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were actually kind of
dramatic.

51:26.517 --> 51:32.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And imagine watching a
convention when Barbara
Jordan gets up and speaks, and
you're a little

51:32.756 --> 51:38.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
black girl at home who sees
nothing like this
on television. It blows your
mind. Where else

51:38.329 --> 51:41.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was I going to see that voice,
hear that voice?

51:41.498 --> 51:44.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, as a result, whenever I
go through
the Austin Airport, I stop and
pat her a little

51:45.002 --> 51:50.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bit. There's a wonderful bronze
sculpture
of her in baggage claim at the
Austin Airport.

51:50.641 --> 51:54.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just greet her every time,
because she
was amazing.

51:54.478 --> 51:59.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Shirley Chisholm -- I mean,
there were
women, black women who were out
there speaking

51:59.116 --> 52:02.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their truth in an environment
where it wasn't
generally welcomed.

52:02.619 --> 52:09.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELE NORRIS: As I listen to
you talk about
this, though, I'm imagining
children watching

52:09.360 --> 52:11.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
television now and seeing you.

52:11.061 --> 52:13.263 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: OK.

52:13.297 --> 52:14.531 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:14.565 --> 52:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: She's going to make
me a little
verklempt here.

52:16.834 --> 52:21.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, when I was a little
girl, there
was a woman named Melba Tolliver
who was on

52:21.672 --> 52:27.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the news. And she had a big
afro. And I just
was transfixed by this idea, not
-- it didn't

52:27.344 --> 52:31.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
make me want to be in
television, as much
as it made me want to tell the
story.

52:31.382 --> 52:36.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And every now and then, I'm not
particularly
interested in -- you know, I
just get caught

52:36.220 --> 52:40.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up in whatever the day's work
is. And, invariably,
somebody will come up to me and
tell me the

52:40.090 --> 52:41.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
story of their little girl.

52:41.859 --> 52:46.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it always stops me in my
tracks, because,
as long as I remember that there
is someone

52:46.597 --> 52:51.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the other side of the piece
of equipment,
the camera, who is watching me
with expectation,

52:51.735 --> 52:57.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it can shape what they do
next, I just
take what I do seriously every
single day.

52:57.508 --> 53:01.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That's the
"NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:01.512 --> 53:03.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
To my friend and mentor, thank
you, Gwen.

53:03.647 --> 53:04.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

53:04.648 --> 53:06.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

53:06.417 --> 53:11.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," Gwen,
we love you. We will miss you.

53:11.388 --> 53:17.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we know all of you in our
audience will,
too.

53:17.428 --> 53:21.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we know all of you in our
audience will,
too.
