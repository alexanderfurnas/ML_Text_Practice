JUDY WOODRUFF: And in the day's
other news,
the chief justice of Alabama's
highest court

00:05.205 --> 00:11.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
urged local officials to deny
marriage licenses
to same-sex couples. That's
despite the U.S.

00:11.912 --> 00:17.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Supreme Court's decision in June
to legalize
gay marriage nationwide.

00:17.351 --> 00:22.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State Chief Justice Roy Moore
said the Supreme
Court decision is at odds with
his court's

00:22.856 --> 00:28.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
earlier rulings and is causing
-- quote -- "confusion
and uncertainty." Moore stopped
short of directly

00:29.029 --> 00:31.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ordering Alabama officials not
to issue licenses.

GWEN IFILL: For the 62nd time,
the Republican-led
House has voted to repeal
President Obama's

00:38.438 --> 00:43.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health care law. But this time,
it's going
all the way to his desk. House
Speaker Paul

00:43.310 --> 00:48.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ryan conceded Congress won't be
able to override
a promised veto, but he said
it's worth the

00:49.016 --> 00:50.717 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
effort anyway.

00:50.751 --> 00:53.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House:
We are confronting the president
with the

00:53.654 --> 01:01.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hard, honest truth: Obamacare
doesn't work.
Higher premiums and fewer
choices and restricted

01:01.628 --> 01:08.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
access, these are not signs of
success. Obamacare
is not successful. They are
signs of failure,

01:08.435 --> 01:10.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the American people deserve
better.

01:10.570 --> 01:15.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Senate already
passed the
repeal measure, which also cuts
funding for

01:15.208 --> 01:20.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Planned Parenthood. But
Massachusetts Congressman
Jim McGovern and other Democrats
said it's

01:20.380 --> 01:22.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wrong-headed and a waste of
time.

01:22.482 --> 01:26.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REP. JIM MCGOVERN (D),
Massachusetts: I can't
understand how you can get up
every morning

01:26.920 --> 01:31.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and go to work and that's your
mission, to
make it more difficult for
people in this

01:31.458 --> 01:37.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country, to throw 22 million
people off the
health insurance rolls, to make
it more difficult

01:37.898 --> 01:42.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for vulnerable women to get
preventative care
at Planned Parenthood. That's
the mission.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's how we're beginning this
new year.

01:44.771 --> 01:49.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The bill would
eliminate the requirement
that most people obtain health
coverage, and

01:49.843 --> 01:54.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it would curb the expansion of
Medicaid, as
well as the taxes imposed to pay
for the law.

JUDY WOODRUFF: The man who
bought the rifles
used in the San Bernardino
shootings pleaded

01:59.386 --> 02:05.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not guilty today in a federal
court in California.
Enrique Marquez is accused of
conspiring to

02:05.826 --> 02:12.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aid terrorists, among other
charges. His friend
Syed Farook and Farook's wife,
Tashfeen Malik,

02:12.833 --> 02:19.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shot 14 people to death at a
holiday party
in December. Marquez goes on
trial next month.

GWEN IFILL: There's evidence
today that years
of drug violence in Mexico has
actually cut

02:24.911 --> 02:29.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
life expectancy in the last
decade. Research
in the journal "Health Affairs"
finds the

02:29.950 --> 02:36.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
projected life span of Mexican
men fell by
more than seven months between
2005 and 2010;

02:37.024 --> 02:41.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
50,000 people died during that
period in Mexico's
war with drug cartels.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Iraq is offering
to mediate
the diplomatic dispute between
Saudi Arabia

02:47.067 --> 02:53.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Iran. The Saudis' Sunni
regime cut off
relations with Shiite Iran last
weekend, after

02:53.673 --> 03:00.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attacks on Saudi diplomatic
sites in Tehran
and elsewhere. That followed
Riyadh's execution

03:00.347 --> 03:02.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of a top Shiite cleric.

03:02.549 --> 03:09.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Tehran today, Iraq's foreign
minister,
Ibrahim Al-Jaafari, met with his
Iranian counterpart

03:09.156 --> 03:11.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and talked of finding a way to
restore calm.

IBRAHIM AL-JAAFARI, Iraqi
Foreign Minister
(through translator): Iraq is at
the heart

03:16.430 --> 03:20.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the region, and we have
sought to use our
broad relations with Arab
countries and other

03:20.434 --> 03:25.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
countries so that Iraq can play
its role and
alleviate tensions between Iran
and Saudi

03:25.305 --> 03:30.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Arabia. We have been active from
the early
moments to prevent a disaster
from happening

03:30.510 --> 03:32.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that could affect the entire
region.

03:32.446 --> 03:37.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Iraq's Shiite-led
government
has relied on Iran for help
fighting Islamic

03:37.984 --> 03:43.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State forces. Separately today,
the White
House said President Obama spoke
by phone

03:43.090 --> 03:48.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider
al-Abadi
on their -- quote -- "mutual
concern" about

03:48.095 --> 03:49.830 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the situation.

03:49.863 --> 03:55.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Germany now says a
record 1.1
million people sought asylum
there last year.

03:55.268 --> 03:59.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
About two-thirds of the migrants
came from
Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.

03:59.773 --> 04:03.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the numbers came out, German
Chancellor
Angela Merkel told reporters --
quote -- "It

04:03.910 --> 04:10.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is very important that we
achieve both a noticeable
reduction in the flow of
refugees and maintain

04:10.517 --> 04:12.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
open borders inside Europe."

JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, Republican
presidential candidate Ted Cruz
dismissed

04:17.891 --> 04:23.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
questions from rival Donald
Trump about his
being born in Canada. The Texas
senator said

04:23.730 --> 04:29.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's settled law that having at
least one
American parent makes you a U.S.
citizen,

04:29.436 --> 04:34.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even if you are born abroad.
Cruz's mother

04:40.046 --> 04:46.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the woman who died in jail after
a traffic
stop in July. Brian Encinia will
face misdemeanor

04:46.620 --> 04:52.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
county of perjury for allegedly
lying about
how he removed Bland from her

04:52.058 --> 04:55.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
jury declined to charge anyone
with Bland's
death.

A major federal assessment finds
a leading
class of insecticides can be
harmful to honeybees

05:00.534 --> 05:09.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in some crops. The Environmental
Protection
Agency says neonicotinoids pose
a significant

05:09.676 --> 05:15.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
risk to honeybees on cotton and
citrus crops,
but not on corn and berries.
Today's report

05:15.048 --> 05:19.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the first of four planned by

it decides whether to ban the
insecticide.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And the bears
were back in
charge today on Wall Street
after oil prices

05:25.292 --> 05:31.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plunged again and worries built
about China's
slowdown, as well as North
Korea's weapons

05:31.264 --> 05:39.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
