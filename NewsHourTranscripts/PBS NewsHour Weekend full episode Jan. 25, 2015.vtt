00:13.280 --> 00:14.848
A CRITICAL ELECTION IN GREECE.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.483
PARLIAMENTARY VOTING THAT COULD

00:16.483 --> 00:17.651
HAVE MAJOR IMPLICATIONS FOR ALL

00:17.651 --> 00:18.852
OF EUROPE AND FOR MARKETS AROUND

00:18.852 --> 00:20.254
THE WORLD.

00:20.254 --> 00:21.922
A TOP HEALTH OFFICIAL EXPLAINS

00:21.922 --> 00:23.257
WHAT'S BEHIND THE GROWING

00:23.257 --> 00:24.491
OUTBREAK OF MEASLES IN THE U.S.

00:24.491 --> 00:27.828
AND WHAT CAN BE DONE TO STOP IT.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.463
AND AS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S VISIT

00:29.463 --> 00:30.831
TO INDIA CONTINUES, WE'LL LOOK

00:30.831 --> 00:32.299
AT THAT NATION'S PLAN TO

00:32.299 --> 00:33.967
MODERNIZE ITS ECONOMY.

00:33.967 --> 00:35.168
WILL HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

00:35.168 --> 00:37.905
POOR PEOPLE THERE BENEFIT OR BE

00:37.905 --> 00:39.239

00:48.115 --> 00:49.349
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING,

00:49.349 --> 00:50.784
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:50.784 --> 00:51.952
IN AN ELECTION BEING WATCHED

00:51.952 --> 00:53.420
CLOSELY THROUGHOUT EUROPE AND

00:53.420 --> 00:54.821
AROUND THE WORLD, GREECE'S LEFT-

00:54.821 --> 00:55.956
WING, ANTI-AUSTERITY PARTY TODAY

00:55.956 --> 00:56.957
WON A DECISIVE VICTORY OVER THE

00:56.957 --> 00:59.159
RULING CENTER-RIGHT PARTY.

00:59.159 --> 01:00.527
THAT MEANS ALEXIS TSIPRAS IS ALL

01:00.527 --> 01:01.461
BUT CERTAIN TO BECOME THE NEXT

01:01.461 --> 01:04.364
PRIME MINISTER.

01:04.364 --> 01:05.499
TSIPRAS HAS PLEDGED TO TRY TO

01:05.499 --> 01:07.134
FORCE GREECE'S CREDITORS,

01:07.134 --> 01:08.602
INCLUDING GERMANY, TO

01:08.602 --> 01:10.637
RENEGOTIATE THE TERMS OF THE 270

01:10.637 --> 01:12.673
BILLION DOLLAR BAILOUT PACKAGE

01:12.673 --> 01:14.808
PUT TOGETHER AFTER THE 2008

01:14.808 --> 01:16.109
GREAT RECESSION TO HELP GREECE

01:16.109 --> 01:18.912
STAVE OFF ECONOMIC COLLAPSE.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.914
BUT IN THE YEARS SINCE, GREECE'S

01:20.914 --> 01:23.083
ECONOMY HAS SHRUNK BY 25 PERCENT

01:23.083 --> 01:24.818
AND ABOUT A THIRD OF THE

01:24.818 --> 01:26.653
CITIZENS THERE NOW LIVE AT OR

01:26.653 --> 01:28.689
BELOW THE POVERTY LINE.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.390
WE'LL HAVE MORE ABOUT WHAT

01:30.390 --> 01:31.591
TODAY'S ELECTION RESULTS MIGHT

01:31.591 --> 01:33.026
MEAN FOR GREECE, THE REST OF

01:33.026 --> 01:34.561
EUROPE AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS

01:34.561 --> 01:36.063
RIGHT AFTER THE NEWS SUMMARY.

01:36.063 --> 01:37.798
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS IN INDIA ON

01:37.798 --> 01:39.066
AN OFFICIAL VISIT, AND AFTER

01:39.066 --> 01:40.233
HOURS OF TALKS WITH PRIME

01:40.233 --> 01:41.501
MINISTER NARENDRA MODI, THE

01:41.501 --> 01:43.470
PRESIDENT SAID THE TWO LEADERS

01:43.470 --> 01:44.905
HAD REACHED WHAT HE CALLED "A

01:44.905 --> 01:46.273
BREAKTHROUGH UNDERSTANDING" THAT

01:46.273 --> 01:47.274
WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR

01:47.274 --> 01:48.208
AMERICAN FIRMS TO BUILD NUCLEAR

01:48.208 --> 01:49.810
REACTORS IN INDIA.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.111
THE TWO COUNTRIES ALSO RENEWED A

01:51.111 --> 01:52.446
DEFENSE PACT AND HAILED AN

01:52.446 --> 01:53.714
AGREEMENT TO JOINTLY PRODUCE NEW

01:53.714 --> 01:56.216
DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY.

01:56.216 --> 01:57.484
BUT TALKS ON CLIMATE CHANGE

01:57.484 --> 01:58.719
REPORTEDLY YIELDED ONLY MINOR

01:58.719 --> 02:00.487
PROGRESS.

02:00.487 --> 02:01.922
WHILE IN INDIA, THE PRESIDENT

02:01.922 --> 02:03.423
BLAMED RUSSIA FOR RENEWED

02:03.423 --> 02:04.791
VIOLENCE IN EASTERN UKRAINE AND

02:04.791 --> 02:06.426
WARNED THAT THE UNITED STATES

02:06.426 --> 02:07.995
WOULD, IN HIS WORDS, RATCHET UP

02:07.995 --> 02:10.897
THE PRESSURE" ON THE KREMLIN.

02:10.897 --> 02:12.599
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WOULD

02:12.599 --> 02:13.967
EXPLORE ADDITIONAL OPTIONS,

02:13.967 --> 02:16.036
SHORT OF MILITARY CONFRONTATION.

02:16.036 --> 02:17.337
PRO-RUSSIAN REBELS ANNOUNCED A

02:17.337 --> 02:18.705
NEW OFFENSIVE THIS WEEK AND ARE

02:18.705 --> 02:19.706
SAID TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR

02:19.706 --> 02:21.241
SHELLING THAT KILLED 30

02:21.241 --> 02:24.211
CIVILIANS YESTERDAY.

02:24.211 --> 02:25.579
SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY

02:25.579 --> 02:27.014
HAS ARRIVED IN NIGERIA, AND

02:27.014 --> 02:28.615
TODAY HE HELD TALKS WITH THAT

02:28.615 --> 02:30.083
COUNTRY'S PRESIDENT AND HIS

02:30.083 --> 02:31.485
CHIEF RIVAL IN NEXT MONTH'S

02:31.485 --> 02:32.853
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS THERE.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.121
AS THOSE TALKS WERE OCCURRING,

02:34.121 --> 02:35.555
BOKO HARAM ISLAMIC MILITANTS

02:35.555 --> 02:36.923
LAUNCHED NEW ATTACKS ON

02:36.923 --> 02:38.558
MAIDUGURI, ONE OF NIGERIA'S

02:38.558 --> 02:40.060
MAJOR CITIES IN THE NORTH OF THE

02:40.060 --> 02:41.762
COUNTRY.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.330
ACCORDING TO THE COUNCIL ON

02:43.330 --> 02:44.564
FOREIGN RELATIONS HERE IN NEW

02:44.564 --> 02:45.532
YORK, THE MILITANTS HAVE KILLED

02:45.532 --> 02:47.467
8,000 NIGERIANS SINCE 2011.

02:47.467 --> 02:48.835
IN ISRAEL TODAY, PRIME MINISTER

02:48.835 --> 02:50.103
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU DEFENDED HIS

02:50.103 --> 02:51.471
DECISION TO ADDRESS THE U.S.

02:51.471 --> 02:52.873
CONGRESS IN MARCH, EVEN THOUGH

02:52.873 --> 02:54.307
HIS INVITATION TO SPEAK WAS

02:54.307 --> 02:55.542
EXTENDED BY HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN

02:55.542 --> 02:57.110
BOEHNER WITHOUT WHITE HOUSE

02:57.110 --> 02:58.512
KNOWLEDGE, AN ACT SOME HAVE

02:58.512 --> 02:59.946
CRITICIZED AS A BREACH OF

02:59.946 --> 03:04.951
PROTOCOL.

03:04.951 --> 03:06.753
>> (translated): IN COMING

03:06.753 --> 03:08.355
WEEKS, WORLD POWERS ARE LIABLE

03:08.355 --> 03:09.556
TO REACH A FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT

03:09.556 --> 03:10.891
WITH IRAN, THAT COULD LEAVE IRAN

03:10.891 --> 03:11.758
AS A NUCLEAR THRESHOLD STATE,

03:11.758 --> 03:12.859
SOMETHING THAT WOULD CHIEFLY

03:12.859 --> 03:13.960
IMPERIL THE EXISTENCE OF THE

03:13.960 --> 03:15.195
STATE OF ISRAEL.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.396
I WILL GO ANYWHERE I AM INVITED

03:16.396 --> 03:17.531
TO MAKE ISRAEL'S CASE AND DEFEND

03:17.531 --> 03:20.934
ITS FUTURE AND EXISTENCE.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.369
>> Sreenivasan: BUT AN ISRAELI

03:22.369 --> 03:23.637
OPPOSITION LEADER, TZIPI LIVNI,

03:23.637 --> 03:24.738
CRITICIZED NETANYAHU'S DECISION

03:24.738 --> 03:27.174
TO MAKE THE VISIT.

03:27.174 --> 03:28.375
>> YOUR JOB AS PRIME MINISTER IS

03:28.375 --> 03:29.409
TO WORK WITH AMERICAN

03:29.409 --> 03:31.178
PRESIDENTS.

03:31.178 --> 03:32.712
THEY ARE THE ONES WHO MAKE THE

03:32.712 --> 03:33.747
DECISIONS.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.015
THEY ARE THE ONES WHO STAND BY

03:35.015 --> 03:37.117
US, WHETHER THEY ARE REPUBLICANS

03:37.117 --> 03:38.318
OR DEMOCRATS.

03:38.318 --> 03:45.192
>> Sreenivasan: WHITE HOUSE

03:45.192 --> 03:46.193
CHIEF OF STAFF DENIS McDONOUGH

03:46.193 --> 03:47.561
INSISTED TODAY THAT PRESIDENT

03:47.561 --> 03:48.595
OBAMA'S DECISION NOT TO MEET

03:48.595 --> 03:49.663
WITH NETANYAHU WHILE HE IS

03:49.663 --> 03:50.931
WASHINGTON IS NOT INDICATIVE OF

03:50.931 --> 03:52.132
A RIFT BETWEEN THE TWO LEADERS,

03:52.132 --> 03:53.400
JUST A MATTER OF THE VISIT

03:53.400 --> 03:55.035
OCCURRING SHORTLY BEFORE ISRAELI

03:55.035 --> 03:56.369
PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.

03:56.369 --> 03:57.571
>> WE OUGHT NOT GET INVOLVED IN

03:57.571 --> 03:59.372
THEIR POLITICS.

03:59.372 --> 04:00.507
THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT THINK

04:00.507 --> 04:01.708
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE FOR US

04:01.708 --> 04:02.542
TO MEET WITH THE PRIME MINISTER

04:02.542 --> 04:03.677
TWO WEEKS BEFORE HIS ELECTION.

04:03.677 --> 04:04.778
>> Sreenivasan: THE OBAMA

04:04.778 --> 04:05.912
ADMINISTRATION SAID TODAY THAT

04:05.912 --> 04:07.080
IT WANTS ABOUT 1.4 MILLION ACRES

04:07.080 --> 04:08.115
OF THE ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE

04:08.115 --> 04:09.449
REFUGE DESIGNATED AS WILDERNESS,

04:09.449 --> 04:10.784
A MOVE THAT WOULD RESTRICT OIL

04:10.784 --> 04:12.185
AND GAS DRILLING IN THE AREA.

04:12.185 --> 04:13.687
THE DECISION WAS IMMEDIATELY

04:13.687 --> 04:14.888
DENOUNCED BY ALASKA REPUBLICAN

04:14.888 --> 04:18.892
SENATOR LISA MURKOWSKI WHO

04:18.892 --> 04:20.560
CALLED IT, QUOTING NOW, "A

04:20.560 --> 04:22.262
STUNNING ATTACK ON OUR

04:22.262 --> 04:24.064
SOVEREIGNTY" THAT WOULD DO

04:24.064 --> 04:25.565
ECONOMIC HARM TO THE STATE.

04:25.565 --> 04:26.666
ALASKA'S GOVERNOR, INDEPENDENT

04:26.666 --> 04:27.901
BILL WALKER, SAID OIL AND GAS

04:27.901 --> 04:29.302
DEVELOPMENT ON STATE LANDS MIGHT

04:29.302 --> 04:30.070
ACCELERATE TO COMPENSATE FOR THE

04:30.070 --> 04:31.571
NEW FEDERAL RESTRICTIONS.

04:31.571 --> 04:32.706
THE FEDERAL AVIATION

04:32.706 --> 04:33.740
ADMINISTRATION HAS WARNED

04:33.740 --> 04:34.808
COMMERCIAL AIRLINES THAT

04:34.808 --> 04:35.775
ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES MAY POSE A

04:35.775 --> 04:37.010
FIRE HAZARD.

04:37.010 --> 04:38.078
IT WANTS THEM PUT ONLY IN CARRY-

04:38.078 --> 04:39.579
ON LUGGAGE, NOT IN CHECKED BAGS,

04:39.579 --> 04:40.780
BECAUSE A FIRE ON BOARD CAN BE

04:40.780 --> 04:42.282
EXTINGUISHED MORE QUICKLY THAN A

04:42.282 --> 04:45.619
FIRE IN THE CARGO HOLD.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.154
E-CIGARETTES HAVE BEEN LINKED TO

04:47.154 --> 04:48.321
AT LEAST TWO FIRES SINCE AUGUST-

04:48.321 --> 04:49.923
- ONE ON A PLANE; ANOTHER IN AN

04:49.923 --> 04:52.826
AIRPORT BAGGAGE AREA.

04:52.826 --> 04:55.295
A TRADE GROUP REPRESENTING THE

04:55.295 --> 04:56.630
AIRLINES SAID IT IS CLOSELY

04:56.630 --> 05:09.709
REVIEWING THE FAA SAFETY ALERT.

05:09.709 --> 05:10.844
THE IMPACT OF TODAY'S VOTE IN

05:10.844 --> 05:11.912
GREECE IS LIKELY TO AFFECT

05:11.912 --> 05:13.180
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.114
TO HELP UNDERSTAND HOW, WE ARE

05:14.114 --> 05:15.615
JOINED NOW BY JOHN AUTHERS.

05:15.615 --> 05:16.616
HE IS THE SENIOR INVESTMENT

05:16.616 --> 05:17.617
COLUMNIST FOR THE "FINANCIAL

05:17.617 --> 05:19.719
TIMES."

05:19.719 --> 05:20.420
WHAT DOES IT MEAN IF THE

05:20.420 --> 05:22.189
PARTY TAKES CONTROL OF

05:22.189 --> 05:23.290
PARLIAMENT, WHETHER IT'S AN

05:23.290 --> 05:24.624
ABSOLUTE MAJORITY OR NOT?

05:24.624 --> 05:26.293
>> IT MEANS THEY NOW HAVE A

05:26.293 --> 05:27.294
MANDATE TO DO WHAT THEY HAVE

05:27.294 --> 05:28.728
BEEN THREATENING TO DO FOR

05:28.728 --> 05:29.763
SEVERAL YEARS, WHICH IS

05:29.763 --> 05:31.164
ATTEMPT TO RENEGOTIATE THE

05:31.164 --> 05:34.234
TERMS OF THE BAILOUT IN

05:34.234 --> 05:35.635
WHICH THEY RECEIVED FROM THE

05:35.635 --> 05:37.037
EUROPEAN UNION SOME YEARS

05:37.037 --> 05:37.671
AGO.

05:37.671 --> 05:41.107
PLAINLY THAT THEN OPENS THE

05:41.107 --> 05:42.475
ISSUE AS THEY FAILED TO

05:42.475 --> 05:43.510
NEGOTIATE NEW TERMS THAT

05:43.510 --> 05:45.645
THEY LEAVE THE YOUR OZONE

05:45.645 --> 05:46.913
INPUT THERE IS NO QUESTION.

05:46.913 --> 05:47.647
>> Sreenivasan: AND HOW DOES

05:47.647 --> 05:49.015
THE EU FEEL ABOUT

05:49.015 --> 05:50.550
RENEGOTIATING A BAILOUT THAT

05:50.550 --> 05:52.085
THEY BEGRUDGINGLY ACCEPTED A

05:52.085 --> 05:53.186
FEW YEARS AGO AND HAVE HAD

05:53.186 --> 05:55.188
TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS FOR

05:55.188 --> 05:57.190
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.291
>> MARKEDLY, UNENTHUSIASTIC,

05:58.291 --> 05:59.359
AS YOU WHAT EXPECT.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.727
THE LINE THAT CAME ACROSS TO

06:00.727 --> 06:03.029
"THE FINANCIAL TIMES"

06:03.029 --> 06:05.899
REPORTERS IN DAVOS IS A

06:05.899 --> 06:06.666
FAIRLY CLEAR ONE THAT THEY

06:06.666 --> 06:07.667
HAVE DONE ENOUGH FOR THE

06:07.667 --> 06:08.969
GREEKS, THE GREEKS MAY STILL

06:08.969 --> 06:13.440
HAVE 175% OF GDP OF THEIR

06:13.440 --> 06:14.074
OVERHANGING DEBT.

06:14.074 --> 06:16.109
THE OTHER EUROPEANS SAY WE

06:16.109 --> 06:17.210
HAVE STILL GIVEN THEM A LOT

06:17.210 --> 06:18.678
OF GENEROSITY ALREADY.

06:18.678 --> 06:20.313
WE HAVE NEGOTIATED SETDOWN,

06:20.313 --> 06:22.015
WE HAVE EXTENDED THE TERMS.

06:22.015 --> 06:22.882
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THERE

06:22.882 --> 06:25.085
WOULD BE A LINE IN THE SANDS

06:25.085 --> 06:26.186
WHEN IT CAME TO WHAT IS

06:26.186 --> 06:27.787
KNOWN AS A HAIRCUT TO

06:27.787 --> 06:29.189
REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF DEBT

06:29.189 --> 06:30.190
OUTSTANDING.

06:30.190 --> 06:31.958
AND THERE WILL BE A LOT OF

06:31.958 --> 06:33.560
WIGGLE ROOM IN TERMS OF

06:33.560 --> 06:35.362
EXTENDING THE DEBT IN THE

06:35.362 --> 06:36.363
FUTURE.

06:36.363 --> 06:37.063
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT IF THE

06:37.063 --> 06:38.732
EU SAYS FINE, WE'LL GIVE YOU

06:38.732 --> 06:39.766
THIS HAIRCUT BUT THEN YOU

06:39.766 --> 06:40.533
HAVE TO LEAVE.

06:40.533 --> 06:41.534
THERE ARE MEMBERS IN THE NEW

06:41.534 --> 06:42.402
PARTY THAT SAY WE SHOULD

06:42.402 --> 06:43.737
LEAVE THE EU ALL TOGETHER.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.205
EITHER WAY IT IS A

06:45.205 --> 06:46.239
PRECEDENT.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.707
>> YES, IT IS.

06:47.707 --> 06:49.175
PLAINLY THE BRIEFINGS AGAIN,

06:49.175 --> 06:50.143
THE BELIEF OUT THERE AT THE

06:50.143 --> 06:51.478
PRESENT IS THAT THAT WOULD

06:51.478 --> 06:53.847
BE JUST ABOUT SURVIVABLE.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.548
IF YOU LOOK AT HOW THE BOND

06:55.548 --> 06:56.983
MARKETS HAVE BEHAVED IN THE

06:56.983 --> 06:59.352
LAST YEAR OR SO, BACK THERE

06:59.352 --> 07:01.488
2010 WHEN THE GREEK CRISIS

07:01.488 --> 07:04.024
FIRST BLEW UP, WE NOW SEE

07:04.024 --> 07:06.593
THAT THE SPANISH DEBT AND

07:06.593 --> 07:09.329
ITALIAN DEBT IS ALMOST NO

07:09.329 --> 07:11.064
RISK OF LEAVING THE EURO, NO

07:11.064 --> 07:12.098
RISK OF DEFAULTS.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.066
TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO,

07:13.066 --> 07:14.467
THE LAST GREEK ELECTIONS,

07:14.467 --> 07:16.169
THEY WERE SIGNALING REAL

07:16.169 --> 07:17.971
PANIC OVER THE POSSIBILITY

07:17.971 --> 07:19.072
THAT THAT COULD HAPPEN.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.240
SO THERE IS A BELIEF THAT

07:20.240 --> 07:23.043
THE REST OF THE EURO ZONE

07:23.043 --> 07:24.010
CAN CARRY ON.

07:24.010 --> 07:25.078
BUT THE CRITICAL THING IS

07:25.078 --> 07:26.446
THERE NO SO PRECEDENCE OF

07:26.446 --> 07:27.414
THIS UP UNTIL NOW.

07:27.414 --> 07:28.748
THE WHOLE POINT OF THE

07:28.748 --> 07:31.184
EUROZONE IS THAT YOU ARE SO

07:31.184 --> 07:32.485
TOTALLY COMMITTED TO THIS

07:32.485 --> 07:33.420
CURRENCY THAT THERE IS NO

07:33.420 --> 07:34.621
WAY YOU CAN LEAVE.

07:34.621 --> 07:35.622
>> Sreenivasan: RIGHT.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.757
>> ONCE ONE COUNTRY HAS LEFT,

07:37.757 --> 07:39.793
IT BECOMES FAR MORE POSSIBLE

07:39.793 --> 07:41.127
FOR OTHERS TO LEAVE.

07:41.127 --> 07:41.895
>> Sreenivasan: BEFORE THAT

07:41.895 --> 07:43.663
DEPARTURE POINT, DOES IT

07:43.663 --> 07:45.231
EMBOLDEN MORE PARTIES ON THE

07:45.231 --> 07:47.000
FAR LEFT IN OTHER COUNTRIES?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.335
>> ALMOST CERTAINLY.

07:48.335 --> 07:51.404
I MEAN THE MERE FACT THAT

07:51.404 --> 07:52.772
THIS LOOKS AS THOUGH WE HAVE

07:52.772 --> 07:54.407
FINALLY GOT TO THE POINT

07:54.407 --> 07:56.509
WHERE ONE OF THE POPULIST

07:56.509 --> 07:57.844
ALTERNATIVE PARTIES HAS

07:57.844 --> 07:58.978
ACTUALLY MANAGED TO TAKE 30

07:58.978 --> 08:01.047
WE ARE-- POWER, WE'VE SEEN

08:01.047 --> 08:02.349
THE REJECTION OF THE

08:02.349 --> 08:04.384
INCUMBENT PARTIES IN ALL THE

08:04.384 --> 08:08.054
CRISIS-HIT COUNTRIES SINCE

08:08.054 --> 08:09.155
THE CRISIS TOOK HOLD.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.223
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

08:10.223 --> 08:12.125
ONE OF THE TRULY NEW WAVE

08:12.125 --> 08:13.226
POPULIST PARTIES HAVE TAKEN

08:13.226 --> 08:13.626
HOLD.

08:13.626 --> 08:16.529
THAT WILL EMBOLDEN THE NEW

08:16.529 --> 08:17.364
LEFT-WING ALTERNATIVE

08:17.364 --> 08:19.065
PARTIES ELSEWHERE VERY MUCH.

08:19.065 --> 08:20.967
OBVIOUSLY, A LOT DEPENDS ON

08:20.967 --> 08:22.569
HOW MUCH THEY MANAGE TO DO

08:22.569 --> 08:23.703
WITH THE OPPORTUNITY.

08:23.703 --> 08:24.437
>> Sreenivasan: SO WHAT

08:24.437 --> 08:25.205
HAPPENS TO THE FINANCIAL

08:25.205 --> 08:26.906
MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD.

08:26.906 --> 08:28.007
HAS THIS UNCERTAINTY ALREADY

08:28.007 --> 08:30.009
BAKED IN OR ARE WE LIKELY TO

08:30.009 --> 08:31.111
SEE MORE VOLATILITY?

08:31.111 --> 08:33.079
>> MY SUSPICION IS THAT THIS

08:33.079 --> 08:33.913
WILL PROBABLY CAUSE SOME

08:33.913 --> 08:35.115
CONCERN IN THE MORNING

08:35.115 --> 08:36.583
SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE

08:36.583 --> 08:37.917
DONE EVEN BETTER THAN THE

08:37.917 --> 08:39.619
MORE OPTIMISTIC PROJECTIONS

08:39.619 --> 08:41.554
AS TIME WENT ON.

08:41.554 --> 08:45.125
THAT SAID, WE ARE-- AT A

08:45.125 --> 08:46.226
POSITION NOW WHERE A LARGE

08:46.226 --> 08:47.360
NUMBER OF THE OTHER

08:47.360 --> 08:48.895
COUNTRIES WHICH WOULD SUFFER

08:48.895 --> 08:50.563
FROM CONTAGION HAVE HAD MUCH

08:50.563 --> 08:52.365
LOWER RATES AT WHICH TO

08:52.365 --> 08:54.033
BORROW FOR QUITE A WHILE.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.069
THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO DEFEND

08:56.069 --> 08:57.170
THEMSELVES QUITE NICELY

08:57.170 --> 08:58.471
AGAINST THIS SITUATION.

08:58.471 --> 09:01.574
YES, VOLATILITY WILL

09:01.574 --> 09:01.941
INCREASE.

09:01.941 --> 09:04.077
THIS WILL WORRY PEOPLE UNTIL

09:04.077 --> 09:06.346
SUCH A POINT AS NEGOTIATIONS

09:06.346 --> 09:07.647
EMPHATICALLY BREAK DOWN OR

09:07.647 --> 09:09.315
THE GREEKS ACTUALLY GO

09:09.315 --> 09:11.117
THROUGH WITH A DEFAULT.

09:11.117 --> 09:13.052
AT WHICH POINT THAT'S A VERY

09:13.052 --> 09:14.154
SERIOUS EVENT.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.622
ARGUABLY NOT A LEHMAN

09:15.622 --> 09:16.956
BROTHERS EVENT, BUT A

09:16.956 --> 09:17.657
SERIOUS EVENT.

09:17.657 --> 09:18.691
UNTIL SUCH A POINT I THINK

09:18.691 --> 09:19.926
IT JUST MEANS PEOPLE GET A

09:19.926 --> 09:21.394
LITTLE BIT MORE NERVOUS.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.462
I DOUBT THERE WOULD BE ANY

09:22.462 --> 09:23.863
MAJOR IMPACT ON THE MARKET.

09:23.863 --> 09:24.864
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

JOHN AUTHERS OF "THE FINANCIAL

09:27.667 --> 09:28.768

09:40.413 --> 09:41.581
MODI WAS ELECTED LAST MAY AFTER

TO MODERNIZE THAT NATION'S

09:43.950 --> 09:45.552
ECONOMY.

09:45.552 --> 09:46.686
BEFORE BECOMING PRIME MINISTER,

09:46.686 --> 09:47.720
MODI LED THE STATE OF GUJARAT IN

09:47.720 --> 09:48.888
WESTERN INDIA FOR MORE THAN A

09:48.888 --> 09:50.657
DECADE.

09:50.657 --> 09:51.691
RECENTLY, SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

09:51.691 --> 09:52.892

GANDHI'S ASHRAM.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.851
NARENDRA MODI INVOKES THE FATHER

10:17.851 --> 10:19.352
OF MODERN INDIA, WHO PREACHED

10:19.352 --> 10:21.754
NON-VIOLENCE AND SIMPLE LIVING.

10:21.754 --> 10:23.623
BUT MODI'S VISION SEEMS IN MANY

10:23.623 --> 10:24.891
WAYS MORE LIKE MODERN CHINA.

10:24.891 --> 10:26.493
SO THIS IS SORT OF SHANGHAI-

HE HEADED THE STATE GOVERNMENT

10:41.875 --> 10:43.743
HERE.

10:43.743 --> 10:44.744

11:31.591 --> 11:35.495
IMPROVED THE INFRASTRUCTURE.

SOMEBODY LIKE ME SHOULD FEEL

14:58.698 --> 14:59.465
>> HE SAID IT IN THE HOUSE OF

14:59.465 --> 15:00.299
PARLIAMENT, THIS IS

15:00.299 --> 15:01.100
UNACCEPTABLE.

OFFICIALS SAY THE MEASLES

16:49.041 --> 16:49.842
OUTBREAK THAT BEGAN AT

16:49.842 --> 16:50.877
DISNEYLAND IN SOUTHERN

16:50.877 --> 16:51.811
CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO RIPPLE

16:51.811 --> 16:52.411
ACROSS THE NATION.

16:52.411 --> 16:53.312
APPROXIMATELY 100 CASES HAVE

16:53.312 --> 16:54.113
BEEN REPORTED SO FAR.

16:54.113 --> 16:55.047
HOW GREAT A RISK DOES IT POSE?

16:55.047 --> 16:55.982
AND WHAT CAN BE DONE TO STOP ITS

16:55.982 --> 16:56.816
SPREAD?

16:56.816 --> 16:57.683
I SPOKE ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY

16:57.683 --> 16:58.417
WITH DOCTOR ANTHONY FAUCI.

16:58.417 --> 16:59.118
HE IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE

16:59.118 --> 17:00.219
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY

17:00.219 --> 17:00.987
AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN

17:00.987 --> 17:04.724
WASHINGTON.

17:04.724 --> 17:05.591
SO DR. FAUCI,

17:05.591 --> 17:07.627
WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE, WHAT,

17:07.627 --> 17:09.028
20 MILLION MEASLES CASES

17:09.028 --> 17:10.329
AROUND THE WORLD EVERY YEAR.

17:10.329 --> 17:12.031
BUT WHAT DOES A THEME PARK

17:12.031 --> 17:13.733
LIKE A DISNEYLAND DO TO MAKE

17:13.733 --> 17:14.767
SURE THAT THE PARENTS AND

17:14.767 --> 17:15.501
CHILDREN THAT ARE VISITING

17:15.501 --> 17:16.869
FROM THE UNITED STATES OR

17:16.869 --> 17:17.904
FROM OTHER COUNTRIES ARE

17:17.904 --> 17:18.237
SAFE?

17:18.237 --> 17:19.639
>> YOU KNOW, IT REALLY

17:19.639 --> 17:20.673
RELATES TO THE FACT THAT

17:20.673 --> 17:21.707
THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE

17:21.707 --> 17:23.075
CHILDREN ARE NOT VACCINATED.

17:23.075 --> 17:24.744
THE OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF

17:24.744 --> 17:26.178
PEOPLE WHO HAVE GOTTEN

17:26.178 --> 17:27.546
INFECTED, PARTICULARLY AMONG

17:27.546 --> 17:28.981
THE CHILDREN, ARE CHILDREN

17:28.981 --> 17:31.350
THAT HAVE NOT BEEN VACCINATED.

17:31.350 --> 17:32.385
BECAUSE PARENTS FOR REASONS

17:32.385 --> 17:34.153
THAT ARE REALLY NOT BASED ON

17:34.153 --> 17:36.055
ANY SCIENTIFIC DATA, JUST

17:36.055 --> 17:37.089
DON'T WANT THEIR CHILDREN TO

17:37.089 --> 17:38.157
BE VACCINATED.

17:38.157 --> 17:39.859
AND IT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE,

17:39.859 --> 17:41.227
BECAUSE VACCINATION CAN

17:41.227 --> 17:41.961
PREVENT ALL OF THIS.

17:41.961 --> 17:43.663
ONE OF THE THINGS WE DO KNOW

17:43.663 --> 17:45.998
ABOUT MEASLES IS THAT THE

17:45.998 --> 17:47.099
VACCINE THAT WE HAVE IS ONE

17:47.099 --> 17:49.435
OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE

17:49.435 --> 17:51.604
VACCINES WE HAVE FOR ANY

17:51.604 --> 17:54.273
VIRAL DISEASE OR FOR ANY

17:54.273 --> 17:56.142
MICROBE-- MICROBE, SO THIS

17:56.142 --> 17:57.276
ALL COULD HAVE BEEN SHUT

17:57.276 --> 17:58.577
DOWN IF PEOPLE HAD GOTTEN

17:58.577 --> 17:59.545
VACCINATED.

17:59.545 --> 18:01.480
THAT IS THE REAL CRITICAL

18:01.480 --> 18:01.814
ISSUE.

18:01.814 --> 18:03.449
>> Sreenivasan: IN

18:03.449 --> 18:04.884
2000-- 2000 WE DECLARED

18:04.884 --> 18:06.185
MEASLES WAS ELIMINATED THAT

18:06.185 --> 18:07.853
IS NOT ACTIVE DISEASE

18:07.853 --> 18:08.287
TRANSMISSIONS.

18:08.287 --> 18:09.288
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

18:09.288 --> 18:11.390
NUMBERS BETWEEN 2001 AND

18:11.390 --> 18:12.725
2013 WE HAD AN AVERAGE OF --

18:12.725 --> 18:14.060
8 CASES A YEAR.

18:14.060 --> 18:17.830
AND LAST YEAR, WE HAD 6-- 88

18:17.830 --> 18:20.032
CASE-- 88 CASES A AREA AND

18:20.032 --> 18:21.267
LAST YEAR 644.

18:21.267 --> 18:22.969
THAT IS AN ENORMOUS LEAP.

18:22.969 --> 18:25.838
>> IT IS, THERE WERE 20

18:25.838 --> 18:27.740
SEPARATE OUTBREAKS IN THE

18:27.740 --> 18:29.775
YEAR 2014 AS YOU MENTIONED,

18:29.775 --> 18:31.877
644 CASES, THAT JUST SHOULD

18:31.877 --> 18:33.179
NOT HAVE HAPPENED.

18:33.179 --> 18:35.548
PEOPLE DON'T FULLY

18:35.548 --> 18:36.649
APPRECIATE THAT MEASLES IS

18:36.649 --> 18:38.017
NOT A TRIVIAL DISEASE.

18:38.017 --> 18:39.719
IT CAN BE TRULY A VERY

18:39.719 --> 18:40.619
SERIOUS DISEASE.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.088
PRIOR TO THE AVAILABILITY OF

18:42.088 --> 18:44.256
VACCINATIONS, WE HAD ABOUT

18:44.256 --> 18:45.958
500,000 CASES IN THE UNITED

18:45.958 --> 18:47.259
STATES AND AN AVERAGE OF

18:47.259 --> 18:49.295
ABOUT 500 DEATHS PER YEAR.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.330
THAT WAS ESSENTIALLY AS YOU

18:51.330 --> 18:53.199
MENTIONED, AGAIN CORRECTLY,

18:53.199 --> 18:54.066
ESSENTIALLY ELIMINATED

18:54.066 --> 18:55.534
BECAUSE WE WERE

18:55.534 --> 18:56.502
MEASLES-FREE.

18:56.502 --> 18:57.470
AND THEN BECAUSE OF THE

18:57.470 --> 18:59.238
MOVEMENT OF ANTI-VACCINATION

18:59.238 --> 19:00.573
MOVEMENT AND CHILDREN NOT

19:00.573 --> 19:02.008
GETTING VACCINATED,

19:02.008 --> 19:03.442
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT IS

19:03.442 --> 19:04.443
CONCENTRATED IN CERTAIN

19:04.443 --> 19:05.778
AREAS WHERE THERE ARE A

19:05.778 --> 19:07.613
HIGHER PERCENTAGE IN CERTAIN

19:07.613 --> 19:09.148
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, THAT

19:09.148 --> 19:10.282
REALLY LEADS TO THAT GROUP

19:10.282 --> 19:11.617
AND CLUSTER.

19:11.617 --> 19:13.986
SO THAT WHEN YOU HAVE AN

19:13.986 --> 19:15.354
INTRODUCTION OF MEASLES,

19:15.354 --> 19:16.689
WHEREVER IT MAY BE, IT COULD

19:16.689 --> 19:19.458
BE IN A RECREATIONAL PARK OR

19:19.458 --> 19:20.793
SOMEPLACE ELSEWHERE PEOPLE

19:20.793 --> 19:22.495
CONGREGATE, IF YOU HAVE A

19:22.495 --> 19:23.562
CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE

19:23.562 --> 19:24.530
CHILDREN OR OF ANYONE WHO

19:24.530 --> 19:26.198
ARE NOT PROTECTED AGAINST

19:26.198 --> 19:28.000
MEASLES, THAT'S HOW YOU GET

19:28.000 --> 19:29.368
THESE OUTBREAKS WHICH,

19:29.368 --> 19:30.369
UNFORTUNATELY, COULD REALLY

19:30.369 --> 19:32.471
HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY AVOIDED

19:32.471 --> 19:34.473
AND PREVENTED.

19:34.473 --> 19:35.141
>> Sreenivasan: SO AS YOU

19:35.141 --> 19:37.243
MENTIONED THESE CLUSTERS,

19:37.243 --> 19:38.210
EPIDEMIOLOGISTS HAVE STUDIED

19:38.210 --> 19:38.944
THESE PATTERNS.

19:38.944 --> 19:40.279
AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

19:40.279 --> 19:41.981
CUTS ACROSS, WHETHER IT'S

19:41.981 --> 19:43.015
CONSERVATIVE OR LIBERAL,

19:43.015 --> 19:43.716
RICH OR POOR.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.484
SO HOW DO YOU DESIGN A

19:45.484 --> 19:46.819
HEALTH POLICY THAT TACKLES

19:46.819 --> 19:48.721
THESE LITTLE CLUSTERS?

19:48.721 --> 19:49.889
>> WELL, WHAT WE HAVE TO DO

19:49.889 --> 19:52.258
IS CONTINUE TO UNDERSCORE

19:52.258 --> 19:53.692
AND EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE

19:53.692 --> 19:54.660
OF VACCINATION.

19:54.660 --> 19:57.096
BUT ALSO TO UNDERSCORE THE

19:57.096 --> 19:59.832
FACT THAT THE REASON FOR NOT

19:59.832 --> 20:01.534
VACCINATING, THIS ISSUE THAT

20:01.534 --> 20:03.502
THE RISK OF A MEASLES

20:03.502 --> 20:05.871
VACCINE IS SO GREAT THAT IT

20:05.871 --> 20:06.972
OVERRIDES THE BENEFIT THAT

20:06.972 --> 20:08.574
YOU COULD GET FROM

20:08.574 --> 20:10.009
PROTECTING YOUR CHILD, IS

20:10.009 --> 20:11.444
JUST NOT TRUE.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.511
BECAUSE THE EVIDENCE THAT

20:12.511 --> 20:14.680
WAS PUT FORTH YEARS AGO

20:14.680 --> 20:17.483
ABOUT VARIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS

20:17.483 --> 20:19.785
ASSOCIATED WITH MEASLES

20:19.785 --> 20:20.953
VACCINATIONS FROM DIFFERENT

20:20.953 --> 20:22.988
TYPES OF DISEASE TO AUTISM

20:22.988 --> 20:24.957
HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY

20:24.957 --> 20:26.459
DISPROVEN BY A NUMBER OF

20:26.459 --> 20:27.593
SCIENTIFIC BODIES,

20:27.593 --> 20:28.794
INDEPENDENT BODIES THAT HAVE

20:28.794 --> 20:29.462
SHOWN THAT.

20:29.462 --> 20:31.564
AND YET THEY STILL CLING AND

20:31.564 --> 20:32.765
REINFORCE EACH OTHER THAT,

20:32.765 --> 20:34.967
IN FACT, MEASLES VACCINES

20:34.967 --> 20:36.669
AND OTHER VACCINES REALLY

20:36.669 --> 20:38.137
SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN BECAUSE

20:38.137 --> 20:39.305
THEY'RE DANGEROUS.

20:39.305 --> 20:40.739
THAT'S JUST UNFORTUNATE.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.108
AND LEADS TO THE KIND OF

20:42.108 --> 20:43.209
THING THAT WE'RE DEALING

20:43.209 --> 20:44.210
WITH RIGHT NOW.

20:44.210 --> 20:44.977
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

20:44.977 --> 20:45.911
LET ME PREFACE THIS QUESTION

20:45.911 --> 20:47.646
BY SAYING I'M NOT TRYING TO

20:47.646 --> 20:48.714
SCARE MY AUDIENCE.

20:48.714 --> 20:50.749
BUT I HAVE GOT TO ASK IS

20:50.749 --> 20:52.118
THAT SOME PART OF US IS DUE

20:52.118 --> 20:53.752
TO THE FACT THAT A LOT OF US

20:53.752 --> 20:54.820
DON'T HAVE FIRSTHAND

20:54.820 --> 20:55.721
EXPERIENCE WITH MEASLES.

20:55.721 --> 20:56.655
RIGHT.

20:56.655 --> 20:57.923
SO WHAT IS THE VACCINE

20:57.923 --> 20:59.258
PROTECTING A CHILD FROM?

20:59.258 --> 21:00.960
WHAT ARE THE AFFECTS OF THIS

21:00.960 --> 21:01.360
DISEASE?

21:01.360 --> 21:03.129
>> WELL, MEASLES IS ONE OF

21:03.129 --> 21:04.930
THOSE DISEASES THAT IN AND

21:04.930 --> 21:06.799
OF ITSELF IS SERIOUS BUT CAN

21:06.799 --> 21:07.733
LEAD TO SERIOUS

21:07.733 --> 21:08.567
COMPLICATION.

21:08.567 --> 21:10.002
THE KIND OF CLINICAL

21:10.002 --> 21:11.303
MANIFESTATION, YOU GET A

21:11.303 --> 21:12.805
FEVER, YOU GET AKOFF, YOU

21:12.805 --> 21:14.840
GET RUNNY NOSE, CONJUNCTIVITIS

21:14.840 --> 21:16.642
OR WHAT WE CALL RED EYE.

21:16.642 --> 21:18.911
AND IT REALLY DEBILITATES A

21:18.911 --> 21:19.879
CHILD DURING THAT PERIOD OF

21:19.879 --> 21:20.613
TIME.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.081
A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF

21:22.081 --> 21:23.249
CHILDREN GO ON TO

21:23.249 --> 21:24.717
COMPLICATIONS LIKE MIDDLE

21:24.717 --> 21:26.752
EAR INFECTIONS, PNEUMONIA

21:26.752 --> 21:29.388
AND EVEN ENSIEVE LIGHT IS

21:29.388 --> 21:30.823
AND EVEN DEATH.

21:30.823 --> 21:31.891
THAT IS WHY THE DEVELOPMENT

21:31.891 --> 21:33.425
OF MEASLES VACCINATION AND

21:33.425 --> 21:34.960
THE ELIMINATION OF MEASLES

21:34.960 --> 21:36.328
FROM THIS COUNTRY SEVERAL

21:36.328 --> 21:37.630
YEARS AGO UNTIL IT BOUNCED

21:37.630 --> 21:39.064
BACK NOW WITH THESE

21:39.064 --> 21:40.599
OUTBREAKS, WAS REALLY A

21:40.599 --> 21:42.201
TRIUMPH IN MEDICAL PUBLIC

21:42.201 --> 21:43.602
HEALTH ENDEAVOR.

21:43.602 --> 21:45.838
GOOD VACCINATIONS IN SOME

21:45.838 --> 21:47.606
RESPECTS PARADOXICALLY ARE

21:47.606 --> 21:49.041
VICTIMS OF THEIR OWN

21:49.041 --> 21:49.475
SUCCESS.

21:49.475 --> 21:51.043
NOW THAT WE DON'T SEE A LOT

21:51.043 --> 21:53.445
OF MEASLES, THAT SCARE OF

21:53.445 --> 21:54.947
THE DIFFICULTY AND THE

21:54.947 --> 21:56.182
SERIOUSNESS OF IT IS NOT ON

21:56.182 --> 21:57.616
PEOPLE'S RADAR SCREEN.

21:57.616 --> 21:59.919
IT GETS BACK ON THEIR RADAR

21:59.919 --> 22:01.287
SCREEN WHEN YOU SEE WHAT IS

22:01.287 --> 22:02.388
GOING ON RIGHT NOW

22:02.388 --> 22:03.055
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

22:03.055 --> 22:04.823
WHICH COULD BE COMPLETELY

22:04.823 --> 22:07.126
AVOIDABLE IF PEOPLE HAD

22:07.126 --> 22:08.961
VACCINATED THEIR CHILDREN.

22:08.961 --> 22:09.762
>> Sreenivasan: DR. ANTHONY

22:09.762 --> 22:14.200
FAUCI, DIRECTOR OF THE

22:14.200 --> 22:14.800
INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND

22:14.800 --> 22:15.968
INFECTIOUS DISEASE, THANK

22:15.968 --> 22:16.635
YOU VERY MUCH.

22:16.635 --> 22:19.805
>> YOU'RE QUITE WELCOME.

22:19.805 --> 22:26.178
>>THIS IS PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.513
>> Sreenivasan: YOU MAY HAVE

22:27.513 --> 22:28.881
SEEN THE CNN DOCUMENTARY

22:28.881 --> 22:29.949
"BLACKFISH" THAT EXAMINED THE

22:29.949 --> 22:31.183
TREATMENT OF KILLER WHALES AT

22:31.183 --> 22:32.451
SEA WORLD ORLANDO.

22:32.451 --> 22:33.686
NOW, AT THE MIAMI SEAQUARIUM,

22:33.686 --> 22:35.154
ANOTHER CONTROVERSY IS BREWING

22:35.154 --> 22:38.791
OVER A WHALE NAMED LOLITA.

22:38.791 --> 22:40.659
THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND

22:40.659 --> 22:42.361
ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION IS

22:42.361 --> 22:43.462
CURRENTLY DECIDING WHETHER

22:43.462 --> 22:45.064
LOLITA SHOULD BE PLACED ON THE

22:45.064 --> 22:46.799
ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST.

22:46.799 --> 22:48.701
>> IF SHE IS LISTED AS AN

22:48.701 --> 22:49.935
ENDANGERED SPECIES, CITIZENS

22:49.935 --> 22:50.703
WILL THEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE

22:50.703 --> 22:53.505
ON HER BEHALF.

22:53.505 --> 22:54.573
>> Sreenivasan: THAT COULD LEAD

22:54.573 --> 22:56.442
TO LOLITA BEING RE-ACCLIMATED

22:56.442 --> 22:57.676
OVER TIME AND EVENTUALLY

22:57.676 --> 22:59.311
RELEASED BACK INTO THE WATERS

22:59.311 --> 23:01.380
OFF SEATTLE, WHERE SHE WAS

23:01.380 --> 23:05.684
CAPTURED IN 1970.

23:05.684 --> 23:07.219
SOME SCIENTISTS AND ACTIVISTS

23:07.219 --> 23:08.854
ARGUE THAT THE TANK WHERE LOLITA

23:08.854 --> 23:10.222
CURRENTLY LIVES ALONE IS TOO

23:10.222 --> 23:11.390
SMALL FOR HER WELL-BEING AND

23:11.390 --> 23:12.925
THAT SHE SHOULD BE SET FREE.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.927
LOLITA HAS BEEN DUBBED "THE

23:14.927 --> 23:16.328
WORLD'S LONELIEST ORCA."

23:16.328 --> 23:18.097
AND THIS WEEK, HUNDREDS MARCHED

23:18.097 --> 23:19.732
IN MIAMI DEMANDING HER RELEASE.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.500
BUT THE MIAMI SEAQUARIUM SAYS IT

23:21.500 --> 23:23.769
WILL FIGHT ANY PLAN TO PUT

23:23.769 --> 23:25.137
LOLITA BACK INTO THE WILD,

23:25.137 --> 23:26.705
ARGUING THAT SHE SIMPLY CAN'T

23:26.705 --> 23:28.040
SURVIVE ON HER OWN AFTER 45

23:28.040 --> 23:31.944
YEARS IN CAPTIVITY.

23:31.944 --> 23:33.345
ROBERT ROSE, THE CURATOR OF THE

23:33.345 --> 23:35.147
AQUARIUM, NOTES HOW HARD IT IS

23:35.147 --> 23:36.582
FOR AN ANIMAL THAT'S LIVED IN

23:36.582 --> 23:37.783
CAPTIVITY FOR SO LONG TO BE

23:37.783 --> 23:40.319
RETURNED TO THE OPEN OCEAN.

23:40.319 --> 23:41.754
>> I MEAN SHE'S GONNA DIE,

23:41.754 --> 23:43.389
WITHOUT QUESTION.

23:43.389 --> 23:44.990
THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE HER OUT

23:44.990 --> 23:46.959
THERE AND DO EXACTLY THE SAME

23:46.959 --> 23:48.827
THING THEY DID TO KEIKO WHICH IS

23:48.827 --> 23:49.828
TO KILL HIM.

23:49.828 --> 23:51.964
>> Sreenivasan: KEIKO WAS THE

23:51.964 --> 23:54.066
ICONIC KILLER WHALE THAT STARRED

23:54.066 --> 23:55.801
IN THE MOVIE "FREE WILLY."

23:55.801 --> 23:56.802
KEIKO WAS RELEASED INTO THE

23:56.802 --> 23:58.070
WATERS OFF NORWAY IN 2002 BUT

23:58.070 --> 23:59.772
DIED ALONE A YEAR LATER OF

23:59.772 --> 24:00.873
PNEUMONIA.

24:00.873 --> 24:01.974
>> AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS DIDN'T

24:01.974 --> 24:03.242
HAVE THE HOLLYWOOD HAPPY ENDING

24:03.242 --> 24:04.543
WHERE FREE WILLY JUMPED OVER THE

24:04.543 --> 24:05.611
WALL AND LIVED HAPPILY EVER

24:05.611 --> 24:06.879
AFTER.

24:06.879 --> 24:07.913
>> Sreenivasan: NOAA'S DECISION

24:07.913 --> 24:08.847
ON LOLITA'S STATUS IS EXPECTED

24:08.847 --> 24:10.849
BY THE END OF THIS MONTH.

24:22.661 --> 24:23.996
BEFORE WE LEAVE YOU TONIGHT,

24:23.996 --> 24:25.130
