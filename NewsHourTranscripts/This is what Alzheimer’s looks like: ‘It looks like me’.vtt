JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to another
in our Brief But Spectacular
series, where we ask people

00:02.966 --> 00:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to describe their passions.

00:05.500 --> 00:06.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Five-and-a-half million
Americans are living
with Alzheimer's disease,
and another 15 million

00:06.700 --> 00:09.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
serve as their
unpaid caregivers.

00:09.133 --> 00:09.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, two individuals
diagnosed with Alzheimer's,
Chris Hannafan and Pam
Montana, share their

00:09.800 --> 00:11.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
experiences.

00:11.266 --> 00:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRIS HANNAFAN, Living
With Alzheimer's: I am 66.

00:12.200 --> 00:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was diagnosed when I was 65.

00:14.200 --> 00:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAM MONTANA, Living With
Alzheimer's: I was diagnosed
initially in November of 2015.

00:15.333 --> 00:16.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think I'm getting
the dates right.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Part of my issue is my dates
sometimes mush together.

00:18.300 --> 00:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRIS HANNAFAN: Yes, I know
exactly what we're doing.

00:19.733 --> 00:21.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I know you're Steve.

00:21.500 --> 00:22.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I know you're Zack.

00:22.733 --> 00:25.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're here in Pine
Street, finally.

00:25.033 --> 00:27.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

00:27.666 --> 00:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAM MONTANA: On July 20 of
last year, I received the
official diagnosis, with
17 research physicians

00:33.766 --> 00:38.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and doctors in the room,
myself, my husband and my two
children, with the diagnosis of

00:40.233 --> 00:44.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
early-onset,
early-stage Alzheimer's.

00:44.033 --> 00:48.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
QUESTION: You can
take a minute or two.

00:48.866 --> 00:51.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAM MONTANA: Every
time I say it.

00:51.266 --> 00:56.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CHRIS HANNAFAN: The way
I explain it to people
is, I am in a new life.

01:00.333 --> 01:04.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
My former life no longer
exists, and it's up to
me to create a new life.

01:04.233 --> 01:06.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAM MONTANA: I knew
something was wrong.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not normal to not be able
to calculate a tip anymore.

01:08.966 --> 01:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not normal to not do math
in your head and to be able
to subtract or add numbers.

01:12.933 --> 01:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not normal to not remember
conversations or to attend a
training class and not remember

01:18.733 --> 01:20.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what was taught.

01:20.233 --> 01:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRIS HANNAFAN: More and
more words are going away.

01:22.533 --> 01:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there are a number of words
that, no matter how I remember
them, they are not there.

01:29.466 --> 01:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I could say, OK, now I have
got it, and, two minutes
later, I won't have it.

01:34.166 --> 01:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAM MONTANA: With Alzheimer's,
you don't have an option.

01:37.733 --> 01:39.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You just -- it's just not there.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The information is just gone.

01:41.200 --> 01:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS HANNAFAN: It seems to
be particularly difficult for
those of us with Alzheimer's

01:44.900 --> 01:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
early-onset to have --
sorry -- I got a little bit.

01:52.600 --> 01:56.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
OK, where was I?

01:56.100 --> 01:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAM MONTANA: Frustrating is
the word that comes to mind.

01:59.500 --> 02:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am frustrated with the fact
that I don't know what 32
minus seven is without a pen

02:05.100 --> 02:07.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and paper.

02:07.133 --> 02:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It frustrates me that I
have no idea what today is,
but I do know it's Friday.

02:10.200 --> 02:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRIS HANNAFAN: The first
thing I lost was my car.

02:12.400 --> 02:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I was no longer able to
use my car for various reasons.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I got a bicycle.

02:19.866 --> 02:21.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I have had two
crashes with that.

02:21.633 --> 02:23.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think part
of that is spatial.

02:23.333 --> 02:25.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAM MONTANA: Now
I have a new job.

02:25.700 --> 02:30.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that job is to be loud
and proud about my disease, to
share my symptoms with everyone

02:31.833 --> 02:33.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and anyone who
will listen to me.

02:33.066 --> 02:35.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHRIS HANNAFAN: I'm
able to be useful.

02:35.266 --> 02:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm able to have -- to surround
myself with a lot of people,
which is absolutely the most

02:42.933 --> 02:44.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
important thing you can
do with Alzheimer's.

02:44.566 --> 02:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAM MONTANA: Everyone
always tells me I look good.

02:47.200 --> 02:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, what does that
have to do with anything?

02:50.633 --> 02:55.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I keep saying to people,
I'm going to walk around
in a bathrobe with
a towel on my head,

02:55.233 --> 03:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you know, no makeup, just an old
hag, and then maybe then they
will think I have Alzheimer's.

03:01.333 --> 03:02.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But this is what
Alzheimer's looks like.

03:02.900 --> 03:04.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It looks like me.

03:04.066 --> 03:05.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHRIS HANNAFAN: My
name is Chris Hannafan.

03:05.633 --> 03:08.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAM MONTANA: My
name is Pam Montana.

03:08.100 --> 03:10.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And this is my Brief
But Spectacular take...

03:10.633 --> 03:12.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHRIS HANNAFAN: Brief
But Spectacular take.

03:12.700 --> 03:14.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAM MONTANA: ... on
living with Alzheimer's.

03:14.800 --> 03:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you, Chris
and Pam, for sharing with all
of us what you're going through.

03:30.566 --> 03:31.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Wow.
