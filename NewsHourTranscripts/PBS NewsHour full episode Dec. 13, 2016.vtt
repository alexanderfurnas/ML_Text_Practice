JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.239 --> 00:06.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.240 --> 00:07.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

00:08.008 --> 00:11.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
President-elect Trump taps
ExxonMobil executive

00:11.645 --> 00:17.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rex Tillerson for secretary of
state, raising
concerns even among Republicans
about the

00:17.851 --> 00:20.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pick's past connections to
Russia.

00:20.087 --> 00:24.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Tuesday:
A nightmare continues, the
Syrian government's

00:24.658 --> 00:28.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
deadly takeover of the
war-ravaged city of
Aleppo.

00:28.095 --> 00:33.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And an artist's
take on how
to look at art, offering a
simple way to enjoy

00:33.400 --> 00:35.135 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a museum.

00:35.168 --> 00:39.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SALLE, Author, "How to
See": It's not
that different from having a
conversation

00:39.172 --> 00:40.140 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with someone.

00:40.173 --> 00:42.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The painter is telling you
something.

00:42.109 --> 00:49.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:49.316 --> 00:52.085 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:52.119 --> 01:01.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Another big seat
is filled
in the Trump Cabinet-to-be, and
it sets up

01:01.662 --> 01:04.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a potential confirmation fight.

01:04.097 --> 01:08.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president-elect's transition
team confirmed
this morning that a top oil
executive is the

01:08.936 --> 01:12.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
choice for secretary of state.

01:12.239 --> 01:17.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After days of speculation,
official word of
the Rex Tillerson pick came
before sunrise,

01:17.911 --> 01:20.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
followed by praise from the vice
president-elect.

01:20.914 --> 01:25.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE PENCE (R), Vice
President-Elect: We just
could not be more grateful that
someone of

01:25.185 --> 01:30.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Rex Tillerson's proven
leadership and accomplishments
has been willing to step forward
to serve

01:30.223 --> 01:33.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our nation as our next secretary
of state.

01:33.260 --> 01:39.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tillerson, a
native Texan,
is currently CEO of oil giant
ExxonMobil,

01:39.066 --> 01:42.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
among the world's largest
publicly traded
companies.

01:42.336 --> 01:48.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He rose through the ranks over
four decades,
and, as chief executive, he's
expanded ExxonMobil's

01:48.675 --> 01:52.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
business overseas, including its
operations
in Russia.

01:52.980 --> 01:59.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a 2013 interview with Charlie
rose for
CBS News, Tillerson made clear
his company

01:59.586 --> 02:01.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will go wherever there's oil.

02:01.121 --> 02:04.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, Chairman &amp; CEO,
ExxonMobil:
My philosophy is to make money.

02:04.091 --> 02:09.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so if I can drill and make
money, then
that's what I want to do.

02:09.963 --> 02:15.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it really is -- for us, it's
about making
quality investments for our
shareholders.

02:15.602 --> 02:20.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: To that end,
ExxonMobil began
working closely with the Russian
state-owned

02:20.207 --> 02:21.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
oil giant Rosneft.

02:22.009 --> 02:29.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That, in turn, brought Tillerson
into close
contact with Russian President
Vladimir Putin.

02:29.049 --> 02:34.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since then, he's received the
Russian Order
of Friendship, and he's said he
opposes U.S.

02:34.988 --> 02:40.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and European sanctions against
Russia over
its intervention in Ukraine.

02:40.727 --> 02:45.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell today
highlighted Tillerson's
experience, and said

02:45.665 --> 02:48.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he looks forward to supporting
his nomination.

02:48.902 --> 02:54.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the top Democrat on the
Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, Ben Cardin,
said he is

02:54.074 --> 03:00.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deeply troubled by Tillerson's
vocal opposition
to sanctions on Russia, and
Republican Senator

03:00.781 --> 03:06.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Marco Rubio voiced serious
concerns about
the planned nomination.

03:06.219 --> 03:11.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's also word that another
Texan, former
Governor Rick Perry, could be
tapped to be

03:11.558 --> 03:13.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
energy secretary.

03:13.693 --> 03:16.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the transition at Energy
could be rocky.

03:16.963 --> 03:22.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The department said today that
it will not
provide the names of employees
who've worked

03:22.335 --> 03:27.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on climate change, as the Trump
transition
team requested.

03:27.040 --> 03:34.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are also reports that
Montana Congressman
Ryan Zinke could be tapped for
interior secretary.

03:34.214 --> 03:39.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, President Obama
criticized Mr.
Trump's lack of interest in
receiving a daily

03:39.519 --> 03:41.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
intelligence briefing.

03:41.288 --> 03:43.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He spoke last night on "The
Daily Show."

03:43.123 --> 03:45.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
It doesn't matter how smart you
are.

03:45.926 --> 03:51.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have to have the best
information possible
to make the best decisions
possible.

03:51.765 --> 04:03.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you're not getting their
perspective,
their detailed perspective, then
you are flying

04:03.043 --> 04:04.911 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
blind.

04:04.945 --> 04:08.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back at Trump
Tower today,
the president-elect met with
Microsoft billionaire

04:08.482 --> 04:10.016 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Bill Gates.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BILL GATES, Founder, Microsoft:
We had a good
conversation about innovation.

04:12.285 --> 04:18.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Others he met
with, pro football
greats Jim Brown and Ray Lewis
and entertainer

04:18.625 --> 04:20.427 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Kanye West.

04:20.460 --> 04:25.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, Mr. Trump is making the
latest stop
on what he's calling his thank
you tour, this

04:25.198 --> 04:26.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
time in Wisconsin.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the day's
other news:
The Environmental Protection
Agency released

04:30.770 --> 04:36.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a long-awaited report on the
effects of hydraulic
fracturing, or fracking, on
drinking water.

04:36.309 --> 04:41.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It found the oil and gas
drilling technique
can contaminate underground
water in some

04:41.248 --> 04:42.749 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cases.

04:42.782 --> 04:45.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It also said there is not
evidence to estimate
the severity of the risk.

04:45.619 --> 04:50.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The report dropped an earlier
finding that
fracking has not caused
widespread systemic

04:50.423 --> 04:52.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
harm to water supplies.

04:52.292 --> 04:57.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ohio's Republican
Governor
John Kasich has vetoed a closely
watched anti-abortion

04:57.731 --> 04:59.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bill.

04:59.566 --> 05:04.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He rejected a measure today that
banned abortion
once the first fetal heartbeat
is detected.

05:04.171 --> 05:07.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said federal courts have
already struck
down similar laws elsewhere.

05:07.874 --> 05:14.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kasich, however, did sign a
separate bill
banning abortion after 20 weeks
of pregnancy.

05:14.381 --> 05:16.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Seventeen states already have
similar laws.

05:16.950 --> 05:21.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: President
Obama today signed
a sweeping law, including new
spending on

05:21.688 --> 05:23.790 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cancer research and drug abuse.

05:23.823 --> 05:27.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The 21st Century Cures Act
provides more than
$6 billion.

05:27.961 --> 05:31.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It also streamlines the process
for approving
drugs and medical devices.

05:31.598 --> 05:35.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Obama spoke before signing
the bill at
a White House ceremony with
lawmakers and

05:35.835 --> 05:37.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Vice President Biden.

05:37.671 --> 05:41.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
We are bringing to reality the
possibility

05:41.942 --> 05:46.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of new breakthroughs to some of
the greatest
health challenges of our time.

05:46.079 --> 05:50.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm confident that it will lead
to better
years and better lives for
millions of Americans,

05:50.283 --> 05:51.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the work that you have done.

05:51.518 --> 05:54.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's what we got sent here
for.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The new law
also includes
funding for mental health.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will explore that later in
the program.

05:58.825 --> 06:03.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Russia,
opposition political
leader Alexei Navalny announced
that he will

06:03.830 --> 06:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
run for president in 2018.

06:06.466 --> 06:11.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The anti-corruption activist
aims to challenge
President Vladimir Putin, who is
expected

06:11.538 --> 06:13.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to seek a fourth term.

06:13.373 --> 06:19.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Navalny is currently on trial
for fraud in
a case that he says is
politically motivated.

06:19.246 --> 06:21.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If he is convicted, he would be
barred from
running.

06:21.314 --> 06:25.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A railway
strike across
Southern England today caused
the worst railway

06:25.785 --> 06:27.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
disruption there in 20 years.

06:27.587 --> 06:32.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is part of a longstanding
dispute over
whether train drivers or
on-board guards should

06:32.692 --> 06:34.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
close train doors.

06:34.494 --> 06:38.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The drivers went on strike today
for 48 hours,
leaving hundreds of thousands of
commuters

06:38.732 --> 06:43.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stranded or delayed and angry,
but union officials
defended their stance.

06:43.536 --> 06:45.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: It's a safety issue.

06:45.272 --> 06:49.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reality for us is that the
increasing
level of trains, the increasing
amount of

06:49.442 --> 06:54.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
footfall in the 21st century, we
don't believe
that the technology or the make
do and mend

06:54.881 --> 06:57.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on our important infrastructure
lends itself
to a one-man operation.

06:57.651 --> 07:00.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The government
blamed the
unions for the impasse.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The railway owner announced new
talks for
tomorrow.

07:03.456 --> 07:06.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Another day,
another rally
on Wall Street.

07:06.259 --> 07:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained more
than 114 points to close at a
record 19911.

07:13.767 --> 07:17.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 51, and the S&amp;P
500 added
14.

07:17.937 --> 07:22.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And the oldest
person in
America is another year older,
but don't tell

07:22.575 --> 07:23.843 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
her that.

07:23.877 --> 07:27.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Adele Dunlap of Pittstown, New
Jersey, turned
114 yesterday.

07:27.681 --> 07:33.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She said she is 105, but her
family said she
always shaves about a decade off
her age.

07:33.420 --> 07:37.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Either way, people at her
nursing home gave
her balloons and sang happy
birthday.

07:37.590 --> 07:40.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I think she
should have
the right to say whatever age it
is.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.128 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

07:42.162 --> 07:44.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Still to come
on the "NewsHour":
how Exxon's CEO could shape
foreign policy

07:44.364 --> 07:50.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as secretary of state; Syrians
facing an onslaught
from government forces in Aleppo
record their

07:50.670 --> 07:57.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
final goodbyes; where American
students rank
compared to their peers around
the globe;

07:57.043 --> 08:03.249 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and much more.

08:03.283 --> 08:13.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's a post first
officially
held by Thomas Jefferson.

08:13.059 --> 08:16.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The secretary of state is
America's top diplomat.

08:16.429 --> 08:21.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, president-elect Trump
tapped the CEO
of the world's largest publicly
traded oil

08:21.668 --> 08:23.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and gas company for the job.

08:23.770 --> 08:29.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, who is Rex Tillerson, and
what does the
pick tell us about the Trump
agenda?

08:29.075 --> 08:30.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're joined now by John Hamre.

08:30.844 --> 08:36.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is the president and CEO of
the Center
for Strategic and International
Studies, a

08:36.049 --> 08:40.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thank tank in Washington, D.C.,
where Tillerson
is a member of the board of
trustees.

08:40.720 --> 08:45.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hamre served as deputy secretary
of defense
during the Clinton
administration.

08:45.759 --> 08:50.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nicholas Burns was a career
diplomat and former
U.S. ambassador to NATO.

08:50.630 --> 08:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's now a professor at Harvard
University.

08:53.466 --> 08:59.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Steve Coll is the author
"Private Empire:
ExxonMobil and American Power."

08:59.572 --> 09:05.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's also a staff writer for
"The New Yorker"
magazine and the dean of the
School of Journalism

09:05.111 --> 09:06.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at Columbia University.

09:06.646 --> 09:09.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Welcome, all three of you, back
to the program.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Steve Coll, to you first.

09:11.618 --> 09:17.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You wrote in The New Yorker this
weekend that
Mr. Tillerson's life, you said,
has been shaped

09:17.791 --> 09:25.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by to institutions, the Boy
Scouts and ExxonMobil,
a company you describe as
ruthless and unusually

09:26.032 --> 09:27.534 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
aggressive.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that a contradiction?

09:29.102 --> 09:31.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE COLL, Dean, Columbia
University Graduate
School of Journalism: No.

09:31.037 --> 09:38.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think he comes from the
standard oil tradition
of ruthless business competition
rooted in

09:38.378 --> 09:45.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strong, strong values and a kind
of adherence
to the rule of law, modeled by
John D. Rockefeller,

09:45.718 --> 09:47.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the original founder of Standard
Oil.

09:47.954 --> 09:52.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the most important part
of his career
is that it's all been at one
place, 40 years

09:52.492 --> 09:54.194 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at ExxonMobil.

09:54.227 --> 09:58.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now that he's been nominated for
secretary
of state, we really don't have
any record

09:58.364 --> 10:00.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of his views about America's
place in the
world.

10:00.800 --> 10:05.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We only have a record of his
views about ExxonMobil's
place in the world, which is
different, I

10:05.939 --> 10:07.240 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hope.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so there's a whole series of
questions
now in front of us.

10:09.809 --> 10:11.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What does he think about
promoting human rights?

10:11.845 --> 10:14.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What does he think about
promoting democracy?

10:14.180 --> 10:17.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are not -- is he worried
about Russia's
influence in Europe?

10:17.784 --> 10:22.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are not questions that
he's had to address,
and that makes him a very
unusual nominee

10:22.155 --> 10:23.823 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for secretary.

10:23.857 --> 10:28.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Typically, even nominees who
have come and
gone from industry have built up
a record

10:28.228 --> 10:31.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of views about these fundamental
questions
of foreign policy.

10:31.397 --> 10:35.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Hamre, as we
said, you
know Rex Tillerson, having
served on your

10:35.635 --> 10:39.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
board at the Center for
Strategic and International
Studies.

10:39.272 --> 10:43.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is your understanding of
his view of
the United States' role in the
world?

10:43.843 --> 10:45.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN HAMRE, President and CEO,
Center for
Strategic and International
Studies: Well,

10:45.478 --> 10:46.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have known Rex well.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have known him for 11 years.

10:47.780 --> 10:51.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's been a very active member
of our board.

10:51.451 --> 10:57.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He's always engaged
substantively in our discussions
about foreign policy.

10:57.123 --> 10:59.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's remarkably insightful.

10:59.759 --> 11:07.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has more experience as a CEO
than most
political figures in Washington.

11:07.600 --> 11:12.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's able to lead conversations
in front of
some of the most impressive
people of our

11:12.872 --> 11:18.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
history in foreign policy,
people like Henry
Kissinger and Zbigniew
Brzezinski.

11:19.012 --> 11:27.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He fits squarely in the
tradition of American
realism, a pragmatic, centrist
realism.

11:27.086 --> 11:32.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He sees the leadership of
America as shaping
a better world.

11:32.625 --> 11:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He actively believes strongly in
American
values, due process, rule of
law.

11:40.433 --> 11:41.801 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But he's also very pragmatic.

11:41.834 --> 11:44.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He wants to know what other
people think.

11:44.304 --> 11:45.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He listens carefully.

11:45.638 --> 11:48.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's one of the most important
qualities,
he listens so well.

11:48.975 --> 11:52.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So you're going to find a very
fine secretary
in Rex Tillerson.

11:52.345 --> 11:57.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nicholas Burns,
based on what
you know of Rex Tillerson, what
do you know

11:57.417 --> 11:59.152 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and what are your concerns?

11:59.185 --> 12:01.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS BURNS, Former U.S.
Undersecretary
of State for Political Affairs:
Well, he's

12:01.154 --> 12:03.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an impressive man, by all
accounts.

12:03.089 --> 12:05.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And he's run our largest
corporations.

12:05.058 --> 12:09.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He has had significant
managerial and international
experience as a negotiator.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is going to stand him in
good stead.

12:11.464 --> 12:16.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was endorsed today publicly,
very strongly,
by former Secretary of Defense
Bob Gates,

12:16.102 --> 12:17.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Former Secretary of State Condi
Rice.

12:17.604 --> 12:19.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I admire both of those people.

12:19.505 --> 12:21.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Those are serious
recommendations.

12:21.341 --> 12:25.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Judy, I think there is
going to be a
real challenge to his
nomination, and that's

12:25.345 --> 12:29.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his closeness to the Russian
regime and what
he's been saying about Russian
policy.

12:29.582 --> 12:34.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the backdrop here to
his Senate
confirmation will be the
extraordinary statements

12:34.420 --> 12:37.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made by Donald Trump about
Russia during the
campaign.

12:37.190 --> 12:44.430 align:left position:0%,start line:66.67% size:100%
I don't think we have had in 70
years a presidential
candidate, and now a
president-elect, so
accommodating

12:44.464 --> 12:45.965 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Russia.

12:45.999 --> 12:50.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No criticism by Donald Trump
about Russia's
illegal annexation of Crimea.

12:50.570 --> 12:54.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No criticism about Russia's
division of the
Donbass of Ukraine.

12:55.008 --> 13:00.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
No criticism of Russia's
harassment of our
NATO allies, Poland and the
Baltic states.

13:00.446 --> 13:06.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And no criticism of this
barbaric Russian
bombing of the civilian
population of Aleppo.

13:06.719 --> 13:10.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of people feel we should
be containing
Putin, and there's a great
concern that Donald

13:11.024 --> 13:15.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump and General Flynn, the new
national
security adviser, and perhaps
Mr. Tillerson

13:15.528 --> 13:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- we don't know yet -- he has a
right to
speak on behalf of his own views
-- that this

13:20.066 --> 13:23.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
administration will be too
tilted to make
excuses for Putin.

13:23.770 --> 13:25.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We might have a weak policy.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That's where I think the
senators are going
to focus in January.

13:28.241 --> 13:31.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's hard
to know what
Donald Trump believes, but,
Steve Coll, based

13:31.678 --> 13:38.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on your reporting of Rex
Tillerson and ExxonMobil,
what do you see as his attitude
towards Russia?

13:38.484 --> 13:40.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know he's grown close to
Vladimir Putin.

13:40.787 --> 13:43.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's received an award from him.

13:43.222 --> 13:48.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE COLL: Well, he's been an
effective negotiator
on behalf of the shareholders of
ExxonMobil,

13:48.561 --> 13:52.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but now he's being asked to
think about Russia
it in an entirely different way.

13:52.565 --> 13:57.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I agree completely with
Ambassador Burns'
critique.

13:57.570 --> 14:00.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a very dangerous moment
in Europe.

14:00.640 --> 14:07.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And part of the reason is
because Putin has
been pushing the boundaries of
Western tolerance.

14:07.747 --> 14:12.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, Trump's election is part
of a wave of
populism and the strengthening
of authoritarian

14:12.385 --> 14:16.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regimes around the world that is
really going
to challenge the United States
and its values.

14:16.823 --> 14:18.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I worry about Russia.

14:18.057 --> 14:20.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I also worry about the global
human rights
movement.

14:20.526 --> 14:25.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, right around the world
today, there
are human rights activists,
democracy activists,

14:25.698 --> 14:31.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
civil society activists that
have traditionally
relied on the secretary of
state's voice speaking

14:31.237 --> 14:33.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up for them when they're under
pressure.

14:33.406 --> 14:38.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the State Department pushes
a lot of funding,
including into authoritarian
regimes, to support

14:38.511 --> 14:43.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this kind of activity, human
rights research
and democracy organizations.

14:43.816 --> 14:46.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, where is Mr. Tillerson on
these issues?

14:46.986 --> 14:48.855 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I have no idea.

14:48.888 --> 14:52.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has spent 40 years managing
ExxonMobil's
place in the world, and it will
be very important

14:52.625 --> 14:56.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to hear him speak forthrightly,
because he's
now, after the president, going
to be the

14:56.729 --> 15:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most important voice on behalf
of American
values in the world.

15:00.533 --> 15:03.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Hamre, you
described Rex
Tillerson as a centrist.

15:03.736 --> 15:08.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you know about him that
would assuage
some of these concerns, first
about Russia?

15:08.374 --> 15:14.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN HAMRE: Well, I will agree
with what both
Nick and Steve have said that we
face a very

15:14.480 --> 15:16.449 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
challenging time with Russia.

15:16.482 --> 15:21.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Boy, that's why I'm so glad that
Rex is there,
because he knows them so well.

15:21.487 --> 15:26.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, knowing someone and
agreeing with
someone are two completely
different things.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Rex does know Russia very well.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He knows President Putin very
well.

15:30.630 --> 15:33.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He knows the dynamics within
Russia very well.

15:33.733 --> 15:37.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course he's going to have to
lay out his
thinking during his nomination
hearing.

15:37.837 --> 15:41.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not at all worried that Rex
is going to
stand up for America or American
values.

15:41.941 --> 15:46.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Nicholas
Burns, I want
to ask you to respond to that,
but also move

15:46.512 --> 15:52.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on to Iran, because there have
been questions
raised about what Rex Tillerson
would do with

15:52.618 --> 15:57.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regard to U.S. posture toward
Iran, and the
nuclear -- the nuclear deal.

15:57.523 --> 16:03.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS BURNS: Well, I do agree
with John
that Rex Tillerson's track
record is very

16:03.496 --> 16:09.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
encouraging as a centrist, as a
pragmatic
person, and as a real leader of
a big, complex

16:09.802 --> 16:10.770 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
organization.

16:10.803 --> 16:11.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think those are all in good
stead.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My questions aren't about him.

16:13.673 --> 16:16.342 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They're about the
president-elect and his
extraordinary statements.

16:16.375 --> 16:20.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, Judy, on Iran, Donald Trump
has been
saying that -- this is the
nuclear deal that

16:20.947 --> 16:24.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama negotiated is
the worst deal
in the history of the world.

16:24.116 --> 16:29.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's going to be very difficult
for a Trump
administration to disengage the
United States

16:29.689 --> 16:34.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the nuclear deal, because,
if we do that,
I'm convinced that Germany,
France, and Britain

16:34.760 --> 16:36.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will not walk out with us.

16:36.295 --> 16:39.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They want to see this deal
through.

16:39.165 --> 16:44.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if we walk out, then, of
course, Iran
would already have received
sanctions relief,

16:44.237 --> 16:48.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but Iran then could walk away on
its own and
go back to resuming its nuclear
program.

16:48.574 --> 16:50.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that's a very bad
outcome.

16:50.343 --> 16:54.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think a smart decision --
and you will
have pragmatic people like
General Mattis

16:54.747 --> 17:00.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at Defense and Rex Tillerson at
State to tell
the president-elect that a smart
decision

17:00.786 --> 17:05.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is going to be to stay with the
nuclear deal,
but try to limit Iranian
behavior in the Sunni

17:05.925 --> 17:09.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
world, and support those
countries that are
victims of Iranian aggression.

17:09.095 --> 17:13.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Steve Coll,
quickly, is there
something you can shed -- that
would shed

17:13.733 --> 17:17.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
light on Rex Tillerson and his
posture toward
Iran from your reporting?

17:17.670 --> 17:23.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE COLL: Well, he has been
realistic in
seeking stability in the Middle
East.

17:23.376 --> 17:30.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has advocated for a world
that is managed,
rather than disrupted.

17:30.816 --> 17:35.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is skeptical about sanctions,
though his
allies have clarified in the
last few days

17:35.888 --> 17:40.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he's more worried about
enforcing them
than imposing them, but they are
a very important

17:40.826 --> 17:45.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
instrument of American foreign
policy that
he has often advocated against.

17:45.097 --> 17:49.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, in his public role, he may
have to clarify
his views about that.

17:49.268 --> 17:55.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, quickly,
again, John Hamre,
and just finally, if we look to
Russ Tillerson

17:55.441 --> 18:01.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- I'm sorry -- to Rex Tillerson
in terms
of U.S. policy towards Iran,
toward Russia

18:01.747 --> 18:04.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
overall, what should Americans
think?

18:04.884 --> 18:10.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this a man who is going to do
exactly what
Donald Trump wants, or will he
speak up to

18:10.823 --> 18:12.825 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump when he disagrees
with him?

18:12.858 --> 18:17.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN HAMRE: Well, I have no
doubt that Rex
Tillerson will give his private
counsel to

18:17.763 --> 18:21.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president, president-elect,
in a very
direct manner.

18:21.701 --> 18:26.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think he will be quite
influential, frankly,
with the president-elect.

18:26.906 --> 18:33.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's not a man who is shy of
sharing his views
once he has reached them.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We really don't need to worry
about Rex Tillerson.

18:35.948 --> 18:36.916 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I promise you.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is a man of great
character.

18:38.651 --> 18:41.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he is going to have a
challenging environment
in this administration.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.556 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He will do well.

18:43.589 --> 18:48.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Hamre,
Nicholas Burns,
Steve Coll, we thank you all.

18:48.160 --> 18:53.632 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS BURNS: Thank you.

18:53.666 --> 19:05.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The years-long
battle for
control of Syria's largest city,
Aleppo, is

19:05.811 --> 19:07.580 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
over.

19:07.613 --> 19:11.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A punishing bombardment by
Syrian and Russian
jets and deadly ground
operations brought

19:11.183 --> 19:15.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an end to the siege of the last
rebel areas
of the city.

19:15.287 --> 19:18.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a major turning point in
the brutal half-decade
war.

19:18.491 --> 19:21.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret
Warner begins our coverage.

19:22.028 --> 19:28.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: After four
years of fighting,
the end is at hand in Eastern
Aleppo.

19:28.934 --> 19:34.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Word came late today of
agreement on a cease-fire
and evacuation from the
shattered city.

19:34.140 --> 19:36.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRITA HAGI HASAN, President,
East Aleppo Local
Council (through translator):
The agreement

19:36.208 --> 19:41.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
includes the groups of fighters
and the civilians,
but my heart is full of pain,
full of emotion

19:41.313 --> 19:44.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for having to ask for a complete
evacuation
of all civilians.

19:44.984 --> 19:49.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: In addition,
Russian officials
announced joint military
operations with the

19:49.188 --> 19:53.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syrians against rebel-held
Eastern Aleppo
have also ended.

19:53.726 --> 19:58.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anne Barnard, who has been
covering the Syrian
conflict for The New York Times
Syria and

19:58.964 --> 20:04.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Beirut, said the cease-fire
assures rebels
and civilians they will be
evacuated to a

20:04.937 --> 20:06.605 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
safe place.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE BARNARD, Beirut Bureau
Chief, The New
York Times: The plan is for them
to go to

20:08.541 --> 20:12.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other rebel-held areas, which
had been a demand
of the civilians and rebels
there because

20:12.244 --> 20:17.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they were afraid that if they
went to the
government side, as tens of
thousands of people

20:17.349 --> 20:22.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
have done, they would be
arrested or face
other reprisals.

20:22.254 --> 20:28.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Inside the government-held
districts of the
city, life was going on more or
less as normal,

20:28.461 --> 20:32.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but there was the constant
danger of shelling
from the rebel side.

20:32.798 --> 20:37.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: In
government-held West Aleppo,
there was jubilation.

20:37.269 --> 20:42.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in the East, thousands of
civilians are
already fleeing, and there are
reports are

20:42.975 --> 20:47.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mass killings by government
forces and their
allies pouring into the city.

20:47.847 --> 20:53.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.N. officials say more than 80
people were
executed in a single
neighborhood, many of

20:53.219 --> 20:55.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
them women and children.

20:55.187 --> 21:00.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Other reports told of dozens of
children trapped
in a building under attack.

21:00.059 --> 21:05.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Overnight, activists in the city
posted grim
goodbyes on social media.

21:05.064 --> 21:09.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: We are here exposed to a
genocide in
the besieged city of Aleppo.

21:09.768 --> 21:11.137 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This may be my last video.

21:11.170 --> 21:13.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: We were a free people.

21:13.672 --> 21:14.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We wanted freedom.

21:14.940 --> 21:19.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We didn't want anything else but
freedom.

21:19.211 --> 21:24.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The fall of
Eastern Aleppo
marks a watershed in the
five-year Syrian

21:24.984 --> 21:27.219 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
civil war.

21:27.253 --> 21:30.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Opposition forces first took
part of the city
in 2012.

21:30.823 --> 21:37.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They prevailed for years, until
October 2015,
when Russia stepped in to
bolster the Syrian

21:37.229 --> 21:41.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
military with punishing air
assaults.

21:41.200 --> 21:46.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When cease-fire talks brokered
by the United
States collapsed last month, the
onslaught

21:46.105 --> 21:48.007 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
intensified.

21:48.040 --> 21:53.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At the U.N. today, U.S.
Ambassador Samantha
Power put the onus on Russia and
Syria.

21:53.212 --> 21:56.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER, U.S. Ambassador
to the United
Nations: Is there no act of
barbarism against

21:56.215 --> 22:00.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
civilians, no execution of a
child that gets
under your skin, that just
creeps you out

22:00.252 --> 22:04.490 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a little bit?

22:04.523 --> 22:07.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there nothing you will not
lie about or
justify?

22:07.660 --> 22:13.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Even the fall
of Aleppo will
not mean an end to the Syrian
war.

22:13.265 --> 22:18.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Bashar al-Assad has
vowed to crush
the resistance to his rule
throughout the

22:18.270 --> 22:20.172 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
entire country.

22:20.206 --> 22:26.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rebel forces still operating in
Northern Syria
are bracing for an assault by
government troops.

22:26.645 --> 22:31.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The chief Syrian opposition
coordinator insists
the loss of Aleppo will not make
them give

22:31.784 --> 22:33.619 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

22:33.652 --> 22:35.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RIAD HIJAB, Chief Syrian
Opposition Coordinator
(through translator): If Assad
and his allies

22:35.988 --> 22:40.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think that a military advance in
certain quarters
of Aleppo signifies that we will
make concessions

22:40.993 --> 22:44.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the goals of the revolution,
that will
not happen.

22:44.196 --> 22:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Meanwhile,
Islamic State
fighters took advantage of the
government's

22:48.067 --> 22:54.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
focus on Aleppo this week to
recapture the
ancient Syrian city of Palmyra.

22:54.173 --> 22:56.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

22:56.809 --> 23:01.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Today, a group
of scholars
and Middle East experts met at
Rice University's

23:01.380 --> 23:06.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
James Baker Institute of Public
Policy in
Houston to discuss options for
the new Trump

23:06.218 --> 23:10.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
administration of a region once
again transformed
by the fall of Aleppo.

23:10.289 --> 23:15.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two of those experts join me
now, Randa Slim
of the Middle East Institute,
and Joshua Landis

23:15.127 --> 23:16.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the University of Oklahoma.

23:16.562 --> 23:18.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Randa, let me start with you.

23:18.163 --> 23:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What does this mean now that
military operations
are over in Eastern Aleppo?

23:21.367 --> 23:26.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RANDA SLIM, Middle East
Institute: Well, it
means this phase of the conflict
is over,

23:26.772 --> 23:33.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but, as the Syrian officials
have themselves
declared, the war is far from
over.

23:33.979 --> 23:41.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What also this win -- and it is
a win for
the regime, political and
military win -- means

23:41.720 --> 23:45.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is, it spells the end of the
negotiation process.

23:45.257 --> 23:53.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Until now, Assad has paid lip
service to the
idea of negotiations and
political process

23:53.098 --> 23:54.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to end the civil war in Syria.

23:54.900 --> 23:58.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think now he's going to be
definitely
dead set against it, because he
will look

23:58.837 --> 24:07.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at this as, you know, winning,
winning this
war, and that there's no need
for him to make

24:07.079 --> 24:12.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the necessary concessions to
make the political
negotiation successful,
including, you know,

24:13.018 --> 24:18.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
transitioning out of power,
which is one of
the premise of the political
negotiations

24:18.657 --> 24:20.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
started in Geneva.

24:20.426 --> 24:22.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Joshua Landis,
what's the
impact of the end of this battle
vs. the end

24:22.661 --> 24:24.530 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the war?

24:24.563 --> 24:30.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSHUA LANDIS, University of
Oklahoma: Well,
the center of gravity for
opposition now shifts

24:30.102 --> 24:32.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Idlib province and Idlib
city.

24:32.905 --> 24:38.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That city is dominated by the
al-Qaida wing
of the opposition and other
Salafist forces.

24:38.777 --> 24:44.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The United States and the West
cannot support
those Salafists and al-Qaida.

24:44.450 --> 24:49.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It means that the rebels are
going to have
a very hard time getting
significant amounts

24:49.588 --> 24:51.357 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of support.

24:51.390 --> 24:56.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it also means on a larger
scale that a
new security architecture is
being laid down

24:56.562 --> 25:03.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Northern Middle East,
Lebanon, Syria,
Iraq, in which pro-Iranian
governments are

25:04.002 --> 25:11.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
consolidating their grip on the
territory
and they're backed by Russia, to
a large degree.

25:11.410 --> 25:18.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this has caused great grief
and consternation
in Saudi Arabia and amongst many
of the United

25:18.283 --> 25:25.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States' allies, Israel, the Gulf
countries,
Turkey, because they see this
new architecture

25:25.858 --> 25:31.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of security and Iranian
influence and Russian
influence as something that's
very bad for

25:31.597 --> 25:33.031 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

25:33.065 --> 25:37.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the United States' course is
being pulled
in to try to counter that.

25:37.336 --> 25:41.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Randa Slim, as
Josh just
mentioned, there are so many
different actors

25:41.473 --> 25:42.441 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

25:42.474 --> 25:43.742 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's take them kind of one at a
time.

25:43.776 --> 25:45.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What happens to the rebels now
after this
military setback?

25:45.611 --> 25:53.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDA SLIM: I think they have --
they are
in for some serious evaluation
of their tactics

25:53.185 --> 25:59.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and of, you know, what they have
achieved
and why they have failed until
now, I mean,

25:59.124 --> 26:03.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
given the odds they were facing.

26:03.061 --> 26:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Part of them definitely will buy
into this
idea that, you know, extremism
is the way

26:08.534 --> 26:10.002 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to go.

26:10.035 --> 26:15.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the win in Aleppo will
fuel the narrative
of groups like al-Qaida.

26:15.541 --> 26:20.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you will see more people
maybe being attracted
to this idea.

26:20.212 --> 26:27.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, also, I think there will be
a group of
the rebels that need to focus on
shifting

26:27.052 --> 26:33.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strategy away from holding
territory, and
because they cannot do that, you
know, when

26:34.026 --> 26:40.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
faced with the -- with the
aggression from
the Syrian regime and from the
Russian forces,

26:40.365 --> 26:48.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and shift that would -- becoming
an insurgency,
and employing tactics to defeat
these forces

26:48.674 --> 26:51.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a way that make them viable
in this battle.

26:51.543 --> 26:55.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Joshua Landis,
what about
ISIS and al-Qaida that almost
seem forgotten

26:55.981 --> 26:58.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in this giant proxy war?

26:58.217 --> 26:59.685 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What happens?

26:59.718 --> 27:03.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is ISIS taking advantage of this
opportunity,
as Margaret Warner reported?

27:03.388 --> 27:05.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOSHUA LANDIS: Yes, ISIS did.

27:05.757 --> 27:10.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We saw that, as Syrian troops
went to Aleppo,
ISIS took Palmyra.

27:10.662 --> 27:12.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But ISIS' days are numbered.

27:12.865 --> 27:17.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trump administration has
said that they're
going to concentrate on ISIS and
they're going

27:17.436 --> 27:19.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to work with Russia.

27:19.238 --> 27:23.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, we don't know whether they
really will
work with Russia or not, but
it's clear that

27:23.308 --> 27:25.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISIS is going to be pounded.

27:25.244 --> 27:27.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Who is going to benefit from
that?

27:27.479 --> 27:33.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's quite clear the Syrian
regime in Syria,
as the Iraqi regime in Iraq is
benefiting

27:33.986 --> 27:40.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from America's effort to destroy
those opposition
forces in both countries.

27:40.759 --> 27:45.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there aren't any other rebel
forces that
one can foresee on the horizon
that will be

27:45.964 --> 27:49.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
able to take Eastern Syria
that's now occupied
by ISIS.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the Syrian government will
be there.

27:52.504 --> 27:55.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's weak today, but it's been
gathering strength.

27:55.941 --> 28:00.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's likely that, in
the next
few years, you will see the
Syrian government

28:00.512 --> 28:02.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
retake much of Syria.

28:02.247 --> 28:03.982 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, this is disputed amongst
experts.

28:04.016 --> 28:08.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a lot of people here
today at our
conference who think that that's
not likely

28:08.186 --> 28:11.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to happen, that there may be
enclaves and
so forth.

28:11.056 --> 28:13.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think the Assad regime is
on a roll.

28:13.692 --> 28:17.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's got the backing of
Russia and
Iran and Hezbollah.

28:17.963 --> 28:23.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's hard to see who is
going to stand
in their way in this steady
fight against

28:23.802 --> 28:25.571 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the insurgents.

28:25.604 --> 28:30.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Randa Slim,
what happens
to U.S. support, considering
that there is

28:30.309 --> 28:32.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this shift in momentum
militarily?

28:32.444 --> 28:35.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What happens to the aid that
we're giving
to these rebels?

28:35.847 --> 28:42.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDA SLIM: Look, I mean, we
have now a new
administration that's going to
take power

28:42.220 --> 28:44.189 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in January.

28:44.222 --> 28:52.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we already have heard from
Mr. Trump during
the campaign that the priority
of his administration

28:52.130 --> 28:57.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will be focusing on fighting
ISIS, and that
he's against nation-building,
against regime

28:57.569 --> 28:59.304 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
change.

28:59.338 --> 29:06.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I'm going -- I would expect
us to move
into some kind of a security
dialogue with

29:06.645 --> 29:09.982 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Russians about what to do in
Syria.

29:10.015 --> 29:12.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
However, the Russians have the
baggage.

29:12.150 --> 29:16.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's Iranian baggage
they're going to
bring with them with any kind of
dialogue

29:16.188 --> 29:18.090 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Americans.

29:18.123 --> 29:23.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you have already this
contradiction between
an American administration that
wants to engage

29:23.061 --> 29:29.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the Russians, but also an
American administration
that sees Iran as a great
threat.

29:29.134 --> 29:34.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the question is how
you're going to
square these two contradictory,
in a way,

29:34.306 --> 29:39.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
positions and attitudes as you
enter into
a security dialogue with the
Russians.

29:39.411 --> 29:45.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when it comes to the support
of our allies
-- and, primarily, the main ally
has been

29:45.851 --> 29:52.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the Kurds -- I see the
possibility, as a result
of this American-Russian
security dialogue,

29:52.858 --> 29:59.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I see the possibility of the
Kurds -- of a
deal, in a way, being struck, at
the expense

29:59.965 --> 30:03.535 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the Kurds in Northern Syria.

30:03.568 --> 30:06.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Joshua Landis,
are the Kurds
the ones that get squeezed out
in this process,

30:07.005 --> 30:11.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where they have to have the
support of the
U.S. to continue on, but, at the
same time,

30:11.343 --> 30:14.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Turkey wants nothing to do in
any close independence
of theirs?

30:14.880 --> 30:20.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSHUA LANDIS: Well, I do
believe that the
Kurds are in a difficult
situation.

30:20.085 --> 30:22.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They do have some American
support.

30:22.087 --> 30:24.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How consistent that will be is
unclear.

30:24.556 --> 30:29.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they have built up a strong
military,
and they have begun to build the
institutions

30:29.061 --> 30:32.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of an autonomous life in
Northern Syria.

30:32.397 --> 30:37.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey's enmity towards the
Kurds and their
desire to make sure there is no
independent

30:37.135 --> 30:43.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kurdish state or even really
autonomous enclave
is going to push the Kurds into
Assad's hands

30:43.942 --> 30:45.711 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
over time.

30:45.744 --> 30:50.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're going to have to strike
a bargain
with Assad that will keep them
in the Syrian

30:50.082 --> 30:56.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state and under some kind of
Syrian authority,
so that they can have the
protection of international

30:56.354 --> 31:01.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
legitimacy and the Syrian army
against the
Turks.

31:01.126 --> 31:04.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much -- how they can bargain
with Assad
is unclear.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What kind of negotiations they
can come to,
unclear.

31:07.799 --> 31:12.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will see whether they get
something like
the Kurds in Iraq, which is a
large measure

31:12.404 --> 31:15.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of autonomy, or something less
than that.

31:15.440 --> 31:19.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That will be one of the big
negotiations to
come out of this process.

31:19.077 --> 31:21.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Joshua Landis,
Randa Slim, thank you both.

31:21.847 --> 31:23.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSHUA LANDIS: Pleasure.

31:23.381 --> 31:25.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We have more
online.

31:25.917 --> 31:30.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before Aleppo was devastated by
war, the city
was a thriving hub with a proud
history dating

31:30.522 --> 31:31.990 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
back millennia.

31:32.023 --> 31:39.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Find images from before and
after the destruction
at PBS.org/NewsHour.

31:39.931 --> 31:50.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

31:50.509 --> 31:56.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
new law to
bolster the United States'
mental health system;

31:56.414 --> 31:59.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and learning to see art with an
artist's eye.

31:59.751 --> 32:05.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: International tests
are one way
of gauging how American kids are
doing in

32:05.157 --> 32:07.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
school compared with other
countries.

32:07.459 --> 32:12.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Traditionally, the U.S.
performance has been
described as mediocre, and this
year was no

32:12.764 --> 32:14.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
different.

32:14.299 --> 32:17.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The most recent test scores show
the U.S.
is stagnant in reading and
science.

32:17.903 --> 32:21.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In math, our country ranks
toward the bottom
of developed nations.

32:22.007 --> 32:26.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What these results tell us about
educational
priorities around the world is a
bit more

32:27.012 --> 32:28.880 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
nuanced.

32:28.914 --> 32:33.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Kavitha
Cardoza with
our partner Education Week met
with international

32:33.518 --> 32:36.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
students to ask them first-hand
about the
differences.

32:36.188 --> 32:39.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of our weekly series
Making the
Grade.

32:39.457 --> 32:42.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Calvin Leong
loves soccer.

32:42.794 --> 32:46.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CALVIN LEONG, Student: I started
soccer really
young.

32:46.865 --> 32:49.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just can't stop playing
soccer because
it's really fun.

32:49.935 --> 32:54.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Two years ago,
Calvin and
his family moved to the U.S.
because of his

32:54.306 --> 32:56.007 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
father's work.

32:56.041 --> 33:00.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His mother Margaret, says if he
was still
living in his home country, Hong
Kong, just

33:00.512 --> 33:04.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like his former classmates,
Calvin would have
had to give up soccer.

33:04.249 --> 33:07.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET TSANG, Mother of
Calvin: Calvin's
friends in Hong Kong have to
give up playing

33:07.319 --> 33:10.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
soccer because they have to
focus and concentrate
in their studying.

33:10.889 --> 33:16.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: She says there
are only a
few universities in Hong Kong,
so competition

33:16.328 --> 33:18.129 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is fierce.

33:18.163 --> 33:23.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET TSANG: That's why
parents would like
them to have extra lessons, even
after school

33:23.168 --> 33:24.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for almost six hours.

33:24.870 --> 33:31.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think they can balance
studying and
extracurricular activities here.

33:31.910 --> 33:36.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Other countries
have, at
times, wrestled with that lack
of balance,

33:36.882 --> 33:42.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and some have even turned to
high-performing
U.S. schools for lessons in
building student

33:42.153 --> 33:45.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
skills, such as creativity and
collaboration.

33:45.624 --> 33:52.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, academically, when Calvin
moved here,
he found general classes much
easier in the

33:52.264 --> 33:53.999 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
U.S.

33:54.032 --> 33:58.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CALVIN LEONG: In Hong Kong,
math-wise, it's
definitely super competitive and
everyone,

33:58.937 --> 34:01.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like, move in the same pace.

34:01.206 --> 34:05.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it's pretty hard to catch up
if you fall
behind.

34:05.543 --> 34:08.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, in America, you can choose
your own pace.

34:08.580 --> 34:13.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Calvin loves
the diversity
of U.S. schools and says he's
made lots of

34:13.952 --> 34:17.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
friends, even if many of them
don't know where
he's from.

34:17.088 --> 34:21.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CALVIN LEONG: When people ask me
about Hong
Kong, I connect Hong Kong with
the Hollywood

34:21.526 --> 34:24.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
movies they saw like the
"Transformers" and
the "Batman."

34:24.729 --> 34:29.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Hong Kong is
also known for
being a place that does very
well on international

34:29.401 --> 34:35.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tests, unlike the U.S., where
the academic
performance this year was
lackluster.

34:35.407 --> 34:39.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. ranks in the middle of
the pack when
it comes to reading and science.

34:39.177 --> 34:43.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In math, it ranked 31st out of
35 countries.

34:43.715 --> 34:48.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The PISA test is taken every
three years by
15-year-olds from dozens of
countries.

34:48.954 --> 34:54.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What makes this test interesting
is that it
doesn't gauge what students can
memorize,

34:54.726 --> 34:56.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in other words, what you can
Google.

34:56.795 --> 35:00.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The PISA test looks to see what
students can
do with what they know.

35:00.899 --> 35:04.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WOMAN: They are asked to
interpret texts,
solve mathematics problems.

35:04.736 --> 35:08.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Andreas
Schleicher oversees
the PISA test.

35:08.206 --> 35:11.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says the school systems of
today are the
economies of tomorrow.

35:11.910 --> 35:15.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREAS SCHLEICHER, PISA Test:
You look at
a country like Korea in the
1960s.

35:15.613 --> 35:20.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Korea had the level of the
economic development
of Afghanistan today, one of the
least developed

35:21.019 --> 35:22.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
education systems.

35:22.620 --> 35:23.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it got education right.

35:23.888 --> 35:25.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It became one of its most
successful economies.

35:25.790 --> 35:32.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The power of education to
transform societies
and generate both economic and
social outcomes

35:32.397 --> 35:34.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is just tremendous.

35:34.332 --> 35:39.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Economic
prosperity, international
competitiveness, national
security, those

35:39.704 --> 35:46.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are a few of the reasons
countries take education
and, by extension, these
rankings so seriously.

35:46.077 --> 35:53.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As President Obama said back in
2009, countries
that out-educate us will
outperform us.

35:53.651 --> 35:58.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. spends markedly more
money compared
to other developed countries on
education,

35:58.056 --> 36:01.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but, by high school, American
students fall
behind.

36:01.893 --> 36:07.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Schleicher says it's not about
how much a
country spends on education, but
how it spends

36:07.565 --> 36:08.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the money.

36:08.833 --> 36:11.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says, in other countries,
it's all about
teacher quality.

36:11.803 --> 36:16.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREAS SCHLEICHER: And I'm not
only talking
about making teaching
financially more attractive.

36:16.174 --> 36:20.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm also talking about making
teaching intellectually
more attractive.

36:20.245 --> 36:24.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's probably where the
United States
is furthest away from some of
the highest-performing

36:24.916 --> 36:29.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
education systems, where you
really have a
much greater investment in the
quality of

36:29.387 --> 36:31.056 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
teaching.

36:31.089 --> 36:34.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: U.S. Secretary
of Education
John King has one word for the
results.

36:34.292 --> 36:36.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN KING, U.S. Education
Secretary: I would
say that we are disappointed.

36:36.194 --> 36:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: King says the
Obama administration
has championed educational best
practices,

36:41.666 --> 36:46.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for example, an emphasis on
teacher quality
and early education.

36:46.438 --> 36:51.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many states have also adopted
the Common Core,
which sets high standards of
what children

36:51.109 --> 36:52.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
should know at each grade.

36:52.811 --> 36:54.779 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But, he says:

36:54.813 --> 36:58.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KING: One of the challenges
in our system,
different from many of our
international competitors,

36:58.316 --> 37:04.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is that it is a highly
decentralized system,
so change takes a particularly
long time.

37:04.089 --> 37:08.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: A lot of people
say, you
know, it's not fair to look at
these results

37:08.259 --> 37:10.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and compare us to other
countries which are
more homogeneous.

37:10.795 --> 37:14.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN KING: Sure, we have to be
cautious about
these results.

37:14.566 --> 37:18.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, we can look at
a country
like Canada that's had a very
large influx

37:18.703 --> 37:22.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of immigrants over the last few
years and
is doing better.

37:22.841 --> 37:28.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can look at countries around
the world
like Poland, which is a country
that has significant

37:28.213 --> 37:33.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
population of low-income
students, and yet
they have made a lot of progress
over the

37:33.518 --> 37:34.486 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last decade.

37:34.519 --> 37:36.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we should ask why.

37:36.321 --> 37:40.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Julia Kempster
and her family
moved from New Zealand to
Maryland earlier

37:40.458 --> 37:41.659 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this year.

37:41.693 --> 37:44.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She gets asked a lot of
questions from classmates.

37:44.496 --> 37:46.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA KEMPSTER, Student: Can you
talk for
me?

37:46.798 --> 37:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Can you say the number 10 for
me?

37:49.067 --> 37:52.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it true that there's one
person to every
65 sheep?

37:52.770 --> 37:59.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: School is very
different
in the U.S., more students, more
tests.

37:59.043 --> 38:04.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the biggest difference,
Julia says, is,
in New Zealand, she had to
interpret and analyze

38:04.215 --> 38:05.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
information a lot more.

38:05.817 --> 38:08.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA KEMPSTER: Here, it's like
you get everything
from the book.

38:08.753 --> 38:10.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's like the facts are the
facts.

38:10.555 --> 38:14.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's lots of dates you
have to memorize,
because everything is very
important.

38:14.926 --> 38:18.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's not a lot about what
you think, but
what's in the book.

38:18.730 --> 38:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Despite the
differences,
Julia's a typical teenager.

38:22.734 --> 38:25.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She loves the social aspect of
her U.S. school.

38:25.503 --> 38:29.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA KEMPSTER: In America,
like, you have
a lot of dances and social
things you get

38:29.240 --> 38:31.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to go to, which is very fun.

38:31.576 --> 38:35.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You get to do, obviously, like
homecoming
and everything like that.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.081 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Yes, it's fun.

38:37.115 --> 38:42.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TOM LOVELESS, Brookings
Institution: American
high schools place a huge
emphasis on the

38:42.320 --> 38:44.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
social life of teenagers.

38:44.255 --> 38:48.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: And that's part
of the problem,
says Tom Loveless with the
Brookings Institution.

38:48.927 --> 38:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says homecoming, prom,
rallies may help
teach teamwork and creativity,
but don't improve

38:55.567 --> 38:57.068 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
academics.

38:57.101 --> 39:01.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says we need to look at the
role culture
plays in reinforcing education.

39:01.973 --> 39:07.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Loveless surveyed almost 400
foreign exchange
students who spent a year in an
American high

39:07.278 --> 39:12.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
school, and asked them about the
relative
importance given to math and
sports.

39:12.850 --> 39:17.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM LOVELESS: I asked them,
among your friends,
among your peer groups, how
important is it

39:17.689 --> 39:20.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be successful at mathematics?

39:20.558 --> 39:25.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they said, well -- the
foreign exchanges
said, well, back home, it's
fairly important

39:25.396 --> 39:27.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whether or not you're good at
mathematics.

39:27.365 --> 39:30.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In the United States, not so
much.

39:30.101 --> 39:32.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then I asked them about
sports.

39:32.136 --> 39:35.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How important is it to be a good
athlete?

39:35.106 --> 39:40.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with both boys and girls,
and no matter
from what country they came
from, they said,

39:40.511 --> 39:46.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the United States, the
emphasis on being
a good athlete was much more
important in

39:46.684 --> 39:50.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the United States than back with
their peer
groups in their home country.

39:50.622 --> 39:54.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: There is a
bright spot when
it comes to this year's PISA
test results.

39:54.726 --> 39:59.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The gap between rich and poor
students in
the U.S. is closing faster than
any other

39:59.831 --> 40:05.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
developed country, but it will
take a lot
more effort to reach the top.

40:05.103 --> 40:12.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour" and
Education Week,
I'm Kavitha Cardoza, reporting
from Bethesda,

40:13.011 --> 40:16.114 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Maryland.

40:16.147 --> 40:25.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Most of the
attention around
the big biomedical bill signed
by President

40:25.757 --> 40:30.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama today has focused on
faster drug approval
and new money for research, but
it's a huge

40:30.662 --> 40:32.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
piece of legislation.

40:32.497 --> 40:36.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one key part that's received
less attention
is the attempt to improve mental
health care

40:36.501 --> 40:37.835 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the U.S.

40:37.869 --> 40:39.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has a look.

40:39.637 --> 40:43.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Advocates say
this part
of the legislation is the most
significant

40:43.141 --> 40:46.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
step forward for mental health
care in nearly
a decade.

40:46.544 --> 40:50.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The law promotes a range of
mental health
initiatives, including more
evidence-based

40:50.648 --> 40:52.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
early intervention for young
people.

40:52.784 --> 40:54.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It expands outpatient mental
health care.

40:54.952 --> 40:59.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to coordinate it all, it
creates a new
assistant secretary position.

40:59.424 --> 41:03.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on this, I'm joined now
by the lead
author of the legislation,
Congressman Tim

41:03.194 --> 41:05.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Murphy, Republican of
Pennsylvania.

41:05.296 --> 41:06.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's also a practicing
psychologist.

41:06.497 --> 41:07.465 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Welcome.

41:07.498 --> 41:08.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

41:08.700 --> 41:10.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM MURPHY (R), Pennsylvania:
Great to be
with you.

41:10.568 --> 41:12.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Before we get
into the specifics
of the legislation, I wonder if
you could

41:12.370 --> 41:16.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just give me an overview of what
you see where
we are failing in our treatment
of mental

41:16.374 --> 41:17.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
health care in this country.

41:17.375 --> 41:19.210 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

41:19.243 --> 41:21.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM MURPHY: Well, in any given
year, 60 million
Americans are affected by some
level of mental

41:21.145 --> 41:24.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
illness, from the very mild to
the very serious,
10 million with very serious
mental illness.

41:24.782 --> 41:26.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Four million get no treatment at
all.

41:26.951 --> 41:30.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States spend an enormous amount
of money,
in the federal government about
$130 billion

41:30.822 --> 41:35.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spread across 112 agencies,
although most
of that is just disability
payments.

41:35.093 --> 41:37.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're not doing a good job,
because what
has happened is, over the years,
when we have

41:37.695 --> 41:43.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seen a dropping of death rates
for cancer,
it's gone down, diabetes,
infectious disease,

41:44.001 --> 41:50.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
lung disease, AIDS, all
declined, increasing
for suicide, increasing for
substance abuse.

41:50.608 --> 41:53.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when we closed all those big
asylums,
those big hospitals that were
out there for

41:53.811 --> 41:57.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a century or so -- we needed to
close them
down -- but we didn't provide
outpatient care.

41:57.815 --> 41:59.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So what do we do?

41:59.117 --> 42:00.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have filled our jails with
them.

42:00.818 --> 42:06.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The majority of people in jails,
the state
and local jails, are people with
a mental

42:06.124 --> 42:07.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
illness disorder, too.

42:07.892 --> 42:12.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Eight out of 10 people in an
emergency room
have some related mental health
disorder.

42:12.563 --> 42:18.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Five percent of the people on
Medicaid are
responsible for 50 percent of
all Medicaid

42:18.336 --> 42:19.504 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
spending.

42:19.537 --> 42:21.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And those are people with a
concurrent mental
illness.

42:21.305 --> 42:25.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you see, in terms of costs,
in terms of
the costs of lives, 959 a day,
350,000 in

42:25.943 --> 42:30.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this country last year, related
to mental
illness, primary, secondary,
that's more deaths

42:30.348 --> 42:34.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in one year than the entire
combat deaths
of World War I -- of the United
States in

42:34.752 --> 42:40.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
World War I, Korea, Vietnam,
Bosnia, Desert
Storm, Afghanistan, and Iraq, in
one year.

42:40.358 --> 42:41.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a serious problem.

42:41.592 --> 42:42.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Really some
startling numbers
there.

42:42.794 --> 42:44.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, let's talk about some of the
specifics.

42:44.662 --> 42:48.599 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You create an assistant
secretary for mental
health and substance use
disorders.

42:48.633 --> 42:50.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know that is something that
was very important
to you.

42:50.535 --> 42:51.502 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Why that?

42:51.536 --> 42:52.737 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

42:52.770 --> 42:54.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM MURPHY: Because we needed
someone to take
the helm.

42:54.772 --> 42:56.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we found in the GAO,
General Accounting
Office, reports, they said there
was no accountability

42:56.974 --> 42:58.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the grant programs.

42:58.943 --> 43:04.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, oftentimes, we were funding
really embarrassing
silly grant programs, such as a
Web site that

43:04.482 --> 43:07.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had a special hot line you could
call if you
were upset about the snow in New
England,

43:07.852 --> 43:12.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you had snow anxiety, how to
make a fruit
smoothie if you were upset,
making collages,

43:12.890 --> 43:17.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
masks, interpretive dancing, a
$20,000 painting
hanging in someone's office
about mental health

43:17.662 --> 43:19.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with two people sitting on a
rock.

43:19.330 --> 43:21.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Total waste of money.

43:21.532 --> 43:26.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We had to put someone in charge
who can take
the helm of these 112 federal
agencies, work

43:26.070 --> 43:30.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with them, with the VA, with
DOD, and others,
and start to coordinate
evidence-based care

43:30.274 --> 43:34.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
directed towards those who need
it, work on
prevention, work on those with
serious mental

43:34.545 --> 43:38.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
illness, but someone with the
clout behind
their name to do that.

43:38.549 --> 43:42.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: One of the
things we often
hear about is there are simply
not enough

43:42.153 --> 43:46.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beds for people who need them
and not enough
practitioners to help those who
need help.

43:46.657 --> 43:48.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What does this legislation do to
address that?

43:48.759 --> 43:50.695 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

43:50.728 --> 43:52.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM MURPHY: Well, regard to the
practitioners,
half the counties in America
have no psychiatrist,

43:52.630 --> 43:53.598 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
no psychologist.

43:53.631 --> 43:54.599 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Half?

43:54.632 --> 43:55.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

43:55.733 --> 43:57.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM MURPHY: Half -- and no
clinical social
worker.

43:57.668 --> 44:00.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And of those that do have
psychiatrists, but
we have 9,000 child and
adolescent psychiatrists.

44:00.671 --> 44:02.440 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We need 30,000.

44:02.473 --> 44:06.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, by the way, serious mental
illness, half
the cases emerge by age 14, 75
percent by

44:06.811 --> 44:07.778 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
age 24.

44:07.812 --> 44:09.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But you can't get care.

44:09.247 --> 44:10.882 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's not there.

44:10.915 --> 44:15.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we invest about $50 million
to help with
the new work force to build that
up.

44:15.987 --> 44:22.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the bed issue, we also
work with Medicaid
that, right now, they had a
16-bed limit,

44:22.426 --> 44:24.195 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
which is absurd.

44:24.228 --> 44:26.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're between the ages of 22
and 64, you
can't any in a private
psychiatric hospital

44:26.831 --> 44:27.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that has more than 16 beds.

44:27.832 --> 44:28.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's not enough.

44:28.966 --> 44:30.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we make them homeless or we
put them in
jail.

44:30.735 --> 44:34.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this lists that and says
15-day average
length of stay per month.

44:34.739 --> 44:35.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's not enough, I know.

44:35.973 --> 44:37.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not going to address
everything.

44:37.675 --> 44:40.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it sure is better to be in a
hospital
bed than laying on a park bench
in the cold

44:40.344 --> 44:42.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or being in a jail cell.

44:42.280 --> 44:44.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Just as you
mentioned, obviously,
one of the first-responders that
often are

44:44.649 --> 44:49.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interacting with people who have
mental health
crises are our police forces all
over the

44:49.854 --> 44:51.055 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

44:51.088 --> 44:52.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And they're not really
well-equipped to deal
with this.

44:52.189 --> 44:53.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you tackle that in this
legislation?

44:53.357 --> 44:54.325 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

44:54.358 --> 44:55.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TIM MURPHY: We do.

44:55.359 --> 44:56.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We put a few million dollars
into that.

44:56.360 --> 44:58.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's called crisis intervention
training.

44:58.195 --> 45:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, two years ago, The
Washington Post
did a story and reported there
was 250 deaths

45:02.466 --> 45:05.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from police encountering someone
with a mental
illness who then attacked the
policeman, came

45:05.469 --> 45:07.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in with a knife or a gun or
something.

45:07.104 --> 45:09.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's too many.

45:09.373 --> 45:12.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we do is fund the programs,
which are
very, very effective in training
policemen

45:12.944 --> 45:17.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when they know someone has a
serious mental
illness or they're in crisis or
they can kind

45:17.815 --> 45:19.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of identify from the situation.

45:19.617 --> 45:23.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They learn techniques to calm
the person down,
and so that it's not a
confrontation, and

45:23.921 --> 45:26.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it will save some lives, and get
the person
in treatment.

45:26.457 --> 45:30.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You have
supported repealing
the Affordable Care Act.

45:30.828 --> 45:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some of your Democratic
colleagues, who
laud this legislation, say that,
if you repeal

45:36.233 --> 45:41.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the ACA, which has a lot of
provisions to
care for the mentally ill, that
you're shooting

45:41.372 --> 45:42.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
your legislation in the foot.

45:42.707 --> 45:43.674 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

45:43.708 --> 45:44.809 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TIM MURPHY: Yes.

45:44.842 --> 45:45.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What's your
response to
that?

45:45.710 --> 45:46.677 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

45:46.711 --> 45:47.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TIM MURPHY: Well, I fought too
hard for this.

45:47.712 --> 45:49.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have worked in this field for
40 years.

45:49.513 --> 45:52.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I welcome the teamwork of my
colleagues on
the other side of the aisle to
say we have

45:52.883 --> 45:55.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to make sure we preserve this.

45:55.386 --> 46:00.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reason it's so important is,
if we're
going to find cost savings in
retooling and

46:00.691 --> 46:05.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reforming health care, a lot of
it comes from
the integrated care of the
mentally ill, with

46:05.863 --> 46:10.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mental illness, behavioral
illness, and physical
illness.

46:10.267 --> 46:14.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you find someone with a
chronic illness,
they're twice the rate of
depression among

46:14.805 --> 46:16.007 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

46:16.040 --> 46:17.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And untreated depression doubles
their health
care costs.

46:17.842 --> 46:21.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you hone in and treat both
at the same
time by integrating behavioral
and physical

46:21.078 --> 46:25.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
medicine, when the physician
takes charge,
when you have capitated plans,
so it's incentive

46:25.316 --> 46:29.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the doctors to do all that,
you actually
can reduce spending for those
people by about

46:29.553 --> 46:32.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
40 percent to 50 percent, while
you're providing
better care.

46:32.156 --> 46:34.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this is a lesson I want to
make sure my
colleagues to know.

46:34.925 --> 46:37.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is the thing what we ought
to be doing.

46:37.695 --> 46:38.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's good with compassion.

46:38.696 --> 46:39.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's good morally.

46:39.697 --> 46:41.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it saves money.

46:41.532 --> 46:44.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But do you
worry that if
the ACA is repealed, that a lot
of what you're

46:44.669 --> 46:48.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trying to do, lauded work here,
is going to
get thrown out?

46:48.272 --> 46:50.041 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

46:50.074 --> 46:51.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM MURPHY: You're talking to
someone who
has spent the last four years in
the trenches

46:51.575 --> 46:55.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fighting for this, and a lot of
members who
were part of this team, too.

46:55.312 --> 46:56.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't see us just throwing
this out.

46:56.647 --> 47:00.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will work together to make
sure these provisions
stay in.

47:00.084 --> 47:03.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even so, part of that
concern is what
states are going to do with
Medicaid money,

47:03.521 --> 47:04.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with block grants.

47:04.522 --> 47:05.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Right.

47:05.523 --> 47:07.291 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

47:07.324 --> 47:08.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM MURPHY: When states got
block grants,
you saw a number of states, like
Rhode Island

47:08.259 --> 47:08.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Ohio, they just pulled the
money out.

47:08.926 --> 47:10.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right.

47:10.294 --> 47:10.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Representative Tim Murphy of
Pennsylvania,
thank you very much.

47:10.561 --> 47:11.495 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

47:11.529 --> 47:17.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TIM MURPHY: Thank you.

47:17.668 --> 47:29.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: freeing
yourself to appreciate
art in all its forms and colors.

47:29.447 --> 47:32.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the focus of our latest
addition to
the "NewsHour" Bookshelf.

47:32.650 --> 47:34.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And for that, we go to Jeffrey
Brown.

47:34.518 --> 47:38.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What do we see
when we look
at art?

47:38.856 --> 47:42.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Something that gives us pleasure
or moves
us not at all.

47:43.027 --> 47:47.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many of us perhaps aren't sure
what it is
we're supposed to be taking in
or trying to

47:47.865 --> 47:49.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
understand.

47:49.600 --> 47:55.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The painter David Salle wants us
to trust
ourselves more in looking, but
also to consider

47:55.806 --> 47:59.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how something is made, as well
as what it
is.

47:59.844 --> 48:01.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His new book is titled "How to
See."

48:01.946 --> 48:07.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SALLE, Author, "How to
See": I think
it enhances one's enjoyment, if
you can put

48:07.585 --> 48:14.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yourself a little bit into the
place of the
maker, imagine how it was made,
imagine what's

48:14.325 --> 48:15.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
involved in making it.

48:15.659 --> 48:17.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Because it is a
thing that
was made, right?

48:18.028 --> 48:19.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID SALLE: Art is something
someone made.

48:19.830 --> 48:21.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a product of human
endeavor.

48:21.799 --> 48:26.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As such, it's not that different
from having
a conversation with someone.

48:26.971 --> 48:29.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The painter is telling us
something.

48:29.673 --> 48:32.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Just, how do they -- what's
their syntax?

48:32.710 --> 48:34.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's their inflection?

48:34.245 --> 48:37.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Which, in
painterly terms,
means what brush you use,
what...

48:37.515 --> 48:39.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID SALLE: It can be.

48:39.283 --> 48:44.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can be how wide the brush is, or
how skinny
the rectangle is, or if it's
even a painting

48:44.054 --> 48:47.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at all, if it has any marks on
it at all.

48:47.124 --> 48:52.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Salle himself has
been a prominent
artist since the 1980s, known
for his large-scale

48:52.630 --> 48:59.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
collage-style paintings that
incorporate disparate
images from a variety of
sources.

48:59.603 --> 49:04.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some newer ones hung in his
Brooklyn studio,
where we talked recently.

49:04.775 --> 49:10.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One way to look at a painting is
to notice
those images, here a car, a
watermelon, a

49:10.881 --> 49:13.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cigarette pack, and more.

49:13.117 --> 49:17.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But how you make these
connections is what
most interests Salle.

49:17.121 --> 49:23.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SALLE: What this painting
does, and
most paintings do, is gives you
a path for

49:23.160 --> 49:24.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
your eye to move around.

49:24.862 --> 49:28.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The painting actually tells your
eye, go here,
now go here, now go here, go
here.

49:28.465 --> 49:32.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So all you have to do is look at
it, give
it a few seconds, and your eye
will start

49:32.436 --> 49:34.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to move through the painting.

49:34.238 --> 49:39.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In his book of
essays, Salle
offers an artist's view of other
artists,

49:40.010 --> 49:49.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Georg Baselitz, Dana Schutz,
John Baldessari,
and many others, and the
decisions they made,

49:49.720 --> 49:55.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the paths they chose, the
reasons a painting
works or doesn't, as with a
favorite and friend

49:55.960 --> 49:57.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of his, Alex Katz.

49:57.394 --> 49:59.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID SALLE: Big brush or small
brush?

49:59.396 --> 50:05.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, in Alex's case, a really
big brush,
a really big brush moved with
some velocity,

50:05.069 --> 50:10.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
using his whole arm, across a
pretty big surface,
ending in a very fine point,
doing that in

50:10.941 --> 50:16.513 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a way which seems both
premeditated and also
free and spontaneous.

50:16.547 --> 50:17.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what you see.

50:17.715 --> 50:20.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then your brain translates
that into Maine
Woods.

50:20.951 --> 50:22.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Oh, I like that place.

50:22.186 --> 50:23.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I want to go back there.

50:23.821 --> 50:29.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what enables you to have
that sensation
is the physical act of painting.

50:29.393 --> 50:32.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You talk about
the artist Christopher
Wool.

50:32.296 --> 50:34.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, that's an abstract painting.

50:34.598 --> 50:38.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't quite know what I'm
looking at in
that sense, or at least it's not
recognizable.

50:38.802 --> 50:40.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID SALLE: Right.

50:40.671 --> 50:43.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, in the example of
Christopher Wool, the
not quite knowing what you're
looking at is

50:43.140 --> 50:44.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
part of the experience.

50:45.009 --> 50:52.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His paintings are made with such
a complicated,
impacted and self-referential
set of gestures,

50:52.816 --> 50:57.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
marks and mechanical
representations of gestures
and marks and their interaction.

50:57.655 --> 50:59.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's very hard to tease them
apart.

50:59.456 --> 51:02.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's what you
mean by the
how in a case like that, all
those kinds of

51:03.027 --> 51:04.061 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
decisions?

51:04.094 --> 51:05.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID SALLE: Yes.

51:05.095 --> 51:06.063 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

51:06.096 --> 51:07.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The how is also the scale, the
size, the color.

51:07.531 --> 51:11.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The -- all of the physical
characteristics
of the thing are the how.

51:11.669 --> 51:16.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And then one more
example would
be Malcolm Morley, right, in...

51:16.040 --> 51:17.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID SALLE: Right.

51:17.875 --> 51:24.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Malcolm paints -- typically
paints paintings
of models, thousands of densely
packed brush

51:24.048 --> 51:30.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strokes made with a very small
brush, intensely
concentrated over small areas of
the canvas,

51:30.487 --> 51:32.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
one after the other.

51:32.156 --> 51:38.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this agitated, densely
packed surface
is the how, which becomes the
what.

51:38.295 --> 51:41.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You're a painter,
so you go
look at these things and say,
oh, how did

51:41.999 --> 51:44.601 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he do this, how did she do that?

51:44.635 --> 51:46.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do I have to know the how?

51:46.804 --> 51:48.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do I have to know how it was
done?

51:48.138 --> 51:50.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SALLE: I don't think you
have to know
anything, really.

51:50.107 --> 51:57.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think if you look for more
than 10 seconds,
you will start to -- without
being told anything,

51:57.481 --> 51:59.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you will start to notice those
things.

51:59.149 --> 52:00.684 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You will notice.

52:00.718 --> 52:05.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you go to a concert, you will
notice, is
it loud?

52:05.122 --> 52:06.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is the music fast?

52:06.123 --> 52:07.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is it predominately strings or
brass?

52:07.958 --> 52:13.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are things we can all
register, whether
we are musicians or not.

52:13.464 --> 52:15.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Painting's no different.

52:15.099 --> 52:20.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Taking pleasure in projecting
oneself into
the painting is the act of
looking.

52:20.204 --> 52:22.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what looking is.

52:22.039 --> 52:25.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You write at one
point, it's
a mistake to ask a work of art
to be all things

52:26.010 --> 52:28.812 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to all people.

52:28.846 --> 52:31.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What can we ask of a work of
art?

52:31.048 --> 52:32.783 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What should we ask of it?

52:32.816 --> 52:36.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SALLE: I think a good
painting or a
good work of art does many
things it wants,

52:36.453 --> 52:39.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, maybe 15 or 20 or 100.

52:39.456 --> 52:42.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the things a painting
does is to make
the room look better.

52:42.693 --> 52:44.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It improves the wall that it's
on.

52:44.495 --> 52:45.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, nothing
wrong with that.

52:45.796 --> 52:50.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SALLE: Which is much
harder than it
looks.

52:50.167 --> 52:53.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's a good thing.

52:53.937 --> 52:58.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if one engages with a
painting on that
level, that's fine, that's
great.

52:58.575 --> 53:04.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After some time, familiarity,
the other things
that a painting does, the other
layers, they

53:04.415 --> 53:06.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just start to make themselves
felt.

53:06.917 --> 53:08.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
People are still making
paintings.

53:08.218 --> 53:11.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People are still enjoying
paintings, looking
at paintings.

53:11.455 --> 53:14.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Paintings still have something
to tell us.

53:14.391 --> 53:21.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a way of being in the
world that painting
brings to us, that painters
bring to the task

53:21.832 --> 53:29.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we absorb and are able to
be in dialogue
with.

53:29.339 --> 53:32.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's something that's part of
us.

53:32.943 --> 53:37.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: From Brooklyn,
New York, I'm
Jeffrey Brown for the "PBS
NewsHour."

53:37.147 --> 53:41.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's wonderful to
hear what
an artist thinks art is, for a
change.

53:41.752 --> 53:43.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

53:43.087 --> 53:43.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, because we always wonder,
what was the
painter thinking?

53:43.754 --> 53:45.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Exactly.

53:45.589 --> 53:50.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, on the "NewsHour" online
right now:
How vital is the president's
daily intelligence

53:50.727 --> 53:52.496 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
briefing?

53:52.529 --> 53:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president-elect has taken an
unprecedented
approach, ignoring the briefing
most days

53:56.433 --> 53:57.801 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
altogether.

53:57.835 --> 54:01.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So how do national security and
intelligence
experts see this move?

54:01.472 --> 54:04.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We explore that on our Web site,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

54:04.141 --> 54:06.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And that's the
"NewsHour"
for tonight.

54:06.977 --> 54:07.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

54:07.978 --> 54:09.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

54:09.046 --> 54:10.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening.

54:10.848 --> 54:20.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.

54:20.891 --> 54:29.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
