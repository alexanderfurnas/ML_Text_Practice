presidency so far: the Russian
meddling in the 2016 election.

00:09.233 --> 00:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

with a Kremlin-connected
Russian lawyer was
just business as usual.

00:25.866 --> 00:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Trump's

00:28.300 --> 00:30.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY, Trump

was standard operating
procedure for the campaign.

00:30.700 --> 00:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's focus on what didn't

No action taken.

00:37.133 --> 00:39.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Nothing.

00:39.233 --> 00:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The New York Times
first reported the June 2016
meeting between Donald Trump

00:42.866 --> 00:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jr., then campaign chairman
Paul Manafort, Trump son-in-law
Jared Kushner, and Natalia

00:49.200 --> 00:51.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Veselnitskaya.

00:51.166 --> 00:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president's son said he had
been told that Veselnitskaya
had damaging information

00:55.100 --> 01:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about Hillary Clinton, who
had clinched the Democratic
nomination just days before.

01:02.233 --> 01:05.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The meeting came as
some Republicans openly
talked of trying to deny
Mr. Trump their party's

01:06.600 --> 01:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nomination at the convention.

01:08.666 --> 01:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Saturday, Donald Trump Jr.
described the session as a
short introductory meeting in

01:14.533 --> 01:16.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which U.S. adoptions of Russian
children were discussed.

01:16.766 --> 01:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But yesterday, faced with The
New York Times' reporting on
the purpose of the meeting, he

01:21.333 --> 01:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
acknowledged he was told the
lawyer might have information
helpful to the campaign.

01:26.200 --> 01:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said: "The woman
stated that she had
information that individuals
connected to Russia were

01:32.800 --> 01:36.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
funding the Democratic
National Committee and
supporting Ms. Clinton.

01:36.400 --> 01:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Her statements were vague,
ambiguous and made no sense.

01:40.466 --> 01:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It quickly became clear that she
had no meaningful information."

01:44.400 --> 01:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In an off-camera White House
briefing, principal Deputy Press
Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders

01:50.300 --> 01:52.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dismissed the controversy.

01:52.366 --> 01:54.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, Deputy
White House Press Secretary:
Don Jr. took a very short

01:54.300 --> 01:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
meeting from which there
was absolutely no follow-up.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Don Jr. didn't collude
with anybody to
influence the election.

02:00.566 --> 02:05.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, Donald
Trump Jr. said: "Obviously,
I'm the first person
on a campaign to ever

02:07.500 --> 02:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take a meeting to hear
info about an opponent Went
nowhere, but had to listen."

02:13.566 --> 02:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He also said he'd cooperate
with the Senate Intelligence
Committee's investigation of

02:16.533 --> 02:19.033 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Russian meddling
in the election.

02:19.033 --> 02:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Moscow, a spokesman for
Russian President Vladimir Putin
said the Kremlin knew nothing

02:23.633 --> 02:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about the lawyer or the meeting.

02:26.233 --> 02:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All this comes amid continued
confusion over just what came
out of the president's meeting

02:31.100 --> 02:33.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with Putin last week
at the G20 summit.

02:33.833 --> 02:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Administration officials
had hailed the creation
of a joint cyber-security
unit to guard against

02:39.566 --> 02:41.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
election hacking.

02:41.466 --> 02:43.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republican Senator Lindsey
Graham called it a dumb idea.

02:43.966 --> 02:46.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South
Carolina: To forgive and forget
when it comes to Putin regarding

02:47.900 --> 02:50.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cyber-attacks is
to empower Putin.

02:50.066 --> 02:52.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's exactly
what he's doing.

02:52.166 --> 02:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Hours after Graham
spoke, the president appeared
to reverse course, saying that a

02:58.133 --> 03:00.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S.- Russian cyber-security
unit can't happen.

03:00.866 --> 03:03.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
