HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.

00:05.539 --> 00:06.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

00:06.540 --> 00:08.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff are
away.

00:08.342 --> 00:12.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: The
death toll
from Italy's massive earthquake
sharply rises

00:12.746 --> 00:18.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to 250, while hundreds of
aftershocks make
rescue efforts even more
treacherous.

00:18.685 --> 00:22.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead, we take a look at
the alt-right
movement making its way onto the
political

00:23.023 --> 00:27.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scene, the history behind it,
and how it could
impact this presidential
election.

00:27.895 --> 00:31.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plus, we sit down with one of
the stars from
the Rio Olympics.

00:31.965 --> 00:35.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Five-time Olympic medalist Katie
Ledecky talks
breaking records and boundaries.

00:35.502 --> 00:39.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE LEDECKY, U.S. Olympic Gold
Medal Winner:
It's just been hard work that's
gotten me

00:39.273 --> 00:40.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to where I am today.

00:40.908 --> 00:43.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It wasn't a lot of talent,
really.

00:43.110 --> 00:49.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was more getting through the
work and setting
some big goals that has gotten
me to this

00:49.082 --> 00:50.417 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
point.

00:50.450 --> 00:56.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour,"

00:56.723 --> 00:59.493 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:59.526 --> 01:08.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Rescuers in
Italy today
desperately searched for signs
of life amid

01:08.368 --> 01:09.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a sea of rubble today.

01:09.636 --> 01:11.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The death toll now stands at 250
people.

01:11.972 --> 01:16.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The temblor leveled a cluster of
mountain
communities northeast of Rome
early yesterday.

01:16.043 --> 01:20.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Emma Murphy of Independent
Television News
is in Italy with the latest.

01:20.213 --> 01:28.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EMMA MURPHY: Since the first
quake, the aftershocks
are seemingly endless.

01:28.221 --> 01:37.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This one measuring 5.4 brought
fear to an
already traumatized population
and greater

01:37.464 --> 01:42.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
danger to those working through
what is already
damaged.

01:43.003 --> 01:43.971 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And what damage.

01:44.004 --> 01:46.106 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is Pescara del Tronto.

01:46.139 --> 01:51.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These images are of destruction
on such a
scale which makes them almost
impossible to

01:51.144 --> 01:53.046 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
take in.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On the ground, it still seems
unreal.

01:55.048 --> 02:01.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet a closer look gives a
glimpse into
the lives which were lived here
and for some

02:01.288 --> 02:03.690 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lost here.

02:03.724 --> 02:08.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even the bishop tells me he has
no words to
offer comfort, relying instead
of spiritual

02:08.495 --> 02:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
closeness or physical closeness
and silence
to help people through.

02:12.699 --> 02:16.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were around 1,000 people
in the town
when the quake struck.

02:16.670 --> 02:19.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Incredibly, most were able to
escape.

02:19.773 --> 02:23.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there are others buried deep
beneath.

02:23.643 --> 02:27.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are moments of joy, like
when this worker
shouted that he thought there
was a child

02:27.848 --> 02:29.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and called for silence.

02:29.583 --> 02:38.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They carefully begin to inch her
out from
the rubble which she has been
trapped in for

02:38.392 --> 02:39.493 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
15 hours.

02:39.526 --> 02:44.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She is 10 years old and pulled
out alive.

02:44.197 --> 02:48.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:48.935 --> 02:56.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA MURPHY: It was a moment of
hope, but
there is much desperation and a
feeling that

02:56.043 --> 02:58.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the time for rescues has now
passed.

02:58.245 --> 03:00.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: We use the dogs.

03:00.781 --> 03:08.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are looking for now at this
moment, but
no sign of people alive, no.

03:08.955 --> 03:13.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA MURPHY: For some, there's
been a chance
to retrieve a few belongings
abandoned as

03:13.393 --> 03:14.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they ran for their lives.

03:14.461 --> 03:15.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: I'm angry with God.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EMMA MURPHY: You're angry with
God?

03:16.797 --> 03:19.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Yes, I'm angry with God.

03:19.433 --> 03:23.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EMMA MURPHY: It's unlikely these
homes will
ever be salvaged.

03:23.470 --> 03:27.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And few feel particularly
confident about
living here now.

03:27.174 --> 03:31.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Italy's civil
protection
agency estimates about 5,000
people, including

03:31.812 --> 03:37.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
firefighters, soldiers, and
volunteers, have
provided assistance in the wake
of the disaster.

03:37.150 --> 03:40.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Colombia's president formally
delivered a
historic peace deal with FARC
rebels to his

03:40.720 --> 03:42.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
country's congress today.

03:42.522 --> 03:47.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It establishes a timetable for
the leftist
rebels to disarm and reenter
society, ending

03:47.761 --> 03:52.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
five decades of war that's
killed more than
220,000 people.

03:52.666 --> 03:56.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Juan Manuel Santos
hailed the agreement
before a jubilant crowd outside
the congress

03:56.069 --> 03:57.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
building in Bogota.

03:57.637 --> 04:01.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It still requires the Colombian
people's approval
in an October referendum.

04:01.608 --> 04:05.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS, Colombian
President (through
translator): I want to inform
Colombians that

04:05.946 --> 04:09.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have ordered a definitive
cease-fire with
the FARC, beginning this coming
Monday.

04:09.716 --> 04:12.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
With this ends the armed
conflict with the
FARC.

04:12.619 --> 04:16.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Through this act, we are giving
the people
the last word regarding
Colombia's peace,

04:16.756 --> 04:20.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and it will be the people on
October 2 who
will say, yes, we want peace.

04:20.794 --> 04:24.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We will take a
closer look
at Colombia's path to peace
after the news

04:24.831 --> 04:26.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
summary.

04:26.766 --> 04:31.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At least 13 people are dead one
after a nearly
nine-hour-long siege at the
American University

04:31.138 --> 04:33.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Afghanistan on the outskirts
of Kabul.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Dozens more were wounded.

04:35.542 --> 04:39.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The attack began last night with
a car bomb
at the university's entrance,
followed by

04:39.279 --> 04:41.047 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
gunfire.

04:41.081 --> 04:45.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It didn't end until this
morning, when two
gunmen were shot dead by Afghan
special forces.

04:45.619 --> 04:48.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Students recounted the assault.

04:48.455 --> 04:51.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AHMAD HUSSIN, Survivor (through
translator):
We were at the gym inside the
university when

04:51.191 --> 04:52.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the attack took place.

04:52.225 --> 04:53.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is a safe room there.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We all stayed there until 1:30
a.m.

04:55.629 --> 04:58.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then the security forces came in
and rescued
us.

04:58.165 --> 05:02.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NAQIE ULLAH, Survivor (through
translator):
The militant insurgents threw
hand grenades

05:02.202 --> 05:05.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at us, but we covered ourselves
under the
desks to avoid shrapnel.

05:05.071 --> 05:08.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then we all jumped down from the
window of
the second floor and escaped.

05:08.475 --> 05:12.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The State
Department confirmed
no U.S. citizens were among the
dead.

05:12.412 --> 05:15.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So far, there has been no claim
of responsibility.

05:15.649 --> 05:20.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Syria, the main Kurdish
militia is beginning
to withdraw from the Turkish
border a day

05:20.287 --> 05:25.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after the U.S. threatened to
revoke its support
if the Kurds didn't do so, this
in part due

05:25.892 --> 05:31.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Turkish concerns that the
so-called YPG
has gained too much ground
fighting the Islamic

05:31.064 --> 05:32.432 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
State.

05:32.465 --> 05:34.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say the group is tied to
Kurdish separatists
inside Turkey.

05:34.968 --> 05:39.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, more Turkish tanks
and fighters
moved into the Syrian border
town of Jarabulus

05:39.839 --> 05:43.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today to help Syrian rebels
secure the area
from ISIS militants.

05:43.944 --> 05:49.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. defense officials have
confirmed a series
of naval face-offs with Iran in
the Persian

05:49.683 --> 05:51.384 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Gulf.

05:51.418 --> 05:54.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An Iranian vessel approached two
American
warships yesterday, prompting
one U.S. ship

05:54.788 --> 05:56.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to fire warning shots.

05:56.656 --> 06:02.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The incident came a day after
Iranian boats
steered within 300 feet of an
American ship

06:02.128 --> 06:03.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the Strait of Hormuz.

06:03.563 --> 06:07.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A Pentagon spokesman said Iran's
naval aggression
was a concerning trend.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER COOK, Pentagon Press
Secretary: We certainly
hope it doesn't continue,
because it serves

06:10.704 --> 06:17.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no purpose, other than to raise
tensions in
an important part of world, and
tensions that

06:17.043 --> 06:20.113 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we don't seek to have escalated.

06:20.146 --> 06:25.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are conducting ourselves
again, as always
have, as the Navy does around
the world, in

06:25.619 --> 06:29.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a safe and professional manner,
and our sailors
will continue to do that, and
they will continue

06:29.422 --> 06:34.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to take the steps they need to,
to protect
themselves, their ships and our
interests

06:34.928 --> 06:36.596 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the region.

06:36.630 --> 06:39.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Iran's defense
minister
warned today they will continue
to confront

06:39.132 --> 06:44.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
any vessel entering its
territory, even though
this week's incidents were in
international

06:44.537 --> 06:46.406 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
waters.

06:46.439 --> 06:50.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The maker of the EpiPen said
today it is reducing
out-of-pocket costs for some
patients, amid

06:50.977 --> 06:52.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a firestorm of criticism.

06:52.879 --> 06:59.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The company, Mylan, will issue
savings cards
that cover up to $300 of the
cost of its $600

06:59.386 --> 07:02.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
two-dose package of the
lifesaving allergy
treatment.

07:02.722 --> 07:07.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is also doubling the amount
of people that
qualify for its patient
assistance program.

07:07.994 --> 07:11.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stocks slipped on Wall Street
today, led by
declines in the health care
sector.

07:11.564 --> 07:14.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 33 points
to close at 18448.

07:14.067 --> 07:19.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell five points, and
the S&amp;P 500
slid nearly three.

07:19.639 --> 07:24.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a Colombian
peace deal ending a half-century
of war; the

07:24.611 --> 07:29.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rise of the alt-right and why
Hillary Clinton
is linking it to Donald Trump;

and much more.

07:39.492 --> 07:45.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ledecky on her record-breaking
Olympic golds;
and much more.

07:45.765 --> 07:49.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we reported s earlier, the
government of
Colombia signed a deal with the
largest rebel

07:49.869 --> 07:53.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
group, the FARC, that could end
the world's
longest-running conflict.

07:53.873 --> 07:57.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here to discuss what's in the
accord and the
road ahead is Cynthia Arnson.

07:57.110 --> 08:00.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's director of the Latin

08:01.781 --> 08:03.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, thanks for joining us.

08:03.350 --> 08:04.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CYNTHIA ARNSON, Woodrow Wilson
International
Center for Scholars: Thank you.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: First of all,
this deal
has been a long time coming.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.922 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What's in it.

08:08.955 --> 08:13.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CYNTHIA ARNSON: Well, there are
five basic
agreements that cover agrarian
reform, cover

08:13.193 --> 08:18.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the kind of political
participation that the
guerrillas will have, cover
illicit economies,

08:18.832 --> 08:25.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including drug trafficking,
transitional justice,
and then the final one on the
terms for disarmament

08:25.372 --> 08:26.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and demobilization.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So it's very comprehensive, very
detailed.

08:28.675 --> 08:34.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The text itself is over 250
pages, but there
are some provisions of it that
are more controversial

08:35.014 --> 08:36.783 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than others.

08:36.816 --> 08:41.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as with any peace accord,
the real test
comes when it's time to
implement, and the

08:41.621 --> 08:45.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government and all of Colombian
society have
to live up to the agreement,
including the

08:45.959 --> 08:47.727 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
FAR.

08:47.761 --> 08:50.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
disarmament seems like
one of those complicated motions
that there

08:50.063 --> 08:56.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are just also -- there is a
distrust between
people who have been fighting,
shooting, killing

08:56.202 --> 08:58.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
one another for quite some time.

08:58.405 --> 09:01.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's to keep someone from
saying, you know
what, I'm going to wait until
the very end

09:01.174 --> 09:04.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
before I hand in my guns or
before I walk
in through this process?

09:04.210 --> 09:09.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CYNTHIA ARNSON: There is a very
explicit timetable
for the demobilization and
disarmament of

09:09.749 --> 09:11.484 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the FARC.

09:11.518 --> 09:16.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's supposed to start the
minute that the
peace accord is actually signed
between the

09:16.956 --> 09:22.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government and the president of
Colombia,
which will probably be some time
in a couple

09:22.195 --> 09:25.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of weeks, in mid to late
September.

09:25.231 --> 09:30.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then that is considered day
one, and there
is a 180-day period, basically
six months,

09:30.804 --> 09:37.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the FARC to go to one of 23
zones throughout
the country that have been
designated that

09:37.076 --> 09:42.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will be overseen by the United
Nations monitors
in terms of verification.

09:42.348 --> 09:44.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So there's a very detailed
thing.

09:44.117 --> 09:50.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Colombian military will
actually be
in place to guarantee the safe
passage of

09:50.790 --> 09:54.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the guerrillas from the various
places in
the country where they are.

09:54.461 --> 09:58.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the Colombian military has
also been at
the peace table.

09:58.465 --> 10:02.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was one of the very unique,
I think,
features of the Colombia peace
process.

10:02.702 --> 10:07.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they have been working
together with the
guerrillas to come up with these
procedures.

10:07.574 --> 10:11.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And this is
still a country
that has a lot of opposition to
the FARC.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What about the feeling that this
is perhaps
giving them a pass?

10:14.881 --> 10:18.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There have been injustices and
human rights
violations on both sides of
this.

10:18.384 --> 10:22.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you bring some of those
perpetrators
to justice while you build this
peace?

10:22.088 --> 10:24.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CYNTHIA ARNSON: Well, it is
hugely controversial.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the country is very
polarized.

10:26.626 --> 10:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there will be a plebiscite,
a chance for
the Colombian public to vote
either yes or

10:33.399 --> 10:36.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no for the peace accord to be
binding and
valid.

10:36.836 --> 10:41.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thirteen percent -- 50 percent
of 13 percent
of the registered voters have to
come out

10:41.774 --> 10:46.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and approve the peace accord
that's been negotiated.

10:46.246 --> 10:53.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the most strident critic is
the former
president, Alvaro Uribe, and the
current president,

10:53.586 --> 10:58.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Santos, was his defense
minister, and so there
is a tremendous amount of bad
blood.

10:58.424 --> 11:04.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are provisions on
transitional justice
and on the political
participation of the

11:04.864 --> 11:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FARC guerrillas that are really,
really controversial.

11:07.534 --> 11:11.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there is an expression in
Spanish about
swallowing frogs.

11:11.804 --> 11:14.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think there are many such
frogs in this
agreement.

11:14.541 --> 11:18.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is there a
possibility here
we could actually see a
campaign, almost a

11:18.645 --> 11:22.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
political-style campaign, to try
to encourage
voters to scuttle this accord?

11:22.815 --> 11:27.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CYNTHIA ARNSON: Well, that
campaign has been
under way throughout the peace
negotiations.

11:27.587 --> 11:33.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of criticism, almost daily
tweets from
President -- former President
Uribe and members

11:33.760 --> 11:35.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of his political party.

11:35.495 --> 11:42.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There will be a very, very
active campaign
between over -- now and October
2, both by

11:42.035 --> 11:46.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the government and its
supporters to mobilize
people to come out and vote in
favor of the

11:46.472 --> 11:52.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
accord, and an equally vigorous
campaign by
the opposition to say vote it
down, this is

11:52.245 --> 11:54.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not a good agreement for
Colombia.

11:54.113 --> 11:56.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Cynthia Arnson
of the Woodrow
Wilson Center, thanks for
joining us.

11:56.849 --> 11:58.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CYNTHIA ARNSON: Thank you.

11:58.751 --> 12:02.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: My
conversation with Cynthia
Arnson continues online on our
Facebook page.

12:02.355 --> 12:06.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Viewers also asked her about the
U.S. role
in the conflict, and what
happens if the agreement

12:06.926 --> 12:10.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to end the war is rejected in
the referendum.

12:10.096 --> 12:20.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can hear what Cynthia Arnson
has to say
at Facebook.com/NewsHour.

12:20.139 --> 12:25.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can hear what Cynthia Arnson
has to say
at Facebook.com/NewsHour.

12:25.311 --> 12:29.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in this country, both
presidential candidates
were in full attack mode today.

12:29.115 --> 12:33.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At issue, Republican nominee
Donald Trump's
alleged connections to a fringe
conservative

12:33.553 --> 12:34.520 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
philosophy.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has the story.

12:36.356 --> 12:41.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, Hillary
Clinton debuted
a fresh line of attack against
Donald Trump.

12:41.561 --> 12:44.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
That is what I want to make
clear today.

12:44.330 --> 12:53.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A man with a long history of
racial discrimination,
who traffics in dark conspiracy
theories drawn

12:53.439 --> 13:03.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the pages of supermarket
tabloids and
the far, dark reaches of the
Internet, should

13:03.750 --> 13:07.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
never run our government or
command our military.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

13:09.856 --> 13:13.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: This comes a little
more than a
week after Trump made Steve
Bannon his campaign's

13:13.126 --> 13:14.927 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
CEO.

13:14.961 --> 13:19.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bannon is on leave from his job
as executive
chairman of Breitbart News, a
Web site Bannon

13:20.033 --> 13:24.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has called a platform for
something called
the alt- right.

13:24.370 --> 13:29.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a movement that lives
largely online,
rejects mainstream conservative
politics,

13:29.676 --> 13:33.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and is linked to nationalist and
white supremacist
sentiments.

13:33.946 --> 13:36.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Clinton said Trump has echoed
alt-right rhetoric.

13:36.282 --> 13:40.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: All of
this adds up
to something we have never seen
before.

13:40.753 --> 13:49.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, of course, there's always
been a paranoid
fringe in our politics, a lot of
arising from

13:49.462 --> 13:51.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
racial resentment.

13:51.264 --> 13:56.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's never had the nominee
of a major
party stoking it, encouraging
it, and giving

13:56.936 --> 13:59.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it a national megaphone, until
now.

14:00.006 --> 14:05.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Clinton's campaign
backed up their
candidate's message online with
this new video

14:05.645 --> 14:09.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that includes a Ku Klux Klan
member expressing
support for Trump.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Donald Trump would be best
for the job.

14:11.584 --> 14:12.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUESTION: For president?

14:12.585 --> 14:13.553 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Yes.

14:13.586 --> 14:14.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: I am a farmer and white
nationalist.

14:14.921 --> 14:16.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Support Donald Trump.

14:16.122 --> 14:18.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Even before Clinton
spoke, Trump
hit back.

14:18.591 --> 14:23.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
When Democratic policies fail,
they are left

14:23.496 --> 14:30.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with only this one tired
argument: You're
racist, you're racist, you're
racist.

14:30.803 --> 14:32.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They keep saying it.

14:32.705 --> 14:33.973 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You're racist.

14:34.006 --> 14:37.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a tired, disgusting
argument.

14:37.710 --> 14:44.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The people of this country who
want their
laws enforced and respected, and
respected

14:44.450 --> 14:50.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by all, and who want their
border secured,
are not racists.

14:50.123 --> 14:56.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you want to have strong
borders, so that
people come into our country,
but they come

14:56.796 --> 15:01.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in legally through a legal
process, that doesn't
make you a racist.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It makes you smart.

15:03.302 --> 15:06.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It makes you an American.

15:06.139 --> 15:13.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today's exchange
between the candidates
shining a spotlight on a
little-known movement.

15:13.880 --> 15:16.349 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, what is the alt-right?

15:16.382 --> 15:19.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And how it is influencing this
year's presidential
race?

15:19.085 --> 15:23.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For that, we are joined by
Matthew Continetti,
editor in chief of The
Washington Free Beacon,

15:23.990 --> 15:29.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a conservative news Web site,
and from Manchester,
New Hampshire, David Weigel, who
covers national

15:29.295 --> 15:31.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
politics for The Washington
Post.

15:31.063 --> 15:33.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gentlemen, thank you both for
joining us.

15:33.266 --> 15:36.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dave, let me start with you and
ask you that
question.

15:36.569 --> 15:40.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is alt-right, who's behind
it, where
did it come from?

15:40.106 --> 15:44.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WEIGEL, The Washington
Post: Well, it's
a fair young movement with
fairly old ideas.

15:44.877 --> 15:49.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I would say what they're
against, which is
easier to define, is a
philosophy of invite

15:49.248 --> 15:50.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the world, invade the world.

15:50.616 --> 15:54.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They are generally
anti-intervention and
anti-multiculturalism.

15:54.687 --> 16:02.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they started to grow in
2007, as the Bush
administration was falling to
below 30 percent,

16:02.695 --> 16:08.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was seen as discredited, was
obviously going
to help Democrats win the next
election.

16:08.167 --> 16:11.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ron Paul's campaign seeded some
of this, but
it really grew under the
presidency of Barack

16:11.871 --> 16:12.839 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Obama.

16:12.872 --> 16:14.607 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they're fairly young people.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This is, I think, what's
worrying for a lot
of progressives and a lot of
people on the

16:16.776 --> 16:22.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right, fairly young people,
under 25, under
30, who have only known the
Republican Party

16:22.248 --> 16:24.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as a disappointment.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have gravitated to
these ideas which
are very anti-immigrant, very
anti-intervention.

16:27.019 --> 16:32.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And they're getting a
lot of attention,
Dave, because of the
anti-Semitic and anti-white

16:32.358 --> 16:35.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- or -- and white supremacist
rhetoric.

16:35.061 --> 16:39.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How central is that to their
message and to
what they believe in?

16:39.165 --> 16:42.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID WEIGEL: It's enabled in a
lot of their
messaging.

16:42.401 --> 16:47.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not every alt-right thinker or
activist is
a white nationalist, by far, but
there's a

16:47.707 --> 16:54.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sense that political correctness
is a bigger
problem than racism, and that
racism is used

16:54.313 --> 16:59.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a cudgel for silencing what
they want to
say, what they want to argue
about.

16:59.652 --> 17:02.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's, again, an older idea.

17:02.188 --> 17:06.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before the alt-right, there were
paleoconservatives,
like Sam Francis, like Pat
Buchanan, who argued

17:06.559 --> 17:11.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this and said, look, what the
left wants to
do to America, how it wants to
import lots

17:11.230 --> 17:17.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of immigrants, decrease the
number of traditional
white Americans, what they want
to do is not

17:17.570 --> 17:20.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
popular, and they have to kind
of Trojan a
horse through culturally, and
we're against

17:20.973 --> 17:21.941 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

17:21.974 --> 17:23.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Matthew, what is your
take on this?

17:23.376 --> 17:25.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What would you add to that, to
what Dave said?

17:25.411 --> 17:27.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MATTHEW CONTINETTI, The
Washington Free Beacon:
I think I have a slightly
narrower definition

17:27.914 --> 17:29.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the alt-right than Dave does.

17:29.181 --> 17:30.983 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

17:31.017 --> 17:33.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW CONTINETTI: It's true,
there has always
been this kind of critique of
conservatism

17:33.452 --> 17:37.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the non-interventionist,
the non-multicultural
view.

17:37.723 --> 17:41.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think the alt-right takes it a
degree further.

17:41.727 --> 17:45.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what you have that
unifies a lot of
these alt-righters on the
Internet is really

17:45.831 --> 17:48.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a disgust at the idea of
egalitarianism.

17:48.834 --> 17:51.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They do believe in hierarchies.

17:51.570 --> 17:52.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Some of them are racial.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They also believe in sexual
hierarchies.

17:54.307 --> 17:59.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, a lot of them kind of wave
the banner
of the men's rights movement.

17:59.979 --> 18:02.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so you start off from that
political conclusion.

18:02.315 --> 18:08.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And very quickly, when you read
the rhetoric,
it devolves into just outright
racism, outright

18:08.454 --> 18:10.222 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
misogyny.

18:10.256 --> 18:15.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So part of it starts with these
ideas of Sam
Francis, Joe Sobran, Pat
Buchanan, that have

18:15.227 --> 18:18.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been around since the end of the
Cold War,
really.

18:18.798 --> 18:24.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a lot now of it is now much
more visceral,
hatred of the mainstream
cultural movement

18:24.904 --> 18:30.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for embracing some version of
egalitarianism,
civil rights, equality of the
sexes.

18:30.910 --> 18:36.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, David, what is
the link, or
is there a link or is there a
connection between

18:36.282 --> 18:38.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Trump campaign and the
alt-right?

18:38.718 --> 18:41.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID WEIGEL: Well, there always
has been.

18:41.821 --> 18:48.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There been alt-right support for
Trump mostly
manifested online or even
sometimes the T-shirts

18:48.194 --> 18:49.595 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and signs you see at rallies.

18:49.628 --> 18:53.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There is a big alt-right
presence on sites
like 4chan and Reddit.

18:53.899 --> 18:56.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was good that Matt
mentioned the men's
rights movement.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You could mention Gamergate.

18:58.537 --> 19:01.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was kind of a gateway for a
lot of activists
who consider themselves
alt-right.

19:01.540 --> 19:03.909 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, they supported Trump in the
first place.

19:03.943 --> 19:09.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The more direction came when
Steve Bannon,
the CEO of Breitbart, became the
CEO of Trump's

19:09.715 --> 19:11.484 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

19:11.517 --> 19:16.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Breitbart, very, I think, in a
calculated
and then also in a natural way
became a forum

19:16.389 --> 19:21.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for alt-right thinking and
alt-right coverage,
coverage of politics the way
that those 4chan

19:21.494 --> 19:23.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Reddit people wanted it
covered.

19:23.796 --> 19:27.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's when this connection
became harder
to deny and when I think the
Clinton campaign

19:27.800 --> 19:29.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thought it was something to
exploit.

19:29.668 --> 19:34.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Matthew, what
does this mean
for the future of the
conservative movement?

19:34.273 --> 19:38.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW CONTINETTI: I think it's
one more
sign that conservatism as we
understand it

19:38.077 --> 19:42.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is coming under great strain
during the era
of Trump.

19:42.048 --> 19:47.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so you have all of these
criticisms of
the mainstream conservatism
represented by

19:47.053 --> 19:49.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William F. Buckley and Ronald
Reagan.

19:49.822 --> 19:53.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All these critics now feel
empowered with
the rise of Donald Trump.

19:53.659 --> 19:57.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anyone who had a bone to pick
with the George
W. Bush administration, with the
Republicans

19:57.363 --> 20:02.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Congress, with the editors of
National
Review, of The Weekly Standard
now says, Trump

20:02.334 --> 20:04.036 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is our guy.

20:04.070 --> 20:09.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump is going to be the agent
of change that
legitimates our somewhat fringe,
marginal

20:09.608 --> 20:10.743 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ideas.

20:10.776 --> 20:12.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Now, is there a large
constituency for these
ideas?

20:12.745 --> 20:14.513 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

20:14.547 --> 20:18.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you can find it on the
Internet, but
the danger for the conservative
mainstream

20:18.918 --> 20:24.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is to say, oh, all of a sudden,
since it's
on the Internet, maybe we need
to incorporate

20:24.423 --> 20:26.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it into our thinking.

20:26.759 --> 20:30.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As soon as that happens, I think
you're going
to find conservatism itself
illegitimated.

20:30.796 --> 20:37.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: You talk about the
days of William
F. Buckley, when he was sort of
the one who

20:37.937 --> 20:39.972 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
said who was a conservative.

20:40.005 --> 20:44.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does the conservative movement,
do you think,
bear any responsibility for the
emergence

20:44.076 --> 20:46.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of this sentiment, the
alt-right?

20:46.345 --> 20:48.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW CONTINETTI: I think it's
bottom-up,
really.

20:48.881 --> 20:53.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I don't think you had the
same gatekeepers
that you did in the earlier
media age, when

20:53.986 --> 20:58.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there were one or two
conservative magazines
that published biweekly or
monthly.

20:58.357 --> 21:00.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now we live in the Internet, and
it's the
Wild West.

21:00.926 --> 21:06.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anyone with an opinion, a
Twitter account,
a YouTube channel, they can
express themselves.

21:06.599 --> 21:09.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They can put these opinions into
the public
sphere.

21:09.401 --> 21:13.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we have found, much to
the surprise
of conservatives like myself,
is, there is

21:13.606 --> 21:18.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a large audience for this type
of rhetoric,
these types of ideas.

21:18.043 --> 21:23.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And also one thing that needs to
be mentioned
with the alt-right, they're kind
of cyber-bullies.

21:23.415 --> 21:28.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we saw, with the rise of
Trump in 2015,
groups of these advocates and
activists on

21:28.754 --> 21:35.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Twitter going after in many
cases Jewish conservatives
and calling them anti-Semitic
tropes.

21:35.194 --> 21:37.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is something that I think
is very ugly.

21:37.630 --> 21:42.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I worry for the future of
conservatism,
that it may displace the more
traditional

21:42.168 --> 21:47.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mainstream conservatism that
most Americans
think of when they think
conservatism for

21:47.373 --> 21:49.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the last 30 years.

21:49.275 --> 21:52.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: We should point out
that one of
the targets of Breitbart was
your father-in-law,

21:52.745 --> 21:55.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
William Kristol, who they went
after right
-- in a very...

21:55.548 --> 21:57.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW CONTINETTI: I wouldn't
like them anyway,
though.

21:57.783 --> 21:58.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

21:58.784 --> 21:59.818 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JOHN YANG: OK.

21:59.852 --> 22:04.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dave, what's the future of this
movement?

22:04.056 --> 22:08.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You say that they feel like this
is their
moment, with Donald Trump as the
nominee.

22:08.827 --> 22:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Regardless of what happens to
Donald Trump
in November, what's going to
happen to this

22:13.699 --> 22:15.434 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
movement?

22:15.467 --> 22:19.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WEIGEL: Well, the light at
the end of
the tunnel for a lot of
Republicans is, they

22:19.538 --> 22:20.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't think they're going to win
the election.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They think Trump will lose.

22:22.808 --> 22:26.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there will be an effort -- I
don't think
a cynical effort, I think in
part a sincere

22:26.879 --> 22:31.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
effort -- to say the reason he
lost is because
he embraced a lot of radical
ideas that can't

22:31.917 --> 22:35.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
win in America anymore, we need
to get rid
of those elements.

22:36.021 --> 22:40.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To key off what Matt was saying,
it wasn't
like they were part of the
conservative conversation,

22:40.526 --> 22:41.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the mainstream conversation
anyway.

22:41.660 --> 22:42.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They weren't writing for
National Review.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They weren't writing for The
Weekly Standard.

22:44.463 --> 22:48.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were always on the outs,
but I think
they will be actively ostracized
after the

22:48.267 --> 22:50.002 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

22:50.035 --> 22:52.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Dave Weigel, Matthew
Continetti,
thanks for helping us walk
through this.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATTHEW CONTINETTI: Thank you.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Thanks.

22:54.206 --> 22:58.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID WEIGEL: Thank you.

22:58.344 --> 23:06.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

23:07.019 --> 23:11.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": our
conversation
with Olympic star Katie Ledecky;
the national

23:11.924 --> 23:18.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parks turn 100 years old; and
Ms. Wheelchair
New York gives her take on
rethinking sex

23:18.163 --> 23:19.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and disabilities.

23:19.999 --> 23:25.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: Trade, globalization
and the impact
on wages and jobs are issues
that have spoken

23:25.070 --> 23:28.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strongly to voters throughout
this presidential
campaign.

23:28.307 --> 23:31.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both Donald Trump and Hillary
Clinton are
talking very differently about
the subject

23:31.910 --> 23:33.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than prior nominees.

23:33.646 --> 23:36.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for Trump, it's been a major
focus of
his campaign.

23:36.915 --> 23:40.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As part of our continuing
coverage of the
issues, our economics
correspondent, Paul

23:40.953 --> 23:44.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Solman, is spending the next
three weeks focused
on those questions.

23:44.690 --> 23:49.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight: how Donald Trump sees
it, and some
of the concerns about that
approach, part

23:49.461 --> 23:52.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of our weekly Making Sense
series, which airs
on Thursdays.

23:52.731 --> 23:55.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
China.

23:55.567 --> 23:56.535 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
China.

23:56.568 --> 23:57.536 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
China.

23:57.569 --> 23:58.537 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
China.

23:58.570 --> 23:59.538 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
China.

23:59.571 --> 24:00.539 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
China.

24:00.572 --> 24:01.607 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
China.

24:01.640 --> 24:02.608 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
China.

24:02.641 --> 24:03.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
China all the time.

24:03.642 --> 24:05.544 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
China.

24:05.577 --> 24:06.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Given Donald
Trump's persistently
pointed pivot to Asia, small
wonder that among

24:06.445 --> 24:08.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his favorite films is "Death by
China."

24:08.113 --> 24:13.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: China has stolen
thousands of our
factories and millions off our
jobs.

24:13.886 --> 24:20.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Multinational corporation
profits are soaring,
and we now owe over $3 trillion
to the world's

24:21.026 --> 24:23.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
largest communist nation.

24:23.062 --> 24:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And small wonder
the film's writer/director,
Peter Navarro, sounds like the
candidate.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO, Writer/Director,
"Death by
China": We're going right down
the toilet,

24:29.468 --> 24:31.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and it's a made-in-China toilet.

24:31.370 --> 24:35.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Navarro, a
Harvard-trained professor
at University of California,
Irvine, is the

24:35.941 --> 24:38.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sole Trump economic adviser with
a Ph.D.

24:38.977 --> 24:41.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So how'd you get interested in
and worried
about China?

24:41.146 --> 24:42.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: I teach MBAs.

24:42.948 --> 24:47.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I noticed, starting a few
years after
China joined the World Trade
Organization,

24:47.820 --> 24:50.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that a lot of my students were
no longer employed.

24:50.489 --> 24:53.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were still coming to get
their MBA, but
they'd lost their jobs.

24:53.359 --> 24:55.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I started to ask questions
why.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, at that point, all roads
were leading
to Beijing.

24:57.496 --> 25:02.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Navarro has done
plenty of technical
work in economics, is a pioneer
in online

25:02.768 --> 25:03.902 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
learning.

25:03.936 --> 25:06.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he began focusing on China
just a few
years ago.

25:06.271 --> 25:11.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: The defining
moment in American
economic history is when Bill
Clinton lobbied

25:11.377 --> 25:13.779 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to get China into the World
Trade Organization.

25:13.812 --> 25:20.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was the worst political and
economic mistake
in American history in the last
100 years.

25:20.619 --> 25:21.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In the last 100
years?

25:21.920 --> 25:23.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: In the last 100
years, yes.

25:23.622 --> 25:28.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China went into the World Trade
Organization
and agreed to play by certain
rules.

25:28.360 --> 25:34.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, they are illegally
subsidizing their
exports, manipulating their
currency, stealing

25:34.066 --> 25:39.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
all of our intellectual
property, using sweatshops,
using pollution havens.

25:39.571 --> 25:43.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What happens is, our businesses
and workers
are playing that game with two
hands tied

25:43.709 --> 25:45.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
behind their back.

25:45.077 --> 25:47.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Navarro says you
can even see
the effects at U.C.

25:47.513 --> 25:53.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Irvine, where, he says, Chinese
students,
paying triple the in-state
tuition rate, are

25:53.719 --> 25:58.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
displacing native Californians,
while the
Chinese parents are scooping up
local real

25:58.624 --> 25:59.591 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
estate.

25:59.625 --> 26:01.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: Generally all
cash deals.

26:01.427 --> 26:06.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So your argument
is, unfair trade
practices, they amass dollars,
they bring

26:06.632 --> 26:10.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the dollars back here, they buy
up property,
and they drive up real estate
prices?

26:10.569 --> 26:11.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: That's right.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they drive up rents for
younger people.

26:13.305 --> 26:16.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will drive up home prices
for first-time
homebuyers.

26:16.074 --> 26:18.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it's not just that we're
losing jobs and
factories.

26:18.644 --> 26:21.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're giving away our homes, our
businesses,
our companies, our technologies.

26:21.647 --> 26:27.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But, of course, we
heard the
same alarm about Japan in the
1980s, a false

26:27.219 --> 26:28.320 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
alarm.

26:28.353 --> 26:32.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But China is different, says
Navarro, so much
bigger.

26:32.057 --> 26:38.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We are going to
enforce all
trade violations against any
country that

26:38.664 --> 26:40.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cheats.

26:40.599 --> 26:45.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So one of the
answers your candidate,
Donald Trump, provides is that
we should have

26:45.771 --> 26:48.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
protective tariffs on Chinese
goods.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: Wrong word.

26:49.174 --> 26:50.142 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Wrong word.

26:50.175 --> 26:51.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: What's wrong?

26:51.276 --> 26:54.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: Donald Trump is
not a protectionist.

26:54.346 --> 26:59.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All he wants to do is defend
America against
unfair trade practices.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Well, defend,
protect.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: Very different.

27:03.522 --> 27:05.491 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trade is good.

27:05.524 --> 27:11.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tariffs and the threat of
tariffs are a negotiating
tool to require countries like
China to stop

27:11.497 --> 27:12.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their unfair trade practices.

27:12.831 --> 27:14.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's the mission.

27:14.600 --> 27:21.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And how much do you
imagine it
might cost in the increase in
the price of

27:21.106 --> 27:22.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
goods at, say, Wal-Mart?

27:22.908 --> 27:29.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: Any increase
would be less
than the paycheck that all these
people would

27:30.015 --> 27:34.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be getting, both in terms of
actually having
a job, plus wages rising again.

27:34.720 --> 27:37.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: If the jobs
actually were to
come back, that is.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: The Trump trade
doctrine is
this.

27:39.825 --> 27:45.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America will trade with any
country, so long
as that deal meets these three
criterion:

27:45.531 --> 27:51.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You increase the GDP growth
rate, you decrease
the trade deficit, and you
strengthen the

27:51.069 --> 27:52.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
manufacturing base.

27:52.938 --> 27:58.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: But isn't
technology responsible
for the elimination of American
factory jobs?

27:58.744 --> 28:06.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PETER NAVARRO: Certainly
technology has played
a part, but the dramatic change
from five-and-a-half

28:06.685 --> 28:13.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decades of 3.5 percent rate of
growth prior
to China entering our markets
with illegally

28:13.425 --> 28:19.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
subsidized goods and the 1.8
percent afterwards
suggests strongly that China has
played an

28:19.965 --> 28:23.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
enormous role in the decline and
downfall
of the American economy.

28:23.602 --> 28:26.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I can show on a blackboard
exactly why.

28:26.939 --> 28:30.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Now, your typical
economist would
hardly agree.

28:30.676 --> 28:36.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, hey, says Navarro, your
typical economist
still believes in the old
so-called Keynesian

28:36.548 --> 28:38.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
approach to reviving the
economy.

28:38.617 --> 28:42.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: Alright, Paul,
the growth of
any nation is simply four
things.

28:42.754 --> 28:48.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: More consumption,
C., by consumers
and more G, government spending.

28:48.427 --> 28:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He and Trump, however, will
supposedly flip
the script, stimulating more I,
Investment,

28:54.933 --> 29:00.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by business, via tax cuts for
the wealthy
and corporations, while boosting
net exports

29:00.272 --> 29:02.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
through new trade deals.

29:02.174 --> 29:03.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's exports minus imports.

29:03.642 --> 29:05.510 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: That's right.

29:05.544 --> 29:10.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And, of course, if
that's a negative
number, that is, you have more
imports than

29:10.115 --> 29:11.083 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
exports.

29:11.116 --> 29:12.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: This is the big
kahuna.

29:12.150 --> 29:14.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is what Donald Trump
understands.

29:14.119 --> 29:15.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is the trade deficit.

29:15.621 --> 29:19.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We run a trade deficit of close
to $800 billion
a year.

29:19.424 --> 29:22.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so this directly subtracts
from this.

29:22.961 --> 29:25.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is why we're stuck in
low-growth mode.

29:25.063 --> 29:26.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Well, maybe.

29:26.598 --> 29:29.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The job of a journalist,
however, is to ask
questions.

29:29.401 --> 29:31.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is U.S. GDP 2016?

29:31.870 --> 29:33.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COMPUTER VOICE: Checking on
that.

29:33.605 --> 29:36.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Happily, there's
now Siri to
answer them.

29:36.041 --> 29:39.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COMPUTER VOICE: It looks like
the answer is
about 18.2 trillion U.S. dollars
per year.

29:39.811 --> 29:41.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Thank you, Siri.

29:42.014 --> 29:49.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In that case, GDP is something
like $18 trillion,
right?

29:49.221 --> 29:57.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you're saying that the trade
deficit is
-- well, it's less than $1
trillion, right?

29:57.162 --> 30:02.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this can't be a major factor
in total
GDP, the size of the economy.

30:02.834 --> 30:07.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: Yes, but when we
run these
big trade deficits and send our
jobs offshore,

30:07.105 --> 30:10.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we hold our wages down and our
income down.

30:10.242 --> 30:14.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That feeds right back into the
biggest part
of this whole equation,
consumption.

30:14.379 --> 30:16.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This drags GDP down as well.

30:16.114 --> 30:18.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Or so this story
goes.

30:18.250 --> 30:24.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you hear the criticism
about Donald Trump's
own goods being made in other
countries, what's

30:24.256 --> 30:25.223 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your reaction?

30:25.257 --> 30:26.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: Do me a favor.

30:26.391 --> 30:28.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Play Dan Slane's clip in my
"Death by China"
movie.

30:28.593 --> 30:30.429 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's priceless.

30:30.462 --> 30:34.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Slane was a plywood
manufacturer
in Bowling Green, Kentucky,
whose competitors

30:34.299 --> 30:36.001 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
moved to China.

30:36.034 --> 30:38.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN SLANE, Business Owner: And I
opened up
three factories in China and
delivered to

30:38.904 --> 30:43.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the customer in the United
States 50 percent
cheaper than I could make it in
Bowling Green.

30:43.508 --> 30:47.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: He winds up
selling product
back here into the U.S. at cost.

30:47.546 --> 30:49.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How did he make his money?

30:49.414 --> 30:54.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN SLANE: Every month, the
Chinese government
would send me a check for 17
percent of my

30:54.119 --> 30:57.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exports, and that was my net
margin and my
profit.

30:57.622 --> 31:00.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, is Donald Trump
getting checks
from the Chinese government?

31:00.826 --> 31:01.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: That's how the
game works.

31:01.927 --> 31:05.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But he could use
American companies.

31:05.764 --> 31:11.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are lots of people who
actually say
made in USA and use that as a
marketing tool.

31:11.937 --> 31:13.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: The point here
is, he can't.

31:13.839 --> 31:21.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The competitive forces that
force a Dan Slane
to take his furniture company to
China, they're

31:21.079 --> 31:22.848 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
real, OK?

31:22.881 --> 31:27.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you try and take the high
ground and
produce here in America, when
China's dumping

31:27.452 --> 31:31.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
product in and manipulating
their currency,
you go out of business.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.024 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You just go out of business.

31:33.058 --> 31:38.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: What about the
character issues
that surround Donald Trump?

31:38.663 --> 31:42.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: Well, look, I
don't go there.

31:42.801 --> 31:44.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I focus on policy.

31:44.669 --> 31:46.004 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's my job.

31:46.037 --> 31:49.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And you have no
problem with
the failed companies?

31:49.407 --> 31:54.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO: No one should be
surprised
just because somebody isn't
successful 100

31:54.346 --> 31:55.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
percent of the time.

31:55.580 --> 31:59.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The percent here, he's a
billionaire.

31:59.518 --> 32:01.219 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's successful.

32:01.253 --> 32:07.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And no matter how
much money
he actually has or hasn't got,
given that

32:07.692 --> 32:12.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump is the Republican
candidate for
president of the United States,
no can argue

32:12.931 --> 32:17.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that he isn't successful -- to
date, at least.

32:17.502 --> 32:23.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
"NewsHour" economics
correspondent Paul Solman,
reporting from Irvine,
California.

32:23.341 --> 32:28.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And next week,
Paul will
look at Hillary Clinton's
approach to trade,

32:28.280 --> 32:41.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and how she has changed over
time.

32:41.326 --> 32:45.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now a conversation with one of
the biggest
stars of this summer's Olympics,
Gold medal-winning

32:45.764 --> 32:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
swimmer Katie Ledecky, about
what's behind
her success.

32:49.034 --> 32:51.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Margaret Warner sat down with
her earlier
today.

32:51.203 --> 32:57.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: She's been
likened to a Lamborghini,
to a hard-charging swimming
machine.

32:57.042 --> 33:03.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Katie Ledecky, the freestyle
phenom, won five
medals in Rio, four gold, one
silver.

33:03.748 --> 33:06.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Also remarkable is her dominance
in her sport.

33:06.751 --> 33:12.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this 800-meter race in Rio,
for example,
her closest competitor was
nearly a pool-length

33:12.491 --> 33:14.593 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
away.

33:14.626 --> 33:20.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ledecky's Olympic debut came at
age 15 in
the 2012 London Games, when she
defeated the

33:20.599 --> 33:24.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
favorite, a British gold
medalist, to win
the 800.

33:24.336 --> 33:28.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now 19, she repeatedly breaks
world records,
usually her own.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

33:30.642 --> 33:35.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Ledecky is
known not just
for her relentless training,
more than four

33:35.547 --> 33:40.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
hours a day, but for her
friendliness, calm
and modesty.

33:40.986 --> 33:44.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amid the celebrations since her
return to
Washington, last night, she
threw out the

33:44.823 --> 33:47.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first pitch at the Washington
Nationals Game.

33:47.626 --> 33:50.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Oh, great pitch.

33:50.262 --> 33:57.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Now she's
taking an unusual
path for such a proven winner,
retain her

33:57.402 --> 34:03.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amateur status, attend Stanford
this fall,
and pass for the moment on
millions of dollars

34:03.208 --> 34:05.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of endorsement deals.

34:05.277 --> 34:09.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We got together today at the
pool where she
competed in high school, Stone
Ridge School

34:09.981 --> 34:13.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the Sacred Heart in Bethesda,
Maryland.

34:13.618 --> 34:14.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Katie Ledecky, welcome.

34:14.619 --> 34:15.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you for joining us.

34:15.854 --> 34:17.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATIE LEDECKY, U.S. Olympic Gold
Medal Winner:
Thank you.

34:17.389 --> 34:19.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Or letting us
join you at
your old stomping ground here.

34:19.691 --> 34:24.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Something that struck me
watching you swim,
but also out of the pool, is
just this joy

34:24.262 --> 34:25.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you seem to radiate.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KATIE LEDECKY: I have always
loved swimming.

34:27.732 --> 34:31.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I started swimming when I was 6
years old
for a summer league swim team.

34:31.503 --> 34:35.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they made it really fun
right from day
one.

34:35.240 --> 34:36.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I never really looked back.

34:36.908 --> 34:41.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I started swimming year-round,
and did it
with my family, with my friends,
and just

34:41.947 --> 34:44.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have gotten to meet so many
great people through
swimming.

34:44.149 --> 34:47.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: And I was
surprised to see
that, in 2012, when you went to
the Olympic

34:47.419 --> 34:53.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
training camp, they gave you
some elite athlete
tests just on your physical
abilities.

34:53.124 --> 34:55.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it came back saying
remarkably unremarkable.

34:55.126 --> 34:56.094 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

34:56.127 --> 34:57.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: What does that
mean?

34:57.529 --> 35:02.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KATIE LEDECKY: I'm not
ridiculously tall for
swimmers.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't have very big hands.

35:04.769 --> 35:07.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't have very big feet,
nothing really
unusual.

35:07.672 --> 35:11.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's just been hard work
that's gotten
me to where I am today.

35:11.376 --> 35:13.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It wasn't a lot of talent,
really.

35:13.778 --> 35:19.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was more getting through the
work and setting
some big goals that has gotten
me to this

35:19.751 --> 35:20.719 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
point.

35:20.752 --> 35:21.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Do you enjoy
working hard?

35:21.753 --> 35:23.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KATIE LEDECKY: I do.

35:23.154 --> 35:26.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's fun when you get to do
it with some
of your best friends.

35:26.558 --> 35:27.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's what I have loved.

35:28.026 --> 35:32.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have just loved setting big
goals and trying
to reach towards them.

35:32.063 --> 35:36.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, a couple of years ago, my
coach, Bruce
Gemmell, and I sat down and set
some goals.

35:36.601 --> 35:41.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at the time, they seemed
pretty big, but
I reached them all in Rio, and
that's the

35:41.973 --> 35:43.675 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
best feeling.

35:43.708 --> 35:46.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: And the goals
are about not
beating someone else, but about
times.

35:46.711 --> 35:48.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KATIE LEDECKY: Right.

35:48.480 --> 35:55.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My goals for Rio were to go 3:56
or better
in the 400 free, and I went
3:56, to go 8:05

35:55.854 --> 35:59.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or better in the 800 free, and I
went 8:04.

35:59.457 --> 36:01.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then the third goal was to
win the 200
free.

36:01.693 --> 36:02.727 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And I did that.

36:02.761 --> 36:05.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I matched all my goals.

36:05.597 --> 36:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at the time, three years
ago, those seemed
pretty far out there.

36:09.234 --> 36:12.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: To what degree
are you competing
with others vs. yourself?

36:12.437 --> 36:18.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE LEDECKY: You are always
racing against
the other swimmers, but I always
try to just

36:18.043 --> 36:20.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
focus on what I'm doing and how
I want to
swim my races.

36:20.812 --> 36:23.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Are you
checking out what's
going on in the other lanes?

36:23.581 --> 36:25.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KATIE LEDECKY: I sometimes do.

36:25.150 --> 36:27.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And if I'm ahead, I can
sometimes tell.

36:28.019 --> 36:33.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It might mean I'm having a good
swim, but
pretty much, I'm just focused on
how fast

36:33.658 --> 36:38.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm going, how fast I'm feeling,
and pretty
much block everything out, the
sounds, the

36:38.730 --> 36:42.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sights, just kind of listen to
the rhythm
of the water, and just
maintaining the same

36:42.834 --> 36:47.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stroke, the same rhythm, the
same tempo, and
thinking about how I want to get
my hand to

36:47.839 --> 36:49.607 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the wall.

36:49.641 --> 36:52.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: David Marsh,
who is the coach
of the whole U.S. team, Olympic
team, said

36:52.377 --> 36:58.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you had an intensity that he'd
never seen
in a distance athlete, and that
you were fearless.

36:58.216 --> 37:02.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another coach of yours said
that, put you
at the beginning of a race, and
you're like

37:02.387 --> 37:05.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a bull in a stall waiting to get
out.

37:05.290 --> 37:06.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where does that come from?

37:06.925 --> 37:08.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KATIE LEDECKY: I don't know.

37:08.960 --> 37:13.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think I have always loved the
competitiveness
of swimming.

37:13.064 --> 37:17.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have just had that outlet
from since
I was 6 years old.

37:18.002 --> 37:21.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think it's something
that's developed
over time, too.

37:21.106 --> 37:26.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As I have gotten faster and I
have come down
to some of the shorter races,
the sprint events,

37:26.544 --> 37:31.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have always just tried to have
that mind-set
of attacking each race and
really treating

37:31.516 --> 37:35.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
each race, no matter how long it
is, as a
true race.

37:35.153 --> 37:38.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: And that's why
you don't
pace yourself, the way a lot of
coaches would

37:38.089 --> 37:39.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
advise you to do?

37:39.090 --> 37:40.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KATIE LEDECKY: Right.

37:40.091 --> 37:41.192 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

37:41.226 --> 37:43.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I like to think of it more as
racing than
pacing.

37:43.161 --> 37:45.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: A lot of top
athletes, especially
when they reach even near the
pinnacle you

37:45.997 --> 37:50.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have, talk about the pressure
they feel, and
that they feel anxiety to
perform.

37:50.835 --> 37:52.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do you ever feel that?

37:52.871 --> 37:54.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KATIE LEDECKY: No, I don't.

37:54.706 --> 38:00.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I always just focus on what my
own goals are,
and not what anybody else's
goals for me are

38:00.378 --> 38:02.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or their expectations.

38:02.147 --> 38:06.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just know that my family will
always be
supporting me and my friends and
my coaches.

38:06.317 --> 38:10.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as long as I put in the hard
work and
know that I'm giving it my best
effort, I

38:10.822 --> 38:12.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will always be happy.

38:12.624 --> 38:16.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: There is a lot
of comment
about your swimming style, and
that your coach

38:16.828 --> 38:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at, what were you, at 12 or 13
changed your
style, so that you could swim
really more

38:21.666 --> 38:23.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like Michael Phelps.

38:23.168 --> 38:24.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's been called a half-gallop.

38:24.569 --> 38:27.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Explain that is and what
advantage it gives
you.

38:27.038 --> 38:31.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE LEDECKY: Yes, it's kind of
a stroke
we found is the most efficient
for me.

38:31.843 --> 38:34.445 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's the fastest stroke for
me.

38:34.479 --> 38:38.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I think it was just
utilizing my strength
to the best.

38:38.049 --> 38:39.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But what does
it consist
of?

38:39.851 --> 38:46.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE LEDECKY: It's just more of
a loping
stroke, and it's using my kick
more than most

38:46.057 --> 38:47.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
female distance swimmers use.

38:47.926 --> 38:53.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I'm just kicking a lot more
and getting
a lot of power out of my hips
and out of my

38:53.631 --> 38:54.599 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stroke.

38:54.632 --> 38:57.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I have a really good catch
with my arms.

38:57.535 --> 38:59.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it's just kind of putting
all those
things together.

38:59.737 --> 39:03.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Now, you have
always, recently,
practiced with men.

39:03.541 --> 39:08.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one male athlete said that
other male
athletes were actually "broken"
-- quote,

39:08.613 --> 39:10.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unquote -- by having to swim
against you.

39:10.782 --> 39:12.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How did you feel about that?

39:12.917 --> 39:15.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATIE LEDECKY: I don't really
pay attention
to it.

39:15.286 --> 39:20.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just -- you know, when there
is a swimmer
next to me, I try to race that
swimmer, no

39:20.692 --> 39:21.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
matter the gender.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, you know, I try to give the
guys a run.

39:24.028 --> 39:25.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They need someone to push them,
too.

39:26.030 --> 39:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it helps me, and hopefully
it helps them
as well.

39:28.666 --> 39:30.468 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

39:30.501 --> 39:34.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: There was also
a lot of commentary
during the Olympics about sexist
comments

39:34.239 --> 39:37.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they were seeing about female
athletes.

39:37.742 --> 39:42.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the examples was the
commentators
who said Katie Ledecky swims
like a man.

39:42.413 --> 39:44.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Did you found that sexist or
offensive?

39:44.582 --> 39:48.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE LEDECKY: Well, I think
Rowdy Gaines
actually said something like:
Katie Ledecky

39:48.219 --> 39:49.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
doesn't swim like a man.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.722 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She swims like Katie Ledecky.

39:50.755 --> 39:53.324 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that was a good comment.

39:53.358 --> 39:55.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I swim the way I swim.

39:55.727 --> 40:01.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I take it as a compliment
when somebody
says I swim like a man, because,
as you said,

40:01.366 --> 40:06.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my stroke is kind of taken after
what some
of the male freestylers have
done.

40:06.404 --> 40:09.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I'm just trying to go as
fast as I can
go.

40:09.941 --> 40:11.209 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

40:11.242 --> 40:13.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: So, now you're
onto Stanford,
NCAA swimming.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.046 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You're not going professional.

40:15.079 --> 40:20.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have heard estimates from $5
million to
$15 million you could be making
a year.

40:20.585 --> 40:21.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Did you even consider that?

40:22.020 --> 40:23.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What went into your decision not
to go pro?

40:23.621 --> 40:25.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATIE LEDECKY: No, I didn't
consider it at
all, really.

40:25.823 --> 40:29.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have always wanted to swim
collegiately
and have that experience.

40:29.527 --> 40:31.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I can't wait to be a part of
the Stanford
team.

40:31.729 --> 40:36.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I can't wait to just be
swimming with
them and going to class with
them and enjoying

40:36.167 --> 40:38.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that whole experience.

40:38.036 --> 40:40.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: So, if a
6-year-old or 7-year-old
or 8-year-old girl were watching
you in the

40:40.938 --> 40:45.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Rio Olympics and said to
herself, I want to
be the next Katie Ledecky, what
advice would

40:45.410 --> 40:47.211 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you give her?

40:47.245 --> 40:50.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE LEDECKY: Yes, I would
encourage her
to set some big goals, because I
never dreamed

40:50.848 --> 40:53.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would go to the Olympics when
I was 6, 7
or 8 years old.

40:53.985 --> 40:56.187 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I just started setting goals.

40:56.220 --> 41:00.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all of a sudden, when I was
14 years old,
my next goal was to make the
Olympics.

41:01.025 --> 41:04.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I never imagined it.

41:04.329 --> 41:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I never imagined I would
come away with
medals and be able to travel the
world and

41:09.033 --> 41:10.168 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
swim.

41:10.201 --> 41:12.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's been such a great
experience.

41:12.570 --> 41:17.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I hope that young girls will
have that
dream and will have experiences.

41:17.108 --> 41:18.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it might not be in swimming.

41:18.209 --> 41:19.644 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It might be in something else.

41:19.677 --> 41:22.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I found a passion, and I
love it.

41:22.213 --> 41:23.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's something I love and
something I enjoy.

41:23.881 --> 41:25.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's something I'm good at.

41:25.483 --> 41:28.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's what I have been able
to give 100
percent to.

41:28.720 --> 41:31.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Well, Katie,
you're certainly
an inspiration to that young
girl and all

41:31.823 --> 41:32.790 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of us.

41:32.824 --> 41:33.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KATIE LEDECKY: Thanks.

41:33.825 --> 41:34.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Thank you so
much.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KATIE LEDECKY: Thank you.

41:36.260 --> 41:38.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One Olympic
postscript of
a very different tone.

41:38.096 --> 41:44.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Late today, Brazilian police
charged American
swimmer Ryan Lochte with filing
a false police

41:44.068 --> 41:45.770 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
report.

41:45.803 --> 41:47.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Lochte said he and three
teammates were robbed
at gunpoint during the Rio
Olympics.

41:47.905 --> 41:50.742 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Brazilian police said no such
crime took place.

41:50.775 --> 42:00.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Investigators have asked that
Lochte be deposed
in the United States.

42:00.818 --> 42:07.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Investigators have asked that
Lochte be deposed
in the United States.

42:07.225 --> 42:11.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was 100 years ago today that
President
Woodrow Wilson signed what was
called the

42:11.429 --> 42:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Organic Act, creating the
National Park Service.

42:15.433 --> 42:17.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown takes our
Bookshelf outdoors.

42:17.402 --> 42:23.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Terry Tempest
Williams, author,
naturalist and environmental
activist, grew

42:23.274 --> 42:25.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
up in Utah surrounded by
national parks.

42:25.743 --> 42:28.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TERRY TEMPEST WILLIAMS, Author,
"The Hour
of Land": They were our
backyard.

42:28.246 --> 42:32.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with our family business,
laying pipe
in the American West, it was
this wonderful

42:32.383 --> 42:37.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
juxtaposition between intrusion
in the land
and protected land.

42:37.255 --> 42:39.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The story of the
land, right?

42:39.090 --> 42:43.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TERRY TEMPEST WILLIAMS: So, I
feel like the
American West is in my bones in
the deepest

42:43.428 --> 42:45.163 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

42:45.196 --> 42:50.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I also felt conflicted at a
really young
age, because I saw my father, my
uncle, my

42:50.968 --> 42:54.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
grandfather, my brothers digging
trenches
in the land.

42:54.172 --> 42:57.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And yet I saw prairie dogs on
the side of
the trenches.

42:57.175 --> 43:04.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my impulse was to protect
them from the
very destruction that was
putting food around

43:04.215 --> 43:05.950 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our table..

43:05.983 --> 43:09.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One hundred years
since the
creation of the National Park
Service, the

43:09.420 --> 43:14.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
contradictions and controversies
over America's
public lands continue.

43:14.892 --> 43:19.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is no denying the
popularity of
the parks themselves, Great
Smoky Mountains

43:19.831 --> 43:27.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the East, Yosemite in the
West, Yellowstone,
the oldest park, established in
1872, and

43:27.672 --> 43:34.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so many more, large and small,
natural landscapes
and historic monuments, some 412
parks and

43:34.912 --> 43:36.747 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sites in all.

43:36.781 --> 43:42.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And attendance records continue
to be broken,
with more than 300 million
visits last year.

43:42.987 --> 43:47.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In "The Hour of Land," a Terry
Tempest Williams,
who still lives in Utah, has
written part

43:47.892 --> 43:52.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
natural history, part memoir,
part call for
preservation.

43:52.530 --> 43:57.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We talked at Great Falls Park, a
small, but
dramatically beautiful National
Park Service

43:57.301 --> 44:03.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
site just 15 miles from
Washington, D.C.,
with the Potomac River crashing
over and through

44:03.774 --> 44:07.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rock formations and turkey
vultures hovering
overhead.

44:07.545 --> 44:11.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what happens to you when you
go out into
a park?

44:11.516 --> 44:13.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TERRY TEMPEST WILLIAMS: The
miraculous.

44:13.818 --> 44:14.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The miraculous?

44:14.819 --> 44:15.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Nothing less than that, huh?

44:15.820 --> 44:16.754 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TERRY TEMPEST WILLIAMS: I mean
superlatives.

44:16.787 --> 44:18.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is about superlatives.

44:18.523 --> 44:24.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just seeing this, all of a
sudden, you say,
OK, I remember what matters, and
I am very,

44:24.428 --> 44:26.130 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very small.

44:26.163 --> 44:32.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, humor returns,
deep breathing
returns, and that sense of
affection.

44:32.036 --> 44:34.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You go to all the
different
parks.

44:34.105 --> 44:35.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You tell their stories.

44:35.907 --> 44:41.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we see that a lot of the
issues of today
have been there forever, right,
whose land

44:41.279 --> 44:44.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is it, the local vs. national
governance of
the land.

44:44.448 --> 44:52.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TERRY TEMPEST WILLIAMS: I
thought I -- in
the beginning, Jeff, I thought I
was writing

44:52.657 --> 44:55.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a book about our national parks.

44:55.793 --> 44:58.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It became very clear to me it
was a book about
America in...

44:58.896 --> 45:00.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: More than the
parks themselves?

45:00.765 --> 45:04.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TERRY TEMPEST WILLIAMS: I think
so, because
they are the soul of our
country.

45:04.869 --> 45:07.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are a reservoir for our
spirit.

45:07.572 --> 45:15.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are not only memory
palaces for each
of us, but they really do hold
our stories,

45:15.079 --> 45:20.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not just one story, but multiple
stories,
diverse stories.

45:20.251 --> 45:27.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the gift of this for
me has been,
what story are we choosing to
tell?

45:27.325 --> 45:29.594 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What stories aren't we telling?

45:29.627 --> 45:33.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's been the power of
"The Hour of
Land" for me.

45:33.864 --> 45:39.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One continuing
story pits energy
development vs. preservation.

45:39.203 --> 45:44.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Terry Tempest Williams describes
in personal
terms a visit several years ago
to the Theodore

45:44.208 --> 45:47.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Roosevelt National Park in North
Dakota with
her father.

45:47.511 --> 45:49.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TERRY TEMPEST WILLIAMS: We fell
in love with
it.

45:49.547 --> 45:55.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We also saw in that viewshed oil
and gas development.

45:55.319 --> 45:59.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We went to see the Bakken oil
fields when
it was at its peak.

45:59.123 --> 46:00.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

46:00.191 --> 46:02.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TERRY TEMPEST WILLIAMS: My
father was shattered.

46:02.059 --> 46:08.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He turned to me and said: "This
is too pretty
of a landscape for oil and gas
development."

46:08.299 --> 46:12.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was my father, who would
tell you he's
very proud of the scars that
he's created

46:12.837 --> 46:14.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on the American landscape.

46:14.972 --> 46:20.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is little my father and I
would agree
on politically, but come to a
national park,

46:20.978 --> 46:25.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and that is our common ground.

46:25.883 --> 46:30.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's the one that gave me
this sense of
place, this ethic of place.

46:30.721 --> 46:38.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Do you see a way
to balance
the needs of preservation and
economic development?

46:38.429 --> 46:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TERRY TEMPEST WILLIAMS: I live
in a state
where national monuments and
parks were fought

46:42.099 --> 46:43.968 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
over.

46:44.001 --> 46:49.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now they are the economic engine
that is keeping
rural Utah alive.

46:49.407 --> 46:56.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's in our history, whether
it's Grand
Teton National Park, whether
it's Grand Staircase

46:56.313 --> 46:58.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
National Monument.

46:58.649 --> 47:04.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
History shows us that it has
always been a
prudent, beautiful decision.

47:04.955 --> 47:11.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And 300 million visits in our
national parks
system, I think, celebrates that
idea.

47:11.062 --> 47:14.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Three hundred
million visits
also brings up the notion that
we hear about

47:14.732 --> 47:17.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today of the parks being loved
to death.

47:17.168 --> 47:18.135 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

47:18.169 --> 47:19.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's another issue for today's
parks.

47:19.370 --> 47:20.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TERRY TEMPEST WILLIAMS: I think
it shows us
our need.

47:20.838 --> 47:22.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think it shows us our void.

47:22.673 --> 47:27.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You and I both know that, yes,
in Yellowstone,
it's not bumper to bumper.

47:27.978 --> 47:29.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's chest to back.

47:29.714 --> 47:34.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you're a half-a-mile off
the beaten
path, you're in a very, very
wild place.

47:34.351 --> 47:38.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What is your
hope, then, for
the next 100 years for the
national parks?

47:38.823 --> 47:43.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TERRY TEMPEST WILLIAMS: It's
very difficult
to establish a national park.

47:43.427 --> 47:47.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's going to be even
more difficult
to keep them.

47:47.331 --> 47:52.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think we, as citizens of
this country,
have to fight for them.

47:52.069 --> 47:55.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we have to make sure
that the public
lands stay public.

47:55.806 --> 47:58.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think we have to love
them.

47:58.242 --> 48:03.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And each of us, with the gifts
that are ours,
I think we have to give those
gifts up in

48:03.047 --> 48:10.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the name of community, to think
beyond our
own species, to think about
grizzlies.

48:10.755 --> 48:17.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do we really want them delisted,
to think
about these black vultures,
their power, their

48:17.194 --> 48:25.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
foreboding, powerful, beautiful
presence,
that we too will die, and they
will pick our

48:25.402 --> 48:27.371 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bones.

48:27.404 --> 48:28.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
These are not political issues.

48:29.006 --> 48:31.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ultimately, I think they are
spiritual issues.

48:32.009 --> 48:34.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this is where the spirit of
America dwells.

48:34.912 --> 48:38.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Terry Tempest
Williams, thank
you so much.

48:38.916 --> 48:41.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TERRY TEMPEST WILLIAMS: Thank
you.

48:41.218 --> 48:45.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In honor of
this year's
centennial, high school students
from across

48:45.189 --> 48:49.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:66.67% size:87.5%
the country who are
participating in the
"NewsHour"'s
Student Reporting Labs program
will be heading

48:49.627 --> 48:54.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the canyons and mountains of
their local
parks to tell stories they
discover about

48:54.265 --> 48:56.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our shared lands.

48:56.100 --> 49:00.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The young journalists are part
of a STEM reporting
initiative funded by the
National Science

49:00.070 --> 49:01.438 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Foundation.

49:01.472 --> 49:04.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more information, visit
@reportinglabs
on Twitter and Facebook.

49:04.241 --> 49:14.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We look forward to seeing their
stories in
the coming year.

49:14.285 --> 49:21.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We look forward to seeing their
stories in
the coming year.

49:21.692 --> 49:24.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now to another in our Brief
But Spectacular
series.

49:24.328 --> 49:27.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tonight, Danielle Sheypuk on
stigmas and disabilities.

49:27.798 --> 49:33.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A former Ms. Wheelchair New
York, she is also
a psychologist who specializes
in relationships

49:33.571 --> 49:36.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and sexuality among those with
disabilities.

49:36.207 --> 49:38.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a warning: The subject
matter is for a
mature audience.

49:38.609 --> 49:40.377 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

49:40.411 --> 49:44.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIELLE SHEYPUK, Clinical
Psychologist: I
am a clinical psychologist and a
runway model.

49:44.148 --> 49:47.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have spinal muscular atrophy
type 2.

49:47.751 --> 49:49.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was born this way.

49:49.486 --> 49:53.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I'm sure we could cut to
pictures of me right
now as a kid looking cute.

49:53.157 --> 49:56.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we're going to cut back to
me.

49:56.060 --> 50:02.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's focus on sex, intimacy,
relationships,and
disability.

50:02.399 --> 50:09.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Can you handle it?

50:09.540 --> 50:16.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I joke a lot that I'm Ms.
Wheelchair New York
by night and clinical
psychologist by day.

50:16.747 --> 50:18.382 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm on Tinder.

50:18.415 --> 50:20.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm out there dating.

50:20.284 --> 50:26.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It really supplements what I do
as a clinician,
because I know exactly what my
patients with

50:26.223 --> 50:28.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
disabilities encounter.

50:28.759 --> 50:34.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People have asked me many times
online dating,
can you function sexually?

50:34.999 --> 50:38.002 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I always answer back, yes.

50:38.035 --> 50:39.770 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Can you?

50:39.803 --> 50:43.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I remember, when I first moved
to New York
and started dating, I was just,
you know,

50:43.974 --> 50:52.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
being rejected, having
inappropriate questions
asked about me, like, oh, hi,
what's your

50:52.683 --> 50:53.617 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
name?

50:53.651 --> 50:55.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Oh, can you have sex?

50:55.552 --> 50:59.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, you really don't start
out conversations
like that.

50:59.089 --> 51:03.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem lies in the fact
that we don't
see a lot of people with
disability in the

51:03.594 --> 51:05.329 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
media.

51:05.362 --> 51:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One night, I got a call from my
friend who
said: Hey, I found this pageant
online, the

51:09.733 --> 51:11.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ms. Wheelchair New York Pageant.

51:11.235 --> 51:16.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I thought to myself, let me
do that pageant,
and let me try and win it.

51:16.206 --> 51:18.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If I could wear high heels, then
they can.

51:18.108 --> 51:22.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If I can dress sexy or do my
hair, then they
can do it, too.

51:22.746 --> 51:30.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are numerous stereotypes
that are still
associated with disability,
being asexual,

51:30.788 --> 51:35.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being unable to have sex, we
don't make good
romantic partners.

51:35.526 --> 51:41.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the notion of sex in society
that we see
on TV, it often shows these
physically fit

51:41.265 --> 51:44.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people having traditional forms
of sex.

51:44.468 --> 51:49.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You don't have to be able to do
the standard
throw-down notions of sex.

51:49.907 --> 51:50.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Anything can be sexy.

51:51.008 --> 51:54.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It could be a fluttering eyelash
on a cheek.

51:54.378 --> 52:00.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you don't see yourself in
those magazines
or part of those models, then
you internalize

52:00.217 --> 52:04.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that image and think that, OK, I
guess I'm
not sexy.

52:04.521 --> 52:09.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People with disabilities have
the same sexual
needs and desires and appetite
for romance

52:09.793 --> 52:12.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and intimacy that everyone else
has.

52:12.997 --> 52:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's part of being human.

52:15.899 --> 52:22.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My name is Dr. Danielle Sheypuk,
and this
is my Brief But Spectacular take
on making

52:22.506 --> 52:24.675 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
disability sexy.

52:24.708 --> 52:31.582 align:left position:0%,start line:66.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Watch more
from our Brief
But Spectacular series on our
Web site,
PBS.org/NewsHour/Brief.

52:31.615 --> 52:35.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Also online: Special
correspondent Marcia
Biggs recently brought you the
story of the

52:35.753 --> 52:38.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
last remaining doctors of
Aleppo, Syria.

52:38.355 --> 52:43.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tomorrow, join her and others
for a Twitter
chat at 1:00 p.m. Eastern about
why pro-government

52:43.527 --> 52:48.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forces seem to be targeting
medical facilities
and physicians with airstrikes.

52:48.632 --> 52:52.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:52.469 --> 52:53.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

52:53.771 --> 52:55.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

52:55.472 --> 52:58.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening
with Mark Shields and David
Brooks.

52:59.009 --> 53:05.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.

53:05.315 --> 53:09.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
