00:15.415 --> 00:16.683
WORLD'S G7 LEADERS MEET IN

00:16.683 --> 00:19.319
GERMANY.

00:19.319 --> 00:20.854
THE HIGH-STAKES ELECTION THAT

00:20.854 --> 00:22.356
COULD TRIGGER UNPRECEDENTED

00:22.356 --> 00:22.990
CHANGE IN TURKEY.

00:22.990 --> 00:24.291
AND IN OUR SIGNATURE SEGMENT,

00:24.291 --> 00:25.592
THE BATTLE OVER THE USE OF

00:25.592 --> 00:27.160
TRAFFIC CAMERAS.

00:27.160 --> 00:29.263
>> IT'S ALL ABOUT REVENUE.

00:29.263 --> 00:30.864
AND THAT'S NOT WHAT LAW

00:30.864 --> 00:32.299
ENFORCEMENT IS SUPPOSED TO BE

00:32.299 --> 00:33.433
ABOUT.

00:33.433 --> 00:34.768
>> DO WE HAVE LESS FOLKS TRYING

00:34.768 --> 00:36.336
TO BEAT THE YELLOW AND RUNNING

00:36.336 --> 00:37.504
LIGHTS?

00:37.504 --> 00:38.672
AND THE ANSWER TO THAT IS

00:38.672 --> 00:39.740
ABSOLUTELY.

00:39.740 --> 00:40.874
>> Stewart: NEXT ON PBS NEWSHOUR

00:40.874 --> 00:42.876
WEEKEND.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.611

00:46.113 --> 00:48.515
ALLISON STEWART.

00:48.515 --> 00:49.516
>> Stewart: GOOD EVENING AND

00:49.516 --> 00:50.584
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:50.584 --> 00:51.919
I'M ALISON STEWART IN FOR HARI

00:51.919 --> 00:53.186
SREENIVASAN.

00:53.186 --> 00:54.755
AT THE VERY START OF THE G7

00:54.755 --> 00:55.989
SUMMIT, PRESIDENT OBAMA AND

00:55.989 --> 00:57.557
GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL

00:57.557 --> 00:58.859
ANNOUNCED THEY'RE UNITED IN

00:58.859 --> 01:00.027
STANDING UP TO RUSSIAN

01:00.027 --> 01:01.695
AGGRESSION IN UKRAINE.

01:01.695 --> 01:02.896
THE LEADERS AGREED TO CONTINUE

01:02.896 --> 01:04.498
SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA EVEN

01:04.498 --> 01:06.033
THOUGH THE E.U. SANCTIONS EXPIRE

01:06.033 --> 01:09.202
AT THE END OF JULY.

01:09.202 --> 01:14.207
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR

01:14.207 --> 01:15.309
PUTIN WAS NOT INVITED TO THE

01:15.309 --> 01:16.610
TWO-DAY SUMMIT IN THE BAVARIAN

01:16.610 --> 01:17.444
ALPS.

01:17.444 --> 01:19.146
LEADERS OF BRITAIN, FRANCE,

01:19.146 --> 01:20.147
ITALY, CANADA AND JAPAN ARE

01:20.147 --> 01:21.715
ATTENDING.

01:21.715 --> 01:22.649
OUTSIDE THE SUMMIT, THOUSANDS OF

01:22.649 --> 01:23.917
PROTESTERS MARCHED IN A NEARBY

01:23.917 --> 01:25.085
TOWN, TOUCHING OFF ISOLATED

01:25.085 --> 01:26.186
CLASHES WITH POLICE.

01:26.186 --> 01:27.554
SO FAR, THE PROTESTS HAVE BEEN

01:27.554 --> 01:29.923
FAR LESS VIOLENT THAN IN PAST

01:29.923 --> 01:30.857
YEARS.

01:30.857 --> 01:32.392
17,000 POLICE OFFICERS ARE

01:32.392 --> 01:33.493
ASSIGNED TO CROWD CONTROL.

01:33.493 --> 01:36.730
SO WHAT CAN WE EXPECT THE G-7 TO

01:36.730 --> 01:37.831
ACCOMPLISH IN JUST TWO-DAY'S

01:37.831 --> 01:38.665
TIME?

01:38.665 --> 01:40.233
I'M JOINED VIA SKYPE BY WALL

01:40.233 --> 01:41.301
STREET JOURNAL REPORTER ANTON

01:41.301 --> 01:42.135
TROIANOVSKI WHO IS COVERING THE

01:42.135 --> 01:42.669
SUMMIT IN GERMANY.

01:42.669 --> 01:43.437
>> ONE OF THE TWO BIGGEST ISSUES

01:43.437 --> 01:44.338
BEING DISCUSSED AT THE G7?

01:44.338 --> 01:45.138
>> WELL, THERE'S A LOT OF

01:45.138 --> 01:46.440
DIFFERENT THINGS ON THE AGENDA

01:46.440 --> 01:47.874
BUT THE ISSUE LOOMING OVER ALL

01:47.874 --> 01:49.576
OF THEM ARE GREECE AND RUSSIA.

01:49.576 --> 01:51.011
GREECE AS YOU KNOW IS LOCKED

01:51.011 --> 01:53.113
INTO THIS KIND OF SHOWDOWN TYPE

01:53.113 --> 01:56.483
NEGOTIATION WITH ITS

01:56.483 --> 01:59.586
INTERNATIONAL CREDITORS, THEY IS

01:59.586 --> 02:00.721
DESPERATELY NEED BILLIONS OF

02:00.721 --> 02:03.023
EUROS AND BAILOUT FUNDS BUT THE

02:03.023 --> 02:04.224
NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE

02:04.224 --> 02:05.726
CREDITORS AND GREECE REMAIN VERY

02:05.726 --> 02:10.897
TENSE.

02:10.897 --> 02:13.700
AND ON RUSSIA, PRESIDENT OBAMA

02:13.700 --> 02:14.668
LANDED HERE THIS MORNING WITH

02:14.668 --> 02:17.037
THE GOAL OF MAKING SURE THAT THE

02:17.037 --> 02:19.139
EUROPEANS ARE UNITED BEHIND

02:19.139 --> 02:21.241
MAINTAINING SANCTIONS AGAINST

02:21.241 --> 02:22.843
RUSSIA.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.678
AS LONG AS THE VIOLENCE IN

02:24.678 --> 02:25.345
UKRAINE CONTINUES.

02:25.345 --> 02:26.847
AND FROM THERE IT APPEARS THAT

02:26.847 --> 02:29.683
THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

02:29.683 --> 02:34.788
>> WHAT HAS BEEN THE IMPACT OF A

02:34.788 --> 02:35.889
PUTIN-LESS SUMMIT?

02:35.889 --> 02:37.824
WHAT HAS HIS ABSENCE MEANT?

02:37.824 --> 02:39.926
>> IT SHOWS THIS NEW DIVISION

02:39.926 --> 02:41.161
THAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE WORLD,

02:41.161 --> 02:42.662
THIS ISSUE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE

02:42.662 --> 02:46.500
ARE REFERRING TO AS A NEW COLD

02:46.500 --> 02:47.868
WAR.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.369
CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL IN

02:49.369 --> 02:51.838
GERMANY WHO IS HOSTING THIS

02:51.838 --> 02:54.374
SUMMIT HAS COME UNDER A LOT OF

02:54.374 --> 02:55.609
CRITICISM THAT PUTIN IS

02:55.609 --> 02:56.476
SECLUDED.

02:56.476 --> 02:59.813
THEY ARE SAYING, HOW CAN YOU

02:59.813 --> 03:00.981
SOLVE INTERNATIONAL ISSUES

03:00.981 --> 03:03.517
WITHOUT PUTIN AT THE TABLE?

03:03.517 --> 03:04.885
HER RESPONSE IS THAT THE GROUP

03:04.885 --> 03:07.421
OF 7 IS NOT JUST AN ECONOMIC

03:07.421 --> 03:09.289
GROUP OR POLITICAL GROUP BUT

03:09.289 --> 03:12.192
IT'S ALSO A GROUP OF DEMOCRACIES

03:12.192 --> 03:13.193
WITH SHARED VALUES.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.562
>> ANGELA MERKEL, CHANCELLOR

03:15.562 --> 03:24.137
MERKEL IS A FAIRLY WELCOMING

03:24.137 --> 03:28.075
PERSONALITY TO OBAMA.

03:28.075 --> 03:29.443
HOW WOULD YOU ACCESSORY THAT

03:29.443 --> 03:30.343
RELATIONSHIP NOW?

03:30.343 --> 03:32.846
>> THE REFERENCES TODAY WAS VERY

03:32.846 --> 03:36.383
OBLIQUE AS THE THING USUALLY IS

03:36.383 --> 03:37.484
WITH ANGELA MERKEL.

03:37.484 --> 03:40.287
SHE DID MENTION BASICALLY THAT

03:40.287 --> 03:41.855
DESPITE SOME DIFFERENCES OF

03:41.855 --> 03:42.856
OPINION BETWEEN GERMANY AND THE

03:42.856 --> 03:45.058
UNITED STATES, THE ALLIANCE

03:45.058 --> 03:45.859
STAYED STRONG.

03:45.859 --> 03:48.695
THE U.S. AND BERLIN HAVE

03:48.695 --> 03:50.597
MAINTAINED A UNITED FRONT BY AND

03:50.597 --> 03:54.034
LARGE IN CONFRONTING MOSCOW OVER

03:54.034 --> 03:54.367
UKRAINE.

03:54.367 --> 03:57.971
MERKEL HAS LED THE EUROPEAN

03:57.971 --> 04:01.007
SANCTIONS PUSH AGAINST RUSSIA.

04:01.007 --> 04:03.043
THE EUROPEAN DIPLOMATIC PUSH

04:03.043 --> 04:04.945
WITH RUSSIA, THAT APPEARS TO BE

04:04.945 --> 04:06.513
WORKING AND YOU COULD CERTAINLY

04:06.513 --> 04:08.815
TELL WHEN OBAMA MET MERKEL TODAY

04:08.815 --> 04:11.284
ON THIS TOWN SQUARE, NEAR THE

04:11.284 --> 04:15.689
RESORT WHERE THEY'RE MEETING,

04:15.689 --> 04:17.724
SHE REALLY WENT ALL OUT TO SAY

04:17.724 --> 04:21.761
THAT THE WAY HE PUT IT, THE U.S.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.230
GERMAN ALLIANCE WAS ONE OF THE

04:23.230 --> 04:24.598
STRONGEST THE WORLD HAS EVER

04:24.598 --> 04:25.499
SEEN.

04:25.499 --> 04:26.967
>> WE SHOULD MENTION OF COURSE

04:26.967 --> 04:28.668
THERE HAVE BEEN THOUSANDS OF

04:28.668 --> 04:31.538
PROTESTERS AT THIS G7 SUMMIT.

04:31.538 --> 04:33.907
WHAT IS IT THAT THEY ARE

04:33.907 --> 04:35.909
PROTESTING, WHAT IS THE MOST

04:35.909 --> 04:37.777
IMPORTANT THING TO THE

04:37.777 --> 04:40.046
ACTIVISTS?

04:40.046 --> 04:43.350
>> IT IS PROBABLY THE

04:43.350 --> 04:45.218
TRANSATLANTIC TRADE AGREEMENT

04:45.218 --> 04:53.460
THAT THE U.S. AND THE PACIFIC

04:53.460 --> 04:57.531
PARTNERS ARE NEGOTIATING NOW.

04:57.531 --> 05:01.168
LOWERING PROTECTIONS IN GERMANY,

05:01.168 --> 05:02.869
BRINGING AMERICAN COWBOY

05:02.869 --> 05:03.537
CAPITALISM IN EUROPE.

05:03.537 --> 05:06.006
THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF

05:06.006 --> 05:07.607
OPPOSITION TO THAT THIS YEAR,

05:07.607 --> 05:13.013
TRADE IS TO BE DISCUSSED AT G7,

05:13.013 --> 05:15.782
TTIP IS ONE OF THE MAIN ECONOMIC

05:15.782 --> 05:17.384
GOALS THAT MERKEL HAS OVER THE

05:17.384 --> 05:20.453
NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS, CLIMATE

05:20.453 --> 05:24.691
POLICY IS ALSO AN ISSUE, AHEAD

05:24.691 --> 05:27.894
OF THE CLIMATE CONFERENCE IN

05:27.894 --> 05:29.362
PARIS LATER ON THIS YEAR.

05:29.362 --> 05:31.531
IT'S BEEN QUITE PEACEFUL

05:31.531 --> 05:36.403
COMPARED TO SOME OF THE PAST

05:36.403 --> 05:44.578
G-8 CONFERENCES.

05:44.578 --> 05:47.347
>> OFFICIALS SUSPECT CHINESE

05:47.347 --> 05:50.984
HACKERS ACCESSED THE BE RECORDS

05:50.984 --> 05:52.385
OF CURRENT AND FEDERAL

05:52.385 --> 05:54.988
EMPLOYEES, HOPING TO FIND AND

05:54.988 --> 05:59.726
POTENTIALLY LOCATE SPIES WITHIN

05:59.726 --> 06:02.095
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

06:02.095 --> 06:05.765
>>

06:05.765 --> 06:07.133
>> NOTHING SHOULD BE TELEGRAPHED

06:07.133 --> 06:08.368
IN ADVANCE, NOTHING SHOULD BE

06:08.368 --> 06:09.903
GIVEN AS FAR AS NOTICE BUT I

06:09.903 --> 06:11.071
THINK THESE COUNTRIES OR THESE

06:11.071 --> 06:12.072
TERRORIST GROUPS SHOULD KNOW

06:12.072 --> 06:13.206
THAT THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES

06:13.206 --> 06:14.341
WHEN THEY ACT THIS WAY.

06:14.341 --> 06:15.675
>> Stewart: SENATOR AND

06:15.675 --> 06:16.810
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL

06:16.810 --> 06:18.345
CANDIDATE LINDSEY GRAHAM TOLD

06:18.345 --> 06:19.579
CNN'S "STATE OF THE UNION" THAT

06:19.579 --> 06:21.214
WE COULD BE FACING A SERIOUS

06:21.214 --> 06:22.482
THREAT UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT

06:22.482 --> 06:24.117
BEEFS UP CYBER SECURITY.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.518
>> YOU GOTTA HAVE MORE MONEY.

06:25.518 --> 06:26.886
YOU GOT TO SET-ASIDE THESE

06:26.886 --> 06:28.088
BUDGET CUTS FOR DEFENSE AND NON-

06:28.088 --> 06:29.422
DEFENSE REPLENISH OUR MILITARY;

06:29.422 --> 06:31.091
UP OUR GAME ON THE INTEL SIDE.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.126
>> Stewart: IN THE

06:33.126 --> 06:35.028
MEDITERRANEAN, CREWS HAVE

06:35.028 --> 06:36.496
LAUNCHED A NEW WAVE OF RESCUE

06:36.496 --> 06:38.098
MISSIONS TO SAVE HUNDREDS OF

06:38.098 --> 06:39.566
MIGRANTS STILL STRANDED AT SEA.

06:39.566 --> 06:40.667
AUTHORITIES SAY AS MANY AS TEN

06:40.667 --> 06:42.102
DIFFERENT BOATS CALLED FOR HELP

06:42.102 --> 06:44.738
THIS MORNING.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.373
MORE THAN 80,000 PEOPLE HAVE

06:46.373 --> 06:48.275
EITHER BEEN RESCUED OR SAILED TO

06:48.275 --> 06:49.576
SAFETY THIS YEAR.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.077
MOST ARE PAYING SMUGGLERS TO

06:51.077 --> 06:52.479
BOARD WOODEN OR RUBBER BOATS IN

06:52.479 --> 06:54.414
A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO FLEE

06:54.414 --> 06:55.749
PERSECUTION AND VIOLENCE IN

06:55.749 --> 06:57.450
LIBYA AND SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA.

06:57.450 --> 06:58.551
WHILE BRITISH, SWEDISH, SPANISH

06:58.551 --> 07:00.053
AND ITALIAN SHIPS ARE RACING TO

07:00.053 --> 07:01.187
SAVE THE STRANDED MIGRANTS, THE

07:01.187 --> 07:02.889
E.U. IS STILL DEBATING HOW TO

07:02.889 --> 07:04.424
HANDLE TO INFLUX OF REFUGEES

07:04.424 --> 07:06.426
ONCE THEY COME ASHORE.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.129
AN INTERESTING TURN OF EVENTS IN

07:09.129 --> 07:10.430
TURKEY'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION:

07:10.430 --> 07:12.499
THE RULING PARTY WAS FAVORED TO

07:12.499 --> 07:14.000
WIN BIG, BUT EARLY RESULTS SHOW

07:14.000 --> 07:15.135
IT COULD END UP LOSING ITS

07:15.135 --> 07:17.904
MAJORITY ALTOGETHER.

07:17.904 --> 07:19.139
PRESIDENT RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN

07:19.139 --> 07:20.273
ASKED THE COUNTRY'S 53 MILLION

07:20.273 --> 07:21.975
ELIGIBLE VOTERS TO GIVE HIS

07:21.975 --> 07:23.276
PARTY 400 PARLIAMENTARY SEATS.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.711
THAT WOULD HAVE CREATED A SUPER

07:24.711 --> 07:26.313
MAJORITY THAT COULD REWRITE THE

07:26.313 --> 07:27.514
CONSTITUTION AND GIVE THE

07:27.514 --> 07:28.948
PRESIDENCY UNPRECEDENTED NEW

07:28.948 --> 07:30.650
POWERS.

07:30.650 --> 07:31.685
THE ELECTION'S CREATED REAL

07:31.685 --> 07:33.453
TENSION IN THE STREETS.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.888
BOMBS EXPLODED AT A RALLY FOR A

07:34.888 --> 07:36.489
RIVAL PARTY FRIDAY, KILLING TWO

07:36.489 --> 07:37.590
AND WOUNDING AT LEAST 200.

07:37.590 --> 07:38.792
JOINING ME TO HELP ANALYZE THESE

07:38.792 --> 07:39.959
EARLY RESULTS IS STEVEN COOK,

07:39.959 --> 07:41.161
SENIOR FELLOW FOR MIDDLE EASTERN

07:41.161 --> 07:43.596
STUDIES AT THE COUNCIL ON

07:43.596 --> 07:46.066
FOREIGN RELATIONS.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.267
IS-K FOR, STEVEN BEFORE WE GO

07:47.267 --> 07:48.234
INTO THE WEEDS ON THE RESULTS I

07:48.234 --> 07:49.569
WANT TO STEP BACK AND SET THE

07:49.569 --> 07:50.670
THE SCENE FOR PEOPLE.

07:50.670 --> 07:52.005
WHY WAS SELECTION SO IMPORTANT?

07:52.005 --> 07:53.239
WHY WAS THE WORLD WATCHING?

07:53.239 --> 07:57.277
>> WELL, THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT

07:57.277 --> 08:00.280
ELECTION BECAUSE, ONE, PRESIDENT

08:00.280 --> 08:02.449
ERDOGAN WHO HAD BEEN PRIME

08:02.449 --> 08:04.050
MINISTER FOR THE PREVIOUS 12

08:04.050 --> 08:06.586
YEARS HAD WANTED TO CHANGE THE

08:06.586 --> 08:10.523
POLITICAL SYSTEM FROM A HYBRID

08:10.523 --> 08:11.458
PRESIDENTIAL PARLIAMENTARY

08:11.458 --> 08:13.560
SYSTEM TO A PURELY PRESIDENTIAL

08:13.560 --> 08:13.893
SYSTEM.

08:13.893 --> 08:15.595
WHICH MEANS ALL THE POWER IN THE

08:15.595 --> 08:16.596
POLITICAL SYSTEM WOULD FLOW TO

08:16.596 --> 08:17.397
HIM.

08:17.397 --> 08:20.100
AT THE MOMENT IT'S THE PRIME

08:20.100 --> 08:23.069
MINISTER WHO IS THE PRIMARY

08:23.069 --> 08:24.671
ACTOR IN THE SYSTEM.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.306
UNDER THE PRESIDENTIAL SYSTEM HE

08:26.306 --> 08:27.440
WOULD HAVE ALL THE EXECUTIVE

08:27.440 --> 08:28.341
POWER.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.009
THE SECOND REASON IT WAS SO

08:30.009 --> 08:32.512
POWER IS A KURDISH POLITICAL

08:32.512 --> 08:35.315
PARTY WAS POISED AND HAS IN FACT

08:35.315 --> 08:37.016
TURKEY'S VERY HIGH THRESHOLD FOR

08:37.016 --> 08:38.218
GETTING INTO THE PARLIAMENT.

08:38.218 --> 08:40.653
THEY HAVE NOW GOTTEN ABOUT 11%

08:40.653 --> 08:42.422
OF THE POPULAR VOTE WHICH MEANS

08:42.422 --> 08:44.758
FOR FIRST TIME A KURDISH BASED

08:44.758 --> 08:48.027
PARTY WILL BE A MAJOR FACTOR IN

08:48.027 --> 08:49.262
TURKISH POLITICS.

08:49.262 --> 08:51.231
>> AND WHAT IMPACT WILL THAT

08:51.231 --> 08:53.500
HAVE ON THE WAY TURKEY'S

08:53.500 --> 08:54.267
GOVERNED GOING FORWARD?

08:54.267 --> 08:56.269
>> UP TO THIS POINT GOING BACK

08:56.269 --> 08:59.572
TO 2002 WHEN THE PARTY FIRST

08:59.572 --> 09:02.308
CAME TO POWER, THEY HAVE NOT HAD

09:02.308 --> 09:04.477
TO SHARE, THEY HAVE RULED

09:04.477 --> 09:06.613
ESSENTIALLY ALONE WITH VERY FEW

09:06.613 --> 09:09.082
CHECKS AND BALANCES I MIGHT ADD.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.184
NOW THEY WILL HAVE TO GO INTO

09:11.184 --> 09:12.385
COALITION WITH ANOTHER PARTY.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.754
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE WILL

09:14.754 --> 09:17.056
LIKELY -- AT LEAST INITIAL

09:17.056 --> 09:18.324
DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE JUSTICE

09:18.324 --> 09:20.894
AND DEVELOPMENT PARTY AND THE

09:20.894 --> 09:23.930
NATIONAL MOVEMENT PARTY, A PART

09:23.930 --> 09:26.466
WITH WHICH THE JUSTICE AND

09:26.466 --> 09:29.169
DEVELOPMENT PARTY HAS SHARED A

09:29.169 --> 09:29.969
CONSTITUENCY AND THEY HAVE

09:29.969 --> 09:31.571
WORKED TOGETHER.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.907
THAT WOULD BE THE MOST LIKELY

09:33.907 --> 09:34.707
COALITION GOING FORWARD.

09:34.707 --> 09:38.711
>> OBVIOUSLY ITS CLOAKS

09:38.711 --> 09:42.282
LOCATION, SHARE NO BORDERS WITH

09:42.282 --> 09:44.584
SYRIA AND IRAQ.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.987
TELL US WHO THE PLAYERS ARE WHO

09:47.987 --> 09:51.791
WILL BE SHARING THE RESULTS?

09:51.791 --> 09:54.327
>> THE SYRIAN OPPOSITION, THE

09:54.327 --> 09:56.696
IRAQI GOVERNMENT, THE EGYPTIAN

09:56.696 --> 09:57.397
GOVERNMENT, THE ISRAELI

09:57.397 --> 09:59.098
GOVERNMENT AND ALL OF THE

09:59.098 --> 10:00.633
GOVERNMENTS IN THE PERSIAN GULF.

10:00.633 --> 10:04.003
>> EVERYBODY IS WHAT YOU'RE

10:04.003 --> 10:04.437
TELLING ME.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.705
>> THE ENTIRE REGION.

10:05.705 --> 10:09.342
IT GOES TO SHOW HOW

10:09.342 --> 10:11.411
STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT TURKEY

10:11.411 --> 10:12.679
IS TO VIRTUALLY EVERY CONFLICT

10:12.679 --> 10:13.680
IN THE REGION IN THE MOMENT.

10:13.680 --> 10:15.982
THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT

10:15.982 --> 10:16.850
DISCONNECT BETWEEN WASHINGTON

10:16.850 --> 10:19.352
AND ANKARA THE WAY IT

10:19.352 --> 10:21.321
APPROACHES THE CONFLICT IN IRAQ

10:21.321 --> 10:23.857
WITH I.S.I.S. AND HOW TO DEAL

10:23.857 --> 10:25.992
WITH THE SYRIAN CIVIL WAR.

10:25.992 --> 10:27.694
THE TURKISH POSITION HAS BEEN

10:27.694 --> 10:31.931
THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH THE

10:31.931 --> 10:36.536
SO-CALLED ISLAMIC STATE IS TO

10:36.536 --> 10:42.408
BRING DOWN THE TURKISH REGIME.

10:42.408 --> 10:44.577
98 PUT A VOID ON THE EFFORT ON

10:44.577 --> 10:47.647
THE PART OF THE TURKS TO FUND

10:47.647 --> 10:51.484
AND COORDINATE DIFFERENT

10:51.484 --> 10:53.920
EXTREMIST GROUPS TO TAKE ON THE

10:53.920 --> 10:54.554
ASSAD REGIME.

10:54.554 --> 10:56.489
THERE MAY BE CHANGES IN THE

10:56.489 --> 10:58.625
APPROACH BUT OVERALL I THINK

10:58.625 --> 11:00.193
TURKISH FOREIGN POLICY WILL

11:00.193 --> 11:02.662
REMAIN LARGELY THE SAME.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.865
>> IN READING THE WIRES AND

11:05.865 --> 11:07.667
TWITTER IT SEEMS THIS POTENTIAL

11:07.667 --> 11:08.535
OUTCOME WAS UNEXPECTED.

11:08.535 --> 11:11.571
>> WELL, THERE WERE A LOT OF

11:11.571 --> 11:13.373
DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS GOING

11:13.373 --> 11:14.140
FORWARD.

11:14.140 --> 11:15.975
I SHOULD SAY THERE WERE A LOT OF

11:15.975 --> 11:16.809
DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS IN THE

11:16.809 --> 11:20.647
LAST FEW WEEKS.

11:20.647 --> 11:22.582
NO ONE CAN REALLY TRUST THE

11:22.582 --> 11:24.751
POLLING THAT WAS DONE AHEAD OF

11:24.751 --> 11:27.287
THE ELECTIONS.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.521
EVERYONE CERTAINLY EXPECTED THE

11:28.521 --> 11:30.056
JUSTICE AND DEVELOPMENT PARTY TO

11:30.056 --> 11:32.825
DO QUITE WELL AND THEY HAVE DONE

11:32.825 --> 11:34.761
QUITE WELL BY ANY STANDARDS

11:34.761 --> 11:37.363
OTHER THAN THEIR OWN PAST

11:37.363 --> 11:39.699
SUCCESS, HAVING 40% OF THE

11:39.699 --> 11:42.502
POPULAR VOTE IS A VERY

11:42.502 --> 11:43.736
SUCCESSFUL PARTY.

11:43.736 --> 11:50.209
BUT THE -- POLITICAL PARTY.

11:50.209 --> 11:56.983
BUT KURDISH PARTY GETTING LESS

11:56.983 --> 12:00.653
THAN 11% OF THE POPULAR VOTE,

12:00.653 --> 12:03.590
IT WILL HAVE LESS POWER THAN

12:03.590 --> 12:09.195
SINCE IT HAS GOTTEN SINCE

12:09.195 --> 12:10.229
2002.

12:10.229 --> 12:12.665
BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN RULING IN

12:12.665 --> 12:14.133
A THUGGISH WAY OVER THE COURSE

12:14.133 --> 12:17.670
OF THE LAST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS,

12:17.670 --> 12:19.238
AND MANY TURKS RESENT THAT KIND

12:19.238 --> 12:21.174
OF ARROGANCE OF POWER.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.042
>> STEVEN COOK FROM THE COUNCIL

12:25.144 --> 12:28.815

12:40.393 --> 12:41.127

12:42.395 --> 12:43.763

14:52.625 --> 14:54.160
SO EVEN WHEN POLICE AREN'T

THERE, DRIVERS THINK TWICE

14:55.428 --> 14:57.196
BEFORE RUNNING A LIGHT.

14:57.196 --> 14:58.664
AND THE PROOF THAT THEY WORK,

14:58.664 --> 14:59.999
ACCORDING TO THE OBERHAUSERS, IS

ABSOLUTELY.

TURN.

16:31.891 --> 16:32.758
HE DID LOOK, HE WAS IN CONTROL

16:32.758 --> 16:34.293
OF HIS VEHICLE, THERE WAS NO

16:34.293 --> 16:36.062
PEDESTRIANS, AND NO OTHER CROSS

16:36.062 --> 16:43.769
VEHICULAR TRAFFIC.

16:43.769 --> 16:44.971
I'M GOING TO REJECT THAT.

16:44.971 --> 16:45.838
THIS IS FOR SAFETY.

IN EXCHANGE, THEY RECEIVE A

17:03.956 --> 17:05.091
PERCENTAGE.

17:05.091 --> 17:06.425
IT ALLOWS US AS A DIVISION OF

FRANKLY, ON MORE VIOLENT CRIME.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.101
AREN'T CONCLUSIVE.

17:15.101 --> 17:16.369
MOST EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THEY

17:16.369 --> 17:18.004
CUT DOWN ON RIGHT ANGLE CRASHES,

17:18.004 --> 17:20.339
WHICH TEND TO BE SEVERE.

17:20.339 --> 17:21.641
BUT SOME RESEARCH SHOWS THAT

17:21.641 --> 17:24.010
THEY MAY LEAD TO MORE CRASHES

17:24.010 --> 17:25.645
OVERALL, BECAUSE DRIVERS WHO

17:25.645 --> 17:27.046
SLAM ON THE BRAKES TO AVOID

17:27.046 --> 17:28.514
RUNNING LIGHTS MAY BE GETTING

EITHER WAY, A LOT OF MOTORISTS

COMMUNITIES, HAVE QUITE FRANKLY

17:51.938 --> 17:53.472
USED THESE AS SPEED TRAPS.

18:05.651 --> 18:06.852
COLUMBUS HAS ONLY USED SPEED

CAMERAS IN SCHOOL ZONES, WHEN A

18:08.387 --> 18:09.922
COP IS PRESENT.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.357
BUT OTHER OHIO MUNICIPALITIES

18:11.357 --> 18:12.858
HAVE DEPLOYED THEM MORE

18:12.858 --> 18:14.160
AGGRESSIVELY.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.328
LIKE ELMWOOD PLACE, JUST OUTSIDE

18:15.328 --> 18:16.862
CINCINNATI.

18:16.862 --> 18:18.898
THERE'S ONE MAIN DRAG THROUGH

HAS SAID DRIVERS USED TO FLY

18:21.634 --> 18:22.868
THROUGH HERE.

18:22.868 --> 18:24.337
BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE THE OFFICERS

18:24.337 --> 18:25.438

COUPLE ACCIDENTS, THE TOWN

DECIDED TO INSTALL SOME

18:33.279 --> 18:34.947
LED TO THOUSANDS OF CITATIONS

18:34.947 --> 18:36.415

18:55.935 --> 18:57.370
WHICH RARELY HAPPENS, BUT IF IT

18:57.370 --> 18:58.838
DOES, THAT POLICE OFFICER HAS TO

18:58.838 --> 19:00.339
RAISE HIS RIGHT ARM AND TESTIFY

19:00.339 --> 19:03.209
THAT THE DEVICE HE USED, THE

19:03.209 --> 19:05.011
LASER RADAR WAS PROPERLY

19:05.011 --> 19:06.712
CALIBRATED, THAT HE IS PROPERLY

MONTY, A SCAM THAT THE MOTORISTS

PLACE TO REMOVE THE CAMERAS.

19:26.932 --> 19:29.969

19:29.969 --> 19:33.372

19:35.307 --> 19:36.242
INSTALLED CAMERAS IN THE FIRST

PLACE, ACCORDING TO ALLEN.

COUNTRY TOWARDS POLICING FOR

19:41.180 --> 19:42.548
PROFIT.

19:42.548 --> 19:43.883

20:08.441 --> 20:10.743
HORRIBLE TRAGEDIES, AND

20:10.743 --> 20:12.344
LEGISLATORS WILL RUSH TO CHANGE

20:12.344 --> 20:15.381
LAWS BECAUSE OF THAT.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.516
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, THOSE

20:17.516 --> 20:19.118
LAWS ACTUALLY ARE COUNTER-

20:19.118 --> 20:20.553
PRODUCTIVE AND CONTRARY TO DUE

20:28.794 --> 20:30.563
IT REQUIRES A LAW ENFORCEMENT

20:38.304 --> 20:39.738

20:39.738 --> 20:41.040
THE PURPOSE OF THE CAMERAS AND

20:41.040 --> 20:44.009
MAKES THEM TOO EXPENSIVE TO USE.

20:44.009 --> 20:45.611
COLUMBUS OFFICIALS ARGUED THAT

20:45.611 --> 20:47.046
COMPLYING WITH THE LAW WOULD

20:47.046 --> 20:48.747
COST THE CITY MORE THAN TWELVE

MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

20:50.382 --> 20:51.917
IT'S ONE OF AT LEAST FIVE
