SECONDARILY WHAT MR. COOK AND

40:21.301 --> 40:23.126
LIKE HOW THE LAW IS WRITTEN.
SECONDARILY WHAT MR. COOK AND
OTHERS SAY IS LISTEN, WHEN

40:23.129 --> 40:24.225
SECONDARILY WHAT MR. COOK AND
OTHERS SAY IS LISTEN, WHEN
COMPANIES MAKE MONEY, WHEN THEY

MONEY SO WE CAN USE IT.

40:33.903 --> 40:35.197
AND SO WE DESERVE TO HAVE THAT
MONEY SO WE CAN USE IT.
AND FINALLY WHAT MR. COOK SAYS

40:35.198 --> 40:37.125
MONEY SO WE CAN USE IT.
AND FINALLY WHAT MR. COOK SAYS
IS THAT AT THIS POINT A MAJORITY

40:37.127 --> 40:38.988
AND FINALLY WHAT MR. COOK SAYS
IS THAT AT THIS POINT A MAJORITY
OF APPLE'S SALES OCCUR OUTSIDE

40:38.990 --> 40:40.750
IS THAT AT THIS POINT A MAJORITY
OF APPLE'S SALES OCCUR OUTSIDE
OF THE UNITED STATES AND SO AS A

40:40.752 --> 40:42.014

NOW, THAT'S SIGNIFICANTLY

40:44.310 --> 40:45.671
TO U.S. TAXATION.

41:31.893 --> 41:34.451

NO ONE IS SAYING THAT APPLE IS

NO ONE IS SAYING THAT APPLE IS
MISLEADING ABOUT WHERE THE SALES

41:36.515 --> 41:38.043
NO ONE IS SAYING THAT APPLE IS
MISLEADING ABOUT WHERE THE SALES
THEMSELVES OCCUR.

41:38.045 --> 41:39.971
MISLEADING ABOUT WHERE THE SALES
THEMSELVES OCCUR.
THE QUESTION IS HOW THAT REVENUE

41:39.973 --> 41:41.833

THE QUESTION IS HOW THAT REVENUE
IS PASSED BETWEEN SUBSIDIARIES.

41:41.835 --> 41:43.429
THE QUESTION IS HOW THAT REVENUE
IS PASSED BETWEEN SUBSIDIARIES.
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT APPLE

41:43.431 --> 41:44.393
IS PASSED BETWEEN SUBSIDIARIES.
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT APPLE
DOES AS WELL AS ALMOST EVERY

41:44.395 --> 41:45.590
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT APPLE
DOES AS WELL AS ALMOST EVERY
OTHER TECH COMPANY IS THAT THEY

41:45.592 --> 41:46.854
DOES AS WELL AS ALMOST EVERY
OTHER TECH COMPANY IS THAT THEY
SELL THEIR OWN INTELLECTUAL

41:48.985 --> 41:51.576
PROPERTY TO ONE OF THEIR

SO APPLE MIGHT INVENT ITUNES IN

SO APPLE MIGHT INVENT ITUNES IN

THEN IRELAND CHARGES OTHER PARTS

THEN IRELAND CHARGES OTHER PARTS
OF APPLE FOR THE USE OF THE
