04:09.916 --> 04:11.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE WITH NO

04:11.150 --> 04:12.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMITTEE MEETINGS, NO HEARINGS,

04:12.885 --> 04:14.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIRTUALLY NO DEBATE, AND IT

04:14.087 --> 04:16.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD TAKE 50 VOTES TO PASS IT.

04:16.055 --> 04:17.490 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WERE SOME CONCESSIONS TO

04:17.490 --> 04:18.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MODERATES.

04:18.358 --> 04:19.425 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S NOT CLEAR THE MOST

04:19.425 --> 04:20.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSERVATIVE OF SENATORS WILL

04:20.593 --> 04:22.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

DIRECTION.

04:24.564 --> 04:26.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THE OTHER SIDE, THE HOUSE

04:26.165 --> 04:27.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PASSED SIGNIFICANT CUTBACKS OF

04:27.934 --> 04:29.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DODD-FRANK BILL.

04:29.302 --> 04:30.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S LEGISLATION THAT PUTS

04:30.703 --> 04:32.839 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIGNIFICANT CAPS ON WHAT BIG

FINANCIAL MELTDOWN IN 2008.

04:38.478 --> 04:40.213 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT IT INDICATES IS THAT THE

REPUBLICAN MAJORITIES IN THE

04:41.648 --> 04:43.249 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOUSE AND SENATE ARE DETERMINED

04:43.249 --> 04:45.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

GOING TO PURSUE THIS AGENDA?

04:56.996 --> 04:57.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, I THINK THE PATTERN

04:57.764 --> 05:00.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXTENDS BEYOND CAPITOL HILL, AND

05:00.199 --> 05:01.601 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT INDICATES WHY SOME

CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS WHO

05:03.469 --> 05:04.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIGHT HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS

AWAY FROM HIM.

05:08.241 --> 05:10.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS DONE

05:10.443 --> 05:12.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL KINDS OF REGULATORY CHANGES.

05:12.945 --> 05:14.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'VE GRANTED A LOT OF

COLLEGES.

05:18.785 --> 05:20.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'VE APPOINTED INTO POSITIONS

05:20.553 --> 05:22.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES

05:22.355 --> 05:23.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

HAVE GIVEN THEM EXEMPTIONS FROM

CONFLICT OF INTEREST RULES.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.761 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'VE CLEARLY APPOINTED SOME--

05:28.761 --> 05:30.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR ARE TRYING TO APPOINT STAUNCH

05:30.296 --> 05:31.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:32.165 --> 05:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS

05:34.600 --> 05:36.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOKING AT TRUMP, THERE'S A

05:36.469 --> 05:38.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOUGHT THAT, WELL, HE MAY HAVE

05:38.004 --> 05:40.039 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBLEMS, BUT HE SEEMS TO BE

05:40.039 --> 05:42.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PURSUING WHAT WE CONSERVATIVES

05:42.008 --> 05:43.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE WANTED THE GOVERNMENT TO DO

05:43.309 --> 05:44.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR SOME TIME, WHICH IS WHY I

05:44.911 --> 05:46.346 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK THAT THEY WILL BE LESS

05:46.346 --> 05:48.281 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

NONSTARTER.

06:11.304 --> 06:12.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF HISTORY

06:12.205 --> 06:13.473 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT IMPEACHMENT, BUT ONE THING

06:13.473 --> 06:16.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS-- AS LONG AS THE PRESIDENT

06:16.943 --> 06:18.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RETAINS THE SUPPORT OF HIS OR

06:18.911 --> 06:20.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HER PARTY, REMOVAL FROM OFFICE

06:20.913 --> 06:22.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.

06:22.448 --> 06:24.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAID

06:24.083 --> 06:25.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUBLICLY HE'D BE WILLING TO

06:25.451 --> 06:27.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKE-- TO TESTIFY UNDER OATH

06:27.587 --> 06:29.889 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEFORE SPECIAL COUNSEL MUELLER,

06:29.889 --> 06:31.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

YOU SAY THAT'S FALSE CAN BE USED

06:37.930 --> 06:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS EITHER A SOURCE OF A CRIMINAL

06:43.035 --> 06:45.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES,

06:45.104 --> 06:46.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

IT WAS JUST THIS LITTLE SCREEN,

12:46.465 --> 12:49.535 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT CONFIRMED TO THE COUNTRY

13:01.547 --> 13:03.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE IN GETTING PEOPLE TO COME

13:03.082 --> 13:05.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT TO THE STREET, BUT YOU ALSO

13:05.050 --> 13:06.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POINT OUT THAT THERE'S A

13:06.085 --> 13:07.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF POWER ON

13:07.520 --> 13:09.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE PLATFORMS NOW.

13:09.188 --> 13:11.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE WAY THAT THE ALGORITHMS

13:11.290 --> 13:12.925 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE DESIGNED COULD ACTUALLY

13:12.925 --> 13:15.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DETERMINE THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE

13:15.161 --> 13:16.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF A MOVEMENT?

13:16.162 --> 13:16.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> ABSOLUTELY.

13:16.695 --> 13:19.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR EXAMPLE, FACEBOOK USES AN

ALGORITHM, A COMPUTER PROGRAM,

13:21.333 --> 13:24.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO CHOOSE HOW TO RANK WHAT IT

13:24.537 --> 13:25.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOWS YOU.

13:25.171 --> 13:25.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, IF YOU DON'T SEE SOMETHING

13:25.971 --> 13:28.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM SOMEONE, MAYBE FACEBOOK

13:28.307 --> 13:30.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISN'T SHOWING IT TO YOU.

13:30.176 --> 13:31.277 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR A SOCIAL MOVEMENT, THAT'S

13:31.277 --> 13:32.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCREDIBLY CONSEQUENTIAL.

14:16.789 --> 14:19.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
