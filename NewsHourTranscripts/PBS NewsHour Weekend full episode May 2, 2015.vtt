00:12.679 --> 00:14.281
AS CROWDS RALLIED IN BALTIMORE,

00:14.281 --> 00:15.549
SIX POLICE OFFICERS CHARGED IN

00:15.549 --> 00:17.184

00:17.184 --> 00:18.585
FREDDIE GRAY ARE NOW OUT ON

00:18.585 --> 00:19.553
BAIL.

00:19.553 --> 00:20.921
FROM AFGHANISTAN: DOZENS OF MEN

00:20.921 --> 00:22.522
FACE TRIAL FOR THE MOB KILLING

00:22.522 --> 00:24.424
OF THIS WOMAN MISTAKENLY ACCUSED

00:24.424 --> 00:27.027
OF BURNING THE KORAN.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.062
AND SANDTOWN BY THE NUMBERS.

00:29.062 --> 00:30.264
A SPECIAL SERIES OF REPORTS

00:30.264 --> 00:31.331
ABOUT WHAT LIFE IS LIKE IN THE

00:31.331 --> 00:32.532
IMPOVERISHED BALTIMORE

00:32.532 --> 00:33.467
NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE FREDDIE GRAY

00:33.467 --> 00:35.102
GREW UP AND WAS ARRESTED.

00:35.102 --> 00:37.938
NEXT ON PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:38.338 --> 00:40.607
FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS IN

00:40.607 --> 00:42.209
LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:42.209 --> 00:45.078
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:45.078 --> 00:45.812
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING.

00:45.812 --> 00:46.847
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:46.847 --> 00:48.181
WE BEGIN TONIGHT IN BALTIMORE,

00:48.181 --> 00:49.449
WHERE A THRONG OF PEOPLE, SOME

00:49.449 --> 00:50.918
CHANTING "TAKE BACK THE CITY"

00:50.918 --> 00:52.452
AND CALLING FOR AN END TO THE

00:52.452 --> 00:54.121
CURFEW, GATHERED PEACEFULLY

00:54.121 --> 00:55.756
TODAY OUTSIDE CITY HALL.

00:55.756 --> 00:57.257
THIS, FOLLOWING THE RELEASE ON

00:57.257 --> 00:58.558
BAIL LAST NIGHT OF THE SIX

00:58.558 --> 01:00.160
BALTIMORE POLICE OFFICERS, WHO

01:00.160 --> 01:01.561
WERE ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH

01:01.561 --> 01:02.362
THE DEATH OF FREDDIE GRAY.

01:02.362 --> 01:03.964
THE 25-YEAR-OLD DIED IN POLICE

01:03.964 --> 01:05.499
CUSTODY, TOUCHING OFF DAYS OF

01:05.499 --> 01:06.533
RIOTS.

01:06.533 --> 01:07.834
FOR THE LATEST FROM BALTIMORE,

01:07.834 --> 01:08.902
WE ARE JOINED ONCE AGAIN TONIGHT

01:08.902 --> 01:09.569
BY LUKE BROADWATER OF THE

01:09.569 --> 01:11.104
"BALTIMORE SUN."

01:11.104 --> 01:12.639
SO, WHAT'S THE TIMETABLE FOR THE

01:12.639 --> 01:13.540
PROSECUTION?

01:13.540 --> 01:14.741
THE CHARGES CAME DOWN VERY

01:14.741 --> 01:15.609
QUICKLY.

01:15.609 --> 01:16.576
WHAT KIND OF A TIMELINE ARE WE

01:16.576 --> 01:18.578
LOOKING FOR NOW THAT WE KNOW

01:18.578 --> 01:19.513
THESE SIX OFFICERS ARE OUT ON

01:19.513 --> 01:20.314
BAIL?

01:20.314 --> 01:21.581
>> FELONY CHARGES IN MARYLAND

01:21.581 --> 01:22.616
HAVE TO GO BEFORE A GRAND JURY,

01:22.616 --> 01:24.151
SO A GRAND JURY IS GOING TO HAVE

01:24.151 --> 01:26.019
TO HEAR THESE CHARGES.

01:26.019 --> 01:28.488
OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S A ONE-SIDE

01:28.488 --> 01:29.556
SITUATION WHERE ONLY THE

01:29.556 --> 01:31.558
PROSECUTION GETS TO PRESENT

01:31.558 --> 01:32.492
EVIDENCE.

01:32.492 --> 01:35.028
THAT WILL HAVE TO HAPPEN WITHIN

01:35.028 --> 01:35.696
30 DAYS.

01:35.696 --> 01:36.897
IF THE GRAND JURY DECIDE TO

01:36.897 --> 01:39.499
BRING CHARGES AGAINST THE

01:39.499 --> 01:41.668
OFFICERS, THEN THEY WILL HAVE AN

01:41.668 --> 01:42.736
ARRAIGNMENT.

01:42.736 --> 01:43.837
SO WE COULD SEE THAT ALL WITHIN

01:43.837 --> 01:45.472
THE NEXT MONTH.

01:45.472 --> 01:47.040
AND AFTER THEY'RE ARRAIGNED,

01:47.040 --> 01:48.909
THEN WE'D LIKELY SEE WHAT THEY

01:48.909 --> 01:51.445
WANT TO PLEA OR GO TO TRIAL.

01:51.445 --> 01:54.014
SO WE-- WE COULD BE-- YOU KNOW,

01:54.014 --> 01:56.650
TRIALS IN BALTIMORE NOTORIOUSLY

01:56.650 --> 01:57.317
TAKE A LONG TIME.

01:57.317 --> 01:59.252
I MEAN, WE SEE POSTPONEMENTS ALL

01:59.252 --> 01:59.953
THE TIMES.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.221
WE'VE SEEN CASES THAT DRAG ON

02:01.221 --> 02:02.589
FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS.

02:02.589 --> 02:05.192
BUT I THINK WITH THE

02:05.192 --> 02:05.993
HIGH-PROFILE NATURE OF THIS ONE,

02:05.993 --> 02:10.030
I THINK WE WILL BE SEEING THESE

02:10.030 --> 02:11.431
CASES IN COURT PRETTY QUICKLY.

02:11.431 --> 02:12.766
>> Sreenivasan: SO THREE OF

02:12.766 --> 02:14.701
THE SIX POLICE OFFICERS INVOLVED

02:14.701 --> 02:16.136
WERE AFRICAN AMERICANS.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.372
HOW IS THAT AFFECTING HOW THIS

02:18.372 --> 02:19.840
STORY IS CONSUMED, PERCEIVED ON

02:19.840 --> 02:22.542
THE STREETS OF BALTIMORE?

02:22.542 --> 02:25.278
>> I WOULD SAY IT MAKES VERY

02:25.278 --> 02:26.113
LITTLE DIFFERENCE.

02:26.113 --> 02:28.382
ALMOST EVERYBODY I TALK TO ON

02:28.382 --> 02:29.316
THE STREET SAYS IT DOESN'T

02:29.316 --> 02:30.851
MATTER TO US WHETHER THE OFFICER

02:30.851 --> 02:31.985
IS WHITE OR BLACK.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.820
WHAT MATTERS TO US IS THAT WE

02:33.820 --> 02:36.823
GET JUSTICE IN THE CASE.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.158
I THINK POTENTIALLY, ESPECIALLY

02:38.158 --> 02:40.093
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BIG,

02:40.093 --> 02:41.995
NATIONAL CASES, THE RACE OF THE

02:41.995 --> 02:44.798
OFFICERS SEEMS VERY IMPORTANT TO

02:44.798 --> 02:46.133
MAYBE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING IN

02:46.133 --> 02:47.134
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

02:47.134 --> 02:49.970
BUT ON THE GROUND HERE, I FOUND

02:49.970 --> 02:51.238
ALMOST ENTIRELY PEOPLE SAY THAT

02:51.238 --> 02:52.839
DOES NOT MATTER AT ALL TO THEM.

02:52.839 --> 02:53.774
>> Sreenivasan: SO AS THIS--

02:53.774 --> 02:55.475
YOU KNOW, AS YOU POINTED OUT,

02:55.475 --> 02:57.611
THAT THIS CASE COULD DRAG ON FOR

02:57.611 --> 03:01.481
MONTHS OR POSSIBLY LONGER, IS

03:01.481 --> 03:03.116
THE CITY EQUIPPED TO HANDLE

03:03.116 --> 03:05.819
ANOTHER FLARE-UP OR ANOTHER

03:05.819 --> 03:07.587
ROUND OF TENSION GIVEN WHAT

03:07.587 --> 03:08.588
THEY'VE EXPERIENCED OVER THE

03:08.588 --> 03:10.023
PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS?

03:10.023 --> 03:12.492
>> WELL, AS WE SAW ON-- I WOULD

03:12.492 --> 03:14.127
SAY ONLY ONE DAY THIS WEEK DID

03:14.127 --> 03:15.929
WE REALLY NEED THE NATIONAL

03:15.929 --> 03:17.798
GUARD, AND THAT WAS ON MONDAY.

03:17.798 --> 03:20.400
THAT WAS THE DAY ALL HELL BROKE

03:20.400 --> 03:22.135
LOOSE AND THE DAY OF THE RIOT.

03:22.135 --> 03:23.470
THAT DAY, DEFINITELY, THERE WERE

03:23.470 --> 03:26.006
A LOT OF POLICE THAT WERE NEED

03:26.006 --> 03:29.142
ED TO KEEP ORDER IN BALTIMORE.

03:29.142 --> 03:32.079
SINCE THAT DAY, THERE HAS BEEN

03:32.079 --> 03:36.383
NO VIOLENCE AT ALL RELATED TO

03:36.383 --> 03:37.417
THE PROTEST OF THE FREDDIE GRAY

03:37.417 --> 03:38.585
CASE.

03:38.585 --> 03:39.853
WHAT THERE HAS BEEN IS A LOT OF

03:39.853 --> 03:41.288
VIOLENCE THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO

03:41.288 --> 03:42.489
WITH THE FREDDIE GRAY CASE, AND

03:42.489 --> 03:44.524
THAT IS THE NORMAL VIOLENCE THAT

03:44.524 --> 03:45.192
THERE IS IN BALTIMORE.

03:45.192 --> 03:48.428
I MEAN, I THINK WE'VE HAD 17

03:48.428 --> 03:49.796
PEOPLE SHOT SINCE THE NATIONAL

03:49.796 --> 03:50.664
GUARD ARRIVED.

03:50.664 --> 03:53.433
WE JUST HAD A STORE OWNER ROBBED

03:53.433 --> 03:54.067
AND KILLED.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.403
SO WE ARE SEEING VIOLENCE, BUT

03:56.403 --> 03:57.270
IT'S NOT-- IT'S NOT FROM THE

03:57.270 --> 03:58.271
PROTESTERS.

03:58.271 --> 03:59.172
>> Sreenivasan: LUKE

03:59.172 --> 03:59.873
BROADWATER OF THE "BALTIMORE

03:59.873 --> 04:00.574
SUN," THANKS SO MUCH FOR

04:00.574 --> 04:01.141
JOINING US.

04:01.141 --> 04:01.675
>> THANK YOU.

04:01.675 --> 04:02.609
>> Sreenivasan: IN OAKLAND

04:02.609 --> 04:03.610
CALIFORNIA LAST NIGHT,

04:03.610 --> 04:05.045
DEMONSTRATORS PROTESTING ALLEGED

04:05.045 --> 04:07.147
POLICE BRUTALITY THREW ROCKS AND

04:07.147 --> 04:09.516
CHAIRS AT POLICE AND SMASHED CAR

04:09.516 --> 04:11.184
WINDOWS AT AUTO DEALERSHIPS.

04:11.184 --> 04:12.486
THE INCIDENTS OCCURRED AFTER

04:12.486 --> 04:14.054
PEACEFUL GATHERINGS TO MARK MAY

04:14.054 --> 04:14.688
DAY.

04:14.688 --> 04:15.589
THERE WAS ALSO TROUBLE IN

04:15.589 --> 04:16.056
SEATTLE.

04:16.056 --> 04:17.224
AT LEAST 15 PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED

04:17.224 --> 04:18.859
THERE AND SEVERAL DOZEN VEHICLES

04:18.859 --> 04:19.893
WERE DAMAGED, ACCORDING TO

04:19.893 --> 04:20.961
AUTHORITIES.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.696
IOWA HAS BECOME THE THIRD STATE

04:22.696 --> 04:23.964
TO DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY

04:23.964 --> 04:25.098
BECAUSE OF THE GROWING SPREAD OF

04:25.098 --> 04:26.633
THE AVIAN FLU.

04:26.633 --> 04:28.368
IOWA PRODUCES MORE EGGS THAN ANY

04:28.368 --> 04:29.436
OTHER STATE.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.337
GOVERNOR TERRY BRANSTAD'S

04:30.337 --> 04:31.438
DECLARATION GIVES AUTHORITIES

04:31.438 --> 04:33.140
ADDITIONAL POWERS TO ENFORCE

04:33.140 --> 04:34.508
PREVENTATIVE MEASURES.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.076
MINNESOTA AND WISCONSIN TOOK

04:36.076 --> 04:37.811
SIMILAR STEPS LAST MONTH.

04:37.811 --> 04:40.113
AN ESTIMATED 21 MILLION CHICKENS

04:40.113 --> 04:42.015
AND TURKEYS HAVE BEEN OR WILL BE

04:42.015 --> 04:44.117
KILLED NATIONWIDE TO TRY TO CURB

04:44.117 --> 04:45.552
THE OUTBREAK, WHICH DOES NOT

04:45.552 --> 04:47.654
POSE A THREAT TO HUMANS.

04:47.654 --> 04:48.922
THE UNITED NATIONS SAYS MORE

04:48.922 --> 04:50.624
THAN A MILLION AND A HALF

04:50.624 --> 04:52.125
PEOPLE IN NEPAL ARE IN

04:52.125 --> 04:53.627
IMMEDIATE NEED OF FOOD.

04:53.627 --> 04:54.694
THIS, AS THE DEATH TOLL FROM

04:54.694 --> 04:55.595
LAST WEEKEND'S EARTHQUAKE

04:55.595 --> 04:57.164
CLIMBED TODAY TO MORE THAN

04:57.164 --> 04:58.298
7,000.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.199
AUTHORITIES SAY DELIVERY OF

04:59.199 --> 05:00.233
ASSISTANCE IS ONLY POSSIBLE BY

05:00.233 --> 05:02.636
HELICOPTER TO SOME AREAS OUTSIDE

05:02.636 --> 05:04.938
THE CAPITAL CITY OF KATHMANDU.

05:04.938 --> 05:07.073
WORD FROM NIGERIA TONIGHT OF THE

05:07.073 --> 05:09.743

05:11.011 --> 05:13.046
CAPTIVE BY BOKO HARAM ISLAMIC

05:13.046 --> 05:13.813
EXTREMISTS.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.081
SEVERAL HUNDRED OTHERS WERE

05:15.081 --> 05:16.249
FREED BY THE NIGERIAN ARMY

05:16.249 --> 05:17.317
EARLIER THIS WEEK.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.585
ACCORDING TO THE BBC, IT WAS NOT

05:18.585 --> 05:19.953
IMMEDIATELY CLEAR WHAT

05:19.953 --> 05:21.021
CONNECTION, IF ANY, THOSE

05:21.021 --> 05:23.690
RESCUED TODAY HAD TO THE 219

05:23.690 --> 05:25.725
SCHOOL GIRLS ABDUCTED A LITTLE

IN AFGHANISTAN, 49 SUSPECTS,

05:29.996 --> 05:32.065
INCLUDING 19 POLICE OFFICERS,

05:32.065 --> 05:33.500
WERE PUT ON TRIAL TODAY IN

05:33.500 --> 05:35.001
CONNECTION WITH THE MOB KILLING

05:35.001 --> 05:36.269
OF AN AFGHAN WOMAN.

05:36.269 --> 05:37.337
THE 27-YEAR-OLD WOMAN WAS

05:37.337 --> 05:39.272
BEATEN, KICKED AND THEN SET ON

05:39.272 --> 05:41.141
FIRE AS SEVERAL POLICEMEN

05:41.141 --> 05:42.742
REPORTEDLY LOOKED ON.

05:42.742 --> 05:44.311
THE CASE DREW NATIONAL ATTENTION

05:44.311 --> 05:45.779
AFTER THE ATTACK WAS CAPTURED ON

05:45.779 --> 05:47.047
A MOBILE PHONE AND DISTRIBUTED

05:47.047 --> 05:47.881
ONLINE.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.382
TODAY'S COURT PROCEEDINGS WERE

05:49.382 --> 05:50.884
TELEVISED NATIONALLY IN

05:50.884 --> 05:52.219
AFGHANISTAN.

05:52.219 --> 05:53.820
AND PRINCE WILLIAM AND KATE

05:53.820 --> 05:55.188
MIDDLETON ARE THE NEW PARENTS OF

05:55.188 --> 05:56.223
A BABY GIRL.

05:56.223 --> 05:57.190
THE UNNAMED NEWBORN WAS

05:57.190 --> 05:58.491
DELIVERED SHORTLY AFTER 8:30 IN

THE MORNING LOCAL TIME IN LONDON

AND WEIGHED IN AT EIGHT POUNDS

06:01.094 --> 06:01.995

06:01.995 --> 06:03.296
THE PRINCESS IS THE FOURTH IN

06:03.296 --> 06:04.664
THE LINE TO THE THRONE BEHIND

06:04.664 --> 06:06.166
HER GRANDFATHER, PRINCE CHARLES;

06:06.166 --> 06:07.601
HER FATHER, PRINCE WILLIAM; AND

06:07.601 --> 06:09.502

06:09.502 --> 06:11.137
PRINCE GEORGE.

06:21.681 --> 06:22.482
>> Sreenivasan: SOMETHING

06:22.482 --> 06:23.083
DIFFERENT TONIGHT.

06:23.083 --> 06:23.984
WE'RE GOING TO USE MOST OF OUR

06:23.984 --> 06:25.185
REMAINING TIME TO OFFER YOU A

06:25.185 --> 06:26.653
DETAILED LOOK AT LIFE IN ONE OF

06:26.653 --> 06:27.621
THE POOREST SECTIONS OF

06:27.621 --> 06:28.421
BALTIMORE.

06:28.421 --> 06:29.723
OUR FOCUS IS ON

06:29.723 --> 06:30.991
SANDTOWN/WINCHESTER, THE

06:30.991 --> 06:32.092
IMPOVERISHED NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE

06:32.092 --> 06:33.460
THERE WAS RIOTING THIS PAST WEEK

06:33.460 --> 06:34.961
FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF FREDDIE

06:34.961 --> 06:35.528
GRAY.

06:35.528 --> 06:36.963
HE GREW UP AND WAS ARRESTED

06:36.963 --> 06:37.564
THERE.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.266
SO LET'S BEGIN "SANDTOWN BY THE

06:39.266 --> 06:39.966
NUMBERS."

06:39.966 --> 06:41.701
IT'S A COMMUNITY OF 14,000

06:41.701 --> 06:43.603
PEOPLE ON BALTIMORE'S WEST SIDE

06:43.603 --> 06:45.205
THAT LIKE SO MANY OTHERS WAS

06:45.205 --> 06:46.573
HARD HIT BY THE LOSS OF

06:46.573 --> 06:48.275
MANUFACTURING JOBS AFTER BIG

06:48.275 --> 06:49.676
COMPANIES LIKE BETHLEHEM STEEL

06:49.676 --> 06:50.543
LEFT TOWN.

06:50.543 --> 06:51.911
THE LATEST AVAILABLE NUMBERS PUT

06:51.911 --> 06:52.979
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN

06:52.979 --> 06:55.415
SANDTOWN AT MORE THAN 21%,

06:55.415 --> 06:57.617
ABOUT FOUR TIMES THE NATIONAL

06:57.617 --> 06:58.351
AVERAGE.

06:58.351 --> 07:00.053
ALMOST A THIRD OF THE RESIDENTS

07:00.053 --> 07:01.788
THERE LIVE IN POVERTY; THAT'S

07:01.788 --> 07:03.423
TWICE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.392
WE BEGIN BY LOOKING AT HEALTH

07:05.392 --> 07:06.559
CARE IN SANDTOWN.

07:06.559 --> 07:07.694
FOR MORE ABOUT THIS WE ARE

07:07.694 --> 07:08.995
JOINED BY DR. ROBERT BLUM, THE

07:08.995 --> 07:10.463
DIRECTOR OF JOHNS HOPKINS URBAN

07:10.463 --> 07:11.398
HEALTH INSTITUTE.

07:11.398 --> 07:13.433
THE INSTITUTE IS LESS THAN FIVE

07:13.433 --> 07:14.834
MILES AWAY FROM SANDTOWN.

07:14.834 --> 07:16.102
SO, THERE'S THIS PHRASE ABOUT

07:16.102 --> 07:17.537
THIS GENETIC LOTTERY.

07:17.537 --> 07:19.005
WE DON'T CHOOSE WHO WE'RE BORN

07:19.005 --> 07:19.639
TO, RIGHT?

07:19.639 --> 07:21.508
BUT THE INFANT MORTALITY RATE IN

07:21.508 --> 07:23.076
SANDTOWN IS MORE THAN THREE AND

07:23.076 --> 07:24.577
A HALF TIMES THE NATIONAL

07:24.577 --> 07:27.514
AVERAGE, 21 PER 1,000 BIRTHS

07:27.514 --> 07:28.915
COMPARED TO SIX PER THOUSAND

07:28.915 --> 07:29.716
BIRTHS.

07:29.716 --> 07:30.917
FROM THE VERY OUTSET OF LIFE WE

07:30.917 --> 07:32.352
ALREADY SEE A HUGE DISPARITY IN

07:32.352 --> 07:34.621
HEALTH FOR A PERSON BORN THERE

07:34.621 --> 07:36.623
VERSUS THE AVERAGE AMERICAN.

07:36.623 --> 07:39.225
UNPACK THAT FOR US A BIT.

07:39.225 --> 07:40.627
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, JUST TO

07:40.627 --> 07:42.862
PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, IF

07:42.862 --> 07:45.131
BALTIMORE WERE A COUNTRY, WE

07:45.131 --> 07:47.367
WOULD BE 75th IN THE WORLD

07:47.367 --> 07:49.202
FOR INFANT MORTALITY, BELOW

07:49.202 --> 07:51.171
EVERY INDUSTRIALIZE COUNTRY AND

07:51.171 --> 07:52.639
MANY LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME

07:52.639 --> 07:53.907
COUNTRIES.

07:53.907 --> 07:56.176
WE HAVE PERSISTENT PROBLEMS DUE

07:56.176 --> 07:59.679
TO LACK OF ACCESS TO RESOURCES,

07:59.679 --> 08:02.449
DUE TO PERSISTENT POVERTY, DUE

08:02.449 --> 08:05.352
TO LACK OF EDUCATION, DUE TO

08:05.352 --> 08:06.920
LACK OF OPPORTUNITIES, AND ALL

08:06.920 --> 08:10.690
OF THESE INTERACT TO CREATE AN

08:10.690 --> 08:11.725
ENVIRONMENT WHERE NEITHER

08:11.725 --> 08:14.394
CHILDREN NOR ADULTS THRIVE.

08:14.394 --> 08:15.228
>> Sreenivasan: SO THERE'S

08:15.228 --> 08:16.396
ANOTHER NUMBER WE CAME ACROSS

08:16.396 --> 08:16.896
THAT STRUCK US.

08:16.896 --> 08:18.498
THAT IS LIFE EXPECTANCY IN

08:18.498 --> 08:18.998
SANDTOWN.

08:18.998 --> 08:21.134
IT'S JUST OVER 65 YEARS.

08:21.134 --> 08:23.169
13 YEARS BELOW THE NATIONAL

08:23.169 --> 08:23.937
AVERAGE.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.638
THAT PUTS PEOPLE THERE ON PAR

08:25.638 --> 08:27.540
WITH FOLKS IN PAKISTAN AND

08:27.540 --> 08:28.174
RAWANDA.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.042
WHAT SHOULD WE MAKE OF THAT?

08:29.042 --> 08:32.011
>> SO WHAT WE HAVE IS A WHOLE

08:32.011 --> 08:33.813
SET OF CONDITIONS.

08:33.813 --> 08:35.448
WE KNOW TODAY THAT ONE'S

08:35.448 --> 08:38.385
ENVIRONMENT, ONE'S CONTEXT DRIVE

08:38.385 --> 08:40.787
THEIR LIFE EXPECTANCY, DRIVE

08:40.787 --> 08:43.223
THEIR HEALTH STATUS, AND TO LIVE

08:43.223 --> 08:45.158
IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF PERSISTENT

08:45.158 --> 08:46.659
POVERTY, WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING

08:46.659 --> 08:48.762
ABOUT ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE.

08:48.762 --> 08:50.597
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ACCESS TO

08:50.597 --> 08:52.098
FOOD, HEALTHY FOOD.

08:52.098 --> 08:53.800
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ACCESS TO

08:53.800 --> 08:56.035
EXERCISE AND RECREATIONAL

08:56.035 --> 08:56.736
PLACES.

08:56.736 --> 08:58.972
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SANITATION.

08:58.972 --> 09:01.007
OUR ENVIRONMENTS IN

09:01.007 --> 09:02.842
SANDTOWN/WINCHESTER IS ONE

09:02.842 --> 09:04.210
EXAMPLE, BUT THERE ARE MANY

09:04.210 --> 09:05.612
COMMUNITIES LIKE THAT IN

09:05.612 --> 09:08.114
BALTIMORE WHERE THE ENTIRE

09:08.114 --> 09:09.983
ENVIRONMENT, BOTH THE PHYSICAL

09:09.983 --> 09:11.418
AND SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT, IS

09:11.418 --> 09:13.253
TOXIC.

09:13.253 --> 09:14.320
>> Sreenivasan: YOU WROTE IN

09:14.320 --> 09:16.356
THE "WASHINGTON POST," TEENAGERS

09:16.356 --> 09:17.390
IN BALTIMORE FACE POORER HEALTH

09:17.390 --> 09:19.292
AND MORE NEGATIVE OUTLOOKS THAN

09:19.292 --> 09:22.128
THOSE IN URBAN CENTERS OF

09:22.128 --> 09:22.028
NIGERIA AND CHINA."

09:22.028 --> 09:23.430
HOW DOES THIS AFFECT THE

09:23.430 --> 09:25.098
PERCEPTIONS THAT THEY HAVE OF

09:25.098 --> 09:26.499
THE WORLD?

09:28.635 --> 09:30.036
>> THE PERCEPTION THEY HAVE

09:30.036 --> 09:33.273
BECAUSE OF LACK OF OPPORTUNITY,

09:33.273 --> 09:36.009
BECAUSE OF BEING LEFT OUT OF ANY

09:36.009 --> 09:37.777
AMERICAN DREAM IS THAT THERE

09:37.777 --> 09:39.279
ISN'T ANY INSTITUTION THEY

09:39.279 --> 09:40.079
TRUST.

09:40.079 --> 09:41.714
THE FOCUS THIS PAST WEEK HAS

09:41.714 --> 09:43.283
BEEN ON THE POLICE AND LACK OF

09:43.283 --> 09:43.883
TRUST FOR THE POLICE.

09:43.883 --> 09:45.785
BUT THERE'S LACK OF TRUST FOR

09:45.785 --> 09:46.953
EDUCATION, FOR GOVERNMENT, FOR

09:46.953 --> 09:48.354
SOCIAL SERVICES.

09:48.354 --> 09:52.425
THEY DON'T TRUST ANY ADULT

09:52.425 --> 09:54.561
BECAUSE IN FACT MANY OF THEM

09:54.561 --> 09:57.197
REPORT THAT THEY LIVE IN

09:57.197 --> 09:59.332
PERSISTENT FEAR IN HOME, IN

09:59.332 --> 10:00.934
SCHOOL, IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.669
THEIR LIVES ARE CONSISTENT FEAR.

10:02.669 --> 10:03.837
>> Sreenivasan: FOCUSING IN ON

10:03.837 --> 10:06.239
HEALTH CARE, WHAT KIND OF ACCESS

10:06.239 --> 10:08.007
CHALLENGES ARE THERE IN THIS

10:08.007 --> 10:08.741
NEIGHBORHOOD?

10:08.741 --> 10:09.542
I MEAN, JUST WHEN I WAS THERE IN

10:09.542 --> 10:11.010
THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, I MET

10:11.010 --> 10:12.045
SEVERAL OF THESE FOLKS WHO DON'T

10:12.045 --> 10:13.813
HAVE TRANSPORTATION, SO FOR

10:13.813 --> 10:15.648
THEM, EVEN THE BURNED DOWN CVS

10:15.648 --> 10:16.983
WAS A SERIOUS PROBLEM OF WHERE

10:16.983 --> 10:18.184
THEY WERE GOING TO GET THEIR

10:18.184 --> 10:20.320
PRESCRIPTIONS FILLED.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.421
>> ABSOLUTELY.

10:21.421 --> 10:23.356
SO LACK OF TRANSPORTATION IS A

10:23.356 --> 10:25.225
BIG ISSUE.

10:25.225 --> 10:28.094
LACK OF HEALTHY FOOD IS A HUGE

10:28.094 --> 10:28.962
ISSUE.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.697
MANY PEOPLE IN THESE COMMUNITIES

10:30.697 --> 10:34.234
HAVE TO TRAVEL MILES WITHOUT ANY

10:34.234 --> 10:35.869
TRANSPORTATION TO GET TO A

10:35.869 --> 10:39.572
GROCERY STORE, A GREEN GROCER.

10:39.572 --> 10:41.541
FOR MANY, LACK OF ACCESS TO

10:41.541 --> 10:43.476
HEALTH CARE SERVICES.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.778
THESE ARE COMPOUNDED BY

10:45.778 --> 10:47.881
PERSISTENT TRAUMA THAT PEOPLE IN

10:47.881 --> 10:49.616
OUR NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE.

10:49.616 --> 10:55.121
FOR EXAMPLE, CHILDREN HAVE, ON

10:55.121 --> 10:57.891
AVERAGE, TWO-- EXPERIENCE TWO

10:57.891 --> 10:59.125
ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES.

10:59.125 --> 11:04.764
THIS IS EXTREME VIOLENCE.

11:04.764 --> 11:06.132
APPROXIMATELY 18% SAY THEY HAVE

11:06.132 --> 11:07.467
WITNESSED A RELATIVE OR A FRIEND

11:07.467 --> 11:09.202
OR SOMEONE THEY KNEW HAVING BEEN

11:09.202 --> 11:10.870
SHOT OR KILLED.

11:10.870 --> 11:12.405
SO KIDS GROW UP IN THESE KINDS

11:12.405 --> 11:15.975
OF ENVIRONMENTS, AND THAT KIND

11:15.975 --> 11:19.045
OF TOXIC STRESS TAKES A HUGE

11:19.045 --> 11:20.547
TOLL ON PHYSICAL HEALTH AS WELL

11:20.547 --> 11:22.448
AS MENTAL HEALTH.

11:22.448 --> 11:24.384
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ARE A

11:24.384 --> 11:26.519
TREMENDOUS SET OF CONCERNS FOR

11:26.519 --> 11:27.120
PEOPLE.

11:27.120 --> 11:27.820
AND IT BECOMES

11:27.820 --> 11:29.289
INTERGENERATIONAL.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.658
IT'S PASSED FROM MOTHER TO CHILD

11:31.658 --> 11:33.459
OR FATHER TO CHILD, NOT

11:33.459 --> 11:35.662
GENETICALLY OR BIOLOGICAL, BUT

11:35.662 --> 11:37.096
SOCIALLY, AND THAT'S THE

11:37.096 --> 11:38.064
CONTEXT.

11:38.064 --> 11:38.865
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

11:38.865 --> 11:40.066
DR. ROBERT BLUM, DIRECTOR OF

11:40.066 --> 11:41.367
JOHNS HOPKINS URBAN HEALTH

11:41.367 --> 11:41.935
INSTITUTE.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.303
THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.

11:44.804 --> 11:45.605
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

11:45.605 --> 11:46.806
HAVING ME.

11:59.252 --> 12:00.053
>> Sreenivasan: OF COURSE, ALL

12:00.053 --> 12:01.821
WEEK LONG, WE'VE SEEN MANY YOUNG

12:01.821 --> 12:04.490
PEOPLE FROM SANDTOWN/WINCHESTER,

12:04.490 --> 12:05.992
OTHER INNER CITY BALTIMORE

12:05.992 --> 12:07.694
COMMUNITIES ALONG WITH MANY

12:07.694 --> 12:09.228
OTHER CONCERNED CITIZENS

12:09.228 --> 12:10.263
PROTESTING, THE DEATH OF FREDDIE

12:10.263 --> 12:11.664
GRAY AT THE HANDS OF POLICE.

12:11.664 --> 12:12.865
FOR A LOOK AT RELATIONS WITH THE

12:12.865 --> 12:14.300
POLICE, WE ARE JOINED NOW BY

12:14.300 --> 12:15.568
NATASHA PRATT-HARRIS, A Ph.D.,

12:15.568 --> 12:16.836
AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF

12:16.836 --> 12:17.637
CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND SOCIOLOGY

12:17.637 --> 12:18.404
AT MORGAN STATE UNIVERSITY IN

12:18.404 --> 12:19.439
BALTIMORE.

12:19.439 --> 12:20.673
PROFESSOR, I WANT TO PLAY YOU A

12:20.673 --> 12:22.408
CLIP WE CAME ACROSS THIS WEEK.

12:22.408 --> 12:23.610
IT'S OF A MAN TALKING ABOUT

12:23.610 --> 12:25.011
HOW HE BELIEVES POLICE TREAT

12:25.011 --> 12:27.614
MEN OF COLOR AS SUSPECTS.

12:27.614 --> 12:30.650
>> IT REALLY HURTS WHEN YOU COME

12:30.650 --> 12:32.118
OUT IN THE MORNING AND YOU JUST

12:32.118 --> 12:33.353
CAN'T COME OUT, TAKE DEEP BREATH

12:33.353 --> 12:35.088
AND TAKE A WALK.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.190
YOU CAN'T EVEN TAKE A WALK,

12:37.190 --> 12:43.596
BECAUSE WHEN YOU DO, HALF OF THE

12:43.596 --> 12:43.262
TIMES THEY ARE STARING AT YOU,

12:43.262 --> 12:44.364
THEY ARE LOOKING AT YOU.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.666
YOU GOT SOMETHING PLANNED, IN

12:46.666 --> 12:47.600
THEIR MINDS.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.401
>> Sreenivasan: IS THAT A FAIR

12:48.401 --> 12:49.335
DESCRIPTION ABOUT WHAT'S

12:49.335 --> 12:50.169
HAPPENING?

12:50.169 --> 12:51.404
>> I WOULD SAY HE'S SPEAKING HIS

12:51.404 --> 12:52.705
TRUTH.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.507
I ACTUALLY GREW UP IN THE CITY

12:54.507 --> 12:55.842
OF BALTIMORE, ATTENDED PUBLIC

12:55.842 --> 12:57.076
SCHOOLS.

12:57.076 --> 12:58.544
I ACTUALLY TEACH IN THE CITY OF

12:58.544 --> 12:59.379
BALTIMORE AT MORGAN STATE

12:59.379 --> 13:00.980
UNIVERSITY.

13:00.980 --> 13:03.182
I HAVE NOT MET A MAN OF COLOR IN

13:03.182 --> 13:04.817
THIS CITY WHO SPENT ANY

13:04.817 --> 13:05.852
SIGNIFICANT TIME IN THE CITY WHO

13:05.852 --> 13:08.788
HASN'T HAD THAT EXPERIENCE, AN

13:08.788 --> 13:11.290
EXPERIENCE THAT WAS IN SOME WAYS

13:11.290 --> 13:11.924
NEGATIVE, SOME NEGATIVE

13:11.924 --> 13:13.593
ENCOUNTER.

13:13.593 --> 13:15.194
SO WHAT HE SAID DOES NOT

13:15.194 --> 13:15.795
SURPRISE ME.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.664
I WILL SAY THAT, YOU KNOW, WE

13:17.664 --> 13:19.499
DON'T NECESSARILY HEAR VOICES

13:19.499 --> 13:21.467
LIKE HIS SHARING WHAT'S

13:21.467 --> 13:22.735
HAPPENED.

13:22.735 --> 13:25.238
SO IT'S WITHOUT A DOUBT A FAIR

13:25.238 --> 13:26.472
DESCRIPTION.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.740
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO

13:27.740 --> 13:29.976
MAKE CERTAIN IS CLEAR, HOWEVER,

13:29.976 --> 13:33.046
IS THAT IS NOT THE ONLY

13:33.046 --> 13:33.980
EXPERIENCE FOR RESIDENTS OF THE

13:33.980 --> 13:35.648
CITY WHEN IT COMES TO LAW

13:35.648 --> 13:36.582
ENFORCEMENT.

13:36.582 --> 13:39.152
THERE ARE QUITE A FEW POSITIVE

13:39.152 --> 13:41.888
ENCOUNTERS, BUT THOSE NEGATIVE

13:41.888 --> 13:43.556
ONES OUTWEIGH THE POSITIVE,

13:43.556 --> 13:46.192
SIMILAR TO THIS PAST WEEK.

13:46.192 --> 13:48.494
WE'VE SEEN THE NEGATIVE

13:48.494 --> 13:50.530
DEPICTIONS OF PERSONS WHO WERE

13:50.530 --> 13:53.166
ENGAGED IN VIOLENT CRIMINAL ACTS

13:53.166 --> 13:55.601
AND THOSE NEGATIVE THINGS

13:55.601 --> 13:57.370
OUTWEIGHED THE VERY POSITIVE

13:57.370 --> 13:58.771
THINGS THAT HAPPENED.

13:58.771 --> 14:00.306
>> Sreenivasan: YOUNG MEN ARE

14:00.306 --> 14:01.841
ARRESTED AT A MUCH HIGHER RATE

14:01.841 --> 14:03.176
THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.410
ACTUALLY, MORE THAN FIVE TIMES

14:04.410 --> 14:06.179
AS OFTEN.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.847
SO HOW DO COMMUNITY RELATIONS,

14:07.847 --> 14:09.482
POLICE RELATIONS SUFFER OR HOW

14:09.482 --> 14:10.717
ARE THEY AFFECTED BY THIS?

14:10.717 --> 14:12.218
>> I WILL KIND OF SPEAK TO WHY

14:12.218 --> 14:13.186
THAT'S HAPPENING.

14:13.186 --> 14:16.122
THERE'S THIS DEBATE THAT THE

14:16.122 --> 14:17.890
RATIONALE BEHIND THAT NUMBER IS

14:17.890 --> 14:20.827
RELATED TO THE INCIDENCES OF

14:20.827 --> 14:22.495
VIOLENCE OR THE RATE BY WHICH

14:22.495 --> 14:25.932
PERSONS ARE ENGAGING CRIMINALLY.

14:25.932 --> 14:27.266
SO THE ONE SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT

14:27.266 --> 14:28.968
IS IF PEOPLE ARE ENGAGING

14:28.968 --> 14:30.803
CRIMINALLY, THEY'RE GOING TO BE

14:30.803 --> 14:31.437
DETAINED.

14:31.437 --> 14:32.472
THEY'RE GOING TO BE ARRESTED BY

14:32.472 --> 14:34.173
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

14:34.173 --> 14:37.110
BUT THE OTHER ARGUMENT IS THAT

14:37.110 --> 14:39.579
THEY HAD MORE CONTACT WITH THE

14:39.579 --> 14:40.012
POLICE.

14:40.012 --> 14:42.815
THAT MEANS THAT POLICE ARE IN

14:42.815 --> 14:44.650
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

14:44.650 --> 14:45.818
IMPOVERISHED.

14:45.818 --> 14:47.086
THEY ARE ACTUALLY IDENTIFYING

14:47.086 --> 14:48.488
INDIVIDUALS AS ENGAGING

14:48.488 --> 14:49.956
CRIMINALLY.

14:49.956 --> 14:51.724
IF THERE'S MORE CONTACT WITH LAW

14:51.724 --> 14:54.260
ENFORCEMENT, THERE'S MORE

14:54.260 --> 14:55.828
LIKELIHOOD OF ENCOUNTER, WHICH

14:55.828 --> 14:58.931
LENDS ITSELF TO CONTAINMENT AND

14:58.931 --> 14:59.832
LATER INCARCERATION.

14:59.832 --> 15:00.666
>> Sreenivasan: THERE ARE

15:00.666 --> 15:01.868
GOING TO BE PEOPLE WHO SAY,

15:01.868 --> 15:05.438
LOOK, THE HOMICIDE RATE IN

15:05.438 --> 15:06.139
SANDTOWN/WINCHESTER IS SO MANY

15:06.139 --> 15:07.240
TIMES THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.908
DON'T THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THIS

15:08.908 --> 15:10.977
COMMUNITY DESERVE A POLICE

15:10.977 --> 15:12.111
PRESENCE TO PROTECT

15:12.111 --> 15:12.745
THEMSELVES?

15:12.745 --> 15:15.782
I MEAN, WE HAD A DOCTOR ON WHO

15:15.782 --> 15:17.083
TALKED ABOUT HOW MOST KIDS THERE

15:17.083 --> 15:18.951
WITNESS A COUPLE OF TRAUMATIC

15:18.951 --> 15:19.986
EVENTS IN THEIR LIFETIME, WHICH

15:19.986 --> 15:21.020
IS KIND OF SOMETHING THE REST OF

15:21.020 --> 15:22.288
THE COUNTRY DOESN'T CONNECT

15:22.288 --> 15:23.890
WITH.

15:23.890 --> 15:25.658
>> I UNDERSTAND, AND I AGREE

15:25.658 --> 15:29.228
THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE

15:29.228 --> 15:30.763
RESPONSIBLE FOR POLICING, BUT

15:30.763 --> 15:31.764
LAW ENFORCEMENT DOESN'T ONLY

15:31.764 --> 15:33.900
HAVE TO ENGAGE IN THE

15:33.900 --> 15:35.868
TRADITIONAL SENSE OF POLICING.

15:35.868 --> 15:37.403
THERE'S SUCH A THING AS

15:37.403 --> 15:39.872
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, AND THE

15:39.872 --> 15:43.910
BALTIMORE CITY POLICE HAS DONE A

15:43.910 --> 15:46.145
FANTASTIC JOB HISTORICALLY IN

15:46.145 --> 15:48.080
ENGAGING WITH THE COMMUNITY.

15:48.080 --> 15:51.017
AND WE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE

15:51.017 --> 15:52.752
POLICE ATHLETIC LEAGUES WHERE

15:52.752 --> 15:53.486
THEY ENGAGE.

15:53.486 --> 15:54.787
THEY HAD A PRESENCE.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.056
IF YOU ARE ACTUALLY IN THE

15:57.056 --> 15:58.958
PRESENCE AND ENGAGED WITH

15:58.958 --> 16:01.127
MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, THAT'S

16:01.127 --> 16:02.495
ANOTHER WAY TO POLICE BECAUSE

16:02.495 --> 16:05.698
YOU GET A SENSE OF WHO'S WHO AND

16:05.698 --> 16:07.333
WHO'S ENGAGED IN WHAT ACTIVITY,

16:07.333 --> 16:10.970
SO YOU CAN EITHER QUELL OR JUST

16:10.970 --> 16:12.338
ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF

16:12.338 --> 16:15.474
SOME CRIMINAL ACTIVITY ENGAGING.

16:15.474 --> 16:19.812
THEN, WHAT WE SEE IS A REACTIVE

16:19.812 --> 16:20.880
TYPE OF POLICING INSTEAD OF

16:20.880 --> 16:21.614
PREVENTION.

16:21.614 --> 16:25.251
WE'RE RESPONDING TO-- I ARGUE--

16:25.251 --> 16:27.787
TO OUR FEAR WHEN WE THINK

16:27.787 --> 16:29.589
ABOUT POLICY, FOR YEARS UNDER

16:29.589 --> 16:31.924
FORMER BALTIMORE MAYOR MARTIN

16:31.924 --> 16:33.559
O'MALLEY, THE CITY INSTITUTE AID

16:33.559 --> 16:35.962
BROKEN WINDOW-STYLE, ZERO

16:35.962 --> 16:37.363
TOLERANCE POLICING AND THEY SAY

16:37.363 --> 16:39.665
CRIME RATES DID DECLINE, LIKE

16:39.665 --> 16:41.634
THEY DID IN MANY BIG CITIES,

16:41.634 --> 16:42.368
INCLUDING NEW YORK.

16:42.368 --> 16:44.070
WHAT ARE THE RIPPLE EFFECTS OF

16:44.070 --> 16:44.604
THAT?

16:44.604 --> 16:46.205
WHY DIDN'T THOSE POLICIES WORK

16:46.205 --> 16:47.139
OR WHAT ARE THE POLICIES THAT

16:47.139 --> 16:48.341
SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED?

16:48.341 --> 16:52.678
>> WELL, THOSE PARTICULAR

16:52.678 --> 16:55.281
POLICIES I WOULD ARGUE WERE--

16:55.281 --> 16:58.284
THEY WERE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING

16:58.284 --> 16:59.518
CRIME-- OR THEY MAY HAVE BEEN

16:59.518 --> 17:01.487
EFFECTIVE.

17:01.487 --> 17:05.358
WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THERE WERE

17:05.358 --> 17:07.093
STILL PAINS AND TROUBLES AND

17:07.093 --> 17:08.194
PROBLEMS IN THOSE VERY

17:08.194 --> 17:09.629
COMMUNITIES PURPOSE THERE WERE

17:09.629 --> 17:11.898
RESOURCES AND PROGRAMS THAT WERE

17:11.898 --> 17:13.866
CUT AFTER-- OR DURING THE

17:13.866 --> 17:16.135
O'MALLEY ADMINISTRATION WHICH IN

17:16.135 --> 17:17.436
FACT CAN SPEAK TO THE VERY

17:17.436 --> 17:19.572
PROBLEMS THAT WE SEE TODAY.

17:19.572 --> 17:21.207
THERE'S JUST SOME SIMPLE THINGS

17:21.207 --> 17:24.243
THAT WE CAN DO TO ADDRESS

17:24.243 --> 17:25.344
COMMUNITY POLICE RELATIONS.

17:25.344 --> 17:27.513
IT BEGINS WITH HAVING A

17:27.513 --> 17:28.748
CONVERSATION.

17:28.748 --> 17:29.815
>> Sreenivasan: OKAY, NATASHA

17:29.815 --> 17:30.683
PRATT-HARRIS, ASSOCIATE

17:30.683 --> 17:31.717
PROFESSOR OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE

17:31.717 --> 17:33.419
AND SOCIOLOGY AT MORGAN STATE

17:33.419 --> 17:34.587
UNIVERSITY IN BALTIMORE.

17:34.587 --> 17:35.855
THANKS SO MUCH.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.190
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

17:43.796 --> 17:44.697
>> Sreenivasan: WE WANTED TO

17:44.697 --> 17:45.698
TURN NOW TO SOCIAL ASPECTS OF

17:45.698 --> 17:46.365
LIFE IN SANDTOWN.

17:46.365 --> 17:47.900
ESPECIALLY FAMILY LIFE.

17:47.900 --> 17:48.734
FOR MORE ABOUT THAT, WE ARE

17:48.734 --> 17:50.002
JOINED BY TARA HUFFMAN FROM THE

17:50.002 --> 17:51.537
OPEN SOCIETY INSTITUTE IN

17:51.537 --> 17:52.238
BALTIMORE.

17:52.238 --> 17:53.339
SHE IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE

17:53.339 --> 17:54.907
CRIMINAL AND JUVENILE JUSTICE

17:54.907 --> 17:56.409
PROGRAM.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.410
SO TARA, I WANT TO START BY

17:57.410 --> 17:58.511
PLAYING YOU A CLIP-- AN EXCERPT

17:58.511 --> 17:59.679
OF WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID

17:59.679 --> 18:00.780
EARLIER THIS WEEK, DESCRIBING

18:00.780 --> 18:02.815
IMPOVERISHED COMMUNITIES ACROSS

18:02.815 --> 18:04.016
THE COUNTRY THAT HE SAID HE HAD

18:04.016 --> 18:05.184
BEEN STRIPPED OF OPPORTUNITY.

18:05.184 --> 18:08.454
>> WHERE CHILDREN ARE BORN INTO

18:08.454 --> 18:13.159
ABJECT POVERTY; THEY'VE GOT

18:13.159 --> 18:14.293
PARENTS-- OFTEN BECAUSE OF

18:14.293 --> 18:15.928
SUBSTANCE-ABUSE PROBLEMS OR

18:15.928 --> 18:17.930
INCARCERATION OR LACK OF

18:17.930 --> 18:20.433
EDUCATION THEMSELVES-- CAN'T DO

18:20.433 --> 18:22.435
RIGHT BY THEIR KIDS.

18:22.435 --> 18:23.836
COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE ARE NO

18:23.836 --> 18:29.342
FATHERS WHO CAN PROVIDE GUIDANCE

18:29.342 --> 18:30.242
TO YOUNG MEN.

18:30.242 --> 18:31.243
>> Sreenivasan: IS THAT A FAIR

18:31.243 --> 18:32.345
PICTURE OF WHAT LIFE IS LIKE IN

18:32.345 --> 18:34.714
SANDTOWN, WINCHESTER AREA?

18:34.714 --> 18:35.614
>> YES, I WOULD SAY THAT'S A

18:35.614 --> 18:37.316
VERY FAIR PICTURE OF WHAT LIFE

18:37.316 --> 18:40.019
IS LIKE IN SANDTOWN/WINCHESTER.

18:40.019 --> 18:41.587
IF YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF

18:41.587 --> 18:43.489
HOUSING POLICY IN BALTIMORE

18:43.489 --> 18:44.757
CITY, YOU'LL SEE THAT IN THE

18:44.757 --> 18:48.227
1910s AND 20s AND 30s, THERE

18:48.227 --> 18:51.230
WERE A SERIES OF CITY ORDINANCES

18:51.230 --> 18:53.232
AND RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AND

18:53.232 --> 18:55.935
RED LINING THAT LOCKED AFRICAN

18:55.935 --> 18:57.670
AMERICAN FAMILIES OUT OF

18:57.670 --> 18:59.638
RESOURCE-RICH NEIGHBORHOODS AND

18:59.638 --> 19:01.340
INTO RESOURCE-POOR

19:01.340 --> 19:02.842
NEIGHBORHOODS.

19:02.842 --> 19:05.478
IN THE 50s, 60s, AND 70s,

19:05.478 --> 19:07.913
THOSE SAME NEIGHBORHOODS WERE

19:07.913 --> 19:09.715
DISPLACED.

19:09.715 --> 19:12.451
UP TO 20,000 FAMILIES DISPLACED

19:12.451 --> 19:13.819
SO THAT THE CITY COULD BUILD NEW

19:13.819 --> 19:15.921
HIGHWAYS AND NEW SCHOOLS AND NEW

19:15.921 --> 19:17.390
HOUSING PROJECTS.

19:17.390 --> 19:18.924
AND THEN CAME THE LOSS OF JOBS

19:18.924 --> 19:22.128
IN THE 1980s, GOOD-PAYING JOBS

19:22.128 --> 19:23.362
THAT DIDN'T REQUIRE A LOT OF

19:23.362 --> 19:24.930
EDUCATION BUT THAT WENT AWAY

19:24.930 --> 19:27.266
WITH THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR.

19:27.266 --> 19:29.068
AND THEN HERE COMES THE 1990s

19:29.068 --> 19:31.404
AND THE 2000s AND THE DRUG WAR

19:31.404 --> 19:32.605
THAT OVER-POLICED,

19:32.605 --> 19:33.973
OVER-CRIMINALIZED AND

19:33.973 --> 19:36.208
OVER-INCARCERATED SCORES OF

19:36.208 --> 19:38.077
AFRICAN AMERICANS, INCLUDING

19:38.077 --> 19:40.112
THOSE IN SANDTOWN/WINCHESTER.

19:40.112 --> 19:40.880
>> Sreenivasan: YOU KNOW, YOU

19:40.880 --> 19:41.580
BRING UP INCARCERATION.

19:41.580 --> 19:43.049
THE RATES IN THESE AREAS ARE

19:43.049 --> 19:44.850
INCREDIBLY HIGH, ALMOST SEVEN

19:44.850 --> 19:46.419
TIMES THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.

19:46.419 --> 19:47.987
HOW DOES THAT PLAY INTO AND

19:47.987 --> 19:49.622
AFFECT THE NOTION OF WHAT WE

19:49.622 --> 19:50.790
CONSIDER A FAMILY OR FAMILY

19:50.790 --> 19:51.624
LIFE?

19:51.624 --> 19:53.025
>> I LIKE TO THINK OF IT SORT OF

19:53.025 --> 19:54.894
AS A JINGA PUZZLE.

19:54.894 --> 19:55.961
IF YOU'RE PLAYING THE GAME OF

19:55.961 --> 19:58.064
JINGA YOU TAKE OUT ONE BLOCK,

19:58.064 --> 19:59.298
THE TOWER STILL STANDS, YOU TAKE

19:59.298 --> 20:00.699
OUT ANOTHER BLOCK, THE TOWER

20:00.699 --> 20:02.902
STILL STANDS, BUT EVENTUALLY YOU

20:02.902 --> 20:04.570
REMOVE TOO MANY BLOCKS AND THE

20:04.570 --> 20:05.905
WHOLE THING COMES CRUMBLING

20:05.905 --> 20:06.639
DOWN.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.107
WHEN YOU PULL OUT TOO MANY

20:08.107 --> 20:10.376
PEOPLE FROM THAT COMMUNITY,

20:10.376 --> 20:12.011
PARTICULARLY TOO MANY AFRICAN

20:12.011 --> 20:14.513
AMERICAN MEN FROM THAT COMMUNITY

20:14.513 --> 20:15.581
AND EXPECT THAT THE COMMUNITY IS

20:15.581 --> 20:17.550
GOING TO BE BETTER, YOUR

20:17.550 --> 20:19.351
APPROACH IS FLAWED.

20:19.351 --> 20:20.419
YOU CANNOT CONTINUE TO

20:20.419 --> 20:23.289
INCARCERATE THAT MANY PEOPLE

20:23.289 --> 20:25.191
FROM A COMMUNITY AND NOT EXPECT

20:25.191 --> 20:26.592
THE COMMUNITY TO SUFFER.

20:26.592 --> 20:28.461
AND THEN AFTER SOME PERIOD OF

20:28.461 --> 20:30.262
TIME, RELEASE THOSE SAME PEOPLE

20:30.262 --> 20:32.131
BACK INTO THAT COMMUNITY BUT NOW

20:32.131 --> 20:33.566
THEY HAVE A CRIMINAL HISTORY

20:33.566 --> 20:35.201
THAT'S GOING TO PREVENT THEM

20:35.201 --> 20:37.169
FROM GETTING EMPLOYMENT, FINDING

20:37.169 --> 20:38.604
DECENT HOUSING, AND BEING

20:38.604 --> 20:40.439
THE KIND OF MEN AND FATHERS AND

20:40.439 --> 20:41.941
BROTHERS AND SONS THAT THEY WANT

20:41.941 --> 20:44.076
TO BE AND THAT EVERYONE EXPECTS

20:44.076 --> 20:45.411
THEM TO BE.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.378
>> Sreenivasan: I WANT TO READ

20:46.378 --> 20:47.446
YOU SOME COMMENTS HERE, ALSO,

20:47.446 --> 20:49.849
FROM RAND PAUL, THE SENATOR AND

20:49.849 --> 20:50.749
ALSO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ON

20:50.749 --> 20:52.585
THE PROTEST INVOLVEMENT IN WEEK:

20:59.291 --> 21:00.693
YOUR REACTION TO THAT?

21:00.693 --> 21:02.261
>> WE CANNOT TALK ABOUT

21:02.261 --> 21:03.696
BREAKDOWN OF FAMILIES AND

21:03.696 --> 21:05.397
BREAKDOWN OF THE MORAL CODE

21:05.397 --> 21:07.032
WITHOUT ALSO TALKING ABOUT

21:07.032 --> 21:10.069
GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN EITHER

21:10.069 --> 21:11.470
INVESTING IN THESE FAMILIES AND

21:11.470 --> 21:12.872
THESE COMMUNITIES OR NOT

21:12.872 --> 21:14.106
INVESTING IN THESE FAMILIES AND

21:14.106 --> 21:15.274
THESE COMMUNITIES.

21:15.274 --> 21:18.511
SO IF YOU WANT TO IMPROVE A

21:18.511 --> 21:19.979
SANDTOWN/WINCHESTER, IF YOU WANT

21:19.979 --> 21:23.182
TO PREVENT ANOTHER FREDDIE GRAY,

21:23.182 --> 21:24.216
THEN WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE IS

21:24.216 --> 21:25.551
NOT JUST INVESTMENT-- BECAUSE

21:25.551 --> 21:26.952
INVESTMENTS HAVE HAPPENED IN

21:26.952 --> 21:29.088
SANDTOWN/WINCHESTER, BUT THEY'VE

21:29.088 --> 21:30.890
BEEN PIECEMEAL AND THEY'VE BEEN

21:30.890 --> 21:32.725
PILOT PROJECTS, NOT PART OF A

21:32.725 --> 21:34.460
COMPREHENSIVE INVESTMENT

21:34.460 --> 21:35.361
STRATEGY.

21:35.361 --> 21:37.463
AND IT PALES IN COMPARISON TO

21:37.463 --> 21:38.664
THE KINDS OF INVESTMENT WE'VE

21:38.664 --> 21:39.965
SEEN IN OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY,

21:39.965 --> 21:41.433
PARTICULARLY DOWNTOWN AND THOSE

21:41.433 --> 21:43.169
SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOODS.

21:43.169 --> 21:45.004
SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO INVEST,

21:45.004 --> 21:46.172
THEY HAVE TO BE TARGETED

21:46.172 --> 21:48.207
INVESTMENTS THAT DELIBERATELY

21:48.207 --> 21:51.477
DISMANTLE YEARS OF STRUCTURAL

21:51.477 --> 21:53.212
RACISM AND INEQUALITY IN THOSE

21:53.212 --> 21:53.879
COMMUNITIES.

21:53.879 --> 21:54.713
