>> EVERYONE'S SURPRISED.

04:12.219 --> 04:14.788 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TWO TO ONE MARGIN FOR TED CRUZ

04:14.788 --> 04:15.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT IN KANSAS WE ALL UNDERSTAND

04:15.655 --> 04:18.725 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THIS IS A VERY STRONGLY

04:18.725 --> 04:20.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELIGIOUS STATE ON THE

04:20.127 --> 04:21.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICAN SIDE.

04:21.094 --> 04:24.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIKE HUCKABEE WON IN 2008.

04:24.898 --> 04:25.932 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RICK SANTORUM RUN.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CRUZ VICTORY WAS NOT A

04:27.267 --> 04:27.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SURPRISE.

04:27.634 --> 04:29.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT EVERYONE EXPECTED THAT

04:29.302 --> 04:30.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP WOULD DO MUCH

04:30.504 --> 04:32.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETTER THAN HE DID AND GET MUCH

04:32.105 --> 04:35.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLOSER TO THE SENATOR FROM TEXAS

04:35.442 --> 04:36.877 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAN HE DID, WE'VE DISCUSSED

04:36.877 --> 04:39.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT MAY BE A PROBLEM FOR DONALD

04:39.513 --> 04:39.813 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP.

04:39.813 --> 04:42.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE IN

04:42.883 --> 04:44.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLOSE STATES, WE'RE ONLY

04:44.818 --> 04:45.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS CAN VOTE.

04:45.685 --> 04:47.053 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KANSAS WAS JUST SUCH A STATE.

04:47.053 --> 04:51.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON SATURDAY AND HE FELL FAR

04:51.091 --> 04:51.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEHIND TED CRUZ.

04:51.625 --> 04:52.425 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCREEN THERE WERE ANY

04:52.425 --> 04:54.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDICATIONS THAT THE TONE OR TEN

04:54.694 --> 04:55.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR OF THE CONVERSATIONS IN THE

04:55.695 --> 04:57.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAST FEW WEEKS HAVE CHANGED THE

04:57.330 --> 04:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIND EVER KANSAS VOTE?

04:59.966 --> 05:01.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YOU DON'T GET THAT SENSE.

05:01.401 --> 05:04.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU GET THE SENSE THAT TED CRUZ

05:04.371 --> 05:07.841 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS VERY POPULAR WITH RELIGIOUS

05:07.841 --> 05:08.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSERVATIVES, ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.

05:08.608 --> 05:09.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE ARE THE VERY PEOPLE THAT

05:09.776 --> 05:11.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALWAYS GO TO CAUCUS HERE IN

05:11.678 --> 05:13.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KANSAS.

05:13.513 --> 05:15.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS I SUGGESTED THEY DID SO IN

05:15.048 --> 05:16.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LAST TWO CAUCUSES HERE.

05:16.917 --> 05:17.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I DON'T THINK ANYONE WAS

05:17.584 --> 05:18.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SURPRISED BY THAT.

05:18.685 --> 05:19.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, DONALD TRUMP DID MAKE A

05:19.886 --> 05:22.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAST MINUTE APPEARANCE IN KANSAS

05:22.155 --> 05:24.658 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SATURDAY IN WICHITA, TRYING TO

05:24.658 --> 05:26.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RALLY SOME VOTES AND I DID TALK

05:26.193 --> 05:27.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO CAUCUS GOERS TODAY WHO

05:27.861 --> 05:29.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP, THEY'RE

05:29.663 --> 05:30.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL VERY FRUSTRATED WITH

05:30.931 --> 05:32.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNMENT AND SO THAT'S A VERY

05:32.699 --> 05:34.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REAL THING HERE AS IT IS IN

05:34.167 --> 05:34.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER STATES.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH TO GET HIM

05:36.937 --> 05:38.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYWHERE NEAR THE CRUZ

05:38.071 --> 05:39.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POPULARITY.

05:39.906 --> 05:41.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCREEN YOU WERE OUT AT SOME OF

05:41.007 --> 05:42.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE POLLS WHAT DID YOU HEAR FROM

05:42.309 --> 05:43.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE VOTERS?

05:43.210 --> 05:44.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE FRUSTRATION THAT I JUST

05:44.444 --> 05:46.813 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

05:46.813 --> 05:50.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY UPSET WITH WASHINGTON.

05:50.116 --> 05:52.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE CAUCUS GOER TOLD ME NOTHING

05:52.519 --> 05:54.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GETS DONE, SHE REUNITE FOR

05:54.487 --> 05:54.854 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMPHASIS.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU ALSO GET THE SENSE THAT SOME

05:56.923 --> 05:59.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE CAUCUS GOERS ARE VERY

05:59.392 --> 06:00.594 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UPSET AT THE TONE OF THE

06:00.594 --> 06:00.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAMPAIGN.

06:00.961 --> 06:04.264 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE OF THE REPUBLICANS I TALKED

06:04.264 --> 06:05.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH SAID THAT SHE DOESN'T

06:05.832 --> 06:07.601 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISTEN ANY MORE BECAUSE SHE'S

06:07.601 --> 06:08.602 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISAPPOINTED AND DISGUSTED WITH

06:08.602 --> 06:10.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TONE OF THE DEBATE AND

06:10.971 --> 06:12.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISAGREEMENTS PARTICULARLY ON

06:12.105 --> 06:13.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REPUBLICAN SIDE.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'LL HAVE TO SEE IF THAT

06:15.208 --> 06:16.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRANSLATES INTO CONCERN AS WE

06:16.309 --> 06:18.044 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEAD TO THE GENERAL ELECTION OR

06:18.044 --> 06:21.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE

06:21.047 --> 06:21.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONVENTION BECAUSE IT'S NOT

06:21.781 --> 06:23.617 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLEAR THAT IT CHANGED ANY VOTES

06:23.617 --> 06:25.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT PEOPLE ARE FED UP WITH THE

06:25.352 --> 06:26.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LANGUAGE IN THE CAMPAIGN I THINK

06:26.453 --> 06:28.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY ARE FED UP WITH

06:28.421 --> 06:28.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WASHINGTON.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.757 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCREEN LET'S TALK ON THE

06:30.757 --> 06:33.293 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRATIC.

06:33.293 --> 06:35.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKELY TO GO TO BERNIE SANDERS,

06:35.195 --> 06:35.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANY SURPRISE THERE 124.

06:35.795 --> 06:37.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> BREAKING NEWS, RIGHT?

06:37.030 --> 06:39.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY JUST ANNOUNCED 90% HAVE

06:39.432 --> 06:40.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN COUNTED THEY DECLARED

06:40.867 --> 06:41.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SENATOR SANDERS THE WINNER.

06:41.968 --> 06:45.538 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE DON'T KNOW THE MARGIN, SO,

06:45.538 --> 06:47.173 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU WANT TO WAIT A LITTLE BIT

06:47.173 --> 06:48.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNTIL YOU UNDERSTAND WHETHER

06:48.008 --> 06:49.909 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S A TEN-POINT VICTORY FOR TWO

06:49.909 --> 06:50.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POINT VICTORY.

06:50.577 --> 06:53.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT I DO THINK IT REFLECTS THE

06:53.546 --> 06:55.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATURE OF CAUCUSES.

06:55.181 --> 06:57.284 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ALWAYS SEND TO ATTRACT, THE

06:57.284 --> 06:59.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE COMMITTED VOTER, THOSE WHO

06:59.052 --> 07:00.954 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE MORE ENERGETIC ABOUT THEIR

07:00.954 --> 07:02.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CANDIDATE AND THERE'S NO

07:02.355 --> 07:03.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION THAT IN KANSAS BERNIE

07:03.089 --> 07:07.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SANDERS HAS MORE OR HAD MORE

07:07.260 --> 07:07.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENERGY THAN HILLARY CLINTON.

07:07.927 --> 07:10.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HILLARY CLINTON HAD A LOT OF

07:10.664 --> 07:11.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORGANIZATIONS BUT NEVER VISITED

07:11.398 --> 07:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE STATE TO CAMPAIGN HERE.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS ON THE OTHER HAND

07:14.467 --> 07:15.568 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS HERE THURSDAY.

07:15.568 --> 07:16.870 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WAS HERE THE WEEK BEFORE IN

07:16.870 --> 07:20.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KANSAS CITY, HE HAD A HUGE CROWD

07:20.273 --> 07:22.042 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S JUST MORE ENERGY WITH

07:22.042 --> 07:24.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SENATOR SANDERS ON SATURDAY.

07:24.344 --> 07:26.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: MUST CLINTON

07:26.413 --> 07:27.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOST THERE LAST ROUND.

07:27.047 --> 07:29.149 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IN 2008 TO BARACK OBAMA WHERE

07:29.149 --> 07:31.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SAME PHENOMENON PLAYED OUT.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU WOULD NOT THINK THAT SOMEONE

07:33.720 --> 07:36.022 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE BARACK OBAMA, THE FIRST

07:36.022 --> 07:37.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFRICAN AMERICAN CANDIDATE WOULD

07:37.157 --> 07:38.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO WELL IN A STATE LIKE KANSAS.

07:38.758 --> 07:40.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT HE DID QUITE WELL BECAUSE OF

07:40.794 --> 07:42.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COMMITTED VOTERS WHO TURNED

07:42.429 --> 07:43.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT IN LARGE NUMBERS.

07:43.430 --> 07:45.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, TURN OUT TODAY WAS MUCH

07:45.098 --> 07:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LARGER IN KANSAS ON THE

07:46.933 --> 07:48.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRATIC SIDE THAN IT WAS IN

07:48.034 --> 07:49.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
2008.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THAT SHOWS YOU THE

07:51.004 --> 07:52.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENTHUSIASM NOR THE SENATOR.

07:52.605 --> 07:53.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHETHER THAT HELPS HIM DOWN THE

07:53.540 --> 07:54.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROAD WE'LL HAVE TO SEE.

07:54.741 --> 07:57.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT ON THIS SATURDAY AT LEAST

07:57.377 --> 07:58.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS WAS QUITE THE

07:58.945 --> 08:00.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTRACTION FOR KANSAS.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
