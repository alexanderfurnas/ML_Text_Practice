TIM KAINE (D-VA), Vice
Presidential Candidate: Do you
believe in a stronger together
America,

00:03.237 --> 00:03.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or do you believe that
we're a crippled America?

00:06.106 --> 00:06.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE PENCE (R-IN), Vice
Presidential Candidate: With the
strong leadership that Donald
Trump

00:06.840 --> 00:06.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will bring to the White House,
we're very confident that we can
bring real change.

00:08.275 --> 00:09.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

when we work as a team.

00:09.076 --> 00:09.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's what Hillary
Clinton believes.

GOV.

00:12.012 --> 00:31.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: And when we elect
Donald Trump, they will have a
team and a partner in the

00:31.932 --> 00:32.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
White House to march back up to
a stronger and greater America.

00:32.299 --> 00:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Good evening.

00:33.066 --> 00:34.601 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:34.601 --> 00:36.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:36.570 --> 00:39.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Welcome to this "PBS NewsHour"
special, coverage of the one
vice presidential debate between

00:39.806 --> 00:43.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republican Mike Pence
and Democrat Tim Kaine.

00:43.877 --> 00:48.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The stage is set at Longwood
University in Farmville,
Virginia.

00:48.882 --> 00:54.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While the level of anticipation
pales in comparison to last
week's showdown between Hillary
Clinton

00:54.054 --> 00:57.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Donald Trump, there is
still a lot on the line, Gwen.

00:57.124 --> 00:59.559 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: There is, Judy.

00:59.559 --> 01:04.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a chance for these two men
to introduce themselves to the
nation, but, more important,

01:04.464 --> 01:07.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to bolster the top of
their respective tickets.

01:07.334 --> 01:12.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Elaine Quijano of CBS News and
their digital channel, CBSN,
will moderate.

01:12.539 --> 01:17.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And joining us at the table, our
regular contributors, syndicated
columnist Mark Shields, from The

01:17.377 --> 01:20.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cook Political Report, Amy
Walter, and Washington Post
columnist Michael Gerson.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.215 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome, all.

01:22.215 --> 01:24.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Here is the question
of the night.

01:24.284 --> 01:25.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why does the vice
presidential debate matter?

01:25.852 --> 01:26.820 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Michael Gerson?

01:26.820 --> 01:29.222 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:29.222 --> 01:29.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON, The Washington
Post: Well, I think Republicans
actually need some good

01:29.122 --> 01:31.425 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
news after a historic trouncing.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.293 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And so there's
morale issue here.

01:33.293 --> 01:35.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they need a good night.

01:35.128 --> 01:36.830 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter?

01:36.830 --> 01:39.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: I absolutely agree.

01:39.599 --> 01:42.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have the role of
playing stabilizer.

01:42.970 --> 01:47.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For Mike Pence, it is to get
Trump and the Trump campaign
back on track, to sort of
stabilize

01:47.474 --> 01:50.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
after the big fall
of this past week.

01:50.978 --> 01:52.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for Tim Kaine, it's to
stabilize Hillary Clinton's
lead.

01:52.479 --> 01:54.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She has the momentum.

01:54.414 --> 01:57.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She's looking strong right now.

01:57.317 --> 02:02.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But can he help her withstand
what I think, for Mike Pence, is
going to be a much more

02:02.522 --> 02:07.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
focused and much more
policy-oriented critique of the
Clinton campaign?

02:07.461 --> 02:10.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Mark, who are
the stakes higher for?

02:10.497 --> 02:14.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think are
awfully, I think, obviously
higher for Pence and for Trump,

02:14.368 --> 02:16.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because he's trying
to stop the bleeding.

02:16.837 --> 02:19.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's trying to right the ship
from listing, or whatever bad
metaphor you want to use,

02:19.973 --> 02:22.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or I want to use.

02:22.542 --> 02:29.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, no, they have had a
terrible week, just a terrible
week, and much -- totally
self-inflicted.

02:29.049 --> 02:35.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it's to Mike Pence to
restore a sense of rationality,
of purpose, and to be a
character

02:35.155 --> 02:37.858 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
witness.

02:37.858 --> 02:40.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, this -- it's
fascinating, because Todd Purdum
in Politico called this the
battle

02:40.260 --> 02:42.195 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the normals.

02:42.195 --> 02:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, Mike -- Kaine and Mike
Pence are very normal people.

02:46.933 --> 02:50.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Michael
Gerson, that means that there's
some -- that people are going

02:50.937 --> 02:53.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be watching to say, what is
going to make news tonight?

02:53.040 --> 02:55.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Just a couple of seconds.

02:55.242 --> 02:56.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: Well, they will
have -- these are normal people
that will have to discover

02:56.176 --> 02:58.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their inner attack dog.

02:58.679 --> 03:03.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the role of a vice
presidential candidate, to press
the case against the opposition.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Both of them need to do that.

03:04.117 --> 03:05.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.888 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And now we go to
Farmville, Virginia.

03:07.888 --> 03:10.023 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Here is Elaine
Quijano of CBS News.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She's the moderator
of tonight's debate.

03:12.325 --> 03:12.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She will introduce
the two candidates.

03:12.926 --> 03:15.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUIJANO: Good evening.

03:15.562 --> 03:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From Longwood University in
Farmville, Virginia, and welcome
to the first, and only, vice
presidential

03:19.766 --> 03:24.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debate of 2016, sponsored by the
Commission on Presidential
Debates.

03:24.237 --> 03:29.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUIJANO: I'm Elaine Quijano,
anchor at CBSN, and
correspondent for CBS News.

03:29.843 --> 03:35.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's an honor to moderate this
debate between Senator Tim Kaine
and Governor Mike Pence.

03:35.615 --> 03:39.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Both are longtime public
servants who are also proud
fathers of sons serving in the

03:39.820 --> 03:42.089 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
U.S. Marines.

03:42.089 --> 03:45.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The campaigns have agreed to the
rules of this 90-minute debate.

03:45.425 --> 03:50.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There will be nine different
segments covering domestic and
foreign policy issues.

03:50.530 --> 03:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Each segment will begin with a
question to both candidates who
will each have two minutes

03:53.433 --> 03:56.002 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to answer.

03:56.002 --> 04:00.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Then I'll ask follow-up
questions to facilitate a
discussion between the
candidates.

04:00.474 --> 04:04.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
By coin toss, it's been
determined that Senator Kaine
will be first to answer the
opening

04:04.978 --> 04:06.780 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
question.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
QUIJANO: We have an
enthusiastic audience tonight.

04:09.583 --> 04:15.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They've agreed to only express
that enthusiasm once at the end
of the debate and right now

04:15.322 --> 04:24.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as we welcome Governor Mike
Pence and Senator Tim Kaine.

04:24.764 --> 04:28.635 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

04:28.635 --> 04:37.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Gentlemen, welcome.

04:37.144 --> 04:47.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It truly is a privilege to
be with both of you tonight.

04:47.621 --> 04:51.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUIJANO: I'd like to start with
the topic of presidential
leadership.

04:51.525 --> 04:56.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Twenty-eight years ago tomorrow
night, Lloyd Bentsen said the
vice presidential debate

04:56.763 --> 05:02.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was not about the qualifications
for the vice presidency, but
about how if tragedy should

05:02.903 --> 05:08.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
occur, the vice president has to
step in without any margin for
error, without time for
preparation,

05:08.608 --> 05:13.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to take over the responsibility
for the biggest job in the
world.

05:13.446 --> 05:17.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What about your qualities, your
skills, and your temperament
equip you to step into that

05:17.484 --> 05:18.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
role at a moment's notice?

05:18.885 --> 05:21.288 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Senator Kaine?

05:21.288 --> 05:24.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: Elaine, thank you for
being here tonight, and,
Governor Pence, welcome.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is so great to be back at
Longwood University in
Farmville, Virginia.

05:27.627 --> 05:30.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a very special place.

05:30.931 --> 05:35.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sixty-five years ago, a young,
courageous woman, Barbara Johns,
led a walkout of her

05:35.835 --> 05:38.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
high school, Moton High School.

05:38.271 --> 05:41.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She made history by protesting
school segregation.

05:41.675 --> 05:45.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She believed our nation
was stronger together.

05:45.612 --> 05:48.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that walkout led to the
Brown v. Board of Education
decision that moved us down the

05:48.415 --> 05:51.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
path toward equality.

05:51.084 --> 05:56.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am so proud to be running with
another strong, history-making
woman, Hillary Clinton, to

05:56.423 --> 05:59.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be president of the
United States.

05:59.025 --> 06:03.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm proud because her vision of
stronger together, building an
economy that works for all, not

06:03.897 --> 06:09.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just those at the top, being
safe in the world not only with
a strong military, but also

06:09.736 --> 06:15.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strong alliances to battle
terrorism and climate change,
and also to build a community of
respect,

06:15.675 --> 06:18.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
just like Barbara Johns
tried to do 65 years ago.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's why I'm so proud
to be her running mate.

06:20.747 --> 06:24.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary told me why she asked
me to be her running mate.

06:24.084 --> 06:27.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She said the test of a Clinton
administration will not be the
signing of a bill or the passage

06:27.554 --> 06:30.090 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of a bill.

06:30.090 --> 06:34.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It'll be whether we can make
somebody's life better, whether
we can make a classroom better

06:34.828 --> 06:38.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
learning environment for
schoolkids or teachers, whether
we can make a safer -- it's
going

06:38.598 --> 06:41.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be about results.

06:41.034 --> 06:43.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she said to me, you've been
a missionary and a civil rights
lawyer.

06:43.803 --> 06:46.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You've been a city
councilman and mayor.

06:46.706 --> 06:50.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You've been a lieutenant
governor and governor and now a
U.S. senator.

06:50.010 --> 06:55.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think you will help me figure
out how to govern this nation so
that we always keep

06:55.081 --> 07:00.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in mind that the success of the
administration is the difference
we make in people's lives.

07:00.787 --> 07:03.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's what I bring to the
ticket, that experience having
served at all levels of

07:03.490 --> 07:05.992 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government.

07:05.992 --> 07:10.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But my primary role is to be
Hillary Clinton's right-hand
person and strong supporter as

07:10.196 --> 07:12.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she puts together the most
historic administration
possible.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I relish that role.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm so proud of her.

07:16.503 --> 07:19.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: I'll just say this: We
trust Hillary Clinton, my wife
and I, and we trust her with

07:19.039 --> 07:21.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the most important
thing in our life.

07:21.408 --> 07:25.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have a son deployed overseas
in the Marine Corps right now.

07:25.145 --> 07:28.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We trust Hillary Clinton as
president and
commander-in-chief, but the
thought of Donald

07:28.214 --> 07:30.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump as commander-in-chief
scares us to death.

07:30.317 --> 07:32.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUIJANO: Governor Pence?

07:32.819 --> 07:37.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: Well, first off, thank
you, Elaine, and thank you to --
thank you to Norwood University

07:37.590 --> 07:40.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for their wonderful hospitality
and the Commission on
Presidential Debates.

07:40.827 --> 07:45.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's deeply humbling for me to
be here, to be surrounded by my
-- my wonderful family.

07:45.732 --> 07:50.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, Senator Kaine, it's an
honor to be here with you, as
well.

07:50.470 --> 07:55.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just -- I also want to say
-- I want to say thanks to
everyone that's looking in

07:55.575 --> 07:58.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tonight, who understands what an
enormously important time this
is in the life of our

07:58.945 --> 08:01.581 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
nation.

08:01.581 --> 08:05.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the last seven-and-a-half
years, we've seen America's
place in the world weakened.

08:05.985 --> 08:14.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We've seen an economy stifled by
more taxes, more regulation, a
war on coal, and a failing

08:14.060 --> 08:16.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health care reform come to be
known as Obamacare, and the
American people know that we
need

08:16.563 --> 08:18.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to make a change.

08:18.665 --> 08:22.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I want to thank all of
you for being -- being with us
tonight.

08:22.202 --> 08:25.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PENCE: I also want to thank
Donald Trump for making that
call and inviting us to be a
part

08:25.505 --> 08:28.274 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of this ticket.

08:28.274 --> 08:31.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have to tell you, I'm a -- I'm
a small-town boy from a place
not too different from
Farmville.

08:31.311 --> 08:34.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I grew up with a cornfield
in my backyard.

08:34.447 --> 08:39.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My grandfather had immigrated to
this country when he was about
my son's age.

08:39.219 --> 08:44.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My mom and dad built a --
everything that matters in a
small town in Southern Indiana.

08:44.090 --> 08:46.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They built a family and -- and
a good name and a business.

08:46.993 --> 08:50.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they raised a family.

08:50.730 --> 08:54.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I dreamed some day of
representing my home town in
Washington, D.C., but I --
honestly,

08:54.534 --> 08:58.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Elaine, I never imagined --
never imagined I'd have the
opportunity to be governor of

08:58.638 --> 09:03.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the state that I love, let alone
be sitting at a table like this
in this kind of a position.

09:03.476 --> 09:03.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. TIM KAINE (D-VA), Vice
Presidential Candidate: Do you
believe in a stronger together
America,

09:03.476 --> 09:05.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or do you believe that
we're a crippled America?

09:05.111 --> 09:06.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GOV. MIKE PENCE (R-IN), Vice
Presidential Candidate: With the
strong leadership that

09:06.112 --> 09:05.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump will bring to the
White House, we're very
confident that we can bring real

09:05.612 --> 09:08.248 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
change.

09:08.248 --> 09:07.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. TIM KAINE: Things work
better when we work as a team.
That's what Hillary Clinton

09:07.714 --> 09:10.216 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
believes.

09:10.216 --> 09:10.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GOV. MIKE PENCE: And when we
elect Donald Trump, they will
have a team and a partner

09:10.817 --> 09:11.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the White House to march back
up to a stronger and greater
America.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.285 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Good
evening. I'm Gwen Ifill.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

09:14.254 --> 09:14.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Welcome to this "PBS NewsHour"
special, coverage of the one
vice presidential debate between

09:14.387 --> 09:16.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republican Mike Pence
and Democrat Tim Kaine.

09:16.423 --> 09:17.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The stage is set at Longwood
University in Farmville,
Virginia. While the level of
anticipation

09:17.190 --> 09:17.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pales in comparison to last
week's showdown between Hillary
Clinton and Donald Trump,

09:17.323 --> 09:18.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there is still a lot
on the line, Gwen.

09:18.024 --> 09:20.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: There is, Judy.

09:20.260 --> 09:20.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a chance for these two men
to introduce themselves to the
nation, but, more important,

09:20.493 --> 09:22.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to bolster the top of
their respective tickets.

09:22.028 --> 09:23.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Elaine Quijano of CBS News and
their digital channel, CBSN,
will moderate.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And joining us at the table, our
regular contributors, syndicated
columnist Mark Shields, from The

09:24.164 --> 09:23.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cook Political Report, Amy
Walter, and Washington Post
columnist Michael Gerson.

09:23.797 --> 09:26.099 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome, all.

09:26.099 --> 09:25.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here is the question of the
night. Why does the vice
presidential debate matter?

09:25.765 --> 09:26.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Michael Gerson?

09:26.733 --> 09:29.135 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

09:29.135 --> 09:29.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON, The Washington
Post: Well, I think Republicans
actually need some good

09:29.035 --> 09:30.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
news after a historic trouncing.

09:30.837 --> 09:31.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so there's morale issue
here. And they need a good
night.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter?

09:32.672 --> 09:34.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: I absolutely agree.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have the role of playing
stabilizer. For Mike Pence, it
is to get Trump and the

09:35.108 --> 09:36.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump campaign back on track, to
sort of stabilize after the big
fall of this past week.

09:36.443 --> 09:37.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for Tim Kaine, it's to
stabilize Hillary Clinton's
lead. She has the momentum.
She's

09:37.177 --> 09:38.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
looking strong right now. But
can he help her withstand what I
think, for Mike Pence,

09:38.311 --> 09:37.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is going to be a much more
focused and much more
policy-oriented critique of the
Clinton

09:37.744 --> 09:39.512 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign?

09:39.512 --> 09:41.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Mark, who are
the stakes higher for?

09:41.214 --> 09:42.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think are
awfully, I think, obviously
higher for Pence and for Trump,

09:42.182 --> 09:42.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because he's trying to stop the
bleeding. He's trying to right
the ship from listing,

09:42.682 --> 09:44.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or whatever bad metaphor you
want to use, or I want to use.

09:44.451 --> 09:45.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, no, they have had a
terrible week, just a terrible
week, and much -- totally
self-inflicted.

09:45.418 --> 09:44.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it's to Mike Pence to
restore a sense of rationality,
of purpose, and to be a
character

09:44.651 --> 09:47.353 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
witness.

09:47.353 --> 09:48.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, this -- it's
fascinating, because Todd Purdum
in Politico called this the
battle

09:48.054 --> 09:49.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the normals. I mean, Mike --
Kaine and Mike Pence are very
normal people.

09:49.289 --> 09:50.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Michael
Gerson, that means that there's
some -- that people are going

09:50.156 --> 09:51.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be watching to say, what is
going to make news tonight? Just
a couple of seconds.

09:51.224 --> 09:52.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: Well, they will
have -- these are normal people
that will have to discover

09:52.125 --> 09:52.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their inner attack dog. This is
the role of a vice presidential
candidate, to press the

09:52.692 --> 09:53.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
case against the opposition.
Both of them need to do that.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.262 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And now we go to
Farmville, Virginia.

09:56.262 --> 09:56.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here is Elaine Quijano of CBS
News. She's the moderator of
tonight's debate. She will

09:56.095 --> 09:58.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
introduce the two candidates.

09:58.398 --> 09:59.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUIJANO: Good evening. From
Longwood University in
Farmville, Virginia, and welcome
to the

09:59.532 --> 09:58.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
first, and only, vice
presidential debate of 2016,
sponsored by the Commission on
Presidential

09:58.665 --> 10:01.334 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Debates.

10:01.334 --> 10:02.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUIJANO: I'm Elaine Quijano,
anchor at CBSN, and
correspondent for CBS News. It's
an honor

10:02.335 --> 10:03.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to moderate this debate between
Senator Tim Kaine and Governor
Mike Pence. Both are longtime

10:03.102 --> 10:04.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
public servants who are also
proud fathers of sons serving in
the U.S. Marines.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The campaigns have agreed to the
rules of this 90-minute debate.
There will be nine

10:05.472 --> 10:06.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
different segments covering
domestic and foreign policy
issues. Each segment will begin
with

10:06.206 --> 10:07.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a question to both candidates
who will each have two minutes
to answer. Then I'll ask

10:07.407 --> 10:08.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
follow-up questions to
facilitate a discussion between
the candidates. By coin toss,
it's

10:08.208 --> 10:09.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been determined that Senator
Kaine will be first to answer
the opening question.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUIJANO: We have an enthusiastic
audience tonight. They've agreed
to only express that

10:10.343 --> 10:09.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
enthusiasm once at the end of
the debate and right now as we
welcome Governor Mike Pence

10:09.976 --> 10:10.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Senator Tim Kaine.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.046 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

10:13.046 --> 10:14.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gentlemen, welcome. It truly is
a privilege to be with both of
you tonight.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUIJANO: I'd like to start with
the topic of presidential
leadership. Twenty-eight years

10:15.448 --> 10:16.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago tomorrow night, Lloyd
Bentsen said the vice
presidential debate was not
about the

10:16.316 --> 10:17.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
qualifications for the vice
presidency, but about how if
tragedy should occur, the vice

10:17.183 --> 10:17.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president has to step in without
any margin for error, without
time for preparation, to

10:17.717 --> 10:19.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
take over the responsibility for
the biggest job in the world.

10:19.285 --> 10:19.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What about your qualities, your
skills, and your temperament
equip you to step into that

10:19.419 --> 10:21.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
role at a moment's
notice? Senator Kaine?

10:21.387 --> 10:21.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAINE: Elaine, thank you for
being here tonight, and,
Governor Pence, welcome. It is
so great

10:21.754 --> 10:23.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to be back at Longwood
University in Farmville,
Virginia.

10:23.356 --> 10:24.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a very special place.
Sixty-five years ago, a young,
courageous woman, Barbara Johns,

10:24.491 --> 10:25.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
led a walkout of her high
school, Moton High School. She
made history by protesting
school

10:25.592 --> 10:26.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
segregation. She believed our
nation was stronger together.
And that walkout led to the
Brown

10:26.059 --> 10:27.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
v. Board of Education decision
that moved us down the path
toward equality.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am so proud to be running with
another strong, history-making
woman, Hillary Clinton, to

10:28.495 --> 10:29.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be president of the United
States. I'm proud because her
vision of stronger together,
building

10:29.295 --> 10:30.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an economy that works for all,
not just those at the top, being
safe in the world not only

10:30.497 --> 10:31.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a strong military, but also
strong alliances to battle
terrorism and climate change,
and

10:31.264 --> 10:31.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also to build a community of
respect, just like Barbara Johns
tried to do 65 years ago.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's why I'm so proud
to be her running mate.

10:33.199 --> 10:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary told me why she asked me
to be her running mate. She said
the test of a Clinton

10:34.200 --> 10:35.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
administration will not be the
signing of a bill or the passage
of a bill. It'll be

10:35.335 --> 10:36.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether we can make somebody's
life better, whether we can make
a classroom better learning

10:36.336 --> 10:35.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
environment for schoolkids or
teachers, whether we can make a
safer -- it's going to be about

10:35.702 --> 10:38.271 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
results.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she said to me, you've been
a missionary and a civil rights
lawyer. You've been a city

10:39.339 --> 10:40.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
councilman and mayor. You've
been a lieutenant governor and
governor and now a U.S. senator.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think you will help me figure
out how to govern this nation so
that we always keep

10:41.274 --> 10:42.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in mind that the success of the
administration is the difference
we make in people's lives.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's what I bring to the
ticket, that experience having
served at all levels of

10:43.576 --> 10:44.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government. But my primary role
is to be Hillary Clinton's
right-hand person and strong
supporter

10:44.644 --> 10:43.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as she puts together the most
historic administration
possible. And I relish that
role. I'm so proud

10:43.710 --> 10:46.379 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of her.

10:46.379 --> 10:47.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: I'll just say this: We
trust Hillary Clinton, my wife
and I, and we trust her with

10:47.313 --> 10:48.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the most important thing in our
life. We have a son deployed
overseas in the Marine Corps

10:48.481 --> 10:48.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right now. We trust Hillary
Clinton as president and
commander-in-chief, but the
thought of

10:48.681 --> 10:48.982 align:left position:25%,start line:80% size:75%
Donald Trump as
commander-in-chief scares us to
death.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUIJANO: Governor Pence?

10:51.351 --> 10:52.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: Well, first off, thank
you, Elaine, and thank you to --
thank you to Norwood University

10:52.519 --> 10:52.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for their wonderful hospitality
and the Commission on
Presidential Debates. It's
deeply humbling

10:52.785 --> 10:54.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
for me to be here, to be
surrounded by my -- my wonderful
family.

10:54.354 --> 10:55.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, Senator Kaine, it's an
honor to be here with you, as
well. And I just -- I also want

10:55.255 --> 10:55.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to say -- I want to say thanks
to everyone that's looking in
tonight, who understands

10:55.922 --> 10:57.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what an enormously important
time this is in the life of our
nation.

10:57.357 --> 10:58.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the last seven-and-a-half
years, we've seen America's
place in the world weakened.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We've seen an economy stifled by
more taxes, more regulation, a
war on coal, and a failing

10:59.559 --> 11:00.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health care reform come to be
known as Obamacare, and the
American people know that we
need

11:00.226 --> 11:01.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make a change. And so I want
to thank all of you for being --
being with us tonight.

11:01.528 --> 11:02.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PENCE: I also want to thank
Donald Trump for making that
call and inviting us to be a
part

11:02.262 --> 11:03.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of this ticket. I have to tell
you, I'm a -- I'm a small-town
boy from a place not too

11:03.296 --> 11:04.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
different from Farmville. I grew
up with a cornfield in my
backyard. My grandfather had

11:04.564 --> 11:05.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immigrated to this country when
he was about my son's age. My
mom and dad built a --
everything

11:05.398 --> 11:06.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that matters in a small town in
Southern Indiana. They built a
family and -- and a good name

11:06.165 --> 11:07.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a business. And they raised
a family. And I dreamed some day
of representing my

11:07.367 --> 11:08.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
home town in Washington, D.C.,
but I -- honestly, Elaine, I
never imagined -- never imagined

11:08.334 --> 11:08.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'd have the opportunity to be
governor of the state that I
love, let alone be sitting

11:08.468 --> 11:10.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at a table like this in
this kind of a position.

11:10.370 --> 11:11.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So to answer your question, I
would say I -- I would hope that
if -- if the responsibility

11:11.371 --> 11:12.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ever fell to me in this role,
that I would meet it with the
way that I'm going to meet

11:12.372 --> 11:13.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the responsibility should I be
elected vice president of the
United States. And that's

11:13.540 --> 11:14.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to bring a lifetime of
experience, a lifetime growing
up in a small town, a lifetime
where

11:14.374 --> 11:15.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I've served in the Congress of
the United States, where --
where I've led a state that

11:15.675 --> 11:16.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
works in the great state of
Indiana, and whatever other
responsibilities might follow
from this,

11:16.376 --> 11:16.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I -- I would hope and, frankly,
I would pray to be able to meet
that moment with that -- that

11:16.009 --> 11:18.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lifetime of experience.

11:18.411 --> 11:19.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, on the
campaign trail, you praised
Secretary Clinton's character,

11:19.379 --> 11:20.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
including her commitment to
public service, yet 60 percent
of voters don't think she's

11:20.547 --> 11:20.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trustworthy. Why do so many
people distrust her? Is it
because they have questions
about

11:20.480 --> 11:22.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
her e-mails and the
Clinton Foundation?

11:22.348 --> 11:23.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: Elaine, let me tell you
why I trust Hillary Clinton.
Here's what people should

11:23.182 --> 11:24.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
look at as they look at a public
servant. Do they have a passion
in their life that

11:24.384 --> 11:25.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
showed up before they were in
public life? And have they held
onto that passion throughout

11:25.351 --> 11:26.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their life, regardless of
whether they were in office or
not, succeeding or failing?

11:26.252 --> 11:27.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Hillary Clinton has that
passion. From a time as a kid in
a Methodist youth group in the

11:27.353 --> 11:28.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
suburbs of Chicago, she has been
focused on serving others with a
special focus on empowering

11:28.288 --> 11:29.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
families and kids. As a civil
rights lawyer in the South, with
the Children's Defense

11:29.322 --> 11:30.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fund, first lady of Arkansas and
this country, senator, secretary
of state, it's always been

11:30.123 --> 11:31.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about putting others first. And
that's a sharp contrast with
Donald Trump.

11:31.324 --> 11:32.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump always puts himself
first. He built a business
career, in the words of one

11:32.392 --> 11:33.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of his own campaign staffers,
"off the backs of the little
guy." And as a candidate, he

11:33.326 --> 11:34.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
started his campaign with a
speech where he called Mexicans
rapists and criminals, and

11:34.327 --> 11:34.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he has pursued the discredited
and really outrageous lie that
President Obama wasn't

11:34.127 --> 11:36.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
born in the United States.

11:36.396 --> 11:37.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is so painful to suggest that
we go back to think about these
days where an African-American

11:37.397 --> 11:38.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could not be a citizen of the
United States. And I can't
imagine how Governor Pence can

11:38.097 --> 11:39.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
defend the insult- driven
selfish "me first" style of
Donald Trump.

11:39.432 --> 11:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUIJANO: Governor Pence, let me
ask you, you have said Donald
Trump is, quote, "thoughtful,

11:40.266 --> 11:41.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
compassionate, and steady." Yet
67 percent of voters feel he is
a risky choice, and 65

11:41.267 --> 11:41.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
percent feel he does not have
the right kind of temperament to
be president. Why do so

11:41.634 --> 11:43.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
many Americans think Mr.
Trump is simply too erratic?

11:43.403 --> 11:44.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: Well, let me -- let me
say first and foremost that,
Senator, you and Hillary Clinton

11:44.671 --> 11:47.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would know a lot about an
insult- driven campaign. It
really is remarkable. At a time
when literally,

11:47.373 --> 11:52.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the wake of Hillary Clinton's
tenure as secretary of state,
where she was the architect

11:52.312 --> 11:56.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Obama administration's
foreign policy, we see entire
portions of the world,
particularly

11:56.916 --> 12:01.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the wider Middle East, literally
spinning out of control. I mean,
the situation we're

12:01.087 --> 12:06.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
watching hour by hour in Syria
today is the result of the
failed foreign policy and the

12:06.059 --> 12:11.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weak foreign policy that Hillary
Clinton helped lead in this
administration and create. The

12:11.598 --> 12:15.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
newly emboldened -- the
aggression of Russia, whether it
was in Ukraine or now they're
heavy-handed

12:15.501 --> 12:17.270 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
approach...

12:17.270 --> 12:18.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAINE: You guys love Russia.
You both have said...

12:18.037 --> 12:19.872 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
PENCE: ... their
heavy-handed approach.

12:19.872 --> 12:20.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: You both have said -- you
both have said Vladimir Putin is
a better leader than

12:20.673 --> 12:21.674 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the president.

12:21.674 --> 12:22.642 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PENCE: Well...

12:22.642 --> 12:25.111 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

12:25.111 --> 12:24.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUIJANO: Well, we're going to
get to Russia in just a moment.
But I do want to get back

12:24.811 --> 12:27.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the question at...

12:27.113 --> 12:28.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: But in the midst --
Elaine, thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, Senator, I'll...

12:28.915 --> 12:30.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: These guys have praised
Vladimir Putin as a great
leader. How can that...

12:30.650 --> 12:33.119 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

12:33.119 --> 12:34.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUIJANO: Yes, and we will get to
that, Senator. We do have that
coming up here. But in the

12:34.687 --> 12:36.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
meantime, the questions...

12:36.189 --> 12:36.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PENCE: Well, Senator,
I must have hit a...

12:36.990 --> 12:38.524 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

12:38.524 --> 12:39.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PENCE: I must have
hit a nerve here.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUIJANO: Why the disconnect?

12:41.561 --> 12:45.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PENCE: Because at a time of
great challenge in the life of
this nation, where we've
weakened

12:45.098 --> 12:48.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
America's place in the world,
stifled America's economy, the
campaign of Hillary Clinton and

12:48.668 --> 12:52.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Tim Kaine has been an
avalanche of insults.

12:52.338 --> 12:59.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, to get to your question
about trustworthiness, Donald
Trump has built a business
through

12:59.112 --> 13:02.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hard times and through good
times. He's brought an
extraordinary business acumen.
He's employed

13:02.582 --> 13:05.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
tens of thousands of
people in this country.

13:05.585 --> 13:07.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAINE: And paid few taxes
and lost a billion a year.

13:07.987 --> 13:09.722 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

13:09.722 --> 13:12.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUIJANO: And why the disconnect
with your running mate?

13:12.091 --> 13:17.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: But there's a -- there's
a reason why people question the
trustworthiness of Hillary

13:17.263 --> 13:20.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton. And that's because
they're paying attention. I
mean, the reality is, when she

13:20.967 --> 13:25.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was secretary of state, Senator,
come on. She had a Clinton
Foundation accepting
contributions

13:25.571 --> 13:27.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from foreign governments.

13:27.640 --> 13:31.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

apprentice. Let me talk about
this...

13:31.344 --> 13:32.979 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

you

14:01.140 --> 14:02.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

When Hillary Clinton became

Osama bin Laden was alive?

14:07.947 --> 14:10.683 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PENCE: Yes.

14:10.683 --> 14:15.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAINE: Do you know that we had
175,000 troops deployed in the
battlefield in Iraq and
Afghanistan?

14:15.288 --> 14:18.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you know that Iran was racing
toward a nuclear weapon and
Russia was expanding its

14:18.091 --> 14:20.560 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stockpile?

14:20.560 --> 14:25.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Under Secretary Clinton's
leadership, she was part of the
national team, public safety

14:25.264 --> 14:29.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
team that went after and revived
the dormant hunt against bin
Laden and wiped him off the

14:29.502 --> 14:33.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
face of the Earth. She worked to
deal with the Russians to reduce
their chemical weapons

14:33.873 --> 14:39.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stockpile. She worked a tough
negotiation with nations around
the world to eliminate

14:39.912 --> 14:42.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Iranian nuclear weapons
program without firing a shot.

14:42.682 --> 14:45.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PENCE: Eliminate the Iranian
nuclear weapons program?

14:45.251 --> 14:49.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: Absolutely, without
firing a shot. And instead of
175,000 American troops deployed

14:49.055 --> 14:50.156 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
overseas, we now have 15,000.

14:50.156 --> 14:51.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PENCE: Right and...

14:51.624 --> 14:53.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KAINE: These are very,
very good things.

14:53.359 --> 14:58.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

by ISIS, because Hillary Clinton
failed to renegotiate...

14:58.231 --> 15:00.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: Well, if you want to put
more American troops in Iraq,
you can propose that.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: Hillary Clinton --
Hillary Clinton -- Hillary

like to correct...

15:11.744 --> 15:14.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PENCE: ... and overrun
vast areas of Iraq.

15:14.347 --> 15:20.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: Governor, President Bush
said we would leave Iraq at the
end of 2011. And, Elaine,

15:20.086 --> 15:24.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iraq didn't want our troops to
stay, and they wouldn't give us
the protection for our troops.

15:24.390 --> 15:28.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And guess what? If a nation
where our troops are serving
does not want us to stay, we're

15:28.628 --> 15:30.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not going to stay without
their protection.

15:30.229 --> 15:31.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PENCE: It was a failure of
the secretary of state...

15:31.497 --> 15:32.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUIJANO: We need to move on
to the next topic, gentlemen.

15:32.799 --> 15:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: If Governor Pence wants
to put more troops back in Iraq,
that's...

15:34.100 --> 15:36.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUIJANO: There are a lot of
people wondering in this country
about the economy. Let's turn

15:36.869 --> 15:37.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the issue of the economy.

15:37.570 --> 15:40.239 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
KAINE: OK.

15:40.239 --> 15:44.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUIJANO: According to the
nonpartisan Committee for a
Responsible Federal Budget,
neither

15:44.110 --> 15:50.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of your economic plans will
reduce the growing $19 trillion
gross national debt. In fact,

15:50.216 --> 15:54.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
your plans would add
even more to it.

15:54.187 --> 15:58.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both of you were governors who
balanced state budgets. Are you
concerned that adding more

15:58.724 --> 16:02.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the debt could be disastrous
for the country. Governor Pence?

16:02.695 --> 16:08.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PENCE: I think the fact that --
that under this past
administration was of which
Hillary

16:08.367 --> 16:14.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton was a part, we've almost
doubled the national debt is
atrocious. I mean, I'm very

16:14.240 --> 16:18.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
proud of the fact that -- I come
from a state that works. The
state of Indiana has balanced

16:18.211 --> 16:23.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
budgets. We cut taxes, we've
made record investments in
education and in infrastructure,
and I

16:23.349 --> 16:27.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
still finish my term with
$2 billion in the bank.

16:27.887 --> 16:31.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a little bit different
than when Senator Kaine was
governor here in Virginia. He
actually

16:31.457 --> 16:36.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- he actually tried to raise
taxes by about $4 billion. He
left his state about $2 billion

16:36.696 --> 16:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the hole. In the state of
Indiana, we've cut unemployment
in half; unemployment doubled

16:39.866 --> 16:42.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
when he was governor.

16:42.201 --> 16:48.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: But I think he's a very
fitting running mate for Hillary
Clinton, because in the wake

16:48.441 --> 16:53.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a season where American
families are struggling in this
economy under the weight of
higher

16:53.145 --> 16:59.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
taxes and Obamacare and the war
on coal and the stifling
avalanche of regulation coming

16:59.151 --> 17:04.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out of this administration,
Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine
want more of the same. It really

17:04.190 --> 17:08.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is remarkable that they actually
are advocating a trillion
dollars in tax increases, which

17:08.861 --> 17:13.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I get that. You tried to raise
taxes here in Virginia and were
unsuccessful.

17:13.099 --> 17:18.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But a trillion dollars in tax
increases, more regulation, more
of the same war on coal,

17:18.671 --> 17:24.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and more of Obamacare that now
even former President Bill
Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy

17:24.610 --> 17:29.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plan. But Hillary Clinton and
Tim Kaine want to build on
Obamacare. They want to expand

17:29.215 --> 17:31.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it into a single-payer program.
And for all the world, Hillary
Clinton just thinks Obamacare

17:31.951 --> 17:34.287 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is a good start.

17:34.287 --> 17:39.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, Donald Trump and I have a
plan to get this economy moving
again just the way that

17:39.292 --> 17:44.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it worked in the 1980s, just the
way it worked in the 1960s, and
that is by lowering taxes

17:44.730 --> 17:49.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
across the board for working
families, small businesses and
family farms, ending the war

17:49.335 --> 17:55.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on coal that is hurting jobs and
hurting this economy even here
in Virginia, repealing Obamacare

17:55.041 --> 17:59.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lock, stock, and barrel, and
repealing all of the executive
orders that Barack Obama

17:59.478 --> 18:03.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has signed that are stifling
economic growth in this economy.

18:03.249 --> 18:08.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We can get America moving again.
Put on top of that the kind of
trade deals that'll put

18:08.220 --> 18:12.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the American worker first, and
you've got a prescription for
real growth. And when you

18:12.258 --> 18:17.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get the economy growing, Elaine,
that's when you can deal with
the national debt. When

18:17.096 --> 18:22.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we get back to 3.5 percent to 4
percent growth with Donald
Trump's plan will do, then we're

18:22.568 --> 18:27.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to have the resources to
meet our nation's needs at home
and abroad, and we're going

18:27.073 --> 18:28.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to have the ability to bring
down the national debt.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUIJANO: Senator Kaine?

18:30.643 --> 18:34.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: Elaine, on the economy,
there's a fundamental choice for
the American electorate. Do you

18:34.480 --> 18:37.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want a "you're hired" president
in Hillary Clinton or do you
want a "you're fired" president

18:37.917 --> 18:42.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in Donald Trump? I think
that's not such a hard choice.

18:42.288 --> 18:46.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary and I have a plan that's
on the table that's a "you're
hired" plan. Five components.

18:46.859 --> 18:51.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First thing we do is we invest
in manufacturing,
infrastructure, and research in
the clean

18:51.130 --> 18:56.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
energy jobs of tomorrow. Second
thing is we invest in our
workforce, from pre-K education

18:56.602 --> 19:00.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to great teachers to debt-free
college and tuition-free college
for families that make

19:00.439 --> 19:03.709 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
less than $125,000 a year.

19:03.709 --> 19:08.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Third, we promote fairness by
raising the minimum wage, so you
can't work full-time

19:08.280 --> 19:13.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and be under the poverty level,
and by paying women equal pay
for equal work.

19:13.019 --> 19:17.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Fourth, we promote small
business growth, just as we've
done in Virginia, to make it

19:17.356 --> 19:21.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
easier to start and grow small
businesses. Hillary and I each
grew up in small-business

19:21.327 --> 19:25.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
families. My dad, who ran an
iron working and welding shop,
is here tonight.

19:25.231 --> 19:29.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, fifth, we have a tax plan
that targets tax relief to
middle- class individuals and

19:29.702 --> 19:33.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
small businesses and asks those
at the very top who've benefited
as we've come out of

19:33.105 --> 19:35.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
recession to pay more.

19:35.674 --> 19:39.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: The Trump plan is a
different plan. It's a "you're
fired" plan. And there's two

19:39.412 --> 19:45.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
key elements to it. First,
Donald Trump said wages are too
high. And both Donald Trump

19:45.084 --> 19:49.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Mike Pence think we ought to
eliminate the federal minimum
wage.

19:49.622 --> 19:56.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mike Pence, when he was in
Congress, voted against raising
the minimum wage above $5.15.

19:56.095 --> 20:01.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he has been a one-man
bulwark against minimum wage
increases in Indiana.

20:01.467 --> 20:06.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The second component of the plan
is massive tax breaks for the
very top, trillions of

20:06.505 --> 20:11.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dollars of tax breaks for people
just like Donald Trump. The
problem with this, Elaine,

20:11.844 --> 20:16.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is that's exactly what we did 10
years ago and it put the economy
into the deepest recession

20:16.515 --> 20:20.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
-- the deepest recession
since the 1930s.

20:20.753 --> 20:24.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Independent analysts say the
Clinton plan would grow the
economy by 10.5 million jobs.

20:24.824 --> 20:29.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Trump plan would cost 3.5
million jobs. And Donald Trump
-- why would he do this?

20:29.829 --> 20:35.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because his tax plan basically
helps him. And if he ever met
his promise and he gave

20:35.334 --> 20:39.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his tax returns to the American
public like he said he would, we
would see just how much

20:39.472 --> 20:42.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his economic plan is
really a Trump-first plan.

20:42.741 --> 20:46.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUIJANO: On that point, Governor
Pence, recently the New York
Times released part of Mr.
Trump's

20:46.612 --> 20:52.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
1995 tax return and reported
that he could have avoided
paying federal income taxes for

20:52.251 --> 20:58.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years. Yesterday, Mr. Trump said
he brilliantly used the laws to
pay as little tax as legally

20:58.090 --> 21:02.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
possible. Does that
seem fair to you?

21:02.294 --> 21:07.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: Well, first, let me say,
I appreciated the "you're
hired," "you're fired" thing,

21:07.967 --> 21:13.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator. You use that a whole
lot. And I think your running
mate used a lot of pre-done
lines.

21:13.305 --> 21:22.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, what -- what you all just
heard out there is more taxes,
$2 trillion in more spending,

21:22.515 --> 21:27.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more deficits, more debt, more
government. And if you think
that's all working, then

21:27.586 --> 21:31.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you look at the other side of
the table. I mean, the truth of
the matter is, the policies

21:31.657 --> 21:35.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of this administration, which
Hillary Clinton and Senator
Kaine want to continue, have run

21:35.194 --> 21:37.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this economy into a
ditch. We're in the...

21:37.062 --> 21:39.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAINE: Fifteen million new jobs?

21:39.231 --> 21:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

recovery since the Great
Depression.

21:59.618 --> 22:03.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got to tell you, people in
Scranton know different. People
in Fort Wayne, Indiana, know
different.

22:03.756 --> 22:09.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I mean, this economy is
struggling. The answer to this
economy is not more taxes.

22:09.295 --> 22:11.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: But it's not the giveaway
tax relief to the folks at the
top.

22:11.430 --> 22:12.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PENCE: It's not more spending...

22:12.164 --> 22:14.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

22:14.633 --> 22:15.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: I am interested to hear
whether he'll defend his running
mate's not releasing taxes

22:15.634 --> 22:16.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and not paying taxes.

22:16.835 --> 22:18.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PENCE: Absolutely I will.

22:18.938 --> 22:22.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUIJANO: Governor, with all due
respect, the question was about
whether it seems fair to

22:22.141 --> 22:27.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you that Mr. Trump said he
brilliantly used the laws to pay
as little tax as legally
possible.

22:27.413 --> 22:31.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: Well, this is probably
the difference between Donald
Trump and Hillary Clinton and

22:31.550 --> 22:37.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Kaine. And, I mean,
Hillary Clinton and Senator
Kaine -- God bless you for it,

22:37.856 --> 22:41.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
career public servants, that's
great -- Donald Trump is a
businessman, not a career
politician.

22:41.560 --> 22:44.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He actually built a business.

22:44.897 --> 22:49.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those tax returns that were --
that came out publicly this week
show that he faced some

22:49.501 --> 22:53.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pretty tough times 20 years ago.
But like virtually every other
business, including

22:53.672 --> 22:58.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the New York Times not too long
ago, he used what's called net
operating loss. We have

22:58.344 --> 23:02.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a tax code, Senator, that
actually is designed to
encourage entrepreneurship in
this country.

23:02.181 --> 23:04.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KAINE: But why won't he
release his tax returns?

23:04.550 --> 23:07.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: Well, we're answering the
question about -- about a
business thing, is he...

23:07.720 --> 23:10.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KAINE: I do want to come
back to that, but...

23:10.055 --> 23:15.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: His tax returns -- his
tax returns showed he went
through a very difficult time,

23:15.494 --> 23:18.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but he used the tax code just
the way it's supposed to be
used. And he did it brilliantly.

23:18.197 --> 23:19.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAINE: How do you know that? You
haven't seen his tax returns.

23:19.898 --> 23:22.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: He created a runway --
because he's created a business
that's worth billions of

23:22.468 --> 23:23.702 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
dollars today.

23:23.702 --> 23:25.771 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAINE: How do you know that?

23:25.771 --> 23:30.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: And with regard to paying
taxes, this whole riff about not
paying taxes and people

23:30.442 --> 23:35.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying he didn't pay taxes for
years, Donald Trump has created
tens of thousands of jobs.

23:35.848 --> 23:36.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he's paid payroll taxes,
sales taxes, property taxes...

23:36.815 --> 23:38.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KAINE: Elaine, let me
talk about something.

23:38.651 --> 23:40.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUIJANO: Senator, I'm going to
give you about 30 seconds to
respond, and I have question

23:40.419 --> 23:41.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on Social Security for you.

23:41.120 --> 23:43.355 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
KAINE: OK.

23:43.355 --> 23:43.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: The only issue on taxes
Clinton is going to raise taxes,
and Donald

23:43.589 --> 23:45.524 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Trump and I are
going to cut them.

23:45.524 --> 23:48.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: Donald Trump started this
campaign in 2014 and he said,
"If I run for president,

23:48.494 --> 23:50.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I will absolutely release my
taxes." He's broken his first...

23:50.829 --> 23:52.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PENCE: And he will.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: He's broken his first
promise. Second, he stood on the
stage...

23:54.867 --> 23:56.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PENCE: He hasn't broken his
promise. He said he's...

23:56.802 --> 23:59.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: He stood on the stage
last week and when Hillary said,
you haven't been paying

23:59.938 --> 24:05.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
taxes, he said, "That makes me
smart." So it's smart not to pay
for our military? It's

24:05.511 --> 24:10.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
smart not to pay for veterans?
It's smart not to pay for
teachers? And I guess all of

24:10.115 --> 24:13.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
us who do pay for those things,
I guess we're stupid. And the
last thing I'll say is this...

24:13.252 --> 24:14.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: Senator, do you take all
the deductions that you're
entitled to?

24:14.553 --> 24:16.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: The last thing -- the
last thing I want to ask
Governor Pence is...

24:16.588 --> 24:19.191 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PENCE: I do.

24:19.191 --> 24:23.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAINE: Governor Pence had to
give Donald Trump his tax
returns to show he was qualified
to

24:23.529 --> 24:28.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be vice president. Donald Trump
must give the American public
his tax returns to show

24:28.467 --> 24:31.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he's qualified to be
president. And he's breaking his
promise.

24:31.103 --> 24:32.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PENCE: Elaine, I have
to respond to this.

24:32.738 --> 24:34.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
QUIJANO: You get very
little time, 20 seconds.

24:34.340 --> 24:35.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PENCE: I'll be -- I'll
be very respectful.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.976 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUIJANO: Governor?

24:37.976 --> 24:40.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PENCE: Look, Donald Trump has
filed over 100 pages of
financial disclosure, which is
what

24:40.412 --> 24:42.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the law requires.

24:42.047 --> 24:43.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAINE: But he said he would
release his tax returns.

24:43.015 --> 24:45.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUIJANO: All right, Gentlemen...

24:45.317 --> 24:47.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: The American people can
review that. And he's going --
Senator, he's going to release

24:47.152 --> 24:48.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his tax returns when
the audit is over...

24:48.387 --> 24:50.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUIJANO: ... I need to ask
you about Social Security...

24:50.522 --> 24:53.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: Richard Nixon released
tax returns when he was under
audit.

24:53.892 --> 24:55.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: They're going to raise
your taxes. We're going to cut
your taxes.

24:55.260 --> 24:56.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUIJANO: Gentlemen...

24:56.695 --> 24:58.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KAINE: If you can't meet
Nixon's standard...

24:58.564 --> 25:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUIJANO: The people at home
cannot understand either one of
you when you speak over each

25:00.733 --> 25:04.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other. I would please ask you to
wait until it is that the other
is finished.

25:04.803 --> 25:07.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KAINE: All right. We're
having fun up here.

25:07.005 --> 25:11.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, on the
issue of Social Security, in 18
years, when the Social Security

25:11.176 --> 25:17.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trust Funds run out of money,
you'll be 76. The Committee for
a Responsible Federal Budget

25:17.149 --> 25:22.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
estimates your benefits could be
cut by as much as $7,500 per
year. What would your
administration

25:22.888 --> 25:26.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
do to prevent this cut?

25:26.058 --> 25:29.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: First, we're going to
protect Social Security, which
is one of the greatest programs

25:29.528 --> 25:33.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the American government has
ever done. It happened at a time
when you would work

25:33.632 --> 25:38.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your whole life, your whole
life, raising your kids,
working, being a Little League

25:38.137 --> 25:42.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
coach or a Sunday school
teacher, and then you would
retire into poverty. And Social

25:42.808 --> 25:47.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Security has enabled people to
retire with dignity and
overwhelmingly not be in
poverty.

25:47.246 --> 25:50.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to keep it solvent. And
we will keep it solvent. And
we'll look for strategies

25:50.682 --> 25:55.754 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like adjusting the payroll tax
cap upward in order to do that.

25:55.754 --> 26:01.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here's what Hillary and I will
not do. And I want to make this
very plain. We will never,

26:01.693 --> 26:06.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ever engage in a risky scheme to
privatize Social Security.
Donald Trump wrote a book

26:06.832 --> 26:11.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and he said Social Security is a
Ponzi scheme and privatization
would be good for all of

26:11.036 --> 26:13.939 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

26:13.939 --> 26:18.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when Congressman Pence was
in Congress, he was the chief
cheerleader for the
privatization

26:18.710 --> 26:24.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Social Security. Even after
President Bush stopped pushing
for it, Congressman Pence

26:24.716 --> 26:29.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kept pushing for it. We're going
to stand up against efforts to
privatize Social Security.

26:29.755 --> 26:32.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we'll look for ways to keep
it solvent going forward,
focusing primarily on the
payroll

26:32.524 --> 26:34.726 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tax cap.

26:34.726 --> 26:36.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUIJANO: Governor Pence, I'll
give you an opportunity to
respond.

Donald Trump and I have said
about Social Security is we're

26:45.170 --> 26:46.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to meet our obligations
to our seniors. That's it.

26:53.111 --> 26:55.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign is really about,
Senator. And I get, this is --
this is the old scare tactic
that

it to the cops."

28:09.488 --> 28:13.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do we ask too much of police
officers in this country? And
how would you specifically
address

28:13.926 --> 28:17.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the chief's concerns?
Senator Kaine?

28:17.062 --> 28:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: Elaine, I think that's a
very fair comment. I think we
put a lot on police shoulders.

28:21.433 --> 28:25.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is something I got a
lot of scar tissue and
experience on.

28:25.137 --> 28:29.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was a city councilman and
mayor in Richmond. And when I
came in, we had one of the
highest

28:29.107 --> 28:32.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
homicide rates in the United
States. We fought very, very
hard over the course of my time

28:32.978 --> 28:36.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in local office with our police
department, and we reduced our
homicide rate nearly in

28:36.148 --> 28:38.717 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
half.

28:38.717 --> 28:42.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then when I was governor of
Virginia, we worked hard, too.
And we did something

28:42.821 --> 28:47.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we had really wanted to do. For
the first time ever, we cracked
the top 10, 10 safest

28:47.392 --> 28:50.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
states, because we
worked together.

28:50.729 --> 28:55.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here's what I learned as a mayor
and a governor. The way you make
communities safer and the

28:55.067 --> 29:00.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way you make police safer is
through community policing. You
build the bonds between the

29:00.472 --> 29:06.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
community and the police force,
build bonds of understanding,
and then when people feel

29:06.078 --> 29:09.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
comfortable in their
communities, that gap between
the police and the communities
they

29:09.715 --> 29:12.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
serve narrows. And when that gap
narrows, it's safer for the
communities and it's safer

29:12.751 --> 29:15.387 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for the police.

29:15.387 --> 29:20.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That model still works across
our country, but there are some
other models that don't

29:20.392 --> 29:25.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
work, an overly aggressive, more
militarized model. Donald Trump
recently said we need

29:25.330 --> 29:30.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do more stop-and-frisk around
the country. That would be a big
mistake because it polarizes

29:30.502 --> 29:34.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the relationship between the
police and the community.

29:34.206 --> 29:40.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So here's what we'll do. We'll
focus on community policing. We
will focus on -- and Hillary

29:40.245 --> 29:44.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton has rolled out a really
comprehensive mental health
reform package that she worked

29:44.216 --> 29:47.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on with law enforcement
professionals, and we will also
fight the scourge of gun
violence

29:47.586 --> 29:50.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the United States.

29:50.088 --> 29:55.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm a gun-owner. I'm a strong
Second Amendment supporter. But
I've got a lot of scar tissue,

29:55.260 --> 29:59.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because when I was governor of
Virginia, there was a horrible
shooting at Virginia Tech,

29:59.097 --> 30:04.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and we learned that through that
painful situation that gaps in
the background record check
system

30:04.870 --> 30:08.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should have been closed and it
could have prevented that crime,
and so we're going to

30:08.440 --> 30:11.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work to do things like close
background record checks. And if
we do, we won't have the
tragedies

30:11.510 --> 30:14.112 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that we did.

30:14.112 --> 30:18.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of those killed at Virginia
Tech was a guy named Liviu
Librescu. He was a
70-plus-year-old

30:18.850 --> 30:23.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Romanian Holocaust survivor. He
had survived the Holocaust. Then
he survived the Soviet

30:23.889 --> 30:27.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Union takeover of his country.
But then he was a visiting
professor at Virginia Tech,

30:27.726 --> 30:31.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and he couldn't survive the
scourge of gun violence.

30:31.697 --> 30:34.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can support the Second
Amendment and do things like
background record checks and
make

30:34.332 --> 30:36.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
us safer, and that will
make police safer, too.

30:36.768 --> 30:39.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUIJANO: Governor Pence?

30:39.971 --> 30:47.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: You know, my uncle was a
cop, a career cop, on the beat
in downtown Chicago. He was

30:47.045 --> 30:52.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my hero when I was growing up.
And we'd go up to visit my dad's
family in Chicago. My

30:52.250 --> 30:55.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
three brothers and I would
marvel at my uncle when he would
come out in his uniform, sidearm

30:55.420 --> 30:58.890 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at his side.

30:58.890 --> 31:04.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police officers are the best of
us. And the men and women,
white, African-American, Asian,

31:04.029 --> 31:13.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Latino, Hispanic, they put their
lives on the line every single
day. And let my say,

31:13.004 --> 31:19.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the risk of agreeing with
you, community policing is a
great idea. It's worked in the

31:19.478 --> 31:23.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hoosier state. And we
fully support that.

31:23.415 --> 31:28.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump and I are going to
make sure that law enforcement
have the resources and

31:28.320 --> 31:34.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the tools to be able to really
restore law and order to the
cities and communities in

31:34.392 --> 31:39.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this nation. It's probably --
probably why the 330,000 members
of the Fraternal Order

31:39.431 --> 31:43.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Police endorsed Donald Trump
as the next president of the
United States of America,

31:43.735 --> 31:48.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because they see his commitment
to them. They see his commitment
to law and order.

31:48.573 --> 31:55.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they also -- they also hear
the bad mouthing, the bad
mouthing that comes from people
that

31:55.213 --> 32:02.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seize upon tragedy in the wake
of police action shootings as --
as a reason to -- to use a

32:02.521 --> 32:08.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
broad brush to accuse law
enforcement of -- of implicit
bias or institutional racism.
And

32:08.860 --> 32:11.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that really has got to stop.

32:11.696 --> 32:18.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, when an African-American
police officer in Charlotte
named Brentley Vinson, an
all-star

32:18.336 --> 32:23.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
football player who went to
Liberty University here in the
state, came home, followed his

32:23.041 --> 32:28.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dad into law enforcement, joined
the force in Charlotte, joined
the force in Charlotte

32:28.246 --> 32:35.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 2014, was involved in a
police action shooting that
claimed the life of Keith --
Keith Lamont

32:35.020 --> 32:39.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Scott, it was a tragedy. I mean,
I -- we -- we mourn with those
who mourn. We -- we grieve

32:39.424 --> 32:44.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with those who grieve. And we're
saddened at the loss of life.

32:44.029 --> 32:48.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Hillary Clinton actually
referred to that moment as an
example of implicit bias in the

32:48.667 --> 32:53.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
police force, where -- where she
used -- when she was asked in
the debate a week ago whether

32:53.138 --> 32:56.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there was implicit bias in law
enforcement, her only answer was
that there's implicit

32:56.908 --> 32:59.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bias in everyone in the United
States. I just think...

32:59.211 --> 33:01.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAINE: Can I -- can I explain...

33:01.279 --> 33:05.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: ... I just think what we
ought to do is we ought to stop
seizing on these moments

33:05.650 --> 33:11.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of tragedy. We ought to assure
the public that we'll have a
full and complete and
transparent

33:11.189 --> 33:16.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investigation whenever there's a
loss of life because of police
action. But, Senator, please,

33:16.728 --> 33:22.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you know, enough of this seeking
every opportunity to demean law
enforcement broadly by making

33:22.934 --> 33:26.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the accusation of implicit bias
every time tragedy occurs.

33:26.271 --> 33:29.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: Elaine -- Elaine, people
shouldn't be afraid to bring up
issues of bias in law

33:29.174 --> 33:31.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
enforcement. And if
you're afraid to have...

33:31.109 --> 33:33.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PENCE: I'm not afraid
to bring that up.

33:33.245 --> 33:36.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: And if -- if you're
afraid to have the discussion,
you'll never solve it. And

33:36.748 --> 33:40.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so here's -- here's an example,
heartbreaking. We would agree
this was a heartbreaking
example.

33:40.986 --> 33:47.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The guy, Philando Castile, who
was killed in St. Paul, he was a
worker, a valued worker

33:47.626 --> 33:53.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a local school. And he was
killed for no apparent reason in
an incident that will be

33:53.498 --> 33:57.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
discussed and will
be investigated.

33:57.502 --> 34:02.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when folks went and explored
this situation, what they found
is that Philando Castile,

34:02.007 --> 34:06.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who was a -- they called him Mr.
Rogers with Dreadlocks in the
school that he worked. The

34:06.311 --> 34:12.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kids loved him. But he had been
stopped by police 40 or 50 times
before that fatal incident.

34:12.350 --> 34:15.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you look at sentencing in
this country, African-Americans
and Latinos get sentenced

34:15.787 --> 34:17.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for the same crimes at
very different rates.

34:17.756 --> 34:19.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PENCE: We need criminal
justice reform.

34:19.691 --> 34:21.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAINE: Well, we do.

34:21.426 --> 34:22.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

involved in a police action
shooting

34:37.542 --> 34:41.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

officer of implicit bias?

34:45.617 --> 34:46.584 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%

34:55.727 --> 34:59.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

35:08.239 --> 35:12.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

we need to adopt criminal
justice reform nationally.

35:28.193 --> 35:31.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I -- I signed criminal justice
reform in the state of Indiana,
Senator, and we're very

35:31.096 --> 35:33.798 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
proud of it.

35:33.798 --> 35:40.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I worked when I was Congress on
a second chance act. We have got
to do a better job recognizing

35:40.839 --> 35:47.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and correcting the errors in the
system that do reflect on
institutional bias in criminal

35:47.746 --> 35:53.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
justice. But what -- what --
what Donald Trump and I are
saying is let's not have the
reflex

35:53.451 --> 36:00.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of assuming the worst of men and
women in law enforcement. We
truly do believe that

36:00.058 --> 36:01.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
law enforcement is not a force
for racism or division in our

KAINE: Elaine, can I...

36:03.328 --> 36:04.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUIJANO: So what would you say
to Senator Scott, Governor?

36:04.896 --> 36:09.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: Law enforcement in this
country is a force for good.
They are the -- they truly

36:09.401 --> 36:14.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are people that put their lives
on the line every single day.
But I would -- I would suggest

36:14.973 --> 36:22.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to you, what we need to do is
assert a stronger leadership at
the national level to support

36:22.580 --> 36:27.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
law enforcement. You just heard
Senator Kaine reject
stop-and-frisk. Well, I would
suggest

36:27.819 --> 36:30.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to you that the families that
live in our inner cities that
are besieged by crime...

36:30.522 --> 36:33.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KAINE: Elaine, let
me -- let me...

36:33.458 --> 36:33.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUIJANO: Governor, the question
is about Senator Scott. What
would -- what would you tell
Senator

36:33.625 --> 36:36.194 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Scott?

36:36.194 --> 36:38.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: Elaine, if I could -- if
I could jump in. I've heard
Senator Scott make that eloquent

36:38.596 --> 36:42.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plea. And look, criminal justice
is about respecting the law and
being respected by

36:42.901 --> 36:46.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the law. So there is a
fundamental respect issue here.

36:46.604 --> 36:50.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just want to talk about
the tone that's set from the
top. Donald Trump during his

36:50.909 --> 36:57.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign has called Mexicans
rapists and criminals. He's
called women slobs, pigs, dogs,
disgusting.

36:57.382 --> 37:02.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't like saying that in
front of my wife and my mother.
He attacked an Indiana-born

37:02.921 --> 37:06.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
federal judge and said he was
unqualified to hear a federal
lawsuit because his parents

37:06.758 --> 37:13.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were Mexican. He went after John
McCain, a POW, and said he
wasn't hero because he'd

37:13.098 --> 37:18.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
been captured. He said
African-Americans are living in
Hell. And he perpetrated this
outrageous

37:18.870 --> 37:23.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and bigoted lie that President
Obama is not a U.S. citizen.

37:23.475 --> 37:28.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you want to have a society
where people are respected and
respect laws, you can't

37:28.913 --> 37:33.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have somebody at the top who
demeans every group that he
talks about. And I just --
again,

37:33.418 --> 37:37.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I cannot believe that Governor
Pence will defend the
insult-driven campaign that
Donald

37:37.322 --> 37:39.791 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trump has run.

37:39.791 --> 37:43.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUIJANO: All right. I want to
turn to our next segment now,
immigration. Your running

37:43.428 --> 37:49.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mates have both said that
undocumented immigrants who have
committed violent crimes should
be

37:49.434 --> 37:52.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deported. What would you tell
the millions of undocumented
immigrants who have not
committed

37:52.737 --> 37:55.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
violent crimes? Governor Pence?

37:55.874 --> 38:00.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: Donald Trump's laid out a
plan to end illegal immigration
once and for all in this

38:00.912 --> 38:05.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country. We've been talking it
to death for 20 years. Hillary
Clinton and Tim Kaine want

38:05.850 --> 38:13.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to continue the policies of open
borders, amnesty, catch and
release, sanctuary cities,

38:13.258 --> 38:18.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all the things that are driving
-- that are driving wages down
in this country, Senator,

38:18.363 --> 38:24.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and also too often with criminal
aliens in the country, it's
bringing heartbreak.

38:24.769 --> 38:33.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I -- Donald Trump has a plan
that he laid out in Arizona,
that will deal systemically

38:33.011 --> 38:37.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with illegal immigration,
beginning with border security,
internal enforcement. It's
probably

38:37.515 --> 38:42.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why for the first time in the
history of Immigration and
Customs Enforcement their union
actually

38:42.086 --> 38:45.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
endorsed Donald Trump as the
next president of the United
States, because they know they

38:45.790 --> 38:49.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
need help to enforce the
laws of this country.

38:49.861 --> 38:53.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Donald Trump has laid out a
priority to remove criminal
aliens, remove people that

38:53.364 --> 38:58.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have overstayed their visas. And
-- and once we have accomplished
all of that, which will

38:58.870 --> 39:02.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- which will strengthen our
economy, strengthen the rule of
law in the country and make our

39:02.507 --> 39:07.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
communities safer once the
criminal aliens are out, then
we'll deal with those that
remain.

39:07.779 --> 39:11.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I have to tell you, I just
-- I was listening to the
avalanche of insults coming out
of

39:11.950 --> 39:15.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Kaine a minute ago.
KAINE: These were Donald's --
hold on a second, Governor.

39:15.453 --> 39:16.754 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

39:16.754 --> 39:18.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PENCE: It's my time, Senator.

39:18.056 --> 39:19.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
QUIJANO: It is, in fact,
the governor's time.

39:19.324 --> 39:20.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAINE: I apologize. It's your
two minutes. I apologize.

39:20.858 --> 39:24.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: Thanks. I forgive you. He
says ours is an insult-driven
campaign. Did you all

39:24.996 --> 39:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just hear that? Ours is an
insult-driven campaign?

39:28.733 --> 39:32.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, to be honest with you,
if Donald Trump had said all of
the things that you've said

39:32.770 --> 39:39.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he said in the way you said he
said them, he still wouldn't
have a fraction of the insults

39:39.410 --> 39:44.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Hillary Clinton leveled
when she said that half of our
supporters were a basket

39:44.716 --> 39:51.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of deplorables. It's -- she said
they were irredeemable, they
were not American.

39:51.256 --> 39:58.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it's extraordinary. And
then she labeled one after
another "ism" on millions of
Americans

39:58.696 --> 40:02.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who believe that we can have a
stronger America at home and
abroad, who believe we can get

40:02.367 --> 40:06.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this economy moving again, who
believe that we can end illegal
immigration once and for

40:06.304 --> 40:09.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all. So, Senator, this -- this
insult-driven campaign, I
mean...

40:09.607 --> 40:11.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUIJANO: Governor...

40:11.376 --> 40:13.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PENCE: That's small potatoes
compared to Hillary Clinton...

40:13.311 --> 40:15.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUIJANO: Senator Kaine?

40:15.546 --> 40:17.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: .... calling half of
Donald Trump's supporters a
basket of deplorables.

40:17.882 --> 40:20.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: Hillary Clinton said
something on the campaign trail,
and the very next day, she

40:20.852 --> 40:22.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
said, you know what, I
shouldn't have said that.

40:22.053 --> 40:24.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PENCE: She said she
shouldn't have said half.

40:24.022 --> 40:25.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUIJANO: Governor, this is
Senator Kaine's two minutes,
please.

40:25.957 --> 40:27.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KAINE: Yeah, that's
right, so now we're even.

40:27.625 --> 40:28.593 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PENCE: Yeah.

40:28.593 --> 40:31.095 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

40:31.095 --> 40:33.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: Look for Donald trump
apologizing to John McCain for
saying he wasn't a hero...

40:33.064 --> 40:35.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PENCE: Oh...

40:35.566 --> 40:38.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: ... to Donald Trump
apologizing for calling women
slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting.

40:38.236 --> 40:40.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PENCE: She apologized
for saying "half."

40:40.104 --> 40:43.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
QUIJANO: Governor. It is
his two minutes, please.

40:43.274 --> 40:47.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KAINE: Did Donald Trump
apologize for taking after
somebody in a Twitter war and
making

40:47.812 --> 40:52.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fun of her weight? Did he
apologize for saying
African-Americans are living in
Hell? Did

40:52.016 --> 40:57.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
he apologize for saying
President Obama was not even a
citizen of the United States?
You

40:57.655 --> 41:03.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will look in vain to see Donald
Trump ever taking responsibility
for anybody and apologizing.

41:03.428 --> 41:07.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Immigration. There's two plans
on the table. Hillary and I
believe in comprehensive
immigration

41:07.965 --> 41:13.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reform. Donald Trump believes in
deportation nation. You've got
to pick your choice. Hillary

41:13.504 --> 41:19.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I want a bipartisan reform
that will put keeping families
together as the top goal,

41:19.510 --> 41:26.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
second, that will help focus
enforcement efforts on those who
are violent, third, that will

41:26.384 --> 41:30.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do more border control, and,
fourth, that will provide a path
to citizenship for those

41:30.088 --> 41:34.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who work hard, pay taxes, play
by the rules, and take criminal
background record checks.

41:34.592 --> 41:40.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's our proposal. Donald
Trump proposes to deport 16
million people, 11 million who

41:40.565 --> 41:45.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are here without documents. And
both Donald Trump and Mike Pence
want to get rid of birthright

41:45.636 --> 41:48.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
citizenship. So if you're born
here, but your parents don't
have documents, they want to

41:48.773 --> 41:52.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
eliminate that. That's
another 4.5 million people.

41:52.543 --> 41:57.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These guys -- and Donald Trump
have said it -- deportation
force. They want to go house

41:57.115 --> 42:02.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to house, school to school,
business to business, and kick
out 16 million people. And I
cannot

42:02.487 --> 42:03.988 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
believe...

42:03.988 --> 42:06.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PENCE: That's nonsense.
That's nonsense.

42:06.057 --> 42:09.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: I cannot believe that
Governor Pence would sit here
and defend his running mate's

42:09.060 --> 42:13.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
claim that we should create a
deportation force to -- so that
they'll all be gone.

42:13.731 --> 42:18.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PENCE: Senator, we have a
deportation force. It's called
Immigrations and Customs
Enforcement.

42:18.770 --> 42:22.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the union for Immigrations
and Customs Enforcement for the
first time in their history

42:22.006 --> 42:25.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
endorsed Donald Trump to be the
next president of the United
States of America.

42:25.276 --> 42:28.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KAINE: So you like the
16 million deportations?

42:28.045 --> 42:31.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: Senator, that's -- that's
nonsense. Look, what you just
heard is they have a plan

42:31.816 --> 42:33.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for open borders,
amnesty. That's...

42:33.384 --> 42:35.153 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

42:35.153 --> 42:39.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

Reagan's plan from 1986.

42:39.056 --> 42:41.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PENCE: They call it
comprehensive immigration reform
-- they call it comprehensive
immigration

42:41.259 --> 42:44.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reform on Capitol Hill. We all
know the routine. It's amnesty.
And you heard one of the last

42:44.429 --> 42:46.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
things he mentioned
was border security.

42:46.230 --> 42:48.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PENCE: That's how
Washington always plays it.

42:48.065 --> 42:50.568 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
KAINE: No, I...

42:50.568 --> 42:50.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: They always say we're
going to do this, we're going to
do that, we'll eventually get

42:50.802 --> 42:51.769 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the border...

42:51.769 --> 42:54.005 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

42:54.005 --> 42:54.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

years ago, and Governor Pence
was against it.

42:54.372 --> 42:56.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
QUIJANO: Governor, Mr.
Trump has said...

42:56.407 --> 42:58.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PENCE: Ronald Reagan said a
nation without borders is not a
nation. Donald Trump is
committed

42:58.776 --> 43:02.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to restoring the borders of this
nation and securing our nation,
enforcing our laws.

43:02.980 --> 43:04.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUIJANO: So, Governor, how would
these millions of undocumented
immigrants leave? Would they

43:04.515 --> 43:07.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be forcibly removed?

43:07.251 --> 43:11.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PENCE: Well, I think Donald
Trump laid out a series of
priorities that doesn't ends
with

43:11.422 --> 43:17.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
border security. It begins with
border security. And after we
secure the border, not only
build

43:17.128 --> 43:21.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a wall, but beneath the ground
and in the air, we do internal
enforcement.

43:21.899 --> 43:26.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he said the focus has to be
on criminal aliens. We just --
we just had a conversation

43:26.237 --> 43:31.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about law enforcement. We just
had a conversation about the --
the violence that's besetting

43:31.042 --> 43:37.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our cities. The reality is that
there's heartbreak and tragedy
that has struck American
families

43:37.148 --> 43:42.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because people that came into
this country illegally are now
involved in criminal enterprise

43:42.954 --> 43:48.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and activity. And we don't have
the resources or the will to
deport them systemically.

43:48.226 --> 43:51.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump has said we're
going to move those people out,
people who've overstayed

43:51.929 --> 43:57.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their visas. We're going to
enforce the law of this country.
We're going to strengthen

43:57.101 --> 44:02.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Immigrations and Customs
Enforcements with more resources
and more personnel to be able

44:02.006 --> 44:06.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do that. And then Donald
Trump has made it clear, once
we've done all of those things,

44:06.511 --> 44:09.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we're going to reform the
immigration system that we
have...

44:09.947 --> 44:11.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

correct Governor Pence....

come into this country.

44:11.716 --> 44:14.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAINE: I have to...

44:14.051 --> 44:19.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: That's the order that you
should do it. Border security,
removing criminal aliens,

44:19.023 --> 44:22.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
upholding with law, and then --
but then, Senator, I'll work you
when you go back to

44:22.560 --> 44:26.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Senate, I promise you, we'll
work you to reform the
immigration system.

44:26.230 --> 44:30.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: I look forward to working
together in whatever capacities
we serve in. But I

44:30.801 --> 44:34.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just want to make it very, very
clear that he's trying to fuzz
up what Donald Trump has

44:34.539 --> 44:38.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said. When Donald Trump spoke in
Phoenix, he looked the audience
in the eye and he said,

44:38.309 --> 44:43.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no, we're building a wall, and
we're deporting everybody. He
said, quote, "They will all

44:43.014 --> 44:46.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be gone." "They will all be
gone." And this is one of these
ones where you can just go

44:46.951 --> 44:49.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the tape on it and see what
Donald Trump has said. And to
add...

44:49.587 --> 44:51.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PENCE: He's talking
about criminal aliens.

44:51.422 --> 44:57.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: And to add to it, and to
add to it, and to add to it, we
are a nation of immigrants.

44:57.528 --> 45:02.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mike Pence and I both are
descended from immigrant
families. Some things, you know,
maybe weren't

45:02.934 --> 45:07.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said so great about the Irish
when they came, but we've done
well by absorbing immigrants,

45:07.238 --> 45:10.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and it's made our
nation stronger.

45:10.107 --> 45:14.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When Donald Trump says Mexicans
are rapists and criminals,
Mexican immigrants, when Donald

45:14.445 --> 45:20.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump says about your judge, a
Hoosier judge, he said that
Judge Curiel was unqualified

45:20.318 --> 45:25.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to hear a case because his
parents were Mexican, I can't
imagine how you could defend
that.

45:25.656 --> 45:30.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUIJANO: Gentleman, I'd like to
shift now to the threat of
terrorism. Do you think the

45:30.595 --> 45:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world today is a safer or more
dangerous place than it was
eight years ago? Has the
terrorist

45:35.533 --> 45:39.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
threat increased or
decreased? Senator Kaine?

45:39.670 --> 45:43.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: The terrorist threat has
decreased in some ways, because
bin Laden is dead. The

45:43.608 --> 45:47.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terrorist threat has decreased
in some ways because an Iranian
nuclear weapons program

45:47.678 --> 45:52.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has been stopped. The terrorist
threat to United States troops
has been decreased in

45:52.083 --> 45:55.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some ways because there's not
175,000 in a dangerous part of
the world. There's only

45:55.486 --> 45:57.955 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
15,000.

45:57.955 --> 46:01.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there are other parts of the
world that are challenging. Let
me tell you this: To

46:01.792 --> 46:05.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
beat terrorism, there's only one
candidate who can do it, and
it's Hillary Clinton. Remember,

46:05.796 --> 46:09.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton was the senator
from New York on 9/11. She was
there at the World Trade

46:09.934 --> 46:13.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Center when they were still
searching for victims and
survivors. That's seared onto

46:13.871 --> 46:17.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
her, the need to beat terrorism.

46:17.375 --> 46:22.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she's got a plan to do it.
She was part of the national
security team that wiped out

46:22.046 --> 46:26.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bin Laden. Here's her plan to
defeat ISIL. First, we've got to
keep taking out their

46:26.450 --> 46:29.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leaders on the battlefield. She
was part of the team that got
bin Laden, and she'll lead

46:29.687 --> 46:33.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the team that will get Abu Bakr
al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS.

46:33.391 --> 46:39.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Second, we've got to disrupt
financing networks, third,
disrupt their ability to recruit
on

46:39.130 --> 46:44.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Internet, in their safe
havens. But, fourth, we also
have to work with allies to
share

46:44.735 --> 46:47.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and surge intelligence. That's
the Hillary Clinton plan; she's
got the experience to

46:47.571 --> 46:50.474 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do it.

46:50.474 --> 46:55.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump. Donald Trump can't
start a Twitter war with Miss
Universe without shooting
himself

46:55.413 --> 47:01.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the foot. Donald Trump
doesn't have a plan. He said, "I
have a secret plan," and then

47:01.452 --> 47:06.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he said, "Um, I know more than
all the generals about ISIL."
And then he said, "I'm going

47:06.290 --> 47:09.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to call the generals to help me
figure out a plan." And finally
he said, "I'm going to

47:09.927 --> 47:12.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
fire all the generals."
He doesn't have a plan.

47:12.897 --> 47:17.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he does have dangerous
ideas. Here's four. He trash
talks the military. The military

47:17.435 --> 47:21.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a disaster, John McCain's no
hero, the generals need all to
be fired, and I know

47:21.872 --> 47:26.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more than them. He wants to tear
up alliances. NATO is obsolete,
and we'll only work together

47:26.610 --> 47:29.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with Israel if they
pay "big league."

47:29.914 --> 47:33.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Third, he loves dictators. He's
got kind of a personal Mount
Rushmore, Vladimir Putin,

47:33.951 --> 47:36.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Kim Jong-un, Moammar Gadhafi...

47:36.654 --> 47:38.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PENCE: Oh, please. Come on.

47:38.923 --> 47:44.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: ... and Saddam Hussein.
And last and most dangerously,
Donald Trump believes -- Donald

47:44.395 --> 47:49.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump believes that the world
will be safer if more nations
have nuclear weapons. He's

47:49.967 --> 47:54.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said Saudi Arabia should get
them, Japan should get them,
Korea should get them. And when

47:54.238 --> 47:59.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he was confronted with this, and
told, wait a minute, terrorists
could get those, proliferation

47:59.176 --> 48:02.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could lead to nuclear war,
here's what Donald Trump said,
and I quote: "Go ahead, folks,

48:02.980 --> 48:05.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
enjoy yourselves."

48:05.349 --> 48:08.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'd love to hear Governor Pence
tell me what's so enjoyable or
comical about nuclear war.

48:08.719 --> 48:11.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUIJANO: Governor Pence?

48:11.388 --> 48:14.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: Did you work on that one
a long time? Because that had a
lot of really creative

48:14.125 --> 48:16.026 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lines in it.

48:16.026 --> 48:18.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAINE: Well, I'm going to see
if you can defend any of it.

48:18.195 --> 48:22.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: Well, look, I can defend
-- I -- I -- I can -- I can make
very clear to the American

48:22.366 --> 48:26.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people, after traveling millions
of miles as our secretary of
state, after being the

48:26.804 --> 48:34.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
architect of the foreign policy
of this administration, America
is less safe today than it was
the

48:34.245 --> 48:38.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
day that Barack Obama became
president of the United States.
It's absolutely inarguable.

48:38.849 --> 48:42.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We've weakened America's place
in the world. It's been a
combination of factors, but
mostly

48:42.853 --> 48:47.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's been a lack of leadership.
I mean, I will give you -- and I
was in Washington,

48:47.458 --> 48:52.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
D.C., on 9/11. I saw the clouds
of smoke rise from the Pentagon.

48:52.196 --> 48:53.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KAINE: I was in Virginia
where the Pentagon's...

48:53.631 --> 48:56.167 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

48:56.167 --> 48:59.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: I know you were. We all
lived through that day as a
nation. It was heartbreaking.

48:59.870 --> 49:08.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I want to give this
president credit for bringing
Osama bin Laden to justice.

49:08.245 --> 49:14.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the truth is, Osama bin
Laden led Al Qaida. Our primary
threat today is ISIS. And
because

49:14.084 --> 49:19.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton failed to
renegotiate a status of forces
agreement that would have
allowed

49:19.590 --> 49:24.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some American combat troops to
remain in Iraq and secure the
hard fought gains the American

49:24.895 --> 49:31.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
soldier had won by 2009, ISIS
was able to be literally
conjured up out of the desert,

49:31.869 --> 49:38.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and it's overrun vast areas that
the American soldier had won in
Operation Iraqi Freedom.

49:38.108 --> 49:46.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My heart breaks for the likes of
Lance Cpl. Scott Zubowski. He
fell in Fallujah in 2005.

49:46.550 --> 49:52.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He fought hard through some of
the most difficult days in
Operation Iraqi Freedom, and he
paid

49:52.990 --> 49:57.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the ultimate sacrifice to defend
our freedom and secure that
nation. And that nation was

49:57.027 --> 50:00.431 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
secured in 2009.

50:00.431 --> 50:06.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But because Hillary Clinton and
Barack Obama failed to provide a
status of forces agreement

50:06.570 --> 50:10.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and leave sufficient troops in
there, we are back at war. The
president just ordered more

50:10.641 --> 50:15.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
troops on the ground. We are
back at war in Iraq. And Scott
Zubowski, whose mom would

50:15.713 --> 50:20.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
always come to Memorial Day
events in Newcastle, Indiana, to
see me, and I'd give her a hug

50:20.918 --> 50:25.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and tell her we're never going
to forget her son and we never
will, Scott Zubowski and

50:25.589 --> 50:29.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the sacrifices the American
soldier made were squandered in
Iraq because this administration

50:29.693 --> 50:33.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
created a vacuum in which
ISIS was able to grow.

50:33.297 --> 50:38.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a reference to the Iranian
deal, the Iranian deal that
Hillary Clinton initiated, $150

vetting of immigrants from parts
of

50:58.989 --> 51:04.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the world that export terrorism.
But that does not address many
of the recent terrorist

51:04.061 --> 51:08.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attacks in the United States,
such as the Orlando nightclub
massacre and the recent

51:08.499 --> 51:14.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

Jersey. Those were homegrown,
committed by U.S. citizens

51:14.605 --> 51:20.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and legal residents. What
specific tools would you use to
prevent those kinds of attacks?

51:20.077 --> 51:26.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: Well, I think it's -- I
think it's a great question,
Elaine, but it really does

51:26.450 --> 51:31.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
begin with us reforming our
immigration system and putting
the interests, particularly the

51:31.322 --> 51:34.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
safety and security of the
American people, first.

51:34.291 --> 51:39.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

for extreme vetting for people
coming into this country

51:39.630 --> 51:44.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so that we don't bring people
into the United States who are
hostile to our Bill of Rights

51:44.768 --> 51:47.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
freedoms, who are hostile
to the American way life.

51:47.204 --> 51:54.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

immigration enforcement and

53:44.688 --> 53:49.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

an intelligence surge.

54:25.829 --> 54:28.365 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
KAINE: Yes.

54:28.365 --> 54:31.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUIJANO: What exactly would an
intelligence surge look like?
And how would that help identify

54:31.702 --> 54:36.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terrorists with no operational
connection to a foreign
terrorist organization?

54:36.707 --> 54:40.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAINE: Intelligence surge is
two-thirds, Elaine. It's two
things. It's, first,
dramatically

54:40.744 --> 54:46.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expanding our intelligence
capacities by hiring great
professionals, but also we've
got some

54:46.083 --> 54:49.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the best intel and cyber
employees in the world right
here in the United States
working

54:49.820 --> 54:52.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for many of our private
sector companies.

54:52.856 --> 54:57.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it involves increasing our
own workforce, but striking
great partnerships with some

54:57.895 --> 55:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of our cyber and intel experts
in the private sector so that we
can, consistent with
constitutional

55:02.533 --> 55:05.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
principles, gather
more intelligence.

55:05.469 --> 55:10.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the second piece of this is
really, really important. It
also means creating stronger

55:10.841 --> 55:14.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alliances, because you gather
intelligence and then you share
your intelligence back

55:14.444 --> 55:19.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and forth with allies. And
that's how you find out who may
be trying to recruit, who

55:19.116 --> 55:23.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may be trying to come to one
country or the next. Alliances
are critical.

55:23.820 --> 55:27.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why Donald Trump's claim
that he wants to -- that NATO is
obsolete and that we need

55:27.724 --> 55:30.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to get rid of NATO
is so dangerous.

55:30.627 --> 55:34.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: That's not his plan.
KAINE: Well, he said NATO is
obsolete. And, look, if you put

55:34.932 --> 55:39.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
aside -- push aside your
alliances, who you're going to
share intelligence with? Hillary

55:39.236 --> 55:43.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton is the secretary of
state who knows how to build
alliances. She built the
sanctions

55:43.607 --> 55:47.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regime around the word that
stopped the Iranian nuclear
weapons program. And that's what
an

55:47.811 --> 55:51.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intelligence surge means. Better
skill and capacity, but also
better alliances.

55:51.848 --> 55:54.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUIJANO: All right. I'd like to

58:58.668 --> 59:03.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lowest number of troops since
the end of the Second World War.
We've got to work with Congress,

59:03.940 --> 59:08.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Donald Trump will, to
rebuild our military and project
American strength in the world.

59:08.145 --> 59:15.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But about Aleppo and about
Syria, I truly do believe that
what America ought to do right

59:15.452 --> 59:21.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now is immediately establish
safe zones, so that families and
vulnerable families with

59:21.291 --> 59:25.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
children can move out of those
areas, work with our Arab
partners, real time, right now,

59:25.462 --> 59:27.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to make that happen.

59:27.931 --> 59:33.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And secondly, I just have to
tell you that the provocations
by Russia need to be met

59:33.870 --> 59:39.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with American strength. And if
Russia chooses to be involved
and continue, I should say,

59:39.209 --> 59:43.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be involved in this barbaric
attack on civilians in Aleppo,
the United States of

59:43.814 --> 59:49.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
America should be prepared to
use military force to strike
military targets of the Assad

59:49.152 --> 59:57.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regime to prevent them from this
humanitarian crisis that is
taking place in Aleppo.

59:57.060 --> 01:00:00.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a broad range of other
things that we ought to do, as
well. We ought to deploy

01:00:00.297 --> 01:00:06.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a missile defense shield to the
Czech Republic and Poland which
Hillary Clinton and Barack

01:00:06.136 --> 01:00:08.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama pulled back on out of not
wanting to offend the Russians
back in 2009.

01:00:08.805 --> 01:00:10.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
QUIJANO: Governor, your
two minutes are up.

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:14.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: We've just got to have
American strength on the world
stage. When Donald Trump becomes

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:17.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president of the United States,
the Russians and other countries
in the world will know

01:00:17.814 --> 01:00:21.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're dealing with a strong
American president. QUIJANO:
Senator Kaine?

01:00:21.184 --> 01:00:25.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAINE: Hillary and I also agree
that the establishment of
humanitarian zones in northern
Syria with

01:00:25.922 --> 01:00:29.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the provision of international
human aid, consistent with the
U.N. Security Council

01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:34.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
resolution that was passed in
February 2014, would be a very,
very good idea.

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:39.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Hillary also has the ability
to stand up to Russia in a way
that this ticket does

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:43.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not. Donald Trump, again and
again, has praised Vladimir
Putin. And it's clear that he
has

01:00:43.039 --> 01:00:47.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
business dealings with Russian
oligarchs who are very connected
to Putin.

01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:52.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Trump campaign management
team had to be fired a month or
so ago because of those

01:00:52.182 --> 01:00:58.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
shadowy connections with
pro-Putin forces. Governor Pence
made the odd claim, he said

01:00:58.221 --> 01:01:04.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
inarguably Vladimir Putin is a
better leader than President
Obama. Vladimir Putin has run

01:01:04.361 --> 01:01:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his economy into the ground. He
persecutes LGBT folks and
journalists. If you don't know

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:15.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the difference between
dictatorship and leadership,
then you got to go back to a
fifth-grade civics

01:01:15.272 --> 01:01:16.640 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
class.

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'll tell you what offends me...

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:21.211 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PENCE: Well, that offended me.

01:01:21.211 --> 01:01:25.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: Governor Pence just said
-- Governor Pence just said that
Donald Trump will rebuild

01:01:25.115 --> 01:01:30.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the military. No, he won't.
Donald Trump is avoiding paying
taxes. The New York Times

01:01:30.921 --> 01:01:35.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
story -- and we need to get this
-- but the New York Times
suggested that he probably

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:39.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
didn't pay taxes for about 18
years starting in 1995. Those
years included the years of

01:01:39.262 --> 01:01:41.831 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
9/11.

01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:48.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So get this. On 9/11, Hillary
Clinton and Donald Trump's
hometown was attacked by the

01:01:48.271 --> 01:01:53.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
worst terrorist attack in the
history of the United States.
Young men and women -- young

01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:58.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
men and women signed up to serve
in the military to fight
terrorism. Hillary Clinton went
to

01:01:58.915 --> 01:02:04.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Washington to get funds to
rebuild her city and protect
first responders, but Donald
Trump

01:02:04.087 --> 01:02:08.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was fighting a very different
fight. It was a fight to avoid
paying taxes so that he wouldn't

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:09.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
support the fight
against terror.

01:02:09.659 --> 01:02:12.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUIJANO: The question was
about Aleppo, Senator.

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:15.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAINE: He wouldn't support
troops. He wouldn't -- he
wouldn't support -- this is
important,

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:21.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Elaine. When a guy running for
president will not support the
troops, not support veterans,

01:02:21.237 --> 01:02:22.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not support teachers,
that's really important.

01:02:22.672 --> 01:02:25.175 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
QUIJANO: Right.

01:02:25.175 --> 01:02:28.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: And I said about Aleppo,
we do agree the notion is we
have to create a humanitarian

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:31.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
zone in northern Syria.
It's very important.

01:02:31.715 --> 01:02:36.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUIJANO: Governor Pence, you had
mentioned no-fly zone. Where
would you propose setting

01:02:36.319 --> 01:02:40.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up a safe zone specifically?
How would you keep it safe?

01:02:40.457 --> 01:02:43.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: Well, first and foremost,
Donald Trump supports our
troops. Donald Trump supports

01:02:43.526 --> 01:02:44.728 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our veterans.

01:02:44.728 --> 01:02:46.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAINE: He won't pay taxes.

01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:48.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: Donald Trump has paid all
the taxes that he's -- do you
not take deductions? How

01:02:48.732 --> 01:02:50.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
does that work?

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:51.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUIJANO: Gentlemen, this is
about Syria. I'd like to...

01:02:51.034 --> 01:02:52.702 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:53.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PENCE: Honestly, Senator.
Honestly, Senator.

01:02:53.803 --> 01:02:56.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAINE: It is about our troops.
It is about our troops.

01:02:56.206 --> 01:02:57.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: I understand why you want
to change -- I understand why
you want to change the

01:02:57.707 --> 01:02:59.776 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
subject.

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:01.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAINE: How can you support the
troops if you won't pay taxes?

01:03:01.211 --> 01:03:02.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: I understand why you want
to change the subject. And let
me be very clear on this

01:03:02.979 --> 01:03:04.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russian thing. The
larger question here...

01:03:04.848 --> 01:03:07.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAINE: Do you think Donald Trump
is smart to not pay taxes?

01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:08.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUIJANO: Gentlemen, we're going
to have time to get to Russia
here.

01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:12.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: What we're dealing with
is the -- you know, there's an
old proverb that says the

01:03:12.856 --> 01:03:18.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian bear never dies, it just
hibernates. And the truth of the
matter is, the weak and

01:03:18.194 --> 01:03:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
feckless foreign policy of
Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama
has awakened an aggression

01:03:23.033 --> 01:03:27.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Russia that first appeared a
few years ago with their move in
Georgia, now their

01:03:27.437 --> 01:03:31.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
move into Crimea, now their move
into the wider Middle East.

01:03:31.775 --> 01:03:37.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all the while, all we do is
fold our arms and say we're not
having talks anymore. To

01:03:37.247 --> 01:03:43.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
answer your question, we just
need American strength. We need
to -- we need to marshal

01:03:43.353 --> 01:03:47.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the resources of our allies in
the region, and in the
immediate, we need to act and
act

01:03:47.057 --> 01:03:49.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
now to get people
out of harm's way.

01:03:49.759 --> 01:03:53.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUIJANO: And exactly how would
those safe zones work? How would
they remain safe?

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:58.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: The -- the safe zones
would have to be -- as the
senator said, there's already

01:03:58.301 --> 01:04:02.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a framework for this that's been
recognized by the international
community. The United

01:04:02.272 --> 01:04:08.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States of America needs to be
prepared to work with our allies
in the region to create

01:04:08.078 --> 01:04:11.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a route for safe passage and
then to protect people in those
areas, including with a no-fly

01:04:11.915 --> 01:04:14.551 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
zone.

01:04:14.551 --> 01:04:18.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, look, this is very tough
stuff. I served on the Foreign
Affairs Committee for a decade.

01:04:18.321 --> 01:04:23.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I traveled in and out of that
region for 10 years. I saw what
the American soldier won

01:04:23.393 --> 01:04:28.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Operation Iraqi Freedom. And
to see the weak and feckless
leadership that Hillary

01:04:28.832 --> 01:04:31.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton was the architect of and
the foreign policy of the Obama
administration...

01:04:31.501 --> 01:04:33.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KAINE: Well, let me --
let me come back...

01:04:33.503 --> 01:04:34.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: ... is deeply troubling
to me. That will all change the
day Donald Trump becomes

01:04:34.237 --> 01:04:36.473 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
president of the United States.

01:04:36.473 --> 01:04:38.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: ... and talk about -- let
me talk about the things that
Governor Pence doesn't want

01:04:38.007 --> 01:04:41.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to acknowledge, Elaine. He
doesn't want to acknowledge that
we stopped the Iranian nuclear

01:04:41.644 --> 01:04:43.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weapons program. He doesn't
want to acknowledge...

01:04:43.179 --> 01:04:45.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PENCE: We didn't.

01:04:45.582 --> 01:04:48.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: ... that Hillary was part
of a team that got bin Laden. He
doesn't want to acknowledge...

01:04:48.651 --> 01:04:51.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: I just did. KAINE: ...
that it's a good thing, not a
bad thing, that it's a good

01:04:51.921 --> 01:04:56.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thing -- not a bad thing -- that
we're down from 175,000 troops
deployed overseas to 15,000.

01:04:56.860 --> 01:05:00.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But let me tell you what will
really make the Middle East
dangerous. Donald Trump's

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:05.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
idea that more nations should
get nuclear weapons, Saudi
Arabia, Japan, South Korea.

01:05:05.969 --> 01:05:10.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ronald Reagan said something
really interesting about nuclear
proliferation back in the 1980s.

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:17.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said the problem with nuclear
proliferation is that some fool
or maniac could trigger

01:05:17.313 --> 01:05:21.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a catastrophic event. And I
think that's who Governor
Pence's running mate is, exactly

01:05:21.317 --> 01:05:24.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who Governor Reagan
warned us about.

01:05:24.187 --> 01:05:25.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: And come on. Senator.
Senator, that was even beneath
you and Hillary Clinton.

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:28.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that -- that's pretty low.

01:05:28.625 --> 01:05:31.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: But do you -- do you
think -- do you think we should
have -- more nuclear weapons

01:05:31.127 --> 01:05:32.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the world will make us safer?

01:05:32.695 --> 01:05:34.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PENCE: Senator, the...

01:05:34.464 --> 01:05:37.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KAINE: That's what
Donald Trump thinks.

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:42.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: Ronald Reagan also said
nuclear war should never be
fought because it can never

01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:47.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be won. And the United States of
America needs to make
investments in modernizing our
nuclear

01:05:47.143 --> 01:05:49.345 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
force for both deterrence...

01:05:49.345 --> 01:05:51.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

should get nuclear weapons?

01:05:51.214 --> 01:05:55.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: ... and assurance to our
allies. But let me go back to
this Iran thing. I mean,

01:05:55.685 --> 01:05:59.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he keeps saying that they
prevented -- that Hillary
Clinton started the deal with
the

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:02.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

no limitation on them obtaining

Russian President Vladimir Putin
invaded Ukraine, annexed Crimea,

01:07:48.598 --> 01:07:53.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and has provided crucial
military support to the Assad

would

01:07:53.469 --> 01:07:57.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your administration take to
counter these actions? Senator
Kaine?

01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:01.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: You've got to be tough on
Russia. So let's start with not
praising Vladimir Putin

01:08:01.244 --> 01:08:07.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as a great leader. Donald Trump
and Mike Pence have said he's a
great leader. And Donald

01:08:07.216 --> 01:08:08.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump has business...

-- has business dealings with
Russia that he refuses to
disclose.

01:08:16.025 --> 01:08:20.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to-
toe with Russia. She went
toe-to-toe with Russia as

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:24.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
secretary of state to do the New
START Agreement to reduce
Russia's nuclear stockpile.
She's

01:08:24.901 --> 01:08:27.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
had the experience doing it.

01:08:27.737 --> 01:08:32.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She went toe-to-toe with Russia
and lodged protests when they
went into Georgia. And

01:08:32.542 --> 01:08:35.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we've done the same thing about
Ukraine, but more than launching
protests, we've put punishing

01:08:35.979 --> 01:08:40.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
economic sanctions on Russia
that we need to continue.

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:42.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump, on the other hand,
didn't know that Russia had
invaded the Crimea.

01:08:42.585 --> 01:08:44.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PENCE: Oh, that's nonsense.

01:08:44.754 --> 01:08:48.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: He was on a TV show a
couple months back, and he said,
"I'll guarantee you this,

01:08:48.491 --> 01:08:51.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia's not going into the
Ukraine." And he had to be
reminded that they had gone into

01:08:51.227 --> 01:08:53.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Crimea two years before.

01:08:53.296 --> 01:08:56.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PENCE: He knew that.

01:08:56.099 --> 01:09:01.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

toe-to-toe with Russia to work
out a deal on New START.

01:09:01.304 --> 01:09:06.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She got them engaged on a
meaningful way to cap Iran's
nuclear weapons program. And yet

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:11.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she stood up to them on issues
such as Syria and their invasion
of Georgia. You've got

01:09:11.547 --> 01:09:15.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to have the ability to do
that, and Hillary does.

01:09:15.451 --> 01:09:19.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the other hand, in Donald
Trump, you have somebody who
praises Vladimir Putin all the

01:09:19.288 --> 01:09:26.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time. America should really
wonder about a President Trump,
who had a campaign manager

01:09:26.095 --> 01:09:31.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with ties to Putin, pro- Putin
elements in the Ukraine, who had
to be fired for that

01:09:31.401 --> 01:09:36.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reason. They should wonder --
when Donald Trump is sitting
down with Vladimir Putin,

01:09:36.305 --> 01:09:40.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is it going to be America's
bottom line or is it going to be
Donald Trump's bottom line

01:09:40.476 --> 01:09:43.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he's going to be worried
about with all of his business
dealings?

01:09:43.112 --> 01:09:47.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, this could be solved if
Donald Trump would be willing to
release his tax returns,

01:09:47.650 --> 01:09:50.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as he told the American public
that he would do. And I know
he's laughing at this, but

got to do with Russia?

01:09:54.357 --> 01:09:57.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

Richard Nixon has done it, and
Donald Trump has said I'm

01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:00.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doing business with Russia. The

01:10:46.876 --> 01:10:52.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the invasion of Ukraine, after
they'd infiltrated with what are

01:11:01.657 --> 01:11:07.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was saying it's not going to

01:12:52.602 --> 01:12:57.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, America is stronger than

larger than the Russian

01:12:57.974 --> 01:13:04.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
economy. America's political
system is superior to the crony,
corrupt capitalist system in

01:13:04.013 --> 01:13:08.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Russia in every way.

01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:16.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When Donald Trump and I observe
that, as I've said in Syria, in
Iran, in Ukraine, that the

01:13:16.025 --> 01:13:22.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

Russia has been stronger on the
world stage than this
administration,

01:13:22.698 --> 01:13:26.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's stating painful facts.
That's not an endorsement of
Vladimir Putin. That's an
indictment

01:13:26.669 --> 01:13:27.803 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
of the weak and
feckless leadership...

KAINE: Well, this is one where
we can just kind of go to the
tape on it. But Governor

01:13:34.143 --> 01:13:38.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pence said, inarguably, Vladimir
Putin is a better leader than
President Obama.

01:13:38.714 --> 01:13:40.916 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%

tell the difference, a country

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's running its economy
into the ground...

01:14:04.674 --> 01:14:08.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: Yeah. KAINE: And with
Donald Trump -- Donald Trump's
sons say that they have

01:14:08.044 --> 01:14:13.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all these business dealings with
Russia. Those could be disclosed
with tax returns, but they

01:14:13.215 --> 01:14:17.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
refuse to do them. Americans
need to worry about whether
Donald Trump will be watching

01:14:17.019 --> 01:14:19.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
out for America's bottom

QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, what
went wrong with the Russia
reset?

01:14:22.525 --> 01:14:26.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KAINE: Vladimir Putin.
Vladimir Putin is a dictator.

01:14:26.729 --> 01:14:29.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
QUIJANO: And what would
do you differently?

01:14:29.699 --> 01:14:34.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: Vladimir Putin is a
dictator. He's not a leader.
Anybody who thinks otherwise

01:14:34.570 --> 01:14:38.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't know Russian history and
they don't know Vladimir Putin.
Hillary Clinton knows

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:42.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exactly who this guy is. John
McCain said, I look in his eyes
and I see KGB. And Hillary

01:14:42.745 --> 01:14:43.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
kind of has that same feeling.

01:14:43.679 --> 01:14:46.048 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PENCE: Right.

01:14:46.048 --> 01:14:49.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: So how do deal with him?
You've got to -- we do have to
deal with Russia in a

01:14:49.418 --> 01:14:54.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lot of different ways. There are
areas where we can cooperate. So
it was Hillary Clinton

01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:59.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who worked with Russia on the
New START Treaty to reduce their
nuclear weapons stockpile.

01:14:59.729 --> 01:15:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was Hillary Clinton that
worked with Russia to get them
engaged in a community of
nations

01:15:04.233 --> 01:15:08.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to stop the Iranian nuclear
weapons without firing a shot.

01:15:08.904 --> 01:15:13.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's not going around praising
Vladimir Putin as a great guy.
But she knows how to sit down

01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:19.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at a table and negotiate tough
deals. This is a very
challenging part of the world,
and

01:15:19.048 --> 01:15:22.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we ought to have a
commander-in-chief who is
prepared and done it, rather
than somebody

01:15:22.485 --> 01:15:25.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
who goes around praising
Vladimir Putin as a great
leader.

01:15:25.621 --> 01:15:29.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUIJANO: All right, I'd like to
ask now about North Korea, Iran
and the threat of nuclear

01:15:29.892 --> 01:15:33.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weapons. North Korea recently
conducted its fifth and most
powerful nuclear test.

01:15:33.596 --> 01:15:36.265 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PENCE: Right.

01:15:36.265 --> 01:15:40.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUIJANO: What specific steps
would you take to prevent North
Korea from developing a
nuclear-armed

01:15:40.603 --> 01:15:45.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
missile capable of reaching the
United States? Governor Pence?

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:50.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: Well, first, we need to
-- we need to make a commitment
to rebuild our military,

01:15:50.246 --> 01:15:56.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
including modernizing our
nuclear forces. And we also need
-- we also need an effective

01:15:56.118 --> 01:16:03.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
American diplomacy that will
marshal the resources of nations
in the Asian Pacific Rim to put

01:16:03.592 --> 01:16:10.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pressure on North Korea, on Kim
Jong-un, to abandon his nuclear
ambitions. It has to remain

01:16:10.099 --> 01:16:14.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the policy of the United States
of America the denuclearization
of the Korean Peninsula,

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:17.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
plain and simple.

01:16:17.039 --> 01:16:21.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And when Donald Trump is
president of the United States,
we're -- we're not going to

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:28.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have the -- the kind of posture
in the world that has Russia
invading Crimea and Ukraine,

01:16:28.984 --> 01:16:33.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that has the Chinese building
new islands in the South China
Sea, that has literally

01:16:33.122 --> 01:16:37.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the world, including North
Korea, flouting American power.
We're going to -- we're going

01:16:37.259 --> 01:16:40.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to go back to the days of
peace through strength.

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:45.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I have to tell you that --
that all this talk about tax
returns -- and I get it, you

01:16:45.901 --> 01:16:47.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know, you want to keep bringing
that up. It must have -- must
have...

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:48.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAINE: Until he...

(CROSSTALK)

01:16:50.506 --> 01:16:54.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

focus group. But here -- Hillary
Clinton and her husband

01:16:54.510 --> 01:16:59.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
set up a private foundation
called the Clinton Foundation.
While she was secretary of
state,

01:16:59.982 --> 01:17:06.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Clinton Foundation accepted
tens of millions of dollars from
foreign governments and foreign

01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:08.958 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
donors.

01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:14.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, you all need to know out
there, this is basic stuff.
Foreign donors, and certainly

01:17:14.363 --> 01:17:19.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
foreign governments, cannot
participate in the American
political process. They cannot

01:17:19.401 --> 01:17:25.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
make financial contributions.
But the Clintons figured out a
way to create a foundation where

01:17:25.107 --> 01:17:30.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
foreign governments and foreign
donors could donate millions of
dollars. And then we found,

01:17:30.212 --> 01:17:34.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thanks to the good work of the
Associated Press, that more than
half her private meetings

01:17:34.049 --> 01:17:39.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when she was secretary of state
were given to major donors of
the Clinton Foundation.

01:17:39.054 --> 01:17:45.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you talk about all these --
all these baseless rumors about
Russia and the rest,

01:17:45.294 --> 01:17:48.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

KAINE: I'm going to talk about

talk about North Korea. So,

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:09.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the foundation. I am glad to
talk about the foundation. The
Clinton Foundation is

01:18:09.785 --> 01:18:14.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of the highest- rated
charities in the world. It
provides AIDS drugs to about
11.5

01:18:14.757 --> 01:18:20.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
million people. It helps
Americans deal with opioid
overdoses. It gets higher
rankings

01:18:20.863 --> 01:18:24.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
for its charity than the
American Red Cross does. The
Clinton foundation does an awful

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:27.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lot of good work.

01:18:27.303 --> 01:18:31.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton as secretary of
state took no action to benefit
the foundation. The State

01:18:31.807 --> 01:18:36.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Department did an investigation,
and they concluded that
everything Hillary Clinton

01:18:36.312 --> 01:18:41.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did as secretary of state was
completely in the interest of
the United States. So the

01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:44.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
foundation does good work. And
Hillary Clinton as secretary of
state acted in the interests

01:18:44.954 --> 01:18:47.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the United States.

01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:52.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But let's compare this now with

01:19:10.913 --> 01:19:14.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
remember, the Trump organization
is not a non-profit. It's
putting money into Donald

01:19:14.383 --> 01:19:18.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump's pockets and into the

the Clinton Foundation is

a non- profit and no Clinton

has a foundation. The foundation
was just fined for illegally

01:19:31.033 --> 01:19:36.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
contributing foundation dollars
to a political campaign of a
Florida attorney general. They

01:19:36.905 --> 01:19:41.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made an illegal contribution,
and then they tried to hide it
by disguising it to somebody

01:19:41.577 --> 01:19:45.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
else. And the person they
donated to was somebody whose
office was charged with
investigating

01:19:45.547 --> 01:19:48.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump University.

01:19:48.751 --> 01:19:53.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the difference between a
foundation that does good work
and a secretary of state

01:19:53.355 --> 01:19:57.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

American interest and somebody
who is conflicted and doing work

around the world and won't share

Senator, we would know a lot

01:20:51.814 --> 01:20:56.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, if you
had intelligence that North
Korea was about to launch a
missile,

01:20:56.819 --> 01:21:00.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a nuclear-armed missile capable
of reaching the United States,
would you take preemptive

01:21:00.489 --> 01:21:02.958 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
action?

01:21:02.958 --> 01:21:08.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KAINE: If we -- look, a
president should take action to
defend the United States against

01:21:08.097 --> 01:21:12.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
imminent threat. You have to. A
president has to do that. Now
exactly what action, you

01:21:12.401 --> 01:21:16.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would have to determine what
your intelligence was, how
certain you were of that
intelligence,

01:21:16.338 --> 01:21:19.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but you would have
to take action.

01:21:19.374 --> 01:21:23.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You asked the question about how
do we deal with a North Korea.
I'm on the Foreign Relations

01:21:23.479 --> 01:21:28.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Committee. We just did an
extensive sanctions package
against North Korea. And
interestingly

01:21:28.083 --> 01:21:32.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
enough, Elaine, the U.N.
followed and did this --
virtually the same package.
Often

01:21:32.521 --> 01:21:38.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
China will use their veto in the
Security Council to veto a
package like that. They're

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:41.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
starting to get worried about
North Korea, too. So they
actually supported the sanctions

01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:45.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
package, even though many of the
sanctions are against Chinese
firms, Chinese financial

01:21:45.467 --> 01:21:48.704 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
institutions.

01:21:48.704 --> 01:21:53.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we're working together with
China, and we need to. China's
another one of those
relationships

01:21:53.208 --> 01:21:58.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where it's competitive, it's
also challenging, and in times
like North Korea, we have to

01:21:58.447 --> 01:22:02.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be able to cooperate. Hillary
understands that very well. She
went once famously to

01:22:02.518 --> 01:22:06.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
China and stood up at a human
rights meeting and looked them
in the eye and said, "Women's

01:22:06.088 --> 01:22:10.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rights are human rights." They
didn't want her to say that, but
she did.

01:22:10.025 --> 01:22:14.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But she's also worked on a lot
of diplomatic and important
diplomatic deals with China.

01:22:14.296 --> 01:22:16.331 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And that's what
it's going to take.

01:22:16.331 --> 01:22:22.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The thing I would worry a little
bit about is that Donald Trump
owes about $650 million

01:22:22.437 --> 01:22:26.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to banks, including the Bank of
China. I'm not sure he could
stand up so tough to the

01:22:26.608 --> 01:22:28.877 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
people who have
loaned him money.

01:22:28.877 --> 01:22:33.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUIJANO: All right. I'd like to
turn to our next segment now.
And in this, I'd like to

01:22:33.081 --> 01:22:38.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
focus on social issues. You have
both been open about the role
that faith has played

01:22:38.854 --> 01:22:43.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in your lives. Can you discuss
in detail a time when you
struggled to balance your
personal

01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:48.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
faith and a public policy
position? Senator Kaine?

01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:52.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: Yeah, that's an easy one
for me, Elaine. It's an easy
one. I'm really fortunate. I

01:22:52.935 --> 01:22:56.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
grew up in a wonderful household
with great Irish Catholic
parents. My mom and dad are

01:22:56.438 --> 01:23:00.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sitting right here. I was
educated by Jesuits at Rockhurst
High School in Kansas City. My

01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:04.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
40th reunion is in 10 days.

01:23:04.179 --> 01:23:09.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I worked with Jesuit
missionaries in Honduras, now
nearly 35 years ago, and they
were the

01:23:09.585 --> 01:23:15.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heroes of my life. I try to
practice my religion in a very
devout way and follow the
teachings

01:23:15.757 --> 01:23:21.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of my church in my own personal
life. But I don't believe in
this nation, a First Amendment

01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:26.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nation, where we don't raise any
religion over the other, and we
allow people to worship

01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:31.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
as they please, that the
doctrines of any one religion
should be mandated for everyone.

01:23:31.773 --> 01:23:37.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For me, the hardest struggle in
my faith life was the Catholic
Church is against the death

01:23:37.246 --> 01:23:43.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
penalty and so am I. But I was
governor of a state, and the
state law said that there

01:23:43.652 --> 01:23:47.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was a death penalty for crimes
if the jury determined them to
be heinous. And so I had

01:23:47.356 --> 01:23:49.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to grapple with that.

01:23:49.725 --> 01:23:53.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I was running for governor,
I was attacked pretty strongly
because of my position on

01:23:53.595 --> 01:23:58.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the death penalty. But I looked
the voters of Virginia in the
eye and said, look, this

01:23:58.166 --> 01:24:03.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is my religion. I'm not going to
change my religious practice to
get one vote, but I

01:24:03.205 --> 01:24:07.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know how to take an oath and
uphold the law. And if you elect
me, I will uphold the law.

01:24:07.576 --> 01:24:13.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I was elected, and I did. It
was very, very difficult to
allow executions to go forward,

01:24:13.215 --> 01:24:17.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but in circumstances where I
didn't feel like there was a
case for clemency, I told
Virginia

01:24:17.386 --> 01:24:20.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
voters I would uphold
the law, and I did.

01:24:20.689 --> 01:24:25.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was a real struggle. But I
think it is really, really
important that those of us

01:24:25.027 --> 01:24:29.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who have deep faith lives don't
feel that we could just
substitute our own views for

01:24:29.531 --> 01:24:32.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
everybody else in society,
regardless of their views.

01:24:32.034 --> 01:24:34.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUIJANO: Governor Pence?

01:24:34.670 --> 01:24:42.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: Well, it's a wonderful
question. And my Christian faith
is at the very heart of

01:24:42.744 --> 01:24:48.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who I am. I was also raised in a
wonderful family of faith. It
was a church on Sunday

01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:50.752 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
morning and grace before dinner.

01:24:50.752 --> 01:24:55.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: But my Christian faith
became real for me when I made a
personal decision for

01:24:55.557 --> 01:25:02.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Christ when I was a freshman in
college. And I've tried to live
that out however imperfectly

01:25:02.297 --> 01:25:07.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
every day of my life since. And
with my wife at my side, we've
followed a calling into

01:25:07.569 --> 01:25:12.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
public service, where we've --
we've tried to -- we've tried to
keep faith with the values

01:25:12.808 --> 01:25:16.478 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that we cherish.

01:25:16.478 --> 01:25:22.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with regard to when I
struggle, I appreciate, and --
and -- and -- I have a great
deal of

01:25:22.851 --> 01:25:25.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
respect for Senator Kaine's
sincere faith. I truly do.

01:25:25.187 --> 01:25:27.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAINE: That's shared.

01:25:27.356 --> 01:25:35.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: But for me, I would tell
you that for me the sanctity of
life proceeds out of the

01:25:35.464 --> 01:25:43.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
belief that -- that ancient
principle that -- where God says
before you were formed in

01:25:43.171 --> 01:25:47.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the womb, I knew you, and so for
my first time in public life, I
sought to stand with

01:25:47.976 --> 01:25:52.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
great compassion for
the sanctity of life.

01:25:52.514 --> 01:25:58.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The state of Indiana has also
sought to make sure that we
expand alternatives in health

01:25:58.587 --> 01:26:03.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
care counseling for women,
non-abortion alternatives. I'm
also very pleased at the fact
we're well

01:26:03.091 --> 01:26:06.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
on our way in Indiana to
becoming the most pro-adoption
state in America. I think if

01:26:06.995 --> 01:26:10.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you're going to be pro-life, you
should -- you should be pro-
adoption.

01:26:10.866 --> 01:26:16.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what I can't understand is
with Hillary Clinton and now
Senator Kaine at her side

01:26:16.838 --> 01:26:22.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is to support a practice like
partial-birth abortion. I mean,
to hold to the view -- and

01:26:22.511 --> 01:26:28.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know Senator Kaine, you hold
pro-life views personally -- but
the very idea that a child

01:26:28.483 --> 01:26:33.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is almost born into the
world could still have their
life taken from them is just
anathema

01:26:33.922 --> 01:26:36.725 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to me.

01:26:36.725 --> 01:26:41.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I cannot -- I can't
conscience about -- about a
party that supports that. Or
that -- I know

01:26:41.963 --> 01:26:48.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you've historically opposed
taxpayer funding of abortion.
But Hillary Clinton wants to

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:51.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
-- wants to repeal the
longstanding provision in the
law where we said we wouldn't
use taxpayer

01:26:51.073 --> 01:26:54.409 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dollars to fund abortion.

01:26:54.409 --> 01:26:59.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So for me, my faith informs my
life. I try and spend a little
time on my knees every

01:26:59.414 --> 01:27:05.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
day. But it all for me begins
with cherishing the dignity, the
worth, the value of every

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:07.756 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
human life.

01:27:07.756 --> 01:27:13.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KAINE: Elaine, this is a
fundamental question, a
fundamental question. Hillary
and I are

01:27:13.795 --> 01:27:16.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
both people out of religious
backgrounds, from Methodist
church experience, which was

01:27:16.465 --> 01:27:20.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
really formative for her
as a public servant.

01:27:20.836 --> 01:27:26.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we really feel like you
should live fully and with
enthusiasm the commands of your
faith.

01:27:26.741 --> 01:27:31.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it is not the role of the
public servant to mandate that
for everybody else.

01:27:31.813 --> 01:27:38.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So let's talk about abortion and
choice. Let's talk about them.
We support Roe v. Wade. We

01:27:38.487 --> 01:27:44.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
support the constitutional right
of American women to consult
their own conscience, their

01:27:44.426 --> 01:27:52.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
own supportive partner, their
own minister, but then make
their own decision about
pregnancy.

01:27:52.334 --> 01:27:56.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's something we trust
American women to do that.

01:27:56.638 --> 01:28:00.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we don't think that women
should be punished, as Donald
Trump said they should, for
making

01:28:00.976 --> 01:28:04.679 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the decision to
have an abortion.

01:28:04.679 --> 01:28:09.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Governor Pence wants to repeal
Roe v. Wade. He said he wants to
put it on the ash heap

01:28:09.584 --> 01:28:12.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of history. And we have some
young people in the audience who
weren't even born when

01:28:12.921 --> 01:28:18.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Roe was decided. This is pretty
important. Before Roe v. Wade,
states could pass criminal

01:28:18.927 --> 01:28:24.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
laws to do just that, to punish
women if they made the choice to
terminate a pregnancy.

01:28:24.833 --> 01:28:30.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think you should live your
moral values. But the last
thing, the very last thing that

01:28:30.739 --> 01:28:37.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government should do is have
laws that would punish women who
make reproductive choices.

01:28:37.445 --> 01:28:41.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is the fundamental
difference between a
Clinton-Kaine ticket and a
Trump- Pence

01:28:41.449 --> 01:28:44.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ticket that wants to punish
women who make that choice.

01:28:44.786 --> 01:28:49.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PENCE: No, it's really not.
Donald Trump and I would never
support legislation that
punished

01:28:49.724 --> 01:28:51.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
women who made the heartbreaking
choice to end a pregnancy.

01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:52.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KAINE: Then why did
Donald Trump say that?

01:28:52.694 --> 01:28:53.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PENCE: We just never would.

01:28:53.795 --> 01:28:55.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAINE: Why did he say that?

01:28:55.897 --> 01:28:59.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: Well, look, it's -- look,
he's not a polished politician
like you and Hillary

01:28:59.201 --> 01:29:00.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Clinton. And so...

01:29:00.936 --> 01:29:01.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAINE: Well, I would admit
that's not a polished...

01:29:01.236 --> 01:29:03.505 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:29:03.505 --> 01:29:03.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: You know, things don't
always come out exactly the way
he means them.

01:29:03.471 --> 01:29:05.407 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAINE: Well, can I say...

01:29:05.407 --> 01:29:06.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: But I'm telling you what
the policy of our administration
would be.

01:29:06.808 --> 01:29:09.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: Great line from the --
great line from the gospel of
Matthew. From the fullness of

01:29:09.311 --> 01:29:12.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the heart, the mouth speaks.

01:29:12.314 --> 01:29:15.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: Yeah. KAINE: When Donald
Trump says women should be
punished or Mexicans are rapists

01:29:15.317 --> 01:29:16.551 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and criminals...

01:29:16.551 --> 01:29:18.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PENCE: I'm telling you...

01:29:18.386 --> 01:29:21.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: ... or John McCain is not
a hero, he is showing you who he
is.

01:29:21.823 --> 01:29:25.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: Senator, you've whipped
out that Mexican thing again. He
-- look...

01:29:25.794 --> 01:29:28.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAINE: Can you defend it?

01:29:28.663 --> 01:29:33.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: There are criminal aliens
in this country, Tim, who have
come into this country illegally

01:29:33.401 --> 01:29:36.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who are perpetrating violence
and taking American lives.

01:29:36.238 --> 01:29:37.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: You want to -- you want
to use a big broad brush against
Mexicans on that?

01:29:37.939 --> 01:29:42.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: He also said and many of
them are good people. You keep
leaving that out of your

01:29:42.077 --> 01:29:45.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quote. And if you want me
to go there, I'll go there.

01:29:45.347 --> 01:29:50.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But here's -- there is a choice,
and it is a choice on life. I
couldn't be more proud

01:29:50.752 --> 01:29:56.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be standing with Donald
Trump, who's standing for the
right to life. It's a principle
that

01:29:56.992 --> 01:29:59.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- Senator Kaine -- and I'm very
gentle about this, because I
really do respect you -- it's

01:29:59.928 --> 01:30:04.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a principle that you embrace.

01:30:04.099 --> 01:30:09.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have appreciated the fact
that you've supported the Hyde
amendment, which bans the

01:30:09.337 --> 01:30:13.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
use of taxpayer funding for
abortion, in the past, but
that's not Hillary Clinton's
view.

01:30:13.508 --> 01:30:18.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People need to understand, we
can come together as a nation.
We can create a culture of life.

01:30:18.913 --> 01:30:25.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More and more young people today
are embracing life because we
know we are -- we're better

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:28.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for it. We can -- like Mother
Teresa said at that famous
national prayer breakfast...

01:30:28.923 --> 01:30:31.059 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAINE: This is important --

01:30:31.059 --> 01:30:33.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: ... bring the -- let's
welcome the children into our
world. There are so many

01:30:33.862 --> 01:30:37.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
families around the country who
can't have children. We could
improve adoption...

01:30:37.265 --> 01:30:39.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAINE: But, Governor...

01:30:39.634 --> 01:30:41.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: ... so that families that
can't have children can adopt
more readily those children

01:30:41.670 --> 01:30:43.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from crisis pregnancies.

01:30:43.938 --> 01:30:48.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: Governor, why don't you
trust women to make this choice
for themselves? We can

01:30:48.076 --> 01:30:53.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
encourage people to support
life. Of course we can. But why
don't you trust women? Why

01:30:53.348 --> 01:30:59.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't Donald Trump trust women
to make this choice for
themselves?

01:30:59.354 --> 01:31:03.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what we ought to be doing
in public life. Living our lives
of faith or motivation

01:31:03.625 --> 01:31:07.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with enthusiasm and excitement,
convincing other, dialoguing
with each other about important

01:31:07.429 --> 01:31:08.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
moral issues of the day...

01:31:08.463 --> 01:31:10.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PENCE: Because there are...

01:31:10.899 --> 01:31:14.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAINE: ... but on fundamental
issues of morality, we should
let women make their own
decisions.

01:31:14.502 --> 01:31:19.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: Because there is -- a
society can be judged by how it
deals with its most vulnerable,

01:31:19.107 --> 01:31:24.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the aged, the infirm, the
disabled, and the unborn. I
believe it with all my heart.
And

01:31:24.045 --> 01:31:28.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I couldn't be more proud to be
standing with a pro-life
candidate in Donald Trump.

01:31:28.249 --> 01:31:33.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUIJANO: I do have one final
question for you both tonight.
It has been a divisive campaign.

01:31:33.788 --> 01:31:38.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Kaine, if your ticket
wins, what specifically are you
going to do to unify the country
and

01:31:38.226 --> 01:31:41.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reassure the people who
voted against you?

01:31:41.663 --> 01:31:46.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAINE: That's a really important
one. That may be the $64,000
question, because it has

01:31:46.768 --> 01:31:52.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been a divisive campaign. And
again, Hillary is running a
campaign about stronger
together,

01:31:52.073 --> 01:31:57.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Donald Trump -- and this is
-- this is not directed at this
man, except to the extent

01:31:57.011 --> 01:31:59.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he can't defend Donald
Trump -- Donald Trump has run a
campaign that's been about

01:31:59.514 --> 01:32:02.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
one insult after the next.

01:32:02.117 --> 01:32:08.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we do have to bring the
country together. So here's what
we'll do. Hillary Clinton was

01:32:08.056 --> 01:32:12.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first lady, then senator for
eight years and secretary of
state. And I served in the
Senate.

01:32:12.794 --> 01:32:17.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm really amazed, Elaine,
as I talk to Republican
senators, how well they regard

01:32:17.298 --> 01:32:20.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and respect Hillary Clinton.

01:32:20.168 --> 01:32:24.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She was on the Armed Services
Committee. She was on other
committees. She worked across

01:32:24.272 --> 01:32:29.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the aisle when she was first
lady to get the CHIP program
passed so that 8 million
low-income

01:32:29.043 --> 01:32:34.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kids have health insurance in
this country, including 150,000
in Indiana.

01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:38.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She worked across the aisle
after 9/11 to get health
benefits for the first
responders

01:32:38.553 --> 01:32:43.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who bravely went into the towers
and into the Pentagon. She
worked to get benefits for

01:32:43.691 --> 01:32:47.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- TRICARE benefits for National
Guard members, including
Hoosiers and Virginians in the
National

01:32:47.228 --> 01:32:49.798 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Guard.

01:32:49.798 --> 01:32:54.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She has a track record of
working across the aisle to make
things happen. And, you know,

01:32:54.803 --> 01:32:58.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Elaine, I have the same track
record. I was a governor of
Virginia with two Republican

01:32:58.807 --> 01:33:03.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
houses. And in the Senate, I
have good working relationships
across the aisle.

01:33:03.778 --> 01:33:07.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because I think it's fine to be
a Democrat or Republican or
independent, but after Election

01:33:07.615 --> 01:33:12.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Day, the goal is work together.
And Hillary Clinton has a track
record of accomplishment

01:33:12.253 --> 01:33:15.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
across the aisle that will
enable her to do just that when
we work with the new Congress

01:33:15.223 --> 01:33:17.125 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in January.

01:33:17.125 --> 01:33:19.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUIJANO: Governor, how will you
unify the country if you win?

01:33:19.994 --> 01:33:22.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PENCE: Well, thank you, Elaine,
and thanks for a great
discussion...

01:33:22.597 --> 01:33:24.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAINE: Absolutely.

01:33:24.199 --> 01:33:27.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PENCE: ... tonight.
Thank you, Senator.

01:33:27.836 --> 01:33:34.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a very challenging time
in the life of our nation.
Weakened America's place in

01:33:34.008 --> 01:33:38.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the world after the leadership
of Hillary Clinton and Barack
Obama on the world stage

01:33:38.046 --> 01:33:44.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has been followed by an economy
that is truly struggling,
stifled by an avalanche of more

01:33:44.886 --> 01:33:50.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
taxes, more regulation,
Obamacare, the war on coal, and
the kind of trade deals that

01:33:50.959 --> 01:33:55.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have put American workers in the
back seat. I think the best way
that we can bring people

01:33:55.530 --> 01:34:00.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
together is through change
in Washington, D.C.

01:34:00.368 --> 01:34:06.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You know, I served in
Washington, D.C., for 12 years
in the Congress of the United
States.

01:34:06.274 --> 01:34:10.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I served with many
Republicans and Democrats, men
and women of goodwill. The
potential is

01:34:10.979 --> 01:34:15.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there to really change the
direction of this country, but
it's going to take leadership

01:34:15.216 --> 01:34:17.819 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do it.

01:34:17.819 --> 01:34:23.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The American people want to see

entire career has been

01:34:37.138 --> 01:34:42.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about building. It's been about
-- it's going through hardship
just like a businessperson

01:34:42.110 --> 01:34:47.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
does and finding a way through
smarts and ingenuity and
resilience to fight forward

and -- when Donald Trump becomes
president of the United States,
we're going to have

01:34:50.518 --> 01:34:53.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a stronger America.

01:34:53.121 --> 01:34:59.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you hear him say he wants
to make America great again,
when we do that, I truly do
believe

01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:02.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the American people are going to
be standing taller. They're
going to see that real change

01:35:02.931 --> 01:35:07.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can happen after decades of just
talking about it. And when that
happens, the American people

01:35:07.969 --> 01:35:11.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are going to stand tall, stand
together, and we'll have the
kind of unity that's been
missing

01:35:11.005 --> 01:35:12.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for way too long.

01:35:12.674 --> 01:35:16.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
QUIJANO: All right,
gentlemen, thank you so much.

01:35:16.344 --> 01:35:21.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This concludes the vice
presidential debate. My thanks
to the candidates, the
commission,

01:35:21.282 --> 01:35:25.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and to you for watching. Please

second presidential debate

01:35:25.853 --> 01:35:30.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

Louis and the final debate on
October 19th at the University

Elaine Quijano of CBS News. Good
night.

01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:43.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that does
wrap up the vice presidential
debate between Tim Kaine and

01:35:43.471 --> 01:35:46.074 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mike Pence.

01:35:46.074 --> 01:35:51.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining me here in our "PBS
NewsHour" studio for some
analysis are syndicated
columnist

01:35:51.913 --> 01:35:56.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark Shields, Amy Walter of The
Cook Political Report, and

Gerson.

01:35:59.087 --> 01:36:02.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To all three of you, we're going
to continue to watch Mr. Pence,
Governor Pence, and Senator

01:36:02.657 --> 01:36:06.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Kaine on the stage as
they greet their family.

01:36:06.094 --> 01:36:11.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, Mark Shields, this was a
debate with a lot of issue
questions. What did you think?

01:36:11.699 --> 01:36:18.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I thought that the
Republicans, in both weeks, if
there were sprints of 20

01:36:18.239 --> 01:36:23.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
minutes did pretty well.
Unfortunately, they're 90-minute
marathons. Tim Kaine came out
captivated

01:36:23.645 --> 01:36:26.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and a little hyper.

01:36:26.748 --> 01:36:35.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As it went on, he got stronger,
more measured, and put --
dominated the debate in terms of

01:36:35.056 --> 01:36:40.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
putting Mike Pence, whose tone
throughout, I thought, was
excellent, but put him on
defensive.

01:36:40.361 --> 01:36:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said, "I don't believe you
will defend Donald Trump," and
then did the litany. Everything

01:36:45.233 --> 01:36:50.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he said about Donald Trump was
true. And Mike -- and he was
right. Mike Pence didn't defend

01:36:50.538 --> 01:36:59.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him. He made the best case he
could. I thought Pence made a
good affirmative case, he was

01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:02.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
put on the defensive in trying
to defend Trump, which he
refused to do.

01:37:02.150 --> 01:37:06.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter, did
you see Tim Kaine putting
Governor Pence on the defensive?

01:37:06.888 --> 01:37:11.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: I think that we're
going to have to figure out, as
people start to digest this,

01:37:11.259 --> 01:37:16.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what folks are going to remember
more about this debate, whether
it was Kaine interrupting

01:37:16.197 --> 01:37:22.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to put him on the defensive,
which, if you just judged by
Twitter and people sort of

01:37:22.270 --> 01:37:27.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
keying in, they found that a
little over the top, just too
much time interrupting, not

01:37:27.775 --> 01:37:32.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
enough tough time kind of
talking about the issues in a
more measured way.

01:37:32.714 --> 01:37:40.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is true, though, that while
Kaine definitely threw all of
Trump's past statements at
Pence,

01:37:40.054 --> 01:37:45.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he found a way to duck and dodge
and try to get the conversation
back to Hillary Clinton,

01:37:45.493 --> 01:37:48.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
back to the issues he
wanted to talk about.

01:37:48.296 --> 01:37:52.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are voters going to, as Mark
said, see that and go, look, he
didn't actually address those

01:37:52.767 --> 01:38:00.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
specific issues, or will they
remember it more for the fact
that we didn't hear Mike

01:38:00.508 --> 01:38:06.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pence go sort of down a rabbit
hole in the same way that Donald
Trump did in the last

01:38:06.547 --> 01:38:10.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debate, where he just defended
over-the-top statements and then
got himself in bigger

01:38:10.251 --> 01:38:12.086 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
trouble?

01:38:12.086 --> 01:38:13.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you
see it, Michael Gerson?

01:38:13.821 --> 01:38:18.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: I think that
Senator Kaine often got the best
of the arguments. He had

01:38:18.993 --> 01:38:26.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this rat-a-tat delivery like a
prepared prosecutor. And he had
a lot of material to work with,

01:38:26.601 --> 01:38:32.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be honest, I think, with
Trump's past statements.

01:38:32.106 --> 01:38:38.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everyone that loves Tim Kaine
who knows him, I'm not sure that
was on display tonight here

01:38:38.179 --> 01:38:45.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the debate. He was sometimes
not very appealing, particularly
in the first half of the debate,

01:38:45.052 --> 01:38:47.588 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
where I think he interrupted.

01:38:47.588 --> 01:38:54.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I would think, by points,
you do Kaine, and, then by
style, it was often Pence.

01:38:54.495 --> 01:38:58.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're saying
that you thought Kaine did --
was too much on the attack, too

01:38:58.966 --> 01:39:03.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
much trying to pin
down Mike Pence?

01:39:03.037 --> 01:39:08.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: Yes, I think
caffeinated was maybe too kind
in this case. He often -- he

01:39:08.976 --> 01:39:15.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sometimes seemed rude. And that
I think in a debate can come
across poorly. So, yes,

01:39:15.349 --> 01:39:16.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but he did he get
better over time.

01:39:16.450 --> 01:39:18.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

01:39:18.719 --> 01:39:24.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our Lisa Desjardins -- as we
continue to watch the candidates
there on the stage at Longwood

01:39:24.592 --> 01:39:29.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
University, our Lisa Desjardins
is somewhere behind the stage or
nearby, where she has

01:39:29.197 --> 01:39:30.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been watching the debate.

01:39:30.898 --> 01:39:34.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa, so, tell us what you're
seeing and hearing there.

01:39:34.735 --> 01:39:38.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right,
nearby the stage and through the
next building.

01:39:38.773 --> 01:39:43.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the spin room, where we
hear from the campaigns
immediately after debates.

01:39:43.077 --> 01:39:47.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I was fortunate that, a few
feet away from me, who came
through the curtain but

01:39:47.114 --> 01:39:50.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kellyanne Conway, the campaign
manager for Donald Trump. I was
the first to speak with

01:39:50.151 --> 01:39:53.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her. And I don't think she had
spoken to many reporters at this
point.

01:39:53.387 --> 01:39:57.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here is what the Trump campaign
told me, what Kellyanne Conway
said. She said, this was

01:39:57.158 --> 01:40:00.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vintage Pence. She felt he
knocked it out of the park, that
he was particularly commanding

01:40:00.127 --> 01:40:02.697 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on policy.

01:40:02.697 --> 01:40:07.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And here's especially what she
said, folks. She said she felt
he was polite and was never

01:40:07.735 --> 01:40:13.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rude, and she feels that Tim
Kaine will regret the number of
times he interrupted tonight.

01:40:13.608 --> 01:40:18.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the other hand, standing
behind me, see this giant scrum
of reporters and microphones.

01:40:18.512 --> 01:40:23.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're all in that pile of
people talking to Robby Mook
with the Clinton campaign. And

01:40:23.718 --> 01:40:27.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can hear, standing -- I'm
close enough to hear what he is
saying.

01:40:27.488 --> 01:40:32.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's stressing other things.
He's staying that he felt that
Tim Kaine had a strong night

01:40:32.026 --> 01:40:36.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on a couple of areas, one of
them being talking about women,
talking about their appeal to

01:40:36.797 --> 01:40:40.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
women, and also talking about
Donald Trump's history of verbal
attacks, as they're calling

01:40:40.501 --> 01:40:43.137 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it, on women and on immigrants.

01:40:43.137 --> 01:40:48.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you have two very different
takes on this debate tonight.
Not hearing about interruptions

01:40:48.276 --> 01:40:50.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the Kaine camp, but that
seems like something the Trump
folks are going to stress,
probably

01:40:50.845 --> 01:40:53.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not just tonight.

01:40:53.214 --> 01:40:57.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, Lisa,
and we may well be coming back
to you a little bit later

01:40:57.919 --> 01:41:00.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as you get a chance to talk to
some of the other
representatives of the two
campaigns

01:41:00.621 --> 01:41:01.856 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

01:41:01.856 --> 01:41:04.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Great.

01:41:04.125 --> 01:41:06.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I think we want
to go up to our newsroom right
now. Is that right?

01:41:06.294 --> 01:41:10.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our John Yang has also been
listening very closely to the
debate with our team. He's

01:41:10.298 --> 01:41:14.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been talking -- working with our
team fact-checking what was said
tonight.

01:41:14.035 --> 01:41:16.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John, what did you discover?

01:41:16.637 --> 01:41:19.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, Judy, we found
couple of instances when each of
the candidates had

01:41:19.874 --> 01:41:22.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a little trouble with the facts.

01:41:22.443 --> 01:41:28.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the one hand, it was the --
Tim Kaine, when he was praising
the top of his ticket,

01:41:28.282 --> 01:41:34.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, he gave her
credit for tough negotiation to
eliminate the Iranian nuclear

01:41:34.055 --> 01:41:36.791 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
weapons program.

01:41:36.791 --> 01:41:43.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, that agreement came
two-and-a-half years after
Secretary Clinton left the
administration,

01:41:43.731 --> 01:41:48.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that the -- the agreement
itself slows the nuclear weapon
program in Iran, doesn't

01:41:48.035 --> 01:41:51.339 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
eliminate it.

01:41:51.339 --> 01:41:57.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Mike Pence also got into a
little trouble when he was
talking about the top of his
ticket,

01:41:57.111 --> 01:42:03.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump, but it came in
defending Mr. Trump when --
against the allegation -- or

01:42:03.317 --> 01:42:09.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tim Kaine saying that Trump had
said that more -- more nations
should get nuclear weapons.

01:42:09.090 --> 01:42:13.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Pence came back, "He never said
that, Senator, and you know it."

01:42:13.794 --> 01:42:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, in March, Trump told
The New York Times that it may
not be such a bad thing

01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:26.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the United States if Japan,
South Korea and Saudi Arabia had
nuclear weapons.

01:42:26.107 --> 01:42:32.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, in each instance, the top of
the ticket got the number two on
the ticket into a little

01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:36.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trouble, in one case praising
and in one case defending --
Judy.

01:42:36.317 --> 01:42:38.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you, John.

01:42:38.886 --> 01:42:42.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we know there was a lot
thrown around in the debate
tonight. There were a lot of

01:42:42.857 --> 01:42:45.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issues that they covered. But
before we get to any more of
that, Mark, I want to come

01:42:45.559 --> 01:42:50.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back to you on the point --
points that Amy and Michael were
making a minute ago, about

01:42:50.664 --> 01:42:57.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where Tim Kaine may have won on
points, but, when it comes to
presentation, to demeanor,

01:42:57.038 --> 01:42:58.305 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
maybe he didn't.

01:42:58.305 --> 01:43:00.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you see that?

01:43:00.608 --> 01:43:02.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, I thought --
as I said, I used the word
caffeinated. I thought he

01:43:02.410 --> 01:43:05.112 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was quick.

01:43:05.112 --> 01:43:08.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had canned lines, prepared
lines, like "You're hired
president, you're fired
president."

01:43:08.883 --> 01:43:14.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He appeared, to use a word,
overprepared. I mean, there's no
doubt about it.

01:43:14.488 --> 01:43:20.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think, as it went on,
there was no question he was
prosecuting in a more affable
sense,

01:43:20.795 --> 01:43:25.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but he was making the case. When
he said that Governor Pence had
to give Donald Trump his

01:43:25.166 --> 01:43:29.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tax returns in order to be
chosen as vice president...

01:43:29.036 --> 01:43:30.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MICHAEL GERSON: That
was a good point.

01:43:30.304 --> 01:43:32.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: ... it
was a superb point.

01:43:32.339 --> 01:43:35.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then Pence, you know, he
would say, "I don't think
Senator Pence will defend --
Governor

01:43:35.643 --> 01:43:39.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Pence will defend this."
And he was right.

01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:47.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pence didn't spend his time
going down a rabbit hole, as Amy
put it, or defending Donald
Trump.

01:43:47.455 --> 01:43:52.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I guess, when Mike Pence
said, Donald Trump used the tax
code just the way it's

01:43:52.626 --> 01:44:00.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
supposed to be used,
brilliantly, boy, oh, boy, I
have to be very frank. Show us
the

01:44:00.734 --> 01:44:05.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tax returns. I mean, if it was
-- how brilliant was it, if you
want to do it.

01:44:05.506 --> 01:44:10.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the point that was made that
I think will come out of this
debate is the narrative.

01:44:10.177 --> 01:44:15.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the Clinton campaign has
mishandled Trump's taxes. And it
should be that, he says

01:44:15.916 --> 01:44:22.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's smart. And Tim Kaine made
the point that that means that
the people who pay the taxes,

01:44:22.790 --> 01:44:27.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether they're firefighters or
emergency room nurses or E-5s in
the Marine Corps, they're

01:44:27.461 --> 01:44:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dumb. The people who pay for
special education teachers or
pay for cops and firefighters,

01:44:31.866 --> 01:44:34.335 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they're dumb.

01:44:34.335 --> 01:44:38.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that's -- that's the
way to separate Donald Trump
from his constituency. And I

01:44:38.672 --> 01:44:41.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thought that was well done.

01:44:41.208 --> 01:44:47.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there's question, he was
yippy and yappy, like a little
puppy, at the outset.

01:44:47.648 --> 01:44:55.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter, on
this tax point, did -- was Tim
Kaine right to bring it up

01:44:55.422 --> 01:45:00.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
again and again and again? Or
are we just tired of hearing
about it?

01:45:00.594 --> 01:45:03.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: No, Tim Kaine's
job was pretty simple.

01:45:03.564 --> 01:45:12.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was to remind the viewers at
every moment things that Trump
has said and done that are

01:45:12.773 --> 01:45:17.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very difficult to defend. And,
as we discussed, Pence had a
very difficult time and
sometimes

01:45:17.244 --> 01:45:22.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
completely avoided
answering those questions.

01:45:22.716 --> 01:45:26.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mike Pence's job wasn't only to
deflect those, but then to try
to bring it back. He sounded

01:45:26.787 --> 01:45:31.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like trying to shoehorn in the
e-mail server in an unrelated
question. Oh, I got to make

01:45:31.425 --> 01:45:33.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sure to get that in. Make sure
got the Clinton Foundation. Make
sure you shoehorn that in.

01:45:33.627 --> 01:45:35.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

01:45:35.896 --> 01:45:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: But what Pence also
did through -- at the very
beginning -- he tried to do

01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:44.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it again at the end and tried to
get it in there at other points
-- this is about strength,

01:45:44.338 --> 01:45:49.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is about putting America
back on track, right, this
message of change, things aren't

01:45:49.877 --> 01:45:54.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
going well. If you want
continuity of the bad things
that are happening now, then go

01:45:54.715 --> 01:45:57.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ahead and vote for Hillary
Clinton. If you want to go
change and you want strength,
come

01:45:57.885 --> 01:46:00.454 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with us.

01:46:00.454 --> 01:46:06.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that was hard to do when it
was a constant barrage of Trump
statements that he had to

01:46:06.093 --> 01:46:08.629 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
defend against.

01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But isn't that
what -- I mean, to play devil's
advocate here, Michael, isn't

01:46:12.566 --> 01:46:16.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that what the Clinton campaign
needs to do, I mean, to keep
reminding people of what Donald

01:46:16.437 --> 01:46:17.571 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trump has said?

01:46:17.571 --> 01:46:19.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL GERSON: Yes.

01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:25.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, on a number of issues, I
think it worked. Governor Pence
had a habit of saying reassuring

01:46:25.479 --> 01:46:32.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things about -- that he clearly
believes on Russia or Syria or a
lot of other topics.

01:46:32.019 --> 01:46:34.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not clear that Donald Trump
would believe those things.

01:46:34.021 --> 01:46:35.189 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:46:35.189 --> 01:46:37.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

01:46:37.424 --> 01:46:41.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: I mean, he
essentially had to -- often had
to defend Donald Trump by

01:46:41.895 --> 01:46:47.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
having a different Donald Trump,
by essentially saying that this
is not the man you see.

01:46:47.868 --> 01:46:54.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you can go to the record.
And that -- and, ultimately, he
could not defend on those issues

01:46:54.475 --> 01:47:00.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
having to do with civility and
cruelty and the treatment of
women and all of these issues

01:47:00.781 --> 01:47:06.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Kaine came back to again
and again. There is no response.
There can't be a response.

01:47:06.620 --> 01:47:09.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has not apologized for those
things. And so you can't
respond.

01:47:09.056 --> 01:47:10.658 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:47:10.658 --> 01:47:11.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Well, he
tried to deflect it.

01:47:11.592 --> 01:47:12.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MICHAEL GERSON: To
change the topic.

01:47:12.893 --> 01:47:13.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, you're running
an insult-driven campaign.

01:47:13.193 --> 01:47:15.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL GERSON: Yes.

01:47:15.162 --> 01:47:16.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: You're the
insult-driven campaign. And that
was his only...

01:47:16.397 --> 01:47:17.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: And then pivot.

01:47:17.231 --> 01:47:19.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

01:47:19.633 --> 01:47:20.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, at one
point, he simply said nothing,
and just -- it just went back

01:47:20.634 --> 01:47:23.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the questioner.

01:47:23.103 --> 01:47:27.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: After the litany
he went through, and he didn't
say anything, and the -- that

01:47:27.775 --> 01:47:30.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was the one point where I wanted
the moderator to insert herself
and say, do you have an

01:47:30.477 --> 01:47:33.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
answer for that? But...

01:47:33.013 --> 01:47:36.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, we
have got Lisa Desjardins. We are
going to go back to Farmville,

01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:39.653 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Virginia, to
Longwood University.

01:47:39.653 --> 01:47:43.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lisa, you have been talking to
some more campaign
representatives?

01:47:43.490 --> 01:47:46.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

01:47:46.694 --> 01:47:53.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, Judy, this theme of
a real flip in the execution of
tone is what we see happening.

01:47:53.267 --> 01:47:56.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just spoke with Virginia
Senator Mark Warner. Of course,
he used to be the governor of
this

01:47:56.904 --> 01:48:01.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fine state. And when he was
governor, his lieutenant
governor was Tim Kaine.

01:48:01.075 --> 01:48:05.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Few people know Tim Kaine
better. And I asked Governor
Warner. I said, what about this
accusation

01:48:05.112 --> 01:48:10.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Tim Kaine interrupted too
often, that perhaps he was rude?
Mark Warner said: If

01:48:10.718 --> 01:48:14.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anything, I would never imagine
calling Tim Kaine rude. Perhaps
there was some back and

01:48:14.388 --> 01:48:17.157 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forth.

01:48:17.157 --> 01:48:19.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I said, no, I counted
interruptions. And he did
interrupt frequently. Governor
Pence

01:48:19.593 --> 01:48:22.029 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
did as well.

01:48:22.029 --> 01:48:26.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he said: No, I think -- this
is from the Democratic viewpoint
-- they say, what Governor

01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:31.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kaine -- what Senator Kaine was
trying to do was to get Governor
Pence to answer for

01:48:31.338 --> 01:48:33.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Trump campaign.

01:48:33.941 --> 01:48:37.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we're going to have
Democrats say that the
Pence-Trump campaign didn't
answer

01:48:37.811 --> 01:48:40.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the accusations made tonight.

01:48:40.647 --> 01:48:45.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the other hand, I talked to
Alabama Republican Senator Jeff
Sessions, who says they felt

01:48:45.252 --> 01:48:51.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the tone from Governor
Pence showed he is a
higher-level player than we saw
from

01:48:51.158 --> 01:48:56.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Clinton campaign tonight and
from Senator Kaine. But,
moreover, he was talking about

01:48:56.697 --> 01:48:59.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
depth of policy from
Governor Pence.

01:48:59.833 --> 01:49:03.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We did see some serious policy
discussions tonight. And it's
interesting that we hear

01:49:03.670 --> 01:49:07.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Trump campaign in particular
pointing that out and feeling
that they made some inroads

01:49:07.808 --> 01:49:09.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there. Obviously, that's for
viewers to decide, but it's
something that the Trump
campaign

01:49:09.877 --> 01:49:12.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is crowing about right now.

01:49:12.179 --> 01:49:17.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, Lisa
talking to representatives of
the campaigns there at

01:49:17.151 --> 01:49:20.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the debate site at
Longwood University.

01:49:20.053 --> 01:49:22.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Amy, this is the point in the
discussion when we get to, OK,
how much difference is all

01:49:22.990 --> 01:49:24.124 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this...

01:49:24.124 --> 01:49:25.559 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:49:25.559 --> 01:49:27.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Going
to make, right.

01:49:27.461 --> 01:49:29.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... going to make
in the course, the trajectory of
this campaign, whatever

01:49:29.396 --> 01:49:30.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
these two gentlemen did?

01:49:30.631 --> 01:49:31.732 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:49:31.732 --> 01:49:34.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

01:49:34.134 --> 01:49:37.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, we have spent a whole lot
of time talking about tone and
interrupting. And we have to

01:49:37.638 --> 01:49:42.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also recognize that, for most
Americans, what they're going to
see of this debate is going

01:49:42.609 --> 01:49:45.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to come in 30-second clips that
the morning shows are going to
show or other programs

01:49:45.946 --> 01:49:48.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
like you will show
tomorrow night.

01:49:48.816 --> 01:49:53.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, if it is, as Mark
pointed out, the rat-a-tat-tat
of the, you said this, you said

01:49:53.854 --> 01:49:57.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this -- you know, or Donald
Trump said this, this, this,
this, this, the Mount Rushmore

01:49:57.925 --> 01:50:01.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
-- he supports the Mount
Rushmore of these terrible
people, like Putin and Kim
Jong-un,

01:50:01.995 --> 01:50:07.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well, then that's a victory for
the Clinton campaign, despite
the fact that, for people

01:50:07.234 --> 01:50:11.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who watched it for 90 minutes,
it didn't feel -- it felt very
different from that.

01:50:11.638 --> 01:50:17.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that is going to really be a
true test about whether this
mattered, or whether Mike

01:50:17.177 --> 01:50:22.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pence and the Trump campaign can
make the case that Pence was the
measured one, Kaine

01:50:22.182 --> 01:50:25.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was the one that was sort of
spiraling out of control, Pence
was the one who can handle

01:50:25.953 --> 01:50:28.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
being under fire.

01:50:28.255 --> 01:50:31.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael Gerson,
how do you see this question of
how much -- do you see

01:50:31.258 --> 01:50:36.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the campaign taking a different
course as a result of how well
either Tim Kaine or Mike

01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:39.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Pence did tonight?

01:50:39.399 --> 01:50:44.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: Well, as I said
earlier, Republicans were
looking for some kind of morale
boost.

01:50:44.071 --> 01:50:46.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they may have
gotten some tonight.

01:50:46.874 --> 01:50:56.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, Mike Pence was calm. He
made the best defense that he
could pushed back hard in

01:50:56.016 --> 01:51:01.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
certain areas. And I -- so,
Republicans are going to take
some hope from that, given the

01:51:01.522 --> 01:51:07.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
week, the horrible week that
they have had, OK, miserable
week they have had.

01:51:07.461 --> 01:51:11.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans -- Democrats will
take some hope from the fact
that this case was prosecuted

01:51:11.765 --> 01:51:16.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
again and again and again, and
there wasn't an adequate
response on a number of issues.

01:51:16.670 --> 01:51:20.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I'm not sure how much
difference that makes. But I
think both parties will probably

01:51:20.874 --> 01:51:23.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
find some way to praise
this performance.

01:51:23.610 --> 01:51:25.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Republicans
take some heart, Mark?

01:51:25.045 --> 01:51:27.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Sure.

01:51:27.147 --> 01:51:31.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Democrats are
pleased that Tim Kaine
prosecuted the case?

01:51:31.385 --> 01:51:38.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Republicans will
say that Mike Pence, and
legitimately so, was
unflappable,

01:51:38.659 --> 01:51:43.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he in no way -- they
started -- used the similar
strategy that Hillary Clinton

01:51:43.096 --> 01:51:48.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did last week to get under his
skin. They didn't get under Mike
Pence's skin.

01:51:48.802 --> 01:51:54.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the problem is that some
Republican will say, gee, if
only the ticket were reversed.

01:51:54.708 --> 01:52:00.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that will not sit well with
the top of the ticket. If that
is said anywhere, and

01:52:00.814 --> 01:52:09.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attributed to any Republican,
that, gee, Pence did much better
job than Trump, it will not

01:52:09.222 --> 01:52:12.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
please the presidential nominee
on the Republican side.

01:52:12.826 --> 01:52:15.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And, of course...

01:52:15.128 --> 01:52:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Just the only
other thing was, there was a
little hyperbole, I thought, on

01:52:19.733 --> 01:52:28.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the part of Kaine. He was a
little bit too fawning,
appreciative of Hillary Clinton.

01:52:28.809 --> 01:52:34.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, there was sort of a
portrait of Hillary Clinton that
he gave, as the appreciative

01:52:34.881 --> 01:52:39.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
running mate, that I thought was
excessive at times, it seemed.

01:52:39.052 --> 01:52:42.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: And perhaps
defending the status quo on the
economy is not necessarily

01:52:42.856 --> 01:52:45.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the best strategy.

01:52:45.158 --> 01:52:49.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There could have been more
empathy with the concerns that a
significant portion of the

01:52:49.129 --> 01:52:53.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
American public felt. It sounded
like a defense of Barack Obama
sometimes, not just a defense

01:52:53.567 --> 01:52:57.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Hillary Clinton. And that's
really not the purpose here.

01:52:57.004 --> 01:52:59.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it's
interesting, Mark. You say he
was too effusive in his praise

01:52:59.039 --> 01:53:00.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Hillary Clinton.

01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:02.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

01:53:02.442 --> 01:53:03.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mike Pence was
sitting there saying: I'm very
proud to serve with Donald

01:53:03.410 --> 01:53:04.778 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

01:53:04.778 --> 01:53:06.113 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.

01:53:06.113 --> 01:53:06.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He ticked
off all the reasons why.

01:53:06.613 --> 01:53:09.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

01:53:09.049 --> 01:53:09.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm just
wondering how you strike a
balance, and you are not that
excited

01:53:09.816 --> 01:53:12.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about your running mate.

01:53:12.085 --> 01:53:16.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I just -- I felt
that there was a canned -- it
was almost like Clinton

01:53:16.490 --> 01:53:23.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people had prepared Tim Kaine,
and that these are the points
you want to make about how

01:53:23.296 --> 01:53:26.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wonderful the nominee is.

01:53:26.199 --> 01:53:33.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I felt that early. And, as I
say, when he got his footing, I
just thought there was

01:53:33.173 --> 01:53:37.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no question, over the last
two-thirds of the debate, who
was the alpha male in the room,

01:53:37.978 --> 01:53:40.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to put it bluntly.

01:53:40.380 --> 01:53:45.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, he was dominant. And
Mike Pence, who was cool and
calm, was reacting and playing

01:53:45.752 --> 01:53:48.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
defense. And you can't
score on defense in these.

01:53:48.855 --> 01:53:52.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sometimes, Amy --
only got a couple of minutes
left -- but people spend

01:53:52.059 --> 01:53:55.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time after these debates saying,
well, were they targeting their
base or were they trying

01:53:55.495 --> 01:53:56.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to expand the base?

01:53:56.730 --> 01:53:58.031 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Right. Right.

01:53:58.031 --> 01:53:59.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How
did you see that?

01:53:59.733 --> 01:54:02.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: I think vice
presidential debates are always
base-organize debates.

01:54:02.335 --> 01:54:07.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First of all, those are the
people who are watching these
debates. They're not as -- they

01:54:07.474 --> 01:54:12.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't bring in as many new
voters or new viewers. So,
that's what this was about. And
I agree

01:54:12.245 --> 01:54:14.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
completely with Michael that it
is about reassuring and
energizing the people that you
need to

01:54:14.748 --> 01:54:17.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
get to turn out to vote.

01:54:17.851 --> 01:54:24.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But all of this, of course, will
be soon forgotten, and -- when
we come back here on Sunday, and

01:54:24.424 --> 01:54:30.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the two main contenders shape up
against each other. And so this
is probably very short-lived

01:54:30.263 --> 01:54:33.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bounce, whatever it is,
for either campaign.

01:54:33.433 --> 01:54:36.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, quick
takeaway, Michael?

01:54:36.903 --> 01:54:39.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: One thing that
was different from the
presidential debate was the talk

01:54:39.473 --> 01:54:40.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about faith and the way
it influenced policy.

01:54:40.907 --> 01:54:43.276 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:54:43.276 --> 01:54:47.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: And this showed
diversity of the Roman Catholic
Church. Lets you know

01:54:47.614 --> 01:54:53.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how broad this is. Went all the
way from a social justice
Catholicism that was very
pro-choice

01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:58.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in certain ways, all the way to
Pence's kind of evangelical
Catholicism that talked about

01:54:58.525 --> 01:55:00.961 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pro-life issues.

01:55:00.961 --> 01:55:04.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they both made their case.
And that -- but that was a
deepening of an argument.

01:55:04.998 --> 01:55:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Two men who
grew up in the Catholic faith.

01:55:06.666 --> 01:55:06.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Two men who
grew up -- that's right.

01:55:06.967 --> 01:55:08.468 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:55:08.468 --> 01:55:08.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very
quick final...

01:55:08.969 --> 01:55:10.237 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:55:10.237 --> 01:55:11.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.

01:55:11.872 --> 01:55:12.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The point is that these were
supposed to be the nice guys.

01:55:12.272 --> 01:55:13.440 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes. That's right.

01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:15.609 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:55:15.609 --> 01:55:19.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It was pretty much
of a Pier 6 brawl for two nice
guys.

01:55:19.412 --> 01:55:21.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Who were brought
up as -- I think they were both
altar boys. Is that right

01:55:21.748 --> 01:55:23.550 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
?

01:55:23.550 --> 01:55:24.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Was Mike
Pence an altar boy?

01:55:24.184 --> 01:55:24.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm not sure.

01:55:24.918 --> 01:55:27.020 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:55:27.020 --> 01:55:26.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: He went away to
college and lost his faith
and...

01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:28.555 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:55:28.555 --> 01:55:29.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: I don't
know what happened.

01:55:29.790 --> 01:55:31.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields,
Michael Gerson, and Amy Walter.

01:55:31.958 --> 01:55:35.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that wraps up our coverage
of this vice presidential
debate, but there's whole lot
