JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally,
remembering filmmaker
George Romero, the master
of the zombie movie

00:07.433 --> 00:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a man whose influence
in the business went further
than many moviegoers realize.

00:11.800 --> 00:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our look.

00:13.833 --> 00:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: Medical examination of
victims bodies show conclusively
that the killers are eating

00:18.766 --> 00:20.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the flesh of the
people they kill.

00:20.833 --> 00:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: With a $100,000
in 1968, George Romero brought
the undead back to life in

00:27.333 --> 00:29.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
American culture.

00:29.433 --> 00:33.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
His "Night of the Living
Dead" became a cult
classic, and launched a
modern zombie industry

00:35.700 --> 00:39.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of soulless ghouls with
a taste for human flesh
popping up everywhere today.

00:41.066 --> 00:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For Romero, his films were
about more than just blood
and graphic violence.

00:43.433 --> 00:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEORGE ROMERO, Director:
This series of films have
been sort of my platform.

00:47.133 --> 00:50.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's ripe for metaphor.

00:50.500 --> 00:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the zombies, to me, have
always represented the people
that are just unwilling to stand

00:59.033 --> 01:00.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

01:00.566 --> 01:03.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, you know, there are a
lot of living dead in America.

01:03.166 --> 01:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Night of the
Living Dead," starring an
African-American actor, was seen

01:10.066 --> 01:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as a kind of social
commentary on racism and the
paranoid mood of its time.

01:15.466 --> 01:18.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A decade later, Romero's
first sequel, "Dawn of
the Dead," played on
the excesses of American

01:20.266 --> 01:22.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
consumerism.

01:22.233 --> 01:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Roger Ebert dubbed it one of
the best horror films ever
made, savagely merciless in its

01:27.300 --> 01:30.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
satiric view.

01:30.300 --> 01:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Romero followed up with many
other films, including four
more in the "Dead" series,

01:35.100 --> 01:37.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with varying degrees
of box office success.

01:37.566 --> 01:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the zombie world he
unleashed took on a massive
multibillion-dollar life of its

01:44.633 --> 01:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
own in blockbuster films like
"World War Z," video games,
and AMC's "The Walking Dead."

01:50.433 --> 01:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That, in turn, led Romero
to sour a bit on the genre
he helped popularize.

01:56.233 --> 01:58.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He spoke on NPR in 2014.

01:58.366 --> 02:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEORGE ROMERO: It's, all of
a sudden, you can't make a
little zombie film anymore.

02:02.033 --> 02:04.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Has to be special
effects and big budget.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I'm not -- I'm just
not interested in that.

02:06.800 --> 02:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Later in life,
he shifted to different media,
including teaming up with

02:10.900 --> 02:13.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Marvel to publish a
comic book series.

02:13.900 --> 02:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
George Romero died Sunday
in Toronto from lung cancer.

02:17.600 --> 02:22.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He was 77 years old.

02:22.133 --> 02:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for more on George Romero
and his impact, I'm joined by
Justin Chang, film critic for

02:26.900 --> 02:28.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The Los Angeles Times.

02:28.166 --> 02:30.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you, Justin.

02:30.066 --> 02:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Zombies, who would have thought?

02:32.500 --> 02:35.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What explains the impact
of those early films?

02:35.433 --> 02:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUSTIN CHANG, The Los Angeles
Times: Well, I think when you
have a film like "Night of

02:39.133 --> 02:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Living Dead," which is, I
think, one of the great debut
films that any director in

02:46.166 --> 02:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or outside the horror genre
has ever given us, you have to
look at the context, you know,

02:51.800 --> 02:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vietnam, Martin Luther
King Jr.'s assassination,
the recent assassinations
of the Kennedy brothers.

02:55.900 --> 02:58.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was a time of, obviously,
great social unrest.

02:58.066 --> 03:03.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And George Romero found,
unwittingly or not, a perfect
metaphor for that unrest.

03:05.066 --> 03:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it was about the
primitiveness of the filmmaking,
the very raw technique.

03:12.500 --> 03:15.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was shot on a $114,000
budget, which is about
$800,000 today, still
a very small budget.

03:17.133 --> 03:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he achieved this kind
of -- a film that was almost
like a documentary nightmare.

03:24.066 --> 03:27.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it really captured,
I think, a sense of rage
and of pointlessness,
a kind of senseless,

03:29.666 --> 03:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
arbitrary killing that
was really unsettling for
audiences at the time,
and is still enormously

03:34.633 --> 03:36.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
unsettling today.

03:36.633 --> 03:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: His films, of
course, largely done on the
cheap, but somehow a cult thing

03:40.300 --> 03:43.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
grew into a very large
cultural phenomenon.

03:43.833 --> 03:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wasn't so crazy -- as
we heard, he wasn't so
crazy about what followed?

03:48.200 --> 03:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUSTIN CHANG: Absolutely.

03:50.133 --> 03:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, we live in a culture
where zombies are proliferating
on screens, whether it's

03:56.566 --> 03:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"World War Z" or "The Walking
Dead," which is still hugely
popular, or the remake of

04:01.966 --> 04:05.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Dawn of the Dead" about 13
years ago, and terrific spoofs
like "Shaun of the Dead,"

04:05.700 --> 04:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which I think is one of the
few that George Romero has
professed to actually liking.

04:09.333 --> 04:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, in a way, he was, I think,
understandably disenchanted with
the way that Hollywood really

04:18.166 --> 04:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mainstreamed the zombie film and
the zombie TV show, and in some
ways took out that edginess,

04:25.600 --> 04:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that political subtext that he
was so good at putting in there.

04:29.433 --> 04:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think he especially
resented things like
"The Walking Dead,"
because it made it

04:33.733 --> 04:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very difficult for him to get
his own zombie movies financed
on an independent level.

04:40.700 --> 04:44.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he was a consummate
independent filmmaker,
and something of a
Hollywood outsider and

04:46.066 --> 04:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
skeptic, I think, all his
career, which makes his success
all the more remarkable.

04:48.900 --> 04:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For a lot of
people, this stuff goes way too
far, right, the graphic violence

04:55.966 --> 04:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's part of our society
and that's really part of
our entertainment culture.

05:00.833 --> 05:02.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Did he help create that,
for better or for worse?

05:02.900 --> 05:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUSTIN CHANG: I don't think
it's entirely fair to lay that
as George Romero's doorstep.

05:06.800 --> 05:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I say that as someone who's
on the more squeamish side of
the spectrum as far as horror

05:12.533 --> 05:14.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
movie viewers goes.

05:14.566 --> 05:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think you have to look
at his films, a film like
"Dawn of the Dead," which is,

05:17.333 --> 05:20.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think, as great a
masterpiece as "Night
of the Living Dead" is.

05:20.066 --> 05:22.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is always something more
going on beneath the violence.

05:22.566 --> 05:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you're just there
for the splatter and the
viscera, you will get that.

05:26.600 --> 05:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he gives you -- he's
always asking you to look a
little closer, see what's going

05:30.966 --> 05:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on, see who these zombies
represent, see who the
real monsters are in a way.

05:34.666 --> 05:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I don't think
it's entirely fair to
say that he's responsible
for the fetishization

05:40.800 --> 05:42.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and exploitation of
violence in our culture.

05:42.866 --> 05:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's using it -- I mean, he's
exploiting violence in his own
way, to very brilliant and very

05:47.066 --> 05:49.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
provocative ends.

05:49.100 --> 05:52.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Just briefly, I
do want to mention the passing
of another movie figure,

05:52.033 --> 05:54.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the actor Martin Landau.

05:54.566 --> 05:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was known early on, on
television, in "Mission:
Impossible," later in
films, including "Ed

06:00.166 --> 06:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Wood," for which he won an
Oscar for best supporting actor.

06:02.200 --> 06:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's take a look at a short
scene from Woody Allen's 1989
film "Crimes and Misdemeanors."

06:06.800 --> 06:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARTIN LANDAU, Actor: This
is what you plan on doing.

06:09.166 --> 06:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're going to hold on
to me with threats, right,
stupid threats and slander?

06:14.000 --> 06:15.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is your idea
of love, right?

06:15.233 --> 06:16.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ACTRESS: I will
not be tossed out.

06:16.633 --> 06:18.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I want to speak to Miriam.

06:18.066 --> 06:19.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARTIN LANDAU: Think.

06:19.733 --> 06:23.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For Christ's sake, think
what the hell you are
doing to me, will you?

06:23.366 --> 06:24.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Please.

06:24.866 --> 06:26.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Justin Chang, a
brief thought on Martin Landau?

06:26.400 --> 06:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUSTIN CHANG: Martin Landau
was such a wonderful actor.

06:29.833 --> 06:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that scene you play sort of,
I think, captures his elegance
and gravitas, his ability

06:35.933 --> 06:39.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to play a silken villain
that we feel for.

06:39.433 --> 06:44.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In that film, he's an adulterous
husband who contemplates
the murder of his lover.

06:46.333 --> 06:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's -- you know, I'm
reminded, too, of his great
performance many decades earlier

06:53.033 --> 06:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Alfred Hitchcock's "North
By Northwest," where he took
the role of a villain's number

06:56.100 --> 07:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two and made it something
really memorable and really
incisive out of that.

07:03.100 --> 07:06.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it's not that he could
only play villains, certainly
not, but he had, I think, a real

07:06.700 --> 07:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talent for playing morally
ambiguous characters,
and doing it superbly.

07:11.133 --> 07:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
Justin Chang of The Los Angeles
Times, thank you very much.

07:14.666 --> 07:16.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUSTIN CHANG: Thank you.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
we thank you, Jeff.

07:17.633 --> 07:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I was covering my eyes
until we got to Martin Landau.
