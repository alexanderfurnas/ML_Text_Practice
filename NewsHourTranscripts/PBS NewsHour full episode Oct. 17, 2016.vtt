back the key city of Mosul after
two years
under the terrorist's group
control.

00:19.353 --> 00:25.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: Donald Trump doubles down
on claims
of a rigged election, while
ongoing e-mail

00:25.726 --> 00:29.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leaks are a headache for the
Clinton campaign.

00:29.763 --> 00:35.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And U.S. health experts are
borrowing a practice
from Africa, using a system of
community health

00:35.969 --> 00:38.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
workers to help struggling
areas.

JESSICA GONZALEZ, Diabetes
Sufferer: With
your doctor, you don't really
want to say

00:41.141 --> 00:46.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what you eat, so I'm able to
tell her like,
really, if I'm not going well,
or, you know,

00:46.747 --> 00:48.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
if I sneaked and cheated.

00:48.215 --> 00:51.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I tell her the right things, and
she helps
me.

00:51.652 --> 00:55.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

(BREAK)

00:59.326 --> 01:11.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The battle for
the Iraqi city
of Mosul is on.

01:11.305 --> 01:16.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraqi forces and their allies
opened an offensive
today to wrest the city from
Islamic State

01:16.443 --> 01:18.145 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forces.

01:18.178 --> 01:22.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The operation is being backed by
American
airstrikes and U.S. ground
troops in support

01:22.783 --> 01:24.685 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
roles.

01:24.718 --> 01:28.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By this evening, both Iraqi and
U.S. military
officials said the assault is
ahead of schedule.

01:28.956 --> 01:32.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will have a full report right
after the
news summary.

01:32.326 --> 01:37.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Government forces in Afghanistan
are reporting
progress against Taliban
fighters around a

01:37.597 --> 01:39.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
key city in the south.

01:39.333 --> 01:44.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say they have pushed back
insurgents
outside Lashkar Gah, the capital
of Helmand

01:44.705 --> 01:47.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Province, with the help of U.S.
airstrikes.

01:47.641 --> 01:52.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One Afghan commander estimated
that hundreds
of Taliban fighters were killed
in the last

01:53.013 --> 01:55.215 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
24 hours alone.

01:55.248 --> 02:00.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the U.S. presidential
campaign, Republican
Donald Trump hammered away again
today at

02:00.687 --> 02:04.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his claim that the election is
being rigged
against him.

02:04.091 --> 02:09.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the ongoing furor over
Hillary Clinton's
e-mails took a new turn.

02:09.696 --> 02:11.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins has our report.

02:11.798 --> 02:16.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Hillary Clinton
was off the
campaign trail today, but her
words from the

02:16.403 --> 02:18.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
past were back in the news.

02:18.338 --> 02:24.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I didn't e-mail any classified
material to

02:24.478 --> 02:25.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
anyone on my e-mail.

02:26.013 --> 02:28.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That was March
of last year.

02:28.281 --> 02:31.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton also said she never
received classified
e-mail.

02:31.618 --> 02:36.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But notes from the FBI's
investigation out
today indicate that, last year,
a senior State

02:36.757 --> 02:42.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Department official asked to
declassify one
e-mail that went to Clinton's
private server.

02:42.496 --> 02:47.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Separately, the official also
offered to let
the FBI put more agents
overseas.

02:47.501 --> 02:53.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The FBI refused to reclassify
the e-mail,
but cited someone in its records
division

02:53.407 --> 02:59.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as saying that that person
believed the State
Department had an agenda, which
involves minimizing

02:59.446 --> 03:05.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the classified nature of the
Clinton e-mails
in order to protect State
interests and those

03:05.419 --> 03:07.120 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Clinton.

03:07.154 --> 03:10.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The State Department said today
it was simply
trying to understand the
classification.

03:10.424 --> 03:15.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK TONER, State Department
Spokesman: So
the allegation of any kind of
quid pro quo

03:15.128 --> 03:20.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is inaccurate and doesn't align
with the facts.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Late today, the
FBI also
said there was no quid pro quo
involved.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.272 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Meanwhile:

03:25.305 --> 03:27.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
This is a rigged system, folks.

03:27.808 --> 03:31.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Donald Trump's
repeated words
this weekend questioning the
integrity of

03:31.845 --> 03:35.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the election reached a new level
on Twitter
this morning.

03:35.182 --> 03:40.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wrote: "Of course there is
large scale
voter fraud happening on and
before election

03:40.220 --> 03:41.321 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
day.

03:41.354 --> 03:44.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why do Republican leaders deny
what is going
on?"

03:44.124 --> 03:48.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Sunday, Trump's V.P. nominee,
Mike Pence,
seemed to be on a different
page.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK TODD, Moderator, "Meet The
Press": Will
you accept the results of the
election?

03:50.630 --> 03:52.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

03:52.499 --> 03:54.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE PENCE (R-IN), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
We will absolutely accept the
results of the

03:54.901 --> 03:56.770 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

03:56.803 --> 03:59.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But today near
Cincinnati,
Pence was pushing the idea of
election problems.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.842 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

04:01.875 --> 04:07.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: Voter fraud cannot
be tolerated
by anyone in this nation,
because it disenfranchises

04:07.848 --> 04:13.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans, independents,
Democrats, conservatives
and liberals in America.

04:13.086 --> 04:19.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In Washington,
the Democratic
V.P. nominee, Tim Kaine, seized
on the Trump

04:19.192 --> 04:21.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
criticism, while making a stop
at his current
workplace, Capitol Hill.

04:21.895 --> 04:23.697 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TIM KAINE (D-VA), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
When you criticize the system,
who are you

04:25.165 --> 04:27.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
criticizing?

04:27.100 --> 04:30.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're criticizing American
voters, and you're
criticizing local elected
officials in cities

04:30.837 --> 04:35.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and counties and states who have
been running
elections, you know, for decades
and decades

04:35.375 --> 04:37.110 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and decades.

04:37.144 --> 04:41.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The criticism is completely
unjustified, and
it's a guy who's whining because
he's a big

04:41.348 --> 04:44.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bully who's getting beaten, and
now he's starting
to whine.

04:44.117 --> 04:48.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And amid the
increasing tension,
investigators are looking into
pre-election

04:49.022 --> 04:50.857 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
violence.

04:50.891 --> 04:54.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over the weekend, someone threw
a firebomb
through the window of a local
Republican office

04:54.694 --> 04:55.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in North Carolina.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.497 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No one was hurt.

04:57.531 --> 05:00.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officials from both parties have
disavowed
the attack.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

05:02.435 --> 05:07.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will look more
closely at
Donald Trump's warning about a
rigged contest

05:07.707 --> 05:10.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and its implications after the
news summary.

05:10.810 --> 05:17.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Syria, the ravaged city of
Aleppo may get
a brief respite this week from
Russian airstrikes

05:17.117 --> 05:19.419 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and Syrian ground assaults.

05:19.452 --> 05:24.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia's military announced
today a humanitarian
pause for eight hours on
Thursday.

05:24.824 --> 05:29.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the U.S. State Department
dismissed the
idea as too little, too late.

05:29.729 --> 05:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, Russian and Syrian
airstrikes continued
today, killing dozens.

05:33.934 --> 05:40.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The attacks came as European
Union leaders
met in Luxembourg and condemned
Russia's air

05:40.140 --> 05:41.875 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

05:41.908 --> 05:42.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FEDERICA MOGHERINI, Foreign
Policy Chief,
European Union: Priority number
one now is

05:42.943 --> 05:45.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to save Aleppo, to save the
people of Aleppo.

05:45.512 --> 05:50.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is why our strong call
is on Russia
and on the Syrian regime to stop
the bombing

05:50.850 --> 06:00.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Aleppo and to continue talks
with the U.S.
and other key players on the
ground to avoid

06:00.360 --> 06:03.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the catastrophe, first of all,
the humanitarian
catastrophe in the city.

06:03.196 --> 06:08.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The E.U. foreign
ministers
stopped short of agreeing to
impose sanctions

06:08.168 --> 06:10.103 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
against Moscow.

06:10.136 --> 06:15.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hard-liners in Iran released

an Iranian-American businessman

held there for a year.

06:17.143 --> 06:23.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Siamak Namazi was arrested in
2015 just days
after the Iran nuclear deal was
adopted.

06:23.917 --> 06:26.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's no word on the charges
against him.

06:26.486 --> 06:32.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Namazi's father was arrested
later, after
going to Iran to try to win his
son's release.

06:32.359 --> 06:37.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, Vice
President Joe Biden
hoped that the cancer moonshot
initiative

06:37.497 --> 06:41.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he leads is going to double the
pace of research.

06:48.108 --> 06:52.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN, Vice President of
the United
States: There is a need for a
greater sense

06:52.345 --> 07:00.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of urgency, because there is --
there are
available answers now to some
cancers, and

07:00.587 --> 07:04.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there is enormous opportunity in
sharing data.

07:04.124 --> 07:09.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am confident, absolutely
confident that
we will be able to accomplish in
the next

07:09.596 --> 07:12.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
five years what otherwise would
have taken
us 10 years.

07:12.232 --> 07:17.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The $1 billion
cancer moonshot
began eight months ago.

07:17.070 --> 07:21.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It aims for collaboration across

The nation's high school

According to federal data

their diplomas

07:31.951 --> 07:34.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on time in the past school year.

07:34.654 --> 07:39.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rates improved among all racial
and ethnic
groups, despite the fact that
the test scores

07:39.626 --> 07:42.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in math and reading have been
dropping.

07:42.962 --> 07:48.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And stocks fell on Wall Street
today, as declining
oil prices dragged down energy
shares.

07:48.635 --> 07:54.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the fight
for the last ISIS stronghold in
Iraq; rhetoric

08:05.051 --> 08:16.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inciting worries of a rigged
election; the
rise of Europe's far right; and
much more.

08:16.896 --> 08:27.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now: Mosul and the start of
operations to
retake Iraq's second largest
city from the

Islamic State group.

08:28.908 --> 08:33.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown will speak with a
former U.S.
ambassador to Iraq in a moment,
but, first,

08:33.446 --> 08:37.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret
Warner reports on today's
events.

08:37.784 --> 08:43.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Gunfire sounded
all day,
across the outskirts of Mosul.

08:43.690 --> 08:50.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Columns of smoke billowed from
artillery fire
and U.S. coalition airstrikes
and from oil

08:50.296 --> 08:54.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ignited by ISIS fighters to
blind attacking
planes.

08:54.801 --> 09:00.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Long anti-ISIS convoys advanced,
and, by late
in the day, the overall Iraqi
commander issued

09:00.206 --> 09:01.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a confident assessment.

09:01.508 --> 09:02.475 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

09:02.509 --> 09:04.544 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

09:04.577 --> 09:06.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TALIB SHAGHATI, Iraqi Commander
(through translator):
The operations are going very
well and according

09:06.579 --> 09:08.314 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to plan.

09:08.348 --> 09:11.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sometimes, we are ahead of the
plan because
of the high morale and the
fighters' strong

09:11.251 --> 09:15.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will to fight the Islamic State
group and
liberate Mosul, which has been
under ISIS

09:15.455 --> 09:17.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rule for the past two years.

09:17.323 --> 09:21.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: For the Iraqi
army, the campaign
for Mosul is by far its largest
operation

09:21.828 --> 09:23.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
yet against the Islamic State.

09:23.963 --> 09:29.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. intelligence estimates that
up to 4,500
ISIS fighters are in the city.

09:29.836 --> 09:31.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Other estimates run to 8,000.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.038 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.873 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN TOWNSEND, U.S. Army:
This may prove
to be a long and tough battle,
but the Iraqis

09:35.341 --> 09:37.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have prepared for it, and we
will stand by
them.

09:38.011 --> 09:43.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Complicating
matters, balancing
the various factions taking part
in the fight.

09:43.550 --> 09:48.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kurdish forces began today by
seizing several
towns on the eastern fringes of
Mosul.

09:48.188 --> 09:54.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They will be part of a
five-pronged assault,
including Iraqi army brigades,
plus Sunni

09:54.227 --> 09:56.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tribal fighters and police.

09:56.663 --> 10:02.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The ultimate drive into Mosul
will likely
be made by Iraqi special forces.

10:02.268 --> 10:07.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Providing air cover and
assisting on the ground
is the American military,
including special

10:07.073 --> 10:09.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
operations troops.

10:09.175 --> 10:14.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shiite militias backed by Iran
are also taking
part, but they have been accused
of atrocities

10:14.380 --> 10:19.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against Sunnis in other cities
and may be
kept out of Mosul proper.

10:19.085 --> 10:24.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Turkey's president,
Recep Tayyip
Erdogan, complained of being
left out of the

10:24.557 --> 10:26.025 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mosul offensive.

10:26.059 --> 10:28.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, Turkish
President (through
translator): Look now.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The operation in Mosul has
started.

10:29.863 --> 10:31.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The operation continues.

10:31.397 --> 10:32.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And what do they say?

10:32.699 --> 10:34.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Turkey shouldn't enter Mosul.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How can I do that?

10:35.969 --> 10:39.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I share 350 kilometers of border
with Iraq,
and I am under threat on that
border.

10:39.739 --> 10:44.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Erdogan said
again he will
keep some 3,000 Turkish-trained
fighters in

10:44.277 --> 10:47.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
northernmost Iraq, despite
objections from
Baghdad.

10:47.714 --> 10:52.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the fighting starts in
earnest, concerns
are also rising over the more
than one million

10:52.919 --> 10:55.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
civilians still in the city.

10:55.355 --> 11:00.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N. and other organizations
say they're
preparing for up to 200,000
refugees.

11:00.627 --> 11:04.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

11:04.063 --> 11:09.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And now
perspectives of James
Jeffrey, the U.S. ambassador to
Iraq from

11:09.569 --> 11:15.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2010 to 2012, and currently
fellow at the
Washington Institute, a think
tank and policy

11:16.009 --> 11:17.076 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
analysis group.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.511 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome to you.

11:18.545 --> 11:20.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES JEFFREY, Former U.S.
Ambassador to Iraq:
Thank you, Jeffrey.

11:20.113 --> 11:22.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Remind us first
why this city
and its capture is so important.

11:22.549 --> 11:28.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES JEFFREY: As we just heard,
it's the
last citadel of ISIL in Iraq.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the second largest city in
the country.

11:30.823 --> 11:38.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the center of the Sunni
Arab third of
Iraq, if you will, its culture
in that country.

11:38.765 --> 11:45.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if it falls, then ISIS is
pushed back
to its headquarters deep in
Syria, in Raqqa,

11:45.872 --> 11:47.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and that could spell the end of
ISIS.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, that's a very, very
important development.

11:49.409 --> 11:54.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: When ISIS
originally took Mosul
and other cities, the Iraqi army
at that point

11:54.614 --> 11:55.848 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was collapsing.

11:55.882 --> 11:59.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is a sense now that it's
strong enough
to do this.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How difficult will it be?

12:01.254 --> 12:02.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How long do you think it might
take?

12:03.022 --> 12:06.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES JEFFREY: As we saw in the
news clip
from Margaret Warner, it's a
very eclectic

12:06.192 --> 12:10.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
force, but it numbers some
50,000 or 60,000
people on the ground, with a
tremendous amount

12:10.563 --> 12:16.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of American and other Western
artillery and
airpower supporting these
people, including,

12:16.769 --> 12:20.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the first time, advisory
units right up
in the front lines.

12:20.873 --> 12:26.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This will take weeks, like the
Fallujah battle
in 2004 also against ISIS's
predecessor, al-Qaida

12:26.679 --> 12:28.448 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in Iraq.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in the end, I think there
is only going
to be one outcome, and that will
be defeat

12:30.883 --> 12:32.652 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of ISIS.

12:32.685 --> 12:35.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There have also
been reports
inside the city of underground
resistance.

12:36.022 --> 12:40.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When ISIS first went into Mosul,
they were
welcomed by many in the city.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What happened in the interim?

12:42.228 --> 12:45.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES JEFFREY: Al-Qaida has
always had a presence
before it became ISIS in Mosul.

12:45.765 --> 12:49.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was a problem when I was
there in 2010
to 2012.

12:49.836 --> 12:54.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's no doubt that part
of the population
welcomed ISIS when it came in,
because it

12:54.207 --> 12:59.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
felt was being oppressed by the
Shia majority
and the troops sent up by the
Shia -- largely

12:59.145 --> 13:00.313 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Shia government.

13:00.346 --> 13:02.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But that changed over time.

13:02.181 --> 13:05.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As in every other city we have
seen that have
been liberated, the people,
regardless of

13:05.785 --> 13:09.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their ethnic and religious
background, welcome
the people who come in.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They can't stand living under
ISIS.

13:11.324 --> 13:16.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That problem,
though, of the
initial welcoming brings us what
might happen

13:16.062 --> 13:18.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the aftermath, right, of
retaking Mosul.

13:18.264 --> 13:19.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES JEFFREY: Exactly.

13:19.432 --> 13:21.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Because it raises
many other
questions.

13:21.167 --> 13:26.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES JEFFREY: Well, the first
one is the
humanitarian, refugee, and food
and relief

13:26.873 --> 13:28.508 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
supplies.

13:28.541 --> 13:32.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is under the control of the
U.N., the
Iraqi government and the Kurdish
regional

13:32.111 --> 13:35.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government, in coordination with
the Iraqi
government, all being watched
closely by the

13:35.381 --> 13:36.616 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
United States.

13:36.649 --> 13:37.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That will be messy.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.452 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It always is.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But these people, if there's one
thing, they
have had experience with some
eight million

13:41.688 --> 13:43.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
refugees in that region in the
last two years.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They will, in the end, be able
to do it.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But there are
fears, though,
about the humanitarian crisis,
right?

13:47.794 --> 13:49.095 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES JEFFREY: Oh, absolutely.

13:49.128 --> 13:50.897 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Absolutely.

13:50.930 --> 13:54.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, as I said, we will
get plenty
of stories about people in
inadequate tents,

13:54.834 --> 13:56.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
inadequate sewage and such.

13:56.903 --> 14:00.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, in the end, I think that
enough food,
supplies will come through.

14:00.373 --> 14:04.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bigger question is, who will
secure this
place, who will govern it, and
what's going

14:04.377 --> 14:07.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to happen to Iraq after the ISIS
threat is
gone?

14:07.280 --> 14:12.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Even including
who marches
into the city in the first
place, right, as

14:12.285 --> 14:16.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Margaret was talking about,
whether it's Iraqi
forces or militia forces.

14:16.222 --> 14:18.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES JEFFREY: Exactly.

14:18.057 --> 14:21.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the deal right now
is that the
Iraqi forces, spearheaded by the
counterterrorism

14:21.661 --> 14:25.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
force, which is very, very good,
and will
have a lot of American advisers
with them

14:25.198 --> 14:29.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and supporting them, will go in
and do the
heavy fighting inside the city.

14:29.302 --> 14:33.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then Sunni police who have been
trained from
the region itself will come in
to secure the

14:34.006 --> 14:35.908 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
city.

14:35.942 --> 14:40.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The trick will be to keep the
Peshmerga forces,
the Kurdish forces, away from
the center of

14:40.313 --> 14:44.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the city, but they have
basically agreed to
stop, as I understand it.

14:44.117 --> 14:49.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't know if the popular
mobilization
forces, these largely Shia
militias, some

14:49.322 --> 14:53.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of whom are under the thumb of
Iran, will
adhere to this deal, or whether
they will

14:53.526 --> 14:55.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
try to push in, as they have
before.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, that's what
I'm wondering.

14:56.195 --> 14:58.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How confident are you or are we?

14:58.264 --> 15:02.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because this is not the first
time that Mosul
has been recaptured, right?

15:02.335 --> 15:07.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, how confident can we be
that, this time,
the forces taking it will get it
right?

15:07.640 --> 15:13.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES JEFFREY: Well, some of
these Shia militias,
Ahl al-Haq, the Mahdi Army,
tried to kill

15:13.446 --> 15:17.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me and my people for years in
Iraq, so I'm
not too confident on anything
they promise,

15:17.850 --> 15:18.818 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be honest.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

15:20.119 --> 15:21.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES JEFFREY: But I will say,
they're not
the majority.

15:21.988 --> 15:27.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Iraqi government and most
Iraqis understand
that they have to bring back the
Sunni Arab

15:27.627 --> 15:30.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
20, 25 percent of the
population.

15:30.429 --> 15:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It won't work with these Shia
militias running
amok in these areas.

15:34.467 --> 15:39.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, briefly,
ISIS itself,
if it gets kicked out of Mosul,
what then?

15:39.972 --> 15:45.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES JEFFREY: It will fall back
on its capital,
Raqqa in Eastern Syria, but it's
a dusty little

15:45.678 --> 15:48.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
town compared to Mosul.

15:48.314 --> 15:53.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's being pressed by
Kurdish and Syrian
opposition forces right now from
the north,

15:53.519 --> 15:56.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
as well as American and
American-supported
forces.

15:56.088 --> 15:59.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I think that the end will be
near for ISIS.

15:59.058 --> 16:02.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we will face all of the
other problems
in the Middle East that ISIS has
covered up

16:02.461 --> 16:03.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over the last two years.

16:03.963 --> 16:12.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
Ambassador James
Jeffrey, thank you very much.

16:12.338 --> 16:15.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES JEFFREY: Thank you.

16:15.441 --> 16:18.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back to this
country now.

16:18.411 --> 16:23.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we heard earlier, Donald
Trump continues
to claim that the presidential
election process

16:23.583 --> 16:25.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is rigged against him.

16:25.451 --> 16:28.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That claim seems to be
resonating with some
voters.

16:28.788 --> 16:33.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just one-third of Republicans
say they have
a great deal of confidence that
their votes

16:33.793 --> 16:36.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will be counted fairly this
election.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's according to a recent
Associated Press
poll.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more on all this, we are
joined by Richard
Hasen.

16:41.767 --> 16:45.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's professor of law at the
University of
California, Irvine.

16:45.538 --> 16:48.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's author of the Election Law
Blog.

16:48.941 --> 16:51.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Al Cardenas is a Republican
strategist.

16:51.777 --> 16:56.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He served as chairman of the
Republican Party
of Florida during the
presidential recount

16:56.616 --> 16:57.583 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 2000.

16:57.617 --> 17:00.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the "NewsHour."

17:00.419 --> 17:02.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Al Cardenas, to you first.

17:02.121 --> 17:04.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump is stepping up
these warnings.

17:04.223 --> 17:08.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He tweeted just a short time ago
-- and I'm
quoting -- he said: "Of course
there's large-scale

17:08.661 --> 17:12.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voter fraud happening on and
before Election
Day."

17:12.765 --> 17:16.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He asked, he said, "Why do
Republican leaders
deny what's going on?

17:16.636 --> 17:18.137 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's so naive."

17:18.170 --> 17:21.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there large-scale voter fraud
happening
in this country?

17:21.107 --> 17:24.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
AL CARDENAS, Republican
Strategist: Oh, my,
there isn't, hasn't been.

17:24.510 --> 17:29.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And our country has been
spending 200-plus
years to get it just right.

17:29.382 --> 17:32.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The checks and balances in the
electoral process
is amazing.

17:32.385 --> 17:35.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know our guest will know more
about it than
I do.

17:35.621 --> 17:41.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have state elected --
state officials
elected or appointed who are in
charge of

17:41.360 --> 17:43.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the overall state process.

17:43.396 --> 17:50.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And every local government,
counties or municipalities,
have supervisor elections who
are elected

17:50.036 --> 17:51.504 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or appointed.

17:51.537 --> 17:55.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And then you have local
canvassing boards
made up oftentimes of judges.

17:55.441 --> 17:57.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they're part of this whole
processes.

17:57.576 --> 18:02.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everyone who works in these
voting precincts
get trained, gets warned about
violating the

18:02.615 --> 18:07.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
laws, gets warned about the
criminal implications
of violating the law.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have a whole process in
America.

18:09.155 --> 18:15.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in 200-some years, we have
never, ever
had a national election that's
been impacted

18:15.261 --> 18:17.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by fraud, not even close.

18:17.363 --> 18:22.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even in Florida, where I served
as chairman
in the famous recount, it -- was
that an issue.

18:22.668 --> 18:25.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Richard Hasen,
what is your
take on this?

18:25.404 --> 18:29.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is the likelihood that this
process could
be rigged, as Donald Trump
charges?

18:29.108 --> 18:31.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICK HASEN, University of
California, Irvine:
If you're talking about rigging
the way that

18:31.644 --> 18:36.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump is talking about
rigging, I would
say the chances are basically
none.

18:36.282 --> 18:38.050 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's impossible.

18:38.084 --> 18:42.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's talking about people going
into the polling
place and voting five or 10 or
15 times.

18:42.922 --> 18:45.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said this would happen in
certain areas
of Pennsylvania.

18:45.725 --> 18:51.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seems to be, from what his
surrogate Rudy
Giuliani said, in minority
areas, that Democrats

18:51.764 --> 18:54.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are going to steal the votes by
impersonating
other people.

18:54.967 --> 18:58.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's just now how -- in the
rare times when
voter fraud occur, that's just
not how elections

18:58.971 --> 19:03.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are stolen in this country, and
not on the
kind of scale that could affect
a presidential

19:03.109 --> 19:08.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election, which would the
cooperation of tens
of thousands of people to try to
commit voter

19:08.581 --> 19:13.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
fraud under the noses of
election officials
and party officials who are
watching the whole

19:13.619 --> 19:15.454 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
process.

19:15.488 --> 19:18.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Richard
Hasen, you say
-- I hear you saying it's
possible to do this

19:18.591 --> 19:20.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on a small scale.

19:20.526 --> 19:22.228 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is that right?

19:22.261 --> 19:24.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD HASEN: Well, the kind of
fraud that
we do occasionally see in this
country is

19:24.864 --> 19:26.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
absentee ballot fraud.

19:26.699 --> 19:30.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That occurs because voting takes
place outside
the presence of election
officials.

19:31.003 --> 19:35.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Usually, it involves buying
votes or stealing
ballots out of people's
mailboxes, and then

19:35.641 --> 19:38.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
voting them in a particular way.

19:38.044 --> 19:42.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we haven't seen that on the
kind of scale
that could affect a presidential
election.

19:42.615 --> 19:45.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's not the kind of fraud
Donald Trump
has been talking about.

19:45.317 --> 19:49.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was talking about the lack of
voter I.D.,
strict voter I.D. law in
Pennsylvania and

19:50.022 --> 19:53.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that would allow someone to go
into the polling
place, and he literally said,
vote five or

19:53.526 --> 19:54.994 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
10 or 15 times.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.762 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That just doesn't happen.

19:56.796 --> 20:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For a study I did, I looked from
the 1980s
on to find a single election
anywhere in the

20:01.367 --> 20:05.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States where it could
have been called
into question because of that
kind of fraud,

20:05.504 --> 20:07.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I can't find a single
instance anywhere
in the country.

20:07.907 --> 20:11.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That kind of fraud would be a
stupid way to
steal the election, and it just
doesn't happen.

20:11.343 --> 20:14.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Al Cardenas, what
makes you
so confident that this couldn't
happen?

20:14.847 --> 20:16.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AL CARDENAS: Well, I lived it in
2000.

20:16.682 --> 20:19.118 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was party chairman in Florida.

20:19.151 --> 20:24.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had over 250 lawyers involved
and volunteering
in the state.

20:24.190 --> 20:26.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We had over 40 lawsuits.

20:26.492 --> 20:28.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We had election supervisors.

20:28.494 --> 20:34.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We had judges in every single
county recounting
every vote, tabulating,
retabulating the votes,

20:34.800 --> 20:37.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
determining whether votes were
fairly cast
or not.

20:37.403 --> 20:41.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were challenges being made
by lawyers
from both parties as to votes
that had not

20:41.974 --> 20:43.442 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been accepted.

20:43.476 --> 20:48.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The whole process took 37 days,
thousands
of people, thousands of hours.

20:48.514 --> 20:54.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And not once, not once did we
find intent
to defraud the process
electorally.

20:54.320 --> 20:57.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The press spent millions of
dollars after
that and went through its own
process.

20:57.990 --> 20:59.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes, they did.

20:59.125 --> 21:00.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AL CARDENAS: And we didn't find
fraud in the
process.

21:00.926 --> 21:06.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let me tell you, Judy, what
really bothers
me here is that America is a
beacon of light

21:06.866 --> 21:11.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for people all throughout the
world who want
their democracies to work our
way.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We are the idols of most
countries.

21:14.006 --> 21:18.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We are asked to oversee
elections in other
countries.

21:18.277 --> 21:21.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We in this country know that
transparency
works.

21:21.447 --> 21:28.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We appreciate and frankly adore
the right
to have the free, peaceful
transfer of power

21:28.954 --> 21:31.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from the president to at the
eventual winner.

21:31.857 --> 21:35.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We in America have always
celebrated the way
we have elections.

21:35.461 --> 21:42.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To tarnish it with unproven
facts, tarnish
it with accusations, to me, it
is just a shame.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It shouldn't be done.

21:44.403 --> 21:48.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Richard
Hasen, we also
hear Donald Trump saying to his
supporters

21:48.807 --> 21:53.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from time to time, you need to
go out and
you need to watch people voting
to make sure

21:53.612 --> 21:56.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
everything is being done on the
up and up,
words to that effect.

21:56.982 --> 22:02.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How would that work, for people
to take it
upon themselves to watch the
voting process?

22:02.288 --> 22:06.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD HASEN: Well, you know,
there are ways
to watch the voting process.

22:06.792 --> 22:08.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are ways to be election
observers.

22:08.627 --> 22:12.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in most places, you have
Democrats and
Republicans and nonpartisan
groups like the

22:12.231 --> 22:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
League of Women Voters watching
the vote count.

22:14.433 --> 22:16.068 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And those people are trained.

22:16.101 --> 22:17.069 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they know what to do.

22:17.102 --> 22:18.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they know not to interfere
with voters.

22:18.904 --> 22:23.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm very concerned that it looks
like Trump
is telling people to take
matters into their

22:23.809 --> 22:25.544 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
own hands.

22:25.578 --> 22:28.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said, after you vote in your
own place,
go to those other areas and see
what's going

22:28.214 --> 22:30.015 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on there.

22:30.049 --> 22:32.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm worried especially in states
where there
is an open-carry law and people
could be taking

22:32.585 --> 22:34.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
firearms to the polling place.

22:34.353 --> 22:37.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to have an election
where people are
not intimidated, where they feel
free to go

22:37.990 --> 22:40.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into the polling place and vote
their conscience.

22:40.793 --> 22:42.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think what he is doing is
dangerous.

22:42.595 --> 22:46.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's dangerous both on after
Election Day
and after Election Day, where,
if he claims

22:46.632 --> 22:51.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the vote count was rigged, who
knows if people
might take into their own hands
to be violent?

22:51.036 --> 22:54.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, we really -- we take our
peaceful
transitions for granted.

22:54.473 --> 22:56.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think we can't this time
around.

22:56.208 --> 22:59.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just quickly, Al
Cardenas,
how would that work?

22:59.511 --> 23:04.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, if voters in your home
state of Florida
decided they were going to watch
other polling

23:04.550 --> 23:06.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
places, what would that mean for
the election?

23:06.385 --> 23:11.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AL CARDENAS: Well, we have a
ballot integrity
initiative every election cycle,
where lawyers

23:11.490 --> 23:13.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and others volunteer.

23:13.359 --> 23:15.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They man these phones.

23:15.227 --> 23:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If there is a voter that feels
they have been
intimidated, harassed or worse,
they can call

23:20.766 --> 23:21.967 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a number.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
These lawyers are activated.

23:23.869 --> 23:28.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They go to local elected
officials, and the
matter is immediately
investigated.

23:28.474 --> 23:32.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can tell you, election after
election -- I
have been chairman of the party
for a long

23:32.511 --> 23:35.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
time -- these instances are
rare.

23:35.514 --> 23:41.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, if somebody is going to be
enticed to
go and intimidate voters, well,
that's a whole

23:41.253 --> 23:43.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
different story, as Richard just
mentioned.

23:43.422 --> 23:46.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That cannot be tolerated, and
law enforcement
needs to step in.

23:46.225 --> 23:51.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we're going
to be continuing,
of course, to follow this
between now and

23:51.297 --> 23:52.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Election Day three weeks from
tomorrow.

23:52.865 --> 23:55.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Al Cardenas, Richard Hasen, we
thank you both.

23:55.501 --> 23:57.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RICHARD HASEN: Thank you.

23:57.069 --> 23:58.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AL CARDENAS: Thank you.

23:58.837 --> 24:03.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Online, read how
the Clinton
campaign is ramping up spending
in a swing

24:03.275 --> 24:05.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
state media blitz.

24:05.110 --> 24:09.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can find that on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

24:09.915 --> 24:14.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And staying on politics, we are
joined now,
as we are every Monday, by Amy
Walter of The

24:14.520 --> 24:17.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cook Political Report and Tamara
Keith of
NPR.

24:17.790 --> 24:18.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Hello to both of you.

24:18.791 --> 24:19.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Hello.

24:19.958 --> 24:21.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Hello,
Judy.

24:21.727 --> 24:23.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, we just heard
from these
two gentlemen how hard, if not
impossible,

24:23.696 --> 24:25.964 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Amy, it is to rig an election.

24:25.998 --> 24:27.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Yes, it is.

24:27.433 --> 24:29.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why then is
Donald Trump continuing
to talk about it?

24:29.101 --> 24:30.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: It's pretty simple.

24:30.936 --> 24:34.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's about trying to suppress
voters from
turning out, and specifically
people who would

24:34.473 --> 24:37.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
support Hillary Clinton, from
turning out
and voting.

24:37.176 --> 24:41.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're talking about going
into certain
neighborhoods and literally
standing there

24:41.313 --> 24:46.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to watch people vote, that says
make sure
that those people don't come out
and vote.

24:46.385 --> 24:50.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, the danger of making saying
that the
election overall is rigged, vs.
they're trying

24:50.856 --> 24:55.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to steal it, is, if you say it's
rigged, then
you're also saying to your own
voters, well,

24:55.728 --> 24:59.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why bother even going, because
it's probably
going to turn out badly anyway?

24:59.098 --> 25:00.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what does
that mean, Tamara?

25:01.033 --> 25:07.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, and he
really has shifted
into more broadly not just
talking about something

25:07.106 --> 25:08.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could be happening in some
neighborhoods.

25:08.907 --> 25:13.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now he's saying the whole thing
is rigged,
that the media is rigging it,
that there is

25:13.846 --> 25:15.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
something bigger going on.

25:15.547 --> 25:21.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it does raise the question,
how are his
voters going to respond to that?

25:21.854 --> 25:23.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that is not clear.

25:23.956 --> 25:27.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, yes, we're in uncharted
territory.

25:27.626 --> 25:31.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it's
something that he
continues to write about, to
tweet about.

25:31.163 --> 25:37.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All right, I want to turn you,
Tam, to the
Clinton campaign today dealing
with more e-mails,

25:37.469 --> 25:41.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this time, as we heard in Lisa's
report a
little while ago, accusations
there was this

25:41.974 --> 25:49.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
discussion between the State
Department and
the FBI about whether to lower
the classification

25:49.248 --> 25:55.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of one e-mail among those that
were sent to
Hillary Clinton.

25:55.087 --> 25:56.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are we to make of this?

25:56.889 --> 25:59.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then there was discussion of
a quid pro
quo because, in that same
conversation, they

25:59.825 --> 26:03.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were taking about the FBI
getting more employees
overseas.

26:03.328 --> 26:04.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Right.

26:04.797 --> 26:08.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And this comes from FBI
investigative notes
that were released today.

26:08.700 --> 26:13.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's one of those things
where both the
FBI and the State Department say
there is

26:13.672 --> 26:20.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no quid pro quo, there was no
quid and there
was no quo, that what the State
Department

26:20.679 --> 26:25.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wanted, they didn't get, what
the FBI wanted,
they didn't get, and that, in
fact, it was

26:25.984 --> 26:32.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the FBI -- somebody at the FBI,
name redacted,
who asked an official at the
State Department

26:33.025 --> 26:34.760 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about something.

26:34.793 --> 26:39.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, it wasn't the State
Department that was
initiating the apparently
nonexistent quid

26:39.398 --> 26:41.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pro quo.

26:41.333 --> 26:45.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But here's what really matters,
is that Donald
Trump is now out with a video
where he's talking

26:45.537 --> 26:49.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
straight to camera saying
Hillary Clinton
did this thing that's shady.

26:49.174 --> 26:53.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, the Clinton campaign says
they didn't
know anything about it, but what
it is, is

26:53.245 --> 26:59.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
another day where there are
headlines that
say Hillary Clinton, e-mail,
FBI.

26:59.251 --> 27:05.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Amy, we're
two days, two
nights away from third and final
debate.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How damaging is it for her?

27:07.292 --> 27:11.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, her name is
not involved
in this at all, so that's one
helpful piece

27:11.196 --> 27:13.031 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
if you're Hillary Clinton.

27:13.065 --> 27:17.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it does -- to Tam's point,
it's not just
that it's the FBI and e-mail and
Hillary Clinton

27:17.936 --> 27:19.638 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the headline.

27:19.671 --> 27:22.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's also the sense that the
whole entire
process was a political process,
where the

27:22.908 --> 27:26.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State Department was looking out
specifically
for Hillary Clinton, trying to
protect her

27:26.545 --> 27:30.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and her e-mails from getting FBI
scrutiny.

27:30.616 --> 27:34.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This question, as well as some
of the other
questions that were raised in
some of her

27:34.987 --> 27:39.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speeches, may be part of the
debate, where
she's going to be asked
specifically to answer

27:39.825 --> 27:42.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of the stuff she said in
private, but
hasn't said in public.

27:42.728 --> 27:46.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought her answer at the her
answer at
the last debate, this was sort
of Lincolnesque,

27:46.865 --> 27:51.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I sort of imagine myself being
Abraham Lincoln,
fell really, really flat.

27:51.470 --> 27:56.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If that's her answer to more
pointed questions,
which I think she will get from
Chris Wallace,

27:56.975 --> 28:03.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the FOX News reporter who's
going to be the
moderator, that's not going to
work really

28:03.248 --> 28:05.017 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
well.

28:05.050 --> 28:06.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: So, the hilarious
thing about
that Lincoln remark that fell
kind of flat

28:06.752 --> 28:10.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the debate is, that's exactly
what the
speech transcript said, that she
was actually

28:10.556 --> 28:11.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
talking about the "Lincoln"
movie.

28:11.557 --> 28:12.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's right.

28:12.558 --> 28:14.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It was in the
speech.

28:14.393 --> 28:15.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: That some -- that
a Brazilian
bank paid her a lot of money to
give a speech

28:15.894 --> 28:17.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where she talked about the movie
"Lincoln."

28:17.729 --> 28:19.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: The movie "Lincoln,"
right.

28:19.531 --> 28:23.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is her camp -- is
she prepared,
Tam, based on your reporting, to
talk about

28:23.769 --> 28:27.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this some more, to give more of
an explanation
about what's going on?

28:27.773 --> 28:29.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: She is certainly
preparing.

28:29.608 --> 28:32.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's for sure, because she's
been off the
trail for several days.

28:32.110 --> 28:35.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's not going to be on the
trail today,
tomorrow.

28:35.647 --> 28:36.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And then there is the debate.

28:36.815 --> 28:38.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's go
back to Donald
Trump.

28:38.850 --> 28:43.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, we know, by now, there
have been, Amy,
nearly a dozen women who have
come forward

28:43.422 --> 28:49.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and said that Donald Trump was
either groping
or in some way sexually
aggressive toward

28:49.995 --> 28:51.697 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

28:51.730 --> 28:54.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, what's different is that
his wife,
Melania, has done an interview
with CNN.

28:54.533 --> 28:58.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're going to show you --
she was asked
by Anderson Cooper about that
"Access Hollywood"

28:58.904 --> 29:01.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tape in which we heard him
talking.

29:01.340 --> 29:03.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hear's what Melania Trump had to
say.

29:03.175 --> 29:07.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MELANIA TRUMP, Wife of Donald
Trump: I said
to my husband that, you know,
the language

29:07.112 --> 29:16.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is inappropriate, it's not
acceptable, and
I was surprised, because that is
not the man

29:16.288 --> 29:17.623 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that I know.

29:17.656 --> 29:23.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as you can see from the
tape, the cameras
were not on.

29:23.061 --> 29:25.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was only a mike.

29:25.731 --> 29:35.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I wonder if they even knew
that the mike
was on, because it was kind of
boy talk, and

29:35.941 --> 29:46.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he was led on, like egged on
from the host
to say dirty and bad stuff.

29:46.952 --> 29:51.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Amy, this is
10 days after
that tape came out.

29:51.456 --> 29:55.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's after we have seen Donald
Trump losing
support among women voters.

29:55.360 --> 29:56.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Does this make...

29:56.595 --> 29:58.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And now -- right,
they put his
wife out...

29:58.797 --> 30:00.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

30:00.298 --> 30:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: ... which she can
help to sort
of soften the edge on this.

30:02.334 --> 30:08.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But her answer and her -- the
way she is defending
her husband is not much
different from what

30:08.940 --> 30:11.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's saying, which is basically,
this was
locker room talk.

30:11.476 --> 30:16.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when you look at the polling
that has
been taking place since this
locker room talk

30:16.381 --> 30:17.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
came out, you're right.

30:17.883 --> 30:19.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He lost support in the polls.

30:19.251 --> 30:21.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's losing support among women.

30:21.119 --> 30:25.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're now hearing about -- when
we're looking
at the polls, we're talking now
about a historic

30:25.724 --> 30:27.693 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gender gap.

30:27.726 --> 30:31.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We may not have seen a gender
gap like this
in -- certainly in the last 30
or 40, 50 -- actually,

30:31.897 --> 30:33.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think it goes back 50 years.

30:33.932 --> 30:38.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the Washington Post
poll that came
out this weekend, when asked do
you think

30:38.370 --> 30:43.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that this issue that was raised
in the tape,
his treatment of women, is
important, is it

30:43.842 --> 30:47.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a legitimate issue, 55 percent
of voters said
this is a legitimate issue.

30:47.646 --> 30:52.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, writing it off to boys
talking, locker
room talk in the wake, not just
of the audio,

30:52.617 --> 30:56.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but the women who came forward,
I don't think
it's going to do much good.

30:56.054 --> 31:01.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Tam, the
Clinton camp
seems to be -- they're out now
talking about

31:01.193 --> 31:05.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how their chances have improved,
expanding
the battleground now.

31:05.397 --> 31:07.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: They're expanding
the map.

31:07.132 --> 31:10.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Bernie Sanders will be
campaigning in Arizona,
Arizona, tomorrow.

31:10.736 --> 31:16.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are running a week of ads
in Texas, very,
very red Texas.

31:17.008 --> 31:21.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Arizona, they're going to
spend about $2
million.

31:21.079 --> 31:24.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's basically a tossup now and
they think
it's a possible pickup.

31:24.382 --> 31:29.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's the added benefit of
making your
opponent have to compete in a
state where

31:29.688 --> 31:31.590 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he shouldn't have to compete.

31:31.623 --> 31:35.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He should be focused on the
battlegrounds
that he really needs to win and
where he is

31:35.327 --> 31:37.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
struggling, and now they are
expanding the
map.

31:37.829 --> 31:39.598 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly.

31:39.631 --> 31:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And I think that
what she really
wants to do is run up the score
to show that

31:41.500 --> 31:43.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
there is a mandate here.

31:43.568 --> 31:47.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem for that is, she may
get a lot
of votes, a lot of electoral
votes, more than

31:47.239 --> 31:52.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Barack Obama got, but she's
still going to
come into office with an overall
disapproval

31:52.711 --> 31:57.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rating that's higher than
anybody in recent
times has come into the
presidency.

31:57.649 --> 32:03.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you want more votes, but
it's not necessarily
going to change the way that
people see her,

32:03.155 --> 32:04.656 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not more positively, at least.

32:04.689 --> 32:07.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter,
Tamara Keith, thank
you both, Politics Monday.

32:07.959 --> 32:09.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

32:09.728 --> 32:12.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we want you
to tune in
this coming Wednesday at 9:00
p.m. Eastern

32:12.297 --> 32:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for our special live coverage of
that final
presidential debate.

32:15.734 --> 32:19.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in the meantime, you can
watch all the
presidential and vice
presidential debates

32:19.871 --> 32:21.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
dating back to 1960.

32:21.606 --> 32:24.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's at our new Web site,
watchthedebates.org.

32:24.075 --> 32:29.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LLOYD BENTSEN (D), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
Senator, you are no Jack
Kennedy.

32:29.614 --> 32:31.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERALDINE FERRARO (D), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
I almost resent, Vice President
Bush, your

32:31.650 --> 32:33.051 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
patronizing...

32:33.084 --> 32:34.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITT ROMNEY (R), Presidential
Candidate: Whole
binders full of women.

32:34.920 --> 32:36.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL DUKAKIS (D),
Presidential Candidate:
That I have opposed the death
penalty during

32:36.321 --> 32:38.123 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all of my life.

32:38.156 --> 32:42.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Interact with all the
general election
debates on our Web site,
watchthedebates.org.

32:42.627 --> 32:49.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But first: As
Europe continues
to struggle with the refugee
crisis, Denmark's

32:49.734 --> 32:55.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government is claiming success
in reducing
the number of people claiming
asylum there,

32:55.073 --> 32:58.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and says other countries want to
copy its
methods.

32:58.276 --> 33:01.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Despite that success, the Danish
electorate
is moving to the right.

33:01.880 --> 33:07.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After complaints, people have
filed charges
of racism against an extreme
right-wing party

33:07.619 --> 33:11.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which has been handing out what
it calls asylum
sprays.

33:11.423 --> 33:16.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From Thisted in Northwest
Denmark, Malcolm
Brabant reports.

33:16.194 --> 33:23.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: In a small town
250 miles
from cosmopolitan Copenhagen,
the new Party

33:23.201 --> 33:28.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Danes is distributing
what it calls
asylum spray, ostensibly as a
defense against

33:28.707 --> 33:32.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
potential immigrant sex
attackers.

33:32.110 --> 33:35.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The campaign has been condemned
as provocative
and xenophobic.

33:35.580 --> 33:38.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nonetheless, the spray finds
several takers.

33:38.650 --> 33:42.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): It's
my daughter
that needs it, the way Danish
society is at

33:42.454 --> 33:44.155 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the moment.

33:44.189 --> 33:47.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): They
can't just
come here and do whatever they
want, like

33:47.092 --> 33:49.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
staring at girls in nightclubs
and stuff.

33:49.527 --> 33:51.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They shouldn't be allowed do
that.

33:51.663 --> 33:56.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The spray was
conceived by
party leader Daniel Carlsen, who
admits denying

33:56.334 --> 34:00.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Holocaust as a teenager, and
is now trying
to win support to run for
Parliament.

34:00.972 --> 34:08.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I think we have too many
people in Denmark
from Arab countries.

34:08.713 --> 34:10.181 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't like it.

34:10.215 --> 34:12.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't like Muslims.

34:12.050 --> 34:16.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This region of
Denmark is
fertile ground for the right.

34:16.121 --> 34:20.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even though the cans only
contain hair
spray, the symbolism touches a
chord.

34:20.959 --> 34:24.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): You
never know
what can happen.

34:24.863 --> 34:27.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just a month ago, I was followed
home on my
bike.

34:27.532 --> 34:31.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Organizations
like the United
Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees think

34:31.670 --> 34:32.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what you're doing is disgusting.

34:32.671 --> 34:34.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's your response?

34:34.472 --> 34:37.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL CARLSEN, Leader, Party of
the Danes:
They are working for and
promoting an invasion

34:37.642 --> 34:44.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Europe, an invasion that, by
time, will
replace the indigenous Europeans
here with

34:44.249 --> 34:46.985 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people from the non-Western
world.

34:47.018 --> 34:48.920 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think that is disgusting.

34:48.954 --> 34:53.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what their politics are
resulting in,
we see that in Europe every day
now.

34:53.558 --> 34:56.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We see rapes, like the incidents
in Cologne.

34:56.895 --> 35:03.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen terror attacks in
Brussels, in
Paris, in Copenhagen, and that's
only the

35:03.134 --> 35:04.936 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last year.

35:04.970 --> 35:11.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: In an
increasingly hostile
atmosphere, Syrian musician Nour
Amora has

35:11.910 --> 35:15.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
found acceptance.

35:15.046 --> 35:19.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We met Amora just over a year
ago, as the
Danish government slashed
welfare benefits

35:19.417 --> 35:23.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for refugees in an attempt to
make the country
less attractive to asylum
seekers.

35:23.388 --> 35:26.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NOUR AMORA, Syrian Refugee: I
make this concert
to know the people, to know the
artists, the

35:26.691 --> 35:29.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
musicians, to make something
with them, to
work, yes.

35:29.194 --> 35:33.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't come to Denmark to
sleep.

35:34.032 --> 35:37.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Amora has been
true to his
word.

35:37.502 --> 35:40.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He supports himself and his
small family with
two jobs.

35:40.939 --> 35:46.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And on this day, he was
entertaining schoolchildren
and educating them about the war
in Syria.

35:46.311 --> 35:49.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Music has opened doors that are
closed to
other refugees.

35:49.614 --> 35:56.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NOUR AMORA (through translator):
I tell my
friends that now it is not good
to come to

35:56.554 --> 36:00.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Denmark because of the
government, but if
you do come, you will find that
the Danish

36:00.792 --> 36:03.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people are really nice.

36:03.762 --> 36:11.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Singer Leila
Rong Hanna was
born in Denmark.

36:11.136 --> 36:15.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has Syrian and Norwegian
heritage, but
has dissuaded relatives in
Damascus and the

36:15.473 --> 36:18.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Syrian port of Latakia from
fleeing to Europe.

36:18.209 --> 36:21.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEILA RONG HANNA, Musician:
Because this is
not the perfect life you get.

36:21.813 --> 36:27.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's quite difficult, not only
the journey,
if you survive in the journey,
but also when

36:27.719 --> 36:29.487 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you come here.

36:29.521 --> 36:31.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's quite uphill.

36:31.222 --> 36:35.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: That's music to
the ears
of many at the Danish
Parliament, because

36:35.293 --> 36:38.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's a sign that the country's
policies are
working.

36:38.329 --> 36:43.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the most satisfied is
Martin Henriksen
of the anti-immigrant Danish
People's Party,

36:43.201 --> 36:45.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
whose support keeps the
center-right government
in power.

36:45.970 --> 36:48.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARTIN HENRIKSEN, Danish
People's Party: Well,
last year, about 20,000 asylum
seekers come

36:48.773 --> 36:49.741 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Denmark.

36:49.774 --> 36:51.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this year, we expected
10,000.

36:51.509 --> 36:56.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This year, we are about around
5,000 at this
time.

36:56.281 --> 36:58.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But 5,000 is still too high.

36:58.550 --> 37:02.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want to -- actually, in the
perfect world,
we want to reduce the numbers,
so that nobody

37:02.420 --> 37:04.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will come to Denmark as an
asylum seeker.

37:04.589 --> 37:06.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So we're not quite there yet.

37:06.491 --> 37:11.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But Peter
Christensen's recently
constituted New Right Party
claims it's even

37:11.896 --> 37:13.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tougher on immigration.

37:13.731 --> 37:18.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's attracted significant
support in recent
surveys after pledging to stop
immigration

37:18.269 --> 37:24.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
altogether, instantly deport
foreigners convicted
of crimes, take Denmark out of
the U.N. Refugee

37:24.309 --> 37:28.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Convention and ban head scarves
in schools
and public offices.

37:28.580 --> 37:31.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Critics fear this swing to the
right is reminiscent
of 1930s Europe.

37:31.983 --> 37:35.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER CHRISTENSEN, New Right
Party: I can't
see how that should compare to
the situation

37:35.987 --> 37:43.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the '30s, with the
discrimination of the
Jews, aggressive nations
attacking each other

37:43.194 --> 37:45.029 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the '40s, the Holocaust.

37:45.063 --> 37:47.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's no comparison
whatsoever.

37:47.499 --> 37:52.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we're talking about is, we
want to implement
a foreign policy that has been
normal until

37:52.537 --> 37:54.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
40, 50 years ago.

37:54.239 --> 37:56.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not -- nobody has the right
to come to
Denmark.

37:56.674 --> 38:00.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have right now because we
are in the
conventions.

38:00.078 --> 38:02.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, I mean, morally, nobody has
the right
to come to Denmark.

38:03.014 --> 38:06.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not like we are expelling
any people.

38:06.217 --> 38:09.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're just saying we want to
have control
of who comes into our country.

38:09.587 --> 38:15.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Denmark's
deterrence of asylum
seekers has enabled it to it
close 17 refugee

38:15.493 --> 38:19.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
centers, including this one in a
former psychiatric
hospital.

38:19.297 --> 38:23.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The policies worry not only
people fleeing
violence in the Middle East.

38:23.968 --> 38:28.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chen Man is concerned about the
time it's
taking to process her asylum
application.

38:28.940 --> 38:34.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She spent seven years in jail in
China for
belonging to Falun Gong, the
outlawed spiritual

38:34.279 --> 38:36.080 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
movement.

38:36.114 --> 38:39.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHEN MAN, Chinese Asylum Seeker:
I feel, like,
worried, because I feel, like,
unstable for

38:39.384 --> 38:40.351 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my security.

38:40.385 --> 38:43.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I need a kind of protection from
the nation.

38:43.087 --> 38:48.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if I cannot have, the risk
of myself is
going back to China and facing
the imprisonment

38:48.893 --> 38:50.662 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
again.

38:50.695 --> 38:53.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Chen Man
believes Denmark's
hostility towards asylum seekers
is a sign

38:53.831 --> 38:55.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of weakness.

38:55.099 --> 38:58.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHEN MAN: Yes, this is not the
way to resolve
the problem.

38:58.169 --> 39:03.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's also a kind of way to
show the fear
inside, because if you are
strong enough,

39:03.474 --> 39:08.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you can handle that without
building up a
wall, but a bridge.

39:08.313 --> 39:11.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: So what's the
source of Denmark's
right turn?

39:11.616 --> 39:14.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is it from the population or
political ideology?

39:14.586 --> 39:18.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nils Holtug is the director of
migration studies
at Copenhagen University.

39:18.590 --> 39:22.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NILS HOLTUG, Copenhagen
University: I think,
to some extent, politicians have
probably

39:22.760 --> 39:27.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been responding to what are real
worries amongst
Danes.

39:27.932 --> 39:35.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they have also been driving
those worries,
so -- especially the Danish
People's Party,

39:35.406 --> 39:39.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but also some of the new parties
that are
coming up now.

39:39.077 --> 39:43.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think the Dane Party is very
worrying.

39:43.214 --> 39:50.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was established by former
members of
a Nazi movement in Denmark.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I'm actually quite worried
about that.

39:52.991 --> 39:54.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Are you a Nazi?

39:54.058 --> 39:55.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL CARLSEN: No.

39:55.293 --> 39:56.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But you were a
National Socialist
before?

39:56.928 --> 39:58.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANIEL CARLSEN: I'm a National
Democrat.

39:58.162 --> 40:00.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But you were a
National Socialist
before.

40:00.164 --> 40:01.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL CARLSEN: Before.

40:01.699 --> 40:04.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: So, are you
saying you're
a reformed National Socialist?

40:04.135 --> 40:05.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANIEL CARLSEN: No, I'm a
National Democrat.

40:06.004 --> 40:09.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But you were a
National Socialist
-- and that was the Nazi Party
-- before.

40:09.807 --> 40:14.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's happening in Denmark is
consistent
with a surge to the right across
Europe.

40:14.112 --> 40:19.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the more controversial
pieces of legislation
enacted here was the so-called
jewelry law,

40:19.617 --> 40:26.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which authorized the authorities
to confiscate
the assets of those migrants and
refugees

40:26.257 --> 40:30.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deemed wealthy enough to be able
to pay for
themselves, rather than relying
on the state.

40:30.561 --> 40:36.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, that law came into effect
in February,
and it's only been used three
times.

40:36.167 --> 40:40.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, the Danish government may
have attracted
lots of international criticism
for its methods,

40:41.005 --> 40:46.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but ministers say that there are
other European
countries that are seeking their
advice about

40:46.644 --> 40:50.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
how to reduce their numbers.

40:50.648 --> 40:54.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With Syria still spinning out of
control and
Europe's migration crisis
showing no sign

40:54.852 --> 40:59.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of abating, does Denmark feel
the need to
toughen its stance still
further, a question

40:59.757 --> 41:02.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the government's migration
spokesman,
Marcus Knuth.

41:02.093 --> 41:06.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCUS KNUTH, Liberal Party:
Part of the reason
why we have such a low influx of
asylum seekers

41:06.864 --> 41:10.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right now is also because of the
E.U. deal
with Turkey.

41:10.501 --> 41:15.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If that deal breaks, if there's
more trouble
in the Middle East and so forth,
everything

41:15.340 --> 41:16.808 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can change.

41:16.841 --> 41:20.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, right now, we're happy that
the situation
seems to be under control.

41:20.044 --> 41:23.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there are so many factors
out there that
things can change.

41:23.881 --> 41:28.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: A strong police
presence
forces refugee supporters to
keep their distance

41:28.553 --> 41:33.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from a monthly anti-Muslim
demonstration.

41:33.358 --> 41:38.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They demand asylum for all,
while the right-wingers
deplore the growth of Islam.

41:38.262 --> 41:41.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The migration crisis is
polarizing European
society.

41:41.666 --> 41:46.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Although the numbers prepared to
demonstrate
on the streets aren't great,
opinion polls

41:46.537 --> 41:52.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
show sentiments expressed at
gatherings like
this are gaining traction, not
just in Denmark,

41:52.076 --> 41:53.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but across the continent.

41:53.511 --> 41:59.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Copenhagen.

41:59.751 --> 42:12.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: With the U.S.
health care system
undergoing its biggest changes
in decades,

42:12.130 --> 42:18.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health experts are looking to an
unexpected
place, sub-Saharan Africa, for
inspiration.

42:18.302 --> 42:22.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Throughout the continent,
ordinary citizens
are routinely trained as
community health

42:22.707 --> 42:24.475 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
workers.

42:24.509 --> 42:28.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Sarah Varney reports on the
lessons to
learn, this story was produced
in collaboration

42:29.013 --> 42:31.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with our partner Kaiser Health
News.

42:31.682 --> 42:37.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Destini Belton is
on a mission
to improve health outcomes in
Harlem.

42:37.388 --> 42:41.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's not a doctor or a nurse,
but she knows
this neighborhood and the people
who live

42:41.926 --> 42:43.761 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

42:43.795 --> 42:48.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Belton goes where clinics and
hospitals can't,
into patients' homes, to
understand the mundane,

42:48.533 --> 42:50.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but vital details of their
lives.

42:50.535 --> 42:51.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DESTINI BELTON, Community Health
Worker: Hi.

42:51.569 --> 42:52.537 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
How are you?

42:52.570 --> 42:55.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Oh, your hair looks nice now.

42:55.273 --> 42:56.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How are you feeling?

42:56.407 --> 42:58.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JESSICA GONZALEZ, Diabetes
Sufferer: OK.

42:58.176 --> 43:01.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: She visits people
like Jessica
Gonzalez, who was blinded by
uncontrolled

43:01.446 --> 43:03.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
type one diabetes at age 22.

43:03.481 --> 43:05.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DESTINI BELTON: Let me take your
blood pressure.

43:05.383 --> 43:11.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Now 33, Gonzalez
has high blood
pressure, high cholesterol and
renal disease,

43:11.088 --> 43:15.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Belton worries that she has
trouble keeping
her medications straight because
she can't

43:15.126 --> 43:16.494 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
see them.

43:16.527 --> 43:18.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DESTINI BELTON: You take most of
them during
what time of the day?

43:18.663 --> 43:20.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JESSICA GONZALEZ: During the day
or after
breakfast.

43:20.331 --> 43:22.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DESTINI BELTON: During the day.

43:22.133 --> 43:25.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Gonzalez is
reluctant to admit
her struggles to her doctor, but
she trusts

43:25.770 --> 43:27.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Belton to understand.

43:27.638 --> 43:31.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSICA GONZALEZ: With your
doctor, you don't
really want to say what you eat,
so I'm able

43:31.309 --> 43:37.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to tell her like, really, if I'm
not going
well, or, you know, if I sneaked
and cheated.

43:37.281 --> 43:39.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I tell her the right things, and
she helps
me.

43:39.750 --> 43:45.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MANMEET KAUR, City Health Works:
East Harlem
in particular has the highest
rate of diet-related

43:45.423 --> 43:47.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
diseases in New York.

43:47.225 --> 43:50.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Manmeet Kaur has
trained a small
team of these community health
workers in

43:50.928 --> 43:52.597 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
New York City.

43:52.630 --> 43:55.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MANMEET KAUR: East Harlem in
particular has
the highest rate of diet-related
diseases

43:55.233 --> 43:56.968 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in New York.

43:57.001 --> 44:00.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: The organization,
called City
Health Works, contracts with
primary care

44:00.671 --> 44:05.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
providers, like Mount Sinai
Health System,
to better manage their most
difficult patients.

44:05.109 --> 44:08.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Today, we're going to be
doing a workshop
on healthy beverages.

44:08.913 --> 44:13.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Nearly all of
their clients
are poor and facing chronic
illnesses that

44:13.551 --> 44:15.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
frequently spiral out of
control.

44:15.786 --> 44:21.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They work to stabilize their
health and avoid
costly visits to the emergency
room and lengthy

44:21.192 --> 44:23.895 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
hospital stays.

44:23.928 --> 44:30.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Employing community health
workers is a common
strategy elsewhere in the world.

44:30.601 --> 44:36.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In sub-Saharan Africa, community
health workers
have long formed the backbone of
health systems,

44:36.040 --> 44:40.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
filling in gaps where doctors
and nurses are
in short supply.

44:40.177 --> 44:45.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was Thandi Blie in Cape Town,
South Africa,
in fact, who helped to inspire
Kaur to start

44:45.516 --> 44:46.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
City Health Works.

44:46.551 --> 44:49.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THANDI BLIE, Mamelani Projects:
Hi.

44:49.287 --> 44:50.254 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Hello.

44:50.288 --> 44:52.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: How are you?

44:52.056 --> 44:54.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
THANDI BLIE: I'm fine.

44:54.258 --> 44:55.226 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

44:55.259 --> 44:56.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And how are you, my dear?

44:56.260 --> 44:57.228 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: I'm good.

44:57.261 --> 44:59.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THANDI BLIE: Long time no see.

44:59.096 --> 45:03.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: They met when Kaur
worked with
a group called Mamelani
Projects, a nonprofit

45:03.701 --> 45:08.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that relies on regular women
like Blie to
help neighbors improve their
health habits.

THANDI BLIE: I remember, last
time, when we
met, you had issues or problems
about your

45:16.113 --> 45:17.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
high blood problem.

45:17.248 --> 45:19.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Often by sharing
their own experience.

45:19.350 --> 45:22.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THANDI BLIE: Yes, because really
high blood
pressure is very dangerous.

45:22.653 --> 45:24.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I know it from me.

45:24.355 --> 45:29.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: She often shares
how her once
high blood pressure led to a
stroke.

45:29.193 --> 45:33.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THANDI BLIE: I make the examples
about what
happens in me.

45:33.631 --> 45:38.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, as soon as I share maybe a
story, someone
say, and me too.

45:38.703 --> 45:44.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Long lines besiege
clinics and
hospitals in South Africa, where
apartheid-era

45:44.075 --> 45:49.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
laws have left a legacy of
widespread poverty
and desperate health conditions.

45:49.580 --> 45:53.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mamelani's health coaches say
that, just as
in New York City, those
realities are often

45:53.985 --> 46:01.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
best confronted outside the
walls of medical
clinics by bringing health
education to areas

46:01.792 --> 46:03.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that need it most.

46:03.928 --> 46:07.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The women who've attended these
classes are
making lasting changes to their
own health

46:07.999 --> 46:10.901 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and in the wider community.

46:10.935 --> 46:15.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mickey Linda used her own
pension to start
a soup kitchen after hearing
that neighbors

46:15.673 --> 46:20.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were taking powerful drugs to
treat HIV on
empty stomachs.

46:20.878 --> 46:25.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With nutrition training from
Mamelani, she
now cooks up healthier meals for
hundreds

46:25.516 --> 46:30.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of neighbors and serves as a
vital local health
resource, keeping watch over her
community.

46:30.321 --> 46:33.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICKEY LINDA, Started Soup
Kitchen: Because
doctors are not staying here.

46:33.357 --> 46:35.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Doctors are staying in town.

46:35.192 --> 46:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's us who see that we can talk
about health
to them, because we are staying
together here.

46:42.600 --> 46:47.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's us who see them, that this
is this problem
this problem.

46:47.204 --> 46:53.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Those close social
ties undergird
much of life in South Africa,
says Mamelani's

46:53.310 --> 46:56.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
founder, Carly Tanur.

46:56.847 --> 47:01.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She and her team are working
closely with
Manmeet Kaur back in Harlem to
figure out

47:01.252 --> 47:05.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how Mamelani's model could be
incorporated
more broadly into the U.S.
health care system.

47:05.923 --> 47:11.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But here in Harlem, the question
is, how can
this model fit into a sprawling
hospital system

47:11.228 --> 47:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like Mount Sinai, especially at
a time when
health care leaders are
searching for ways

47:15.599 --> 47:19.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to control the cost of caring
for chronically
ill patients?

47:19.370 --> 47:24.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With Medicare now penalizing
providers for
some preventable conditions,
there are stronger

47:24.608 --> 47:28.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
financial incentives to steady
the turbulent
lives of people like Jeanette
Rodriguez.

47:28.746 --> 47:34.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEANETTE RODRIGUEZ, New York: I
was in emergency
last two Fridays ago because I
fell in the

47:34.919 --> 47:36.654 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
street.

47:36.687 --> 47:39.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Destini Belton is
her go-to
problem-solver, filling out
paperwork for

47:39.790 --> 47:43.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
benefits, helping her find a
caregiver program
for her father.

47:43.094 --> 47:46.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But she's also a liaison for
Rodriguez's own
medical needs.

47:46.297 --> 47:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DESTINI BELTON: So, the main
things we're
going to ask when we get up
there to the doctor

47:49.667 --> 47:51.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is about your back.

47:51.235 --> 47:55.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: At a nearby Mount
Sinai clinic,
that preparation has paid off.

47:55.139 --> 47:59.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DR. Joseph Truglio tells
Rodriguez she may
have had a mild stroke.

47:59.110 --> 48:00.878 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

48:00.911 --> 48:01.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH M. TRUGLIO, Mount Sinai
Clinic: I know
that's got to be pretty hard to
hear that

48:01.912 --> 48:03.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that might have been something
that happened.

48:03.948 --> 48:07.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Rodriguez had
dismissed the
tingling on her right side as
arthritis, but

48:07.852 --> 48:13.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Belton's insistence and long
relationship
with her ensured Dr. Truglio
would hear about

48:13.824 --> 48:15.826 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

48:15.860 --> 48:19.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plugging into their patients'
electronic health
records, Kaur wants to make
coaches an indispensable

48:19.897 --> 48:25.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
part of the health care system
by professionalizing
their role and proving their
financial value.

48:25.136 --> 48:30.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MANMEET KAUR: We work with
clinics to determine,
how do we integrate our team
into their operations?

48:31.008 --> 48:35.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that we know has resulted in
patients
feeling very confident in the
services we

48:35.546 --> 48:39.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
provide, but also the doctors
feeling really
confident that they know more of
what's going

48:39.316 --> 48:40.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on with their patients.

48:40.818 --> 48:44.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: But Kaur goes home
each night
to one of her biggest skeptics.

48:44.054 --> 48:49.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her husband, Dr. Prabhjot Singh,
is helping
Mount Sinai figure out whether
there's enough

48:49.193 --> 48:53.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
evidence that efforts like City
Health Works
should be integrated more fully
into Mount

48:53.697 --> 48:54.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Sinai's business.

48:54.698 --> 48:56.534 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

48:56.567 --> 48:58.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PRABHJOT SINGH, Mount Sinai: I
think the thought
that comes up a lot of my
colleagues, and

48:58.335 --> 49:02.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
frankly my own, is, how do you
do this for
40,000 people, 50,000 people at
the scale

49:02.740 --> 49:05.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the Mount Sinai Health
System?

49:05.209 --> 49:09.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Singh heads the
Department of
Health System Design and Global
Health at

49:09.547 --> 49:10.514 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mount Sinai.

49:10.548 --> 49:12.349 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

49:12.383 --> 49:14.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PRABHJOT SINGH: We actually have
to know whether
or not the relationship between
Destini and

49:14.084 --> 49:15.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her client is effective.

49:15.886 --> 49:20.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It may feel really good, but,
from a health
system perspective, and also
just looking

49:20.558 --> 49:24.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at health improvement, we have
to really understand,
is she getting healthier and are
we doing

49:24.662 --> 49:25.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it in a cost-effective way?

49:25.996 --> 49:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: There are early
signs the program
is working.

49:29.099 --> 49:34.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Patients with health coaches
cost $600 a month
less in medical care than a
control group,

49:34.238 --> 49:39.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a strong indication that coaches
are preventing
expensive medical emergencies.

49:39.176 --> 49:43.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for half the patients,
coaches alerted
doctors about urgent needs that
they weren't

49:43.480 --> 49:45.316 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
aware of.

49:45.349 --> 49:49.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While the program has worked
well for people
like Jessica Gonzalez and
Jeanette Rodriguez,

49:49.954 --> 49:54.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
City Health Works remains a
small venture,
supported largely by foundations
interested

49:54.792 --> 49:56.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in testing the model.

49:56.627 --> 50:01.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the ultimate aim is to have
public and
private insurers around the
country pay for

50:01.232 --> 50:08.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thousands of coaches like
Destini Belton,
creating stronger ties between
neighbors,

50:08.305 --> 50:13.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like in sub-Saharan Africa, to
help poor communities
take control of their own
health.

50:14.011 --> 50:18.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour" and
Kaiser Health News,
I'm Sarah Varney.

50:18.048 --> 50:24.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can learn
about a community
health initiative taking place
in New York

50:24.121 --> 50:27.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that aims to protect residents
from unsafe
summer temperatures.

50:27.625 --> 50:32.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's on our Web site,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

50:32.296 --> 50:45.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to our
"NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught our eye
that might be

50:46.010 --> 50:47.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of interest to you, too.

50:47.845 --> 50:53.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The mineral topaz comes in a
wide range of
hues and saturations, and one
British museum

50:53.684 --> 50:58.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is about to unveil what it says
is the biggest
cut specimen of its color and
clarity.

50:58.989 --> 51:01.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s Julia Griffin
took a closer
look.

51:01.659 --> 51:08.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JULIA GRIFFIN: At 9,381
glittering carats,
the Ostro stone is being called
the largest

51:08.832 --> 51:10.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
topaz of its kind.

51:10.668 --> 51:16.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The electric blue, oval-cut
stone is nearly
six inches long, 4.5 inches
wide, and weighs

51:16.907 --> 51:18.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nearly 4.5 pounds.

51:18.742 --> 51:22.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAURICE OSTRO, Entrepreneur and
Philanthropist:
Having tried to hold it for
photography, I

51:22.112 --> 51:24.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
can tell you it is very heavy.

51:24.081 --> 51:29.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JULIA GRIFFIN: British
entrepreneur and philanthropist
Maurice Ostro recently gave the
gemstone to

51:29.286 --> 51:32.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
London's Natural History Museum
on a permanent
loan.

51:32.690 --> 51:37.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAURICE OSTRO: What is amazing
about this
stone is not just its size.

51:37.328 --> 51:39.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's its quality.

51:39.129 --> 51:46.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The color, the intensity of the
blue and the
clarity of the stone are what
makes it so

51:46.370 --> 51:48.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
exceptionally rare.

51:48.205 --> 51:52.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Ostro's father,
Max, discovered
the original rough topaz in the
Amazon rain

51:52.609 --> 51:57.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forest in 1986, but the cut
stone has been
locked away for three decades.

51:57.448 --> 52:02.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After his father's death,
Maurice Ostro thought
it was time for the public to
enjoy the gemstone's

52:02.486 --> 52:04.254 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
beauty.

52:04.288 --> 52:08.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The museum's mineral curator,
Mike Rumsey,
hopes the topaz will help spark
interest in

52:08.525 --> 52:10.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the wider collection.

52:10.327 --> 52:12.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE RUMSEY, London Natural
History Museum:
It will tell us another bit of
the natural

52:12.363 --> 52:13.998 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
story.

52:14.031 --> 52:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So you start off with that rough
mineral,
which is all kind of quite
interesting, and

52:16.000 --> 52:17.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I really like that as a
scientist.

52:17.501 --> 52:19.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then we do things to it, and
we will change
it.

52:19.636 --> 52:22.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will cut it into something,
and this is
really a fantastic example of
the way in which

52:23.007 --> 52:24.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we have crafted something out of
nature.

52:25.009 --> 52:30.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: The Ostro stone
now joins other
topaz record holders in their
own color categories.

52:30.514 --> 52:36.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The 21,000-carat light blue
Brazilian Princess
topaz lives at the American
Museum of Natural

52:36.854 --> 52:43.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
History in New York, while the
31,000-carat
reddish-orange El-Dorado topaz
belongs to

52:43.093 --> 52:45.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Programa Royal Collections
in Spain.

52:45.929 --> 52:50.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Ostro stone will go on
display October
19.

52:50.501 --> 52:53.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But jewel thieves, including
Pink Panther
prowlers, beware.

52:53.604 --> 52:58.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The museum has pledged to boost
security to
protect the gemstone.

52:58.375 --> 53:01.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Julia Griffin.

53:01.211 --> 53:04.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Pretty stunning.

53:04.081 --> 53:05.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.
