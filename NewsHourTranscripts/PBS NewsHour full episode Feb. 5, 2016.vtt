JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.173 --> 00:11.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Democrats square
off in a contentious debate, as
Republican

00:12.045 --> 00:17.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
candidates jockey for survival
just days before
the New Hampshire primary.

00:17.317 --> 00:23.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Then: a report from the
epicenter of the Zika
outbreak in Brazil, where
scientists are racing

00:23.690 --> 00:25.559 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
against time.

00:25.659 --> 00:31.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And from a new restaurant owner
to a resilient
mother in a muddy camp, the many
lives of

00:31.798 --> 00:34.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Syrian refugees now living
in Lebanon.

00:34.935 --> 00:38.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMINA HAMADI, Refugee (through
translator):
A mountain can't move me. I have
children

00:38.906 --> 00:42.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that I have to raise. I need to
look after
them.

00:42.309 --> 00:47.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.
Mark Shields
and David Brooks are here, to
analyze the

00:47.281 --> 00:48.949 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
week's news.

00:49.049 --> 00:55.889 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:55.989 --> 00:58.759 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:58.859 --> 01:08.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's the final
weekend before
the New Hampshire primary, and
the eyes of

01:08.235 --> 01:13.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the political world are focused
on the Granite
State. Candidates are dashing
across the state

01:13.807 --> 01:16.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to win over as many votes as
possible.

01:16.944 --> 01:21.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Political director Lisa
Desjardins, who is
in Manchester, reports that when
the two remaining

01:21.315 --> 01:26.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats took center stage
together, they
heated up a cold New England
night.

01:26.586 --> 01:31.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Four days
before the balloting,
the Democratic race is now about
defining

01:31.625 --> 01:33.527 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and definitions.

01:33.627 --> 01:34.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Well, let me start by saying
that Senator

01:34.895 --> 01:37.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sanders and I share some very
big progressive
goals.

01:37.497 --> 01:41.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Progressive,
that was Hillary
Clinton's key word from minute
one of last

01:41.635 --> 01:45.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night's debate, even as Bernie
Sanders tried
to tie her to a different word:
moderate.

01:45.706 --> 01:48.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
It is what she said, and all
that I said,

01:48.575 --> 01:52.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's nothing wrong with being
a moderate.
But you can't be a moderate. You
can't be

01:52.379 --> 01:53.547 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a progressive.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Sanders
attacked and Clinton
countered.

01:55.682 --> 01:58.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: But if
we're going
to get into labels, I don't
think it was particularly

01:58.218 --> 02:00.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
progressive to vote against the
Brady Bill
five times.

02:00.821 --> 02:04.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I don't
think it was
progressive to vote to give gun
makers and

02:04.324 --> 02:06.159 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sellers immunity.

02:06.259 --> 02:10.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Minutes later,
another sharp
exchange over Sanders' repeated
mention of

02:10.364 --> 02:13.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the speaking fees Clinton
previously collected
from banks.

02:13.433 --> 02:19.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: There is
this attack
that he is putting forth, which
really comes

02:19.673 --> 02:28.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down to, you know, anybody who
ever took donations
or speaking fees from any
interest group has

02:28.882 --> 02:30.684 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be bought.

02:30.784 --> 02:36.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I just absolutely reject
that, Senator.
So I think it's time to end the
very artful

02:36.223 --> 02:45.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
smear that you and your campaign
have been
carrying out in recent weeks,
and let's talk

02:45.399 --> 02:47.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- let's talk about the issues.

02:47.234 --> 02:49.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Let's talk
let's talk
about issues, all right? Let's
talk about

02:49.202 --> 02:55.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why, in the 1990s, Wall Street
got deregulated.
Did it have anything to do with
the fact that

02:55.442 --> 03:02.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street provided -- spent
billions of
dollars on lobbying and campaign
contributions?

03:02.115 --> 03:05.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, some people might think,
yes, that had
some influence.

03:05.685 --> 03:10.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Sanders
hammered home a chief
campaign issue for him: that
Wall Street is

03:10.357 --> 03:12.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hoarding wealth and politicians
have left
it uncontrolled.

03:13.060 --> 03:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: It is not
one street.
Wall Street is an entity of
unbelievable economic

03:19.833 --> 03:21.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and political power. That's a
fact.

03:21.968 --> 03:25.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Sanders also
launched his
top charge against Clinton.

03:25.806 --> 03:28.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Not only
did I vote against
that war. I helped lead the
opposition

03:29.076 --> 03:32.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Raising her
2002 vote that
authorized the Iraq War.

03:32.946 --> 03:39.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Look, we
did differ.
A vote in 2002 is not a plan to
defeat ISIS.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to look at the threats
that we face
right now.

03:41.988 --> 03:43.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:43.457 --> 03:45.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: And we
have to be
prepared to take them on.

03:45.292 --> 03:49.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But that led to
a longer
back-and-forth, where Clinton
sharply questioned

03:49.396 --> 03:51.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some of Sanders' foreign policy
grasp.

03:51.431 --> 03:57.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Such as
inviting Iranian
troops into Syria to try to
resolve the conflict

03:57.304 --> 04:03.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there, putting them right on the
doorstep
of Israel, asking Saudi Arabia
and Iran to

04:03.643 --> 04:10.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work together, when they can't
stand each
other, and are engaged in a
proxy battle right

04:10.383 --> 04:11.118 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at this moment.

04:11.218 --> 04:12.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

04:13.086 --> 04:16.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: I fully,
fully concede
that Secretary Clinton, who was
secretary

04:16.656 --> 04:23.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of state for four years, has
more experience.
That is not arguable in foreign
affairs. But

04:23.930 --> 04:28.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
experience is not the only
point. Judgment
is.

04:28.335 --> 04:32.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: For all of that
heat during
last night's one-on-one clash,
the major opponent

04:32.939 --> 04:38.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today in the Granite State was
snow. It slowed
the day's events, but candidates
plowed on.

04:38.945 --> 04:43.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeb Bush was out in Derry today.
And former
first lady Barbara Bush braved
the conditions

04:43.650 --> 04:47.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as well, touting her son during
a make-or-break
week for him.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARBARA BUSH, Former First Lady:
Vote for
Jeb.

04:49.489 --> 04:53.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Voters still
came out to
see John Kasich in Hollis for
what was his

04:53.126 --> 04:58.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
99th town hall. His campaign,
like that of
Jeb Bush, hinges on a solid
showing in next

04:58.999 --> 05:04.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tuesday's primary. The snow
didn't get in
the way of several women
senators, either.

05:04.204 --> 05:08.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They joined New Hampshire's
governor in Manchester
today, in a bid to give Clinton,
their former

05:08.842 --> 05:11.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
colleague, a post-debate boost.

05:12.012 --> 05:16.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Four days to go, and it is
already a blitz,
or, if you will, blizzard here
in New Hampshire.

05:16.883 --> 05:21.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even with today's snow, Judy,
candidates held
some 20 events today, like this
one here at

05:21.588 --> 05:23.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a middle school gym for Marco
Rubio.

05:23.557 --> 05:28.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One note about this event. The
Rubio campaign
was very happy to tell me that
they originally

05:28.195 --> 05:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scheduled this for the cafeteria
of this school,
but they had more people show up
than they

05:33.400 --> 05:35.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
expected and they moved it to
the gym -- Judy.

05:35.202 --> 05:38.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, that's
surprising they
would want to share that
information with

05:38.338 --> 05:39.105 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you, Lisa.

05:39.206 --> 05:40.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Imagine.

05:41.007 --> 05:44.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you have been
to several
candidate events today. What are
the voters

05:45.011 --> 05:46.846 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
saying to you?

05:46.947 --> 05:51.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: When you talk
to New Hampshire
voters who go to these events,
to be honest,

05:51.484 --> 05:55.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy, I feel a lot of them are
still soft.
Most of them seem to be honing
in on their

05:55.689 --> 05:58.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
own private list of two or three
candidates.

05:59.025 --> 06:03.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what surprised me, Judy, was
the combination
of candidates. I talked to two
different voters

06:03.196 --> 06:07.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today who are looking at one
Democrat and
one Republican. For example, a
man I talked

06:08.068 --> 06:13.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to, former firefighter, thinking
about Bernie
Sanders and Marco Rubio. That's
a combination

06:13.173 --> 06:17.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that might surprise people, but
he said what
he's looking for is integrity.

06:17.244 --> 06:21.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that's a word I heard
throughout. Also
here at this event, those who
are looking

06:21.348 --> 06:26.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at Rubio, the Republicans, it
does seem like
they're considering Rubio
against Trump or

06:26.119 --> 06:30.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rubio against Cruz, but the key
there, Judy,
is that these are voters who say
they weren't

06:30.824 --> 06:34.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
paying that much attention to
Marco Rubio,
say, a month ago. Now they're
here and they

06:34.728 --> 06:36.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
want to see him in person.

06:36.696 --> 06:41.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, are you
picking up a sense
that Rubio has benefited from
coming in third

06:41.768 --> 06:44.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Iowa, a close third to Donald
Trump?

06:44.437 --> 06:47.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think
absolutely he's benefited.

06:47.907 --> 06:52.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, I don't think he's locked
in those votes
yet, but I think he has people
considering

06:52.412 --> 06:56.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him who were not before. I also
think Marco
Rubio is benefiting from doubts
about the

06:57.083 --> 07:02.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other candidates, about the
fight between
Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.
Donald Trump saying

07:02.222 --> 07:06.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Ted Cruz doesn't get along
with anyone,
I have heard that from people
here today at

07:06.660 --> 07:08.561 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this Rubio event.

07:08.662 --> 07:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, Ted Cruz
saying that Donald
Trump is a hothead who can't be
trusted, say,

07:13.166 --> 07:17.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the nuclear arsenal, I have
heard that
as well. Rubio seems to be
benefiting from

07:17.304 --> 07:22.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that fight from the top two.
Now, how that
will end, I don't know. Rubio
obviously has

07:22.876 --> 07:27.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to prove himself on his own.
Donald Trump
wasn't in the state today, as we
said, because

07:27.814 --> 07:33.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the weather, and he is trying
to re-angle
his campaign, Judy, trying to be
-- do more

07:33.119 --> 07:35.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
retail politics than we have
seen before.

07:35.555 --> 07:39.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So far, his campaign hasn't
proven that they
know quite how to do that, but
they're trying.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they can pull that off, it
might help him
here.

07:42.128 --> 07:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Lisa, is it
thought that
not being in the state today
will matter for

07:46.800 --> 07:51.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump? And, by the way,
both Democrats,
Hillary Clinton and Bernie
Sanders, are going

07:51.571 --> 07:54.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be leaving the state for part
of the weekend.

07:54.341 --> 07:58.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right, the
tightest race
that we have, the Democratic
race, if you

07:58.778 --> 08:02.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
look nationally, both candidates
are taking
time from the campaign trail.

08:02.315 --> 08:05.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders, he is going to
be on "Saturday
Night Live" with Larry David. I
think some

08:06.086 --> 08:10.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of our viewers will be happy to
imagine how
that will go. And then Hillary
Clinton is

08:10.523 --> 08:13.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to Flint, Michigan. Those
are two very
different events, but it shows
that both of

08:13.760 --> 08:18.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these candidates are looking
past New Hampshire,
maybe for different reasons,
Hillary Clinton

08:18.932 --> 08:23.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
knowing she's behind, wanting to
talk to,
perhaps, Flint, Michigan, a
group that could

08:23.970 --> 08:29.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
appeal, to, say, South Carolina,
where there
are a lot of African-American
and sort of

08:29.142 --> 08:30.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lower-income voters.

08:31.077 --> 08:35.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders trying to appeal
more broadly
nationally, where he and Clinton
are the closest.

08:35.482 --> 08:40.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As for Donald Trump, I do think
New Hampshire
voters notice when a candidate
is not here.

08:40.320 --> 08:43.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have noticed. And I think
the Trump campaign
is aware of that.

08:43.623 --> 08:48.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think we will watch this
weekend and
see if he starts scheduling more
events. Certainly,

08:48.328 --> 08:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Trump campaign wants to win,
but they're
used to very large speeches. And
they're right

08:52.966 --> 08:55.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now just retooling for the
retail politics
of New Hampshire.

08:55.902 --> 08:59.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we know
voters in New
Hampshire and Iowa expect to see
their candidates

09:00.039 --> 09:03.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and see them often. So, we will
see.

09:03.410 --> 09:07.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins in New Hampshire
for the weekend
through the duration, thank you.

09:07.580 --> 09:10.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: My pleasure.
Thank you.

09:10.550 --> 09:15.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news, the
government's latest jobs report
showed hiring

09:15.989 --> 09:21.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
slowed substantially in January
from the month
before. The Labor Department
said U.S. employers

09:21.461 --> 09:29.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
added 151,000 jobs. At the same
time, the
unemployment rate dropped to 4.9
percent last

09:29.502 --> 09:37.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
month. That is its lowest level
in eight years.
And wages, average hourly
earnings, rose significantly.

09:37.610 --> 09:40.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama hailed the news
this afternoon
at the White House.

09:40.480 --> 09:43.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
We should be proud of the
progress we have

09:43.416 --> 09:50.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made. We have recovered from the
worst economic
crisis since the 1930s, the
worst in my lifetime

09:50.256 --> 09:55.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the lifetime of most of the
people in
this room, and we have done it
faster, stronger,

09:55.428 --> 09:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
better, more durably than just
about any other
advanced economy.

09:59.666 --> 10:04.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The mixed jobs
data sent stocks
downward on Wall Street today.
The Dow Jones

10:05.038 --> 10:12.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
industrial average dropped
nearly 212 points
to close just under 16205. The
Nasdaq fell

10:12.912 --> 10:20.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than 146 points, and the
S&amp;P 500 lost
35. For the week, the Dow was
down more than

10:20.753 --> 10:27.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a percent. The Nasdaq fell 5
percent, and
the S&amp;P 500 lost 3 percent.

10:27.160 --> 10:34.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A 6.4-magnitude earthquake has
rocked southern
Taiwan. It was centered about 27
miles southeast

10:34.634 --> 10:41.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Tainan and struck about six
miles underground.
Local media reported multiple
buildings had

10:41.207 --> 10:46.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
collapsed in the city that is
home to nearly
two million people. There was no
immediate

10:46.679 --> 10:48.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
word on casualties.

10:48.948 --> 10:55.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Syria, pro-government forces
aided by Russian
airstrikes tightened their grip
around Aleppo.

10:55.288 --> 11:00.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They captured the town of
Ratyan, less than
15 miles away. A rebel commander
said the

11:00.994 --> 11:05.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
northern Aleppo countryside has
now been totally
encircled.

11:05.598 --> 11:11.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Turkey estimates
15,000 Syrians
have arrived at their border,
but it's not

11:11.905 --> 11:18.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clear how many will be let in.
Relief groups
have set up tents on the Syrian
side for temporary

11:18.244 --> 11:20.046 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
shelter.

11:20.146 --> 11:25.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The United Nations' children's
agency, UNICEF,
reports that at least 200
million girls and

11:25.585 --> 11:31.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women around the world have been
subjected
to genital mutilation. That is
70,000 more

11:32.025 --> 11:39.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
cases than in 2014. It
attributed the rise
to both population growth and
increased reporting.

11:39.532 --> 11:45.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Female genital mutilation occurs
in at least
30 countries. But half the
victims live in

11:45.405 --> 11:48.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Egypt, Ethiopia and Indonesia.

11:48.608 --> 11:53.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Twitter is cracking down on
accounts that
promote terrorist activity. The
company said

11:53.980 --> 12:01.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
today that it's already
suspended more than
125,000 accounts, mostly linked
to the Islamic

12:01.321 --> 12:07.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State. It's also increasing the
staffing of
teams that review accounts
flagged for extremism,

12:08.094 --> 12:11.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so they can catch suspicious
users faster.

12:11.431 --> 12:17.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A United Nations human rights
panel ruled
today that WikiLeaks founder
Julian Assange

12:17.503 --> 12:22.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should be allowed to walk free.
The group
said that he's been arbitrarily
detained by

12:22.475 --> 12:28.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the British and Swedish
governments, who have
long sought to extradite Assange
to Sweden

12:28.214 --> 12:34.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to face rape charges that he's
denied. Assange
emerged onto the balcony of
Ecuador's embassy

12:34.354 --> 12:39.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in London, where he's taken
refuge since 2012,
to celebrate the panel's
findings.

12:39.959 --> 12:50.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JULIAN ASSANGE, Founder,
WikiLeaks: How sweet
it is. This is a victory that
cannot be denied.

12:50.203 --> 13:01.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a victory of historic
importance, not
just for me, for my family, for
my children,

13:02.015 --> 13:05.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but for the independence of the
U.N. system.

13:05.618 --> 13:10.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: British's foreign
secretary,
Philip Hammond, repudiated the
U.N. ruling,

13:10.256 --> 13:12.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which is not legally binding.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHILIP HAMMOND, British Foreign
Secretary:
Julian Assange is a fugitive
from justice.

13:14.927 --> 13:21.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is hiding from justice in the
Ecuadorian
Embassy. He can come out onto
the pavement

13:21.267 --> 13:28.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anytime he chooses. He is not
being detained
by us, but he will have to face
justice in

13:28.741 --> 13:31.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Sweden if he chooses to do so.

13:31.678 --> 13:38.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it is right that he
shouldn't be able
to escape justice. This is,
frankly, a ridiculous

13:39.018 --> 13:41.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
finding by the working group,
and we reject
it.

13:42.088 --> 13:46.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: London police
have said that
they will arrest Assange if he
tries to leave

13:46.426 --> 13:52.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Ecuadorian Embassy. It's
unclear whether
the U.S. is also seeking his
arrest related

13:52.198 --> 13:57.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to WikiLeaks' release of
hundreds of thousands
of secret U.S. documents.

13:57.670 --> 14:02.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There will be no big dance
appearance for
the Louisville Cardinals this
year. The University

14:02.508 --> 14:08.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of Louisville announced a
self-imposed postseason
ban for its men's basketball
team today. It

14:08.915 --> 14:15.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
comes as the NCAA is
investigating claims
that escorts were paid to dance
and have sex

14:15.755 --> 14:21.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with recruits and players. The
university's
president said a separate
internal investigation

14:21.561 --> 14:24.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
revealed -- quote -- "that
violations had
occurred."

14:24.997 --> 14:31.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And former Apollo 14 astronaut
Edgar Mitchell
has died. Mitchell was a part of
the 1971

14:31.971 --> 14:37.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lunar mission, becoming the
sixth of only
12 people to ever walk on the
surface of the

14:37.643 --> 14:43.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moon. He died last evening in
Florida following
a short illness. Edgar Mitchell
was 85 years

14:44.016 --> 14:45.718 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
old.

14:45.818 --> 14:50.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Brazil's
race against time to combat the
Zika virus;

14:50.556 --> 14:55.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syrian refugees struggle to call
Lebanon home;
Mark Shields and David Brooks on
this week

14:55.995 --> 15:02.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in politics; psychology of
sports ahead of
Sunday's Super Bowl; plus, the
causes and

15:02.935 --> 15:12.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
consequence of distrust in
government.

15:12.245 --> 15:23.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. health officials put out
new guidance
today about the Zika virus. For
the first

15:23.823 --> 15:29.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time, they recommended that men
who have traveled
to an area with Zika should use
condoms if

15:29.362 --> 15:34.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have sex with a pregnant
woman for the
entire duration of the
pregnancy. The CDC

15:34.734 --> 15:40.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also says those men may want to
consider abstaining
from sex with women who are
trying to get

15:40.840 --> 15:42.642 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pregnant.

15:42.742 --> 15:46.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
While the disease is
overwhelmingly spread
by mosquitoes, questions about
three possible

15:46.779 --> 15:51.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cases of sexual transmission led
to these
new guidelines.

15:51.617 --> 15:57.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Brazil, Zika has been found
in the saliva
and urine of two people. And
more than one

15:57.590 --> 16:01.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
million people there are said to
be infected
with Zika.

16:01.260 --> 16:05.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our science correspondent, Miles
O'Brien,
is covering the story. He joins
me now from

16:05.898 --> 16:09.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Recife, Brazil, where Carnival
celebrations
are beginning.

16:09.969 --> 16:15.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Miles, this is a country
that's hardest-hit.
It also happens to be you're
there at the

16:15.474 --> 16:17.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
time of this big annual holiday.

16:17.877 --> 16:22.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes, Judy. Here
we are in the
middle of this public health
crisis and this

16:22.915 --> 16:29.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
celebration, this national
holiday begins
on this night, Carnival.

16:29.422 --> 16:33.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What's interesting about
Carnival is that
at the very core the philosophy
is, forget

16:34.026 --> 16:39.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your troubles and party like
there is no tomorrow.
That's how the Brazilians view
it and that's

16:39.131 --> 16:42.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
why in most cases the party has
gone on.

16:42.235 --> 16:46.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I talked to a lot of public
health officials
and doctors and scientists who
have been involved

16:46.873 --> 16:53.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this hurt for some action and
some way
to control the Zika outbreak,
and many of

16:53.779 --> 16:57.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them express misgivings about
it, frankly,
but the show is going on.

16:57.950 --> 17:03.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, Miles, we
know the Centers
for Disease Control said today
that the cooperation

17:03.656 --> 17:08.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Brazil is getting better.
That's the
CDC here in the U.S. But they
also have some

17:08.461 --> 17:13.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expressed some frustration about
not getting
enough data from down this. What
do you know

17:13.199 --> 17:15.001 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about that?

17:15.101 --> 17:17.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: We heard a lot
about this when
we spoke to some of the
scientists on the

17:17.303 --> 17:23.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
front lines here, some of the
epidemiologists
and the virologists who are
working on this

17:23.209 --> 17:24.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
scientific riddle.

17:25.011 --> 17:30.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This is a virus that has
presented a whole
new problem for them, and it's a
virus, like

17:31.083 --> 17:35.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so many things these days, that
instantly
become a global problem. The
problem is, there

17:35.221 --> 17:40.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is legislation, there is law in
this land
which makes it all but
impossible for them

17:40.693 --> 17:46.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to share samples with their
colleagues in
Atlanta or Glasgow or elsewhere
In Europe.

17:46.599 --> 17:52.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they have been frustrated
by that inability
to share their data. Having said
that, in

17:52.638 --> 17:57.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a briefing today, the head of
the CDC, Tom
Frieden, said that is improving.
But it's

17:57.643 --> 18:03.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a reminder that when you're in a
situation
like this with a fast-moving
virus, it's time

18:03.282 --> 18:08.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to bring all kinds of borders
and privileges
and scientific prerogatives down
and try to

18:09.055 --> 18:10.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fight the problem.

18:10.990 --> 18:14.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Miles, for
the medical
profession, I know you're
talking to physicians

18:14.527 --> 18:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there, researchers. You were
saying this has
to be very frustrating for them,
that they

18:20.066 --> 18:23.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't feel, you said, that they
have the tools
in the toolbox that they need.

18:23.569 --> 18:29.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: I spoke to a
gynecologist today
who's dealt with several mothers
who have

18:29.141 --> 18:31.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had to contend with this, and
she's so frustrated.

18:31.844 --> 18:37.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She said: "I feel like I'm in
the Stone Age.
I can see this coming, I stay
problem developing,

18:37.984 --> 18:42.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and I have no tools in my
toolbox to help
these women."

18:42.488 --> 18:46.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an unfortunate case. They
have got this
virus that came out of the blue,
and they

18:47.026 --> 18:50.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really don't have a way of
coping with it
right now.

18:50.262 --> 18:56.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Miles, in
terms of the
science of it and dealing with
the mosquitoes

18:56.102 --> 19:02.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are carrying this virus
around, what about
that front? Are they able to --
I mean, are

19:02.541 --> 19:09.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they able to project any kind of
precautions
that can be taken? Where are
they on that

19:09.181 --> 19:11.083 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
front?

19:11.183 --> 19:14.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, obviously,
they're telling
pregnant women to be very
careful and to guard

19:14.720 --> 19:19.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
against being bitten by
mosquitoes. It's worth
mentioning that those are the
people. It's

19:19.525 --> 19:23.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the pregnant women and their
babies in utero
that are of concern.

19:23.195 --> 19:26.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When an adult gets bitten by a
mosquito and
gets Zika, four out of five
people don't even

19:26.999 --> 19:31.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know they have had it. So, part
of it is public
education. Part of it is going
through and

19:31.871 --> 19:34.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doing some spraying, which has
limited efficacy.

19:34.106 --> 19:39.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have got 200,000 troops in
the military
knocking on doors, looking for
standing water,

19:40.046 --> 19:43.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but ultimately they're way
outnumbered by
the mosquitoes. We were in a lab
just the

19:43.649 --> 19:49.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other day where they're actually
genetically
engineering mosquitoes, male
mosquitoes, to

19:49.355 --> 19:54.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mate with females, creating
progeny which
will die very quickly.

19:55.027 --> 20:00.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that kind of clever approach
is part of
putting some tools in the
toolbox to try to

20:00.433 --> 20:03.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
control how mosquitoes are
carrying Zika.

20:03.135 --> 20:09.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, meantime,
finally, Miles,
warnings going out to women and
to men about

20:09.875 --> 20:11.644 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the dangers of this virus.

20:11.744 --> 20:16.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: You know, Judy,
it's really
a heartbreaking scenario, how
this cropped

20:16.949 --> 20:21.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up. It's dangerous and it caught
public health
officials by surprise.

20:21.554 --> 20:31.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, I was with a mother with
a 2-month-old
son who is drastically affected
by this microcephaly.

20:31.664 --> 20:39.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it means a lifelong problem
of disability
and care for this now
2-month-old child of

20:39.939 --> 20:47.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hers. And so it's -- the danger
cannot be
understated for pregnant women.
And that set

20:47.379 --> 20:51.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against this Carnival offers up
quite a contrast
this year.

20:51.617 --> 20:54.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's
heartbreaking. It's
frightening.

20:55.054 --> 20:58.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, Miles, I know we look
forward to the
reporting that you're doing down
there. And

20:58.591 --> 21:00.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we will be having that in the
days to come.

21:00.693 --> 21:03.462 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Miles O'Brien, we thank you.

21:03.562 --> 21:12.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: You're welcome,
Judy.

21:12.304 --> 21:20.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As we reported
earlier, a new
wave of refugees is being forced
from Syria

21:20.846 --> 21:23.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as the war rages in the north.

21:23.315 --> 21:29.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But west of Syria, Lebanon is
now hosting
more than one million Syrians.
Many live in

21:29.188 --> 21:34.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
desperate conditions. Others are
looking toward
Europe. Some still dream of
home. But amid

21:34.994 --> 21:38.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the crisis, there is some good
fortune.

21:38.164 --> 21:41.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Jane
Ferguson reports
from Beirut.

21:41.367 --> 21:47.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Running a bakery
is not something
Abdul Halim is used to. Only a
few months

21:47.339 --> 21:53.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago, he was destitute, just
another refugee
from Syria escaping deadly
violence threatening

21:53.879 --> 21:55.581 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his family.

21:55.681 --> 22:01.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His marriage broke down in Syria
and his wife
left him to look after their two
children.

22:01.320 --> 22:06.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He fled the war to neighboring
Lebanon and
found himself penniless,
struggling to survive

22:06.592 --> 22:10.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the streets of Beirut as a
single father.

22:10.863 --> 22:17.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"I tried to look for work, but
no one would
give me a job because I had my
kids with me,"

22:17.303 --> 22:22.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he says. "I walked the streets
and saw there
were schools and a lot of
students, so I thought

22:22.775 --> 22:27.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the best thing I could do was to
sell pens.
I went and bought a box of pens.
And I left

22:28.013 --> 22:32.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my son at home. And I took my
daughter, who
was this small. And I would
carry her. What

22:32.918 --> 22:36.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could I do? There was nowhere I
could put
her."

22:36.155 --> 22:42.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What happened next was
extraordinary. Someone
saw Abdul Halim selling his pens
in the hot

22:42.461 --> 22:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
summer sunshine, his daughter
Reem in his
arms, and posted this picture on
Twitter.

22:48.400 --> 22:53.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It went viral, and soon there
was a campaign
to raise money for him, using
the hashtag

22:53.239 --> 23:03.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
#buypens. Its organizers hoped
to raise $5,000.
In the end, they got over
$190,000.

23:03.382 --> 23:13.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, with that money, he bought
a bakery,
sandwich shop and a small
restaurant, and

23:13.659 --> 23:21.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
employs 20 men, all Syrian
refugees supporting
their families. His son even
helps out.

23:21.667 --> 23:27.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"My children's lives changed,"
he tells us.
"We were living in a room that
was uninhabitable.

23:28.007 --> 23:33.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now we live in a house with
four rooms.
I have furnished it nicely. My
son goes to

23:33.245 --> 23:38.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
school. My daughter is looked
after and is
learning. And I have three shops
and I'm working.

23:38.617 --> 23:41.854 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My life has changed totally."

23:41.954 --> 23:47.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Abdul Halim is extremely lucky.
Most Syrians
struggle to pay for the rising
cost of living

23:47.226 --> 23:55.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
here on tiny wages. Until
recently, Ahmed
Kaju worked in the bakery. But
$10 a day didn't

23:55.467 --> 24:00.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pay the rent. He now feels he
must make a
desperate choice.

24:00.806 --> 24:06.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
"I want to go to Germany,
because they say
the living is good and that they
want to help

24:06.645 --> 24:12.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Syrians," he said. So, I
will go just
like everybody else, to Turkey
and from Turkey

24:13.052 --> 24:13.852 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Greece.

24:13.952 --> 24:15.688 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
In a boat?

24:15.788 --> 24:20.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AHMED KAJU, Refugee (through
translator):
Yes, in a boat to Greece, and
from there,

24:20.225 --> 24:22.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we will continue with everybody
else.

24:22.628 --> 24:24.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: With your family?

24:24.963 --> 24:28.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AHMED KAJU (through translator):
With my family,
my son and my daughter.

24:28.434 --> 24:31.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: But it's very
dangerous.

24:31.236 --> 24:35.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AHMED KAJU (through translator):
But I'm dying
here. I might as well die there.
It's the

24:35.774 --> 24:39.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
same in the end. Let me die
trying.

24:39.578 --> 24:46.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: We traveled
across town to
the impoverished neighborhood of
Bourj el-Barajneh,

24:46.819 --> 24:51.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where we met another Syrian
refugee family
hoping to make it to Europe
soon.

24:52.091 --> 24:58.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jinan Jamal's husband survived
the dangerous
boat journey from Turkey four
months ago.

24:58.931 --> 25:04.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She stayed behind with their
three young boys.
Now in Germany, her husband is
trying to get

25:04.403 --> 25:10.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
asylum for Jinan and the
children. Six months
pregnant and living on debt, she
is desperate

25:11.009 --> 25:12.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to join her husband.

25:12.945 --> 25:22.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
"Honestly, I have no more
strength. I'm tired,"
she tells us. "Sometimes, I put
my kids to

25:22.154 --> 25:28.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bed and when they sleep, I look
at them and
I cry. I don't care about
myself. I care about

25:28.260 --> 25:33.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my kids and how they are living.
There is
nobody to help me. My parents
are dead. There

25:33.932 --> 25:54.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is nowhere I can go. All I want
to do is to
join my husband."

25:54.219 --> 25:59.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But life is even tougher for
refugees living
outside Beirut. Providing
crucial services

25:59.792 --> 26:05.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to many of them is the charity
Mercy Corps.
They took us to the Bekaa
Valley, where thousands

26:05.197 --> 26:10.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Syrians scratch out a living
in the countryside
along Lebanon's border with
Syria.

26:10.436 --> 26:15.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People who cross over from Syria
here to try
to escape the fighting, who end
up living

26:15.407 --> 26:16.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in tents, that's because they
don't have any
money.

26:16.975 --> 26:20.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Yes, they don't have
money to rent
apartments.

26:20.646 --> 26:26.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Bitter snowstorms
make winter
the worst time of year to be a
refugee.

26:26.885 --> 26:30.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Without aid agencies like
yourselves, what
would happen to those people?

26:30.956 --> 26:36.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: What would happen?
Without aid agencies,
I think that those people would
be not able

26:37.029 --> 26:38.897 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to live.

26:38.997 --> 26:43.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: This is how most
Syrian refugees
survive, in overcrowded camps.
Some of the

26:43.735 --> 26:49.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
families here have lived in
these canvas huts
for years, in the shadow of a
mountain range

26:49.107 --> 26:52.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that separates them from their
home country.

26:52.344 --> 26:58.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many refugees live in camps like
this, just
groups of tents directed here on
farmland.

26:58.317 --> 27:03.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The conditions are absolutely
squalid. In
the summer here, it's hot and
dusty, and in

27:03.989 --> 27:10.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the winter, it's freezing cold
and absolutely
waterlogged.

27:10.195 --> 27:15.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amina Hamadi shares this room
with her sister
and four children. A farmer from
Syria, she

27:15.934 --> 27:20.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wouldn't dream of going to
Europe, she tells
me. She hopes to return one day
to her old

27:20.939 --> 27:22.875 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

27:22.975 --> 27:30.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"There, everybody owned land. We
owned land,"
she says. "We lived off the
land. We planted

27:30.649 --> 27:34.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vegetables and we lived from
it."

27:34.353 --> 27:40.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her husband died three years
ago, and now
the family relies on handouts
from the U.N.

27:40.893 --> 27:46.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's bitterly cold in her tent,
despite the
small stove, but she is
resilient.

27:46.932 --> 27:53.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"A mountain can't move me," she
says. "I have
children that I have to raise. I
need to look

27:54.039 --> 27:57.843 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
after them."

27:57.943 --> 28:04.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her 6-year-old son, Ahmed, shows
us a drawing.
In it, his family are smiling
next to a house.

28:04.683 --> 28:11.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says it is their home in
Syria. Millions
of Syrian children like Ahmed
have only ever

28:11.790 --> 28:19.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
known war, and a hard life as
refugees.

28:19.665 --> 28:25.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The children are saying that
they don't get
to go to school because they
cannot afford

28:26.004 --> 28:31.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get transport to the nearest
school. The
schools here are free, but they
can't get

28:31.643 --> 28:33.512 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

28:33.612 --> 28:37.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syrians around the world each
tell different
stories of suffering,
resilience, and sometimes

28:38.083 --> 28:44.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hope. As the war drags on into
its fifth year,
they will likely have to
continue their lives

28:44.923 --> 28:46.858 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in exile.

28:46.959 --> 29:00.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jane Ferguson, "PBS NewsHour,"
Beirut, Lebanon.

29:00.539 --> 29:08.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now more on
the race for
the White House.

29:08.580 --> 29:13.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we heard, the Democrats
squared off on
the debate stage last night in
New Hampshire.

29:13.218 --> 29:18.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It was one of the most
contentious meetings
in the election cycle so far.
One of the sticking

29:18.323 --> 29:20.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
points, how the candidates would
get things
done.

29:20.626 --> 29:25.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I am not going to make promises
I can't keep.

29:25.631 --> 29:32.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am not going to talk about big
ideas like
single-payer and then not level
with people

29:32.971 --> 29:34.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about how much it will cost.

29:35.040 --> 29:38.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
Now all of the ideas that I'm
talking about,

29:38.777 --> 29:43.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are not radical ideas.
Doing -- making
public colleges and universities
tuition-free,

29:43.615 --> 29:48.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that exists in countries all
over the world,
used to exist in the United
States.

29:48.920 --> 29:53.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that brings
us to the analysis
of Shields and Brooks. That's
syndicated columnist

29:54.026 --> 29:56.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and New York Times
columnist
David Brooks.

29:57.029 --> 29:58.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, gentlemen.

29:58.897 --> 30:02.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is the first time,
Mark, we have
seen the two of them, just the
two of them,

30:02.501 --> 30:04.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the debate stage. What did
you make of
it?

30:04.836 --> 30:09.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I thought they
played their
roles exceedingly well. I mean,
you had the

30:10.042 --> 30:18.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
battle-tested, experienced,
pragmatist concerned
with results against this fresh
new face,

30:18.116 --> 30:22.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
74 years old, the outside
crusader with a
noble cause.

30:22.487 --> 30:24.156 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

30:24.256 --> 30:28.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And I thought each
of them kind
of made their respective case
well.

30:28.860 --> 30:33.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Obviously want to give a
shout-out, quite
honestly, to Chuck Todd and
Rachel Maddow,

30:33.498 --> 30:36.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who I thought did a great job of
moderating,
let them debate.

30:36.735 --> 30:37.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sure.

30:37.869 --> 30:39.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Didn't have
artificial times
imposed.

30:39.771 --> 30:43.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought Hillary Clinton, if
you read the
transcript, I think she comes
across better

30:43.608 --> 30:50.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than she does in person. And
what is missing,
there's great factual command,
but there's

30:50.916 --> 30:56.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
nothing inspirational or
aspirational about
her candidacy at this point. And
I think that's

30:56.354 --> 30:58.156 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
missing.

30:58.256 --> 31:04.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie is a lot of inspiration,
and he's excited.
Democrats are a glandular party.
They like

31:04.629 --> 31:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to love to fall in love. And an
awful lot
of them have fallen in love with
Bernie.

31:08.366 --> 31:10.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Glandular party?

31:10.202 --> 31:11.403 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

31:11.503 --> 31:14.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I'm not going
to explore
that metaphor.

31:14.706 --> 31:19.644 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)
DAVID BROOKS: You know, he does
have passion
and he has got policies. He's
the most predictable

31:19.745 --> 31:23.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidate imaginable. He will
talk about Wall
Street, but then he will talk
about his policies,

31:23.715 --> 31:27.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
free college education -- a
terrible idea,
by the way, good way to
subsidize the affluent

31:27.853 --> 31:30.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- but, still, it's a policy.

31:30.322 --> 31:34.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The health thing is a policy.
The attack on
Wall Street, it is a policy.
What has -- Clinton,

31:34.359 --> 31:37.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of course she has policies. She
has got white
papers written somewhere in the
campaign,

31:37.829 --> 31:44.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but what is her main thing on
the -- when
she's talking? It's a process. I
can get things

31:44.402 --> 31:47.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
done in a certain way. It's more
gradualist.

31:47.939 --> 31:53.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, who's marching to the flag
of gradualism?
And so I think, rhetorically,
there is a disadvantage

31:53.979 --> 31:58.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there, that he's got substance
and she's got
a process.

31:58.650 --> 32:05.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, frankly, I do think, if
you're just a
random voter, that's not just
campaign style.

32:05.123 --> 32:09.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You look at her record in -- as
secretary
of state, well, she had a lot of
process,

32:09.561 --> 32:12.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but what vision did she actually
bring to
the job? This has always been
the knock on

32:12.430 --> 32:14.232 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
her as secretary.

32:14.332 --> 32:16.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you got to think, well, is
this just part
of who she would be as
president? So, it's

32:16.868 --> 32:18.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not just style. It goes to
something substantive
as well.

32:18.804 --> 32:22.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He went after
her, Mark, on
a number of things, but we heard
on Wall Street.

32:22.574 --> 32:26.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He said her Wall Street
connections, that
she's not enough of a
progressive. How did

32:26.344 --> 32:28.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
she hold up, stand up to that?

32:28.580 --> 32:32.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I don't think she
has an answer,
Judy, quite honestly.

32:32.717 --> 32:37.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, she showed her
independence. She has
defied him or challenged him to
show a vote

32:37.455 --> 32:41.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
where she had changed her
policy, she had
changed because of her
contributions. But

32:41.993 --> 32:45.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's a mystery to people close
to Hillary
Clinton, to her campaign, strong
supporters

32:46.097 --> 32:52.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of her, who was separated in
2000 from the
Clinton Foundation, from all
that outside

32:52.270 --> 32:56.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fund-raising, when she became a
United States
senator, went to the secretary
of state's

32:56.675 --> 33:02.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
job, and all the way through
2013, she was
insulated and isolated from some
of the mishaps

33:02.614 --> 33:06.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or happenings that were going on
at the foundation
and allegations.

33:06.151 --> 33:12.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She comes out. Instead of
remaining pristine,
she plunged into that,
money-making, knowing

33:12.157 --> 33:17.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
full well that it was going to
be raised,
if not -- and it remains a
mystery. And I

33:17.262 --> 33:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't think she does have an
answer. I really
don't. And I think he's tapped
into something

33:21.433 --> 33:23.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's very deep in the
Democratic Party.

33:23.335 --> 33:29.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Democrats are generally
overwhelmingly
disappointed in Barack Obama and
Eric Holder,

33:29.574 --> 33:33.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that nobody, for the millions of
people who
lost their homes in the mortgage
crisis and

33:33.311 --> 33:35.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the banks, that nobody has ever
been held
accountable.

33:35.347 --> 33:37.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you think
she deals
with this Wall Street issue?

33:37.549 --> 33:40.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. Well, early
in the week,
she dealt with it extremely
poorly. That's

33:40.886 --> 33:45.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of the money they offered
me, so I took
it. So, that wasn't good, and
scarcely better

33:45.557 --> 33:47.392 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the debate.

33:47.492 --> 33:51.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so she has to have some
answer. They're
going to ask her to release the
transcripts

33:51.329 --> 33:55.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the remarks. I guarantee you
or I strongly
suspect she will never do that,
because she

33:55.667 --> 33:58.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
probably said some nice things
about the audience
who were paying her so much
money. I do not

33:59.037 --> 34:04.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
believe it has influenced her
votes. So I
think she's right about that.

34:04.609 --> 34:08.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it doesn't look good. The
weird thing
about the Democratic Party now
is that Wall

34:08.246 --> 34:13.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Street has become the center of
evil in the
country. Now, I didn't like what
happened

34:13.351 --> 34:19.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 2008. I think that fees these
hedge funds
charge are crazy, especially
given their performance.

34:19.324 --> 34:26.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the problems of the middle
class are caused
by technological change and
globalization.

34:26.765 --> 34:33.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're not primarily caused by
Wall Street.
And creating this boogeyman, as
Sanders does,

34:33.271 --> 34:38.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as Wall Street, that is the
wrong problem.
And he's creating a false
narrative, which

34:38.443 --> 34:41.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just is an economic reality of
why we have
wage stagnation and inequality
and all the

34:42.047 --> 34:43.882 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rest.

34:43.982 --> 34:46.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Mark, what
about him going
after her, we have heard
different iterations

34:46.718 --> 34:50.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this, that she's just not
truly progressive
enough, that she's part of
the...

34:50.588 --> 34:54.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, I don't think
that a lot
of Democrats spend time about
arguing whether

34:54.960 --> 34:57.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you're progressive or
un-progressive or whatever.

34:58.096 --> 35:02.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has a record of -- the thing
is that,
to some degree, she's almost
like the incumbent,

35:03.068 --> 35:08.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy. For 25 years, she's been
going to New
Hampshire. But her
identification with children's

35:08.440 --> 35:11.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
issues, family issues is deep
and strong.

35:11.309 --> 35:16.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I really do think that this
is -- David
makes the case on technological
change and

35:17.015 --> 35:22.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so forth. But, I mean, I think
the reaction
to the mortgage crisis was, this
is a terrible

35:22.153 --> 35:26.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thing. We must find the people
who did it
and give them billions of
dollars.

35:26.691 --> 35:31.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, that was basically the
response. And
I think there is a -- just a
simmering anger

35:31.663 --> 35:37.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that remains presently in the
electorate that
he has tied in to. The advantage
he has is

35:37.669 --> 35:41.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he knows exactly what he
believes. He
has said the said thing for so
long. He's

35:41.406 --> 35:43.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
never going to be tripped up. I
mean, he's
totally consistent.

35:43.708 --> 35:49.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And she goes
after him, as
we heard, David, for just having
these pie-in-the-sky

35:49.547 --> 35:51.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ideas that he can never carry
out.

35:51.816 --> 35:54.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, I think
she's right about
that. I think they're
unaffordable.

35:55.086 --> 35:59.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Washington Post had a good
editorial on
how unaffordable a lot of these
things are.

35:59.557 --> 36:03.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And unless he can sweep the
House of Representatives
and get 60 votes in the Senate,
he has no

36:04.062 --> 36:05.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
implementation strategy.

36:05.930 --> 36:09.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, does she have one? That's
an interesting
question. You could argue that
maybe. But

36:09.667 --> 36:14.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not sure she has a better
implementation
strategy anyway either. It's not
as if the

36:14.172 --> 36:17.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clintons are non-polarizing.
They are polarizing
figures.

36:17.809 --> 36:24.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she surely has a better shot
of an implementation
strategy than Bernie Sanders or
Ted Cruz.

36:24.549 --> 36:30.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it's tough to hear any
of these candidates
give you a plausible story about
how their

36:30.455 --> 36:32.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agendas could possibly get
passed in this
climate.

36:32.624 --> 36:34.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's talk about
the Republicans.

36:34.959 --> 36:40.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming out of Iowa, Mark, Ted
Cruz gets a
big lift, but it is said that
New Hampshire

36:40.331 --> 36:42.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is not great political territory
for him.

36:42.867 --> 36:47.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No. One-third as
many New Hampshire
voters are evangelical voters,
self-identified,

36:48.039 --> 36:52.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as there are in Iowa. In other
words, there
are three times as large a
percentage in Iowa.

36:52.510 --> 36:57.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And New Hampshire is a -- call
it non-religious,
irreligious. Religion doesn't
play a central

36:57.582 --> 37:02.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
role. And I think he's been on
the defensive
ever since Iowa because of the
dirty tricks,

37:02.954 --> 37:07.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or whatever you want to call
them, toward
Ben Carson. And somebody that,
as a part of

37:07.559 --> 37:15.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his basic speech, says we must
raise up the
body of Christ in his rallying
cry, I mean,

37:15.366 --> 37:18.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this raises a charge of a little
hypocrisy
or inconsistency.

37:18.970 --> 37:24.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will be fascinated to see if
Ben Carson
in Saturday night's debate uses
his time to

37:24.542 --> 37:30.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reprimand and censure Ted Cruz
and the tactics
he sued. So, Cruz has now just
said they're

37:31.049 --> 37:34.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not going to spend more time and
effort and
resources in New Hampshire.

37:34.986 --> 37:39.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Ted Cruz, and
then we look
at Donald Trump, who, David, was
leading in

37:39.390 --> 37:45.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iowa, came in a pretty distant
-- well, four
or five points behind. The air
came out of

37:45.530 --> 37:47.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some of that balloon. Where does
he go next?

37:47.465 --> 37:49.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

37:49.400 --> 37:51.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, he, of course, missed the
day today
because he can't afford to stay
in New Hampshire,

37:51.202 --> 37:55.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
apparently. He can't afford the
hotels there
and has to stay at home in New
York.

37:55.440 --> 37:56.608 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:56.708 --> 37:59.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: He's magnifying, I
think, his
weaknesses.

37:59.477 --> 38:03.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of the things he said and
some of the
things he's tweeted, saying I
actually would

38:03.248 --> 38:08.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have won Iowa, but Cruz cheated,
that's not
-- that's unnerving. That's not
the way you

38:08.253 --> 38:12.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
react to a defeat. And so I
think if people
had any doubts about his
stability, as Lisa

38:12.824 --> 38:16.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said, with the nuclear trigger,
this sort
of magnifies it.

38:16.227 --> 38:20.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With Cruz, we saw the guy has an
iron wall
around him. He has extremely
conservative

38:20.765 --> 38:24.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters locked down. But it's
very hard for
him to reach out to anybody
else. There is

38:24.702 --> 38:29.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just an iron wall separating him
from moderate
voters, from other kinds of
Republicans.

38:29.674 --> 38:34.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, if you look at the
post-Iowa polls
in New Hampshire, you see Cruz
dipping a little

38:34.345 --> 38:40.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- I mean, Trump dipping a
little, Rubio rising
a lot, so he now looks like the
alternative,

38:40.818 --> 38:44.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then Cruz getting no bounce
because of
that wall around him.

38:45.023 --> 38:48.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I want to ask
you about
Rubio in a minute.

38:48.193 --> 38:54.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Mark, do I hear you -- both
of you saying
that Trump really -- it's hard
for Trump to

38:54.632 --> 38:56.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
find some kind of footing in New
Hampshire?

38:56.401 --> 38:59.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I mean, he's
enjoyed a
large lead in all the public
opinion polls

39:00.071 --> 39:01.306 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up until now.

39:01.406 --> 39:02.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

39:02.307 --> 39:04.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I don't know,
Judy.

39:04.242 --> 39:06.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Someone who predicates it on,
I'm a winner
and the people on the other side
are losers,

39:06.811 --> 39:12.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then doesn't win, that's
what he was selling,
there was something special
about him. And

39:12.884 --> 39:17.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know. I think the debate
Saturday
night, not to put all the --
everything into

39:18.022 --> 39:21.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, but I think it's going to
be a test
of him and policies.

39:21.526 --> 39:23.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tomorrow night.

39:23.494 --> 39:27.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: I mean, for
example, in an interview
with Anderson Cooper, he said we
-- the United

39:27.632 --> 39:29.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
States gave Iran $150 billion.

39:30.068 --> 39:35.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, now, the United States
didn't give
Iran. That was -- it was Iran's
money, its

39:35.640 --> 39:43.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
assets that had been frozen. But
his real
holes on policy matters, I
think, are a real

39:43.381 --> 39:51.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problem for him. And, you know,
I don't know.
If Rubio were to finish first in
New Hampshire,

39:51.222 --> 39:56.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it basically propels him
in a remarkable
fashion.

39:56.961 --> 40:00.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, what is
this magic, David,
that Rubio seems to have caught?

40:00.832 --> 40:06.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, by the way, we have got
these other three
well-known establishment
candidates, John

40:06.237 --> 40:12.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kasich, Chris Christie, Jeb
Bush, who finished
way back in Iowa, but are still
trying really

40:12.610 --> 40:14.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hard to show up in New
Hampshire.

40:14.612 --> 40:16.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

40:16.514 --> 40:18.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're trying hard, but what
happened, what
the Iowa result has done is
given Rubio some

40:18.383 --> 40:21.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
distance between him and the
others. And so
he seems like the alternative.
And I think,

40:22.053 --> 40:25.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the other three, if they
don't tie or
beat him, then I don't see any
justification

40:25.790 --> 40:29.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for their continued campaigns,
which is not
how they're talking, but I think
that's just

40:30.094 --> 40:31.829 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the reality.

40:31.929 --> 40:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rubio has gotten a nice bump.
He's a good
communicator. And the important
thing is,

40:35.633 --> 40:37.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's acceptable to all parts of
the party.

40:37.135 --> 40:38.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

40:38.703 --> 40:41.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And so he ran --
we forget,
he ran as a Tea Party candidate.

40:41.205 --> 40:42.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

40:42.507 --> 40:44.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And so -- but now
he's seen
as Mr. Moderate.

40:44.375 --> 40:49.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he's -- I think he's the
77th most -- he's
in the 77th percentile of
conservatism in

40:49.914 --> 40:54.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Republican Congress, so he's
more conservative
than the average congressional
Republican,

40:54.619 --> 40:56.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which is -- means he's pretty
conservative.

40:56.521 --> 41:01.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he's acceptable to all
sides. He has a
nice disposition. We will see,
as Mark says,

41:01.292 --> 41:05.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the debate, when he gets
attacked from
all quarters, how he handles it.

41:05.196 --> 41:08.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Forty-five
seconds, Mark. What
about these other -- these four,
Rubio, but

41:09.000 --> 41:10.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the other three who are trying
to catch up?

41:10.468 --> 41:12.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Sure.

41:12.370 --> 41:15.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rubio is the closest thing to
Jimmy Carter
in 1976 I have seen, in the
sense that he's

41:15.573 --> 41:19.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
an incredibly disciplined
candidate, just
as Carter was. He's on message.
He's running

41:19.711 --> 41:25.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on biography. And he's broadly
acceptable
to all the elements in his own
party. And

41:25.550 --> 41:32.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he also -- there is implicit
electability,
and that -- which is Bernie
Sanders' Achilles'

41:32.156 --> 41:33.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
heel at this point, quite
honestly.

41:34.058 --> 41:39.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The others, I mean, this is it.
You remember
Jon Huntsman made his fight in
2012. Unless

41:39.964 --> 41:45.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of them breaks through and
almost closes
to the third or fourth, I don't
think any

41:45.837 --> 41:49.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of them expects to be second at
this point.
And I think it's going to be
tough to go on,

41:49.774 --> 41:51.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
especially if Rubio gets the
bounce.

41:51.843 --> 41:54.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I remember
one of these
people at the table -- maybe
both of you -- speaking

41:54.879 --> 41:57.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the name Rubio even some time
ago.

41:57.915 --> 42:00.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will see. Just a few nights
to go, New
Hampshire, and both of you are
going to be

42:00.985 --> 42:02.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with us Tuesday night.

42:02.820 --> 42:07.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thank you, David Brooks, Mark
Shields.

42:07.625 --> 42:11.462 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you, Judy.

42:11.562 --> 42:20.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next, in case
you're been asleep,
this is Super Bowl weekend. The
heavily favored

42:20.638 --> 42:26.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carolina Panthers will face off
against the
Denver Broncos on Sunday for
football's biggest

42:26.711 --> 42:27.412 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
prize.

42:27.512 --> 42:29.280 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has our story.

42:29.380 --> 42:34.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A TV audience
of well over
100 million is expected to tune
in to see

42:34.285 --> 42:38.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the Carolina Panthers
quarterback Cam Newton
go head-to-head with sentimental
favorite

42:38.856 --> 42:41.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Peyton Manning leading the
Denver Broncos.

42:41.492 --> 42:46.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both teams spent this week in
preparations.
The game caps a season of big
rivalries, bigger

42:46.931 --> 42:49.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
setbacks and some surprise
comebacks.

42:50.034 --> 42:54.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a new book, "This Is Your
Brain on Sports,"
"Sports Illustrated"'s executive
editor, Jon

42:54.639 --> 42:59.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wertheim, along with co-author
Sam Sommers
of Tufts University, explore the
psychology

42:59.410 --> 43:02.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and behavior of sports teams and
their fans.

43:02.380 --> 43:04.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For a closer look, Jon Wertheim
joins me now.

43:04.282 --> 43:06.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, "This Is Your Brain on
Sports," why the
book?

43:06.350 --> 43:08.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON WERTHEIM, Author, "This Is
Your Brain
on Sports": We all love sports.

43:08.352 --> 43:12.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is so much that goes on in
sports, it
seems irrational or
counterintuitive. And

43:12.924 --> 43:16.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we dismiss that these are just
sort of -- these
are the rules of the road of
sports. And we

43:16.494 --> 43:20.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wanted to dig a little and say,
what really
explains -- what are the
underpinnings, everything

43:20.431 --> 43:24.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the crazy T-shirt cannon
that we go crazy
about, to the fact that teams
seem to elevate

43:24.902 --> 43:26.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
when there's a rivalry?

43:26.771 --> 43:29.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is really going on here?
What is the
human behavior? What is the
psychology? What

43:29.640 --> 43:30.842 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is going on here?

43:30.942 --> 43:32.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Let's talk a
little bit
about rivalries.

43:32.844 --> 43:36.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The likelihood is that this
might be one of
Peyton Manning's last days. So,
it's not a

43:36.113 --> 43:40.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Peyton vs. Cam rivalry. But,
sometimes, when
two teams get together at the
Super Bowl,

43:40.718 --> 43:44.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's a much bigger deal for
entire cities
and fans. Why is that?

43:44.989 --> 43:48.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON WERTHEIM: Rivalry is one of
these essential
elements of sports.

43:48.326 --> 43:52.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what the research says is
that there really
is a difference in performance a
run-of-the-mill

43:52.797 --> 43:57.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
game vs. a rivalry team.
Physiologically,
athletes in a rivalry game,
testosterone levels

43:57.401 --> 44:01.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are different. Saliva levels are
different.
These scores tend to be closer.

44:01.372 --> 44:05.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is true in life too.
There are all
sorts of studies. You put kids
alone to take

44:05.643 --> 44:09.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the SAT and then you put them in
a room with
other kids, and they will score
better when

44:09.480 --> 44:11.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there are other kids in the
room.

44:11.415 --> 44:15.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we bid on eBay, if it's
just us, we bid
one way. If we have a rival, it
may only be

44:15.553 --> 44:20.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a code name, an eBay sign-in
name, our bidding
patterns change. So, rivalry
really does -- it's

44:20.291 --> 44:22.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of hyper-competition that
really changes
performance.

44:22.860 --> 44:27.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the
elements of pressure
that a lot of people don't think
about during

44:27.565 --> 44:33.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Super Bowl is the pressure
that is on
the coaches on the sidelines.
And you kind

44:33.638 --> 44:37.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of point out that the Denver
coach is a relatively
new one. The one before that
Denver coach

44:38.042 --> 44:40.578 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was a pretty darn good one, too.

44:40.678 --> 44:45.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JON WERTHEIM: In the NFL,
especially, Hari,
you have this monstrous
turnover. About three

44:45.149 --> 44:48.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years is the average tenure for
a coach. Remember,
they're only playing 16 games,
so not a lot

44:48.619 --> 44:50.421 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of data points.

44:50.521 --> 44:54.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ron Rivera, Carolina coach, five
years, that
puts him the top quartile for
longevity. And

44:54.625 --> 45:00.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we say, why is this? Why is
there this turnover
of coaches? And what we think is
at play is

45:00.231 --> 45:04.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the action bias, that the
owners, your team
is 8-8, and the fans are saying
make a change,

45:05.069 --> 45:06.804 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you're 9-7.

45:06.904 --> 45:08.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the owners say, you know
what? We have
got to do something. We have got
to make it

45:09.040 --> 45:13.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look like we care. And, again,
this is human
behavior. We do this all the
time. This is

45:13.110 --> 45:18.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why we're too quick to buy and
sell stocks.
This is why physicians sort of
offer too many

45:18.950 --> 45:20.785 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tests.

45:20.885 --> 45:25.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The moral of the story is sort
of don't just
-- stand there, don't just do
something. But

45:25.856 --> 45:28.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what we see is that owners are
very quick
on the trigger and -- exactly.
Denver has

45:28.993 --> 45:30.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a first-year coach in Gary
Kubiak.

45:30.828 --> 45:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Right. And you
said also
that players don't necessarily
-- great players

45:35.766 --> 45:37.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't necessarily make good
coaches.

45:37.802 --> 45:39.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JON WERTHEIM: Right.

45:39.770 --> 45:43.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's funny. Ron Rivera and
Gary Kubiak
were both NFL players, but they
were not -- these

45:43.608 --> 45:46.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are not Pro Bowlers, just sort
of serviceable
players. And you look at the
best athletes

45:46.844 --> 45:50.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in sports, whether it's Michael
Jordan, or
whether it's Wayne Gretzky, not
great careers

45:51.082 --> 45:52.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as coaches and assessors of
talent.

45:53.084 --> 45:57.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, why is that? And what we
discovered
is there's something called the
curse of expertise.

45:57.154 --> 46:01.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you get so good at a task,
you skip steps,
and part of the problem with
that is, it becomes

46:01.726 --> 46:04.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very hard to articulate what's
going on.

46:04.228 --> 46:09.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, Michael Jordan was a
brilliant basketball
player, but he skipped steps to
get there.

46:09.200 --> 46:13.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And when it came time to
instruct people,
not great idea for a coach. The
same way maybe

46:13.771 --> 46:17.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your kid plays the violin, the
best virtuoso
in the world is probably not the
best violin

46:18.075 --> 46:19.910 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
teacher.

46:20.011 --> 46:22.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we see in sports is that
like guys like
Gary Kubiak and Ron Rivera, who
they played,

46:22.113 --> 46:25.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they didn't pull these guys off
the street,
but they weren't at that top
echelon. They're

46:26.017 --> 46:28.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
actually better able to
articulate what's
going on.

46:28.552 --> 46:32.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And you
mentioned that Jimmy
Connors and Andy Roddick, that
was one of

46:32.456 --> 46:34.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those combinations where he
couldn't figure
out how to tell him to improve
his game.

46:34.859 --> 46:37.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON WERTHEIM: No, the great
Jimmy Connors,
one of the most successful
tennis players

46:37.762 --> 46:40.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ever, and as a coach, it was
fight harder,
hit the ball.

46:40.564 --> 46:44.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For Andy Roddick's next coach,
he ended up
going down a level, player Larry
Stefanki,

46:44.869 --> 46:49.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much less accomplished player
than Jimmy Connors.
He saw the game completely
differently. And,

46:49.106 --> 46:51.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
again, he wasn't afflicted by
this curse of
expertise.

46:51.342 --> 46:54.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK. And there
is this other
thing in the book, and I want to
get to it,

46:54.845 --> 46:57.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is, are quarterbacks better
looking on average?

46:57.782 --> 46:59.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JON WERTHEIM: Great archetype of
sports, right?

47:00.051 --> 47:01.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Why is that?

47:01.986 --> 47:06.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JON WERTHEIM: No, the
quarterbacks, whether
it's Tom Brady and Cam Newton,
for that matter,

47:06.624 --> 47:09.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the highest level, or whether
it's the
high school quarterback who
dates the cheerleader,

47:09.960 --> 47:12.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have this idea in our head
that the quarterbacks
are the best looking guys.

47:13.097 --> 47:17.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we actually devised an
experiment. My
collaborator, Sam Sommers,
experimental psychologist,

47:18.035 --> 47:22.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
devised an experiment, where we
actually tested
that and sort of in a blind
taste test assessed

47:23.040 --> 47:26.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the looks of different players
by positions.
And quarterbacks actually ranked
towards the

47:26.744 --> 47:28.646 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bottom.

47:28.746 --> 47:31.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So why is it we have this
archetype of quarterback
as good looking? And there are a
lot of factors,

47:31.215 --> 47:35.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but we think some of it is,
we're conflating
other qualities, right? This is
the face of

47:35.820 --> 47:40.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the franchise. This is the
leader. This is
one of the most important
positions in sports.

47:40.124 --> 47:44.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we do, it's called the
halo effect,
where we have qualities that we
like in someone

47:44.328 --> 47:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and we conflate all sorts of
other qualities.
So, we like Peyton Manning, and
suddenly he

47:48.566 --> 47:50.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
becomes good looking in our
eyes.

47:50.334 --> 47:52.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Jon
Wertheim,
co-author, along with Sam
Sommers. The book

47:52.803 --> 47:55.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is called "This Is Your Brain on
Sports."
Thanks so much.

47:55.773 --> 48:05.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JON WERTHEIM: Thanks, Hari. It
was fun.

48:05.850 --> 48:12.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
we pause for
a "PBS NewsHour" essay.

48:12.623 --> 48:17.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeff Greenfield is a seasoned
political journalist
and author, and he shares his
belief about

48:17.962 --> 48:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the end of trust by Americans in
this country's
institutions.

48:22.066 --> 48:25.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Greenfield has titled his essay
"In Nothing
We Trust."

48:25.703 --> 48:29.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF GREENFIELD, Journalist:
It's not exactly
breaking news that we're
entering this political

48:29.573 --> 48:32.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
high season in the winter of our
discontent.

48:32.510 --> 48:37.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The polls and the political
rhetoric speak
to a mood of anger, distrust,
even outright

48:37.782 --> 48:43.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
betrayal. But take a look beyond
the political
realm, and you will find
something that runs

48:43.320 --> 48:47.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
longer than the current
campaign, and deeper
than politics.

48:47.491 --> 48:52.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The unhappy fact is that
Americans' trust
in just about all our
institutions has been

48:52.963 --> 48:59.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a long, almost unbroken
decline. Our trust
in government? A Pew Research
poll last November

48:59.804 --> 49:05.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
found that only 19 percent of us
trusted the
government to do what was right
all or most

49:05.442 --> 49:09.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the time. That's close to an
historic low.

49:09.246 --> 49:17.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the real story here is how
long that distrust
has been festering. Go back to
1964, when

49:17.855 --> 49:23.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.S. was in the midst of a
long period
of economic growth, when the
Cold War was

49:23.394 --> 49:27.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
easing, when a major civil
rights bill had
just been passed.

49:27.665 --> 49:33.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back then, 77 percent trusted
the government
to do the right thing all or
most of the time.

49:33.604 --> 49:40.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A decade later, after a divisive
war, racial
and generational unrest, a
president driven

49:40.511 --> 49:46.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from office in scandal, the
number had dropped
to 36 percent. And in the four
decades since,

49:46.617 --> 49:52.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it has never hit 50 percent, not
even in the
surge of patriotism after 9/11.

49:52.423 --> 49:58.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's about 40 years' worth of
alienation
from the government of, by and
for people.

49:58.562 --> 50:03.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Well, OK, but that's the
government. We are
a nation born in revolt, with a
permanent

50:03.801 --> 50:10.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
skepticism about our leaders.
But now look
at our feelings about other
major institutions,

50:10.207 --> 50:15.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the picture, painted by a
series of Gallup
surveys going back decades,
finds a disturbingly

50:15.613 --> 50:17.381 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
similar pattern.

50:17.481 --> 50:22.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our churches? Two-thirds of us
had a lot of
trust in our religious
institutions back in

50:22.152 --> 50:32.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1973. Now barely 42 percent do.
Banks? Trust
has gone from 60 percent back in
1979 to 28

50:32.129 --> 50:37.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
percent now. Our public schools?
More than
half were trusting at the end of
the '70s.

50:38.035 --> 50:40.237 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Barely three in 10 are today.

50:40.337 --> 50:46.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Organized labor? Big business?
The medical
system? The presidency? All get
low grades.

50:46.277 --> 50:51.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And before you ask, 21 percent
profess a lot
of faith in television news,
less than half

50:52.049 --> 50:55.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the percentage that did so
little more than
20 years ago.

50:55.152 --> 51:00.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Other than the military, the
police, and small
business, no institution
commands the trust

51:00.791 --> 51:05.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a majority of us, and even
those are less
trusted than they once were.

51:05.663 --> 51:12.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, the question is, why? One
obvious answer,
there's good reason for this
mistrust. How

51:12.403 --> 51:17.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
confident should we be in banks
after the
financial meltdown, in our
public schools,

51:17.274 --> 51:23.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
given the woeful marks our
students get compared
with other nations, in our
religious leaders,

51:23.247 --> 51:27.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
given the criminal sexual
behavior of those
who've spoken in God's name?

51:28.018 --> 51:32.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we're also living in a less
innocent time.
The press was strictly
controlled in World

51:32.890 --> 51:38.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
War II. The failures, strategic
and moral,
in places like Iraq, are on full
display.

51:38.963 --> 51:48.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The private lives of
politicians, once carefully
concealed, are now matters of
public speculation.

51:48.172 --> 51:55.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Movies that celebrated heroes of
the church
or finance now tell very
different stories

51:55.512 --> 52:00.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of greed and sin. And the media
messengers
who show us the feet of clay on
those that

52:00.384 --> 52:05.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stand on the pedestals, well,
they are increasingly
seen as carriers of a partisan
agenda, or

52:06.056 --> 52:07.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
guilty of their own failures.

52:07.925 --> 52:13.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, deserved or not, the
lengthy disaffection
that so many feel about so many
important

52:13.497 --> 52:18.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parts of our national life
clearly puts a
heavy burden on anyone asking
for the trust

52:18.969 --> 52:24.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of the citizenry. It may,
indeed, reward those
who seek power, not by offering
to ease that

52:24.775 --> 52:26.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
disaffection, but to feed it.

52:26.844 --> 52:33.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's worth asking, how does
a nation thrive
when, year after year, our motto
is, in nothing

52:33.350 --> 52:34.952 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
we trust?

52:35.052 --> 52:42.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can find
more of our
essays online at
PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:42.359 --> 52:47.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also on the "NewsHour" online
right now, there's
a museum being built underwater
off the Canary

52:47.765 --> 52:53.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Islands. Soon, divers will be
able to visit
the ghostly sculptures, which
offer a stark

52:53.370 --> 52:59.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reminder of Europe's refugee
crisis and, the
artist hopes, inspires viewers
to protect

52:59.443 --> 53:05.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our oceans. All that and more is
on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:06.050 --> 53:09.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And a reminder about some
