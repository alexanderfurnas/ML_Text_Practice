JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight:
A pair of blues greats are
collaborating on a new album

00:05.000 --> 00:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and a North American tour.

00:07.033 --> 00:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have known each other
for decades, but their joint
project has only recently come

00:11.433 --> 00:12.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to fruition.

00:12.866 --> 00:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

00:16.600 --> 00:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The Chautauqua
Auditorium in Boulder, Colorado
recently, at the start of

00:23.566 --> 00:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a new tour by two musicians
who've been doing this a long
time, but never together.

00:32.733 --> 00:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And while it's called the
blues, 75-year-old Taj Mahal and
65-year-old Keb' Mo' are feeling

00:39.333 --> 00:40.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nothing but joy.

00:40.866 --> 00:43.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAJ MAHAL, Musician: That's
what we like about music.

00:43.266 --> 00:46.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's why we do music,
to share the fun.

00:46.733 --> 00:49.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Life brings a lot of strife.

00:49.566 --> 00:51.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In the digital age,
it's even more intense.

00:51.466 --> 00:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And a lot of people don't
know how to get loose of it.

00:54.900 --> 00:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, our job as musicians is to
help them get loose and have a
good time and feel good about

01:01.800 --> 01:03.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
themselves.

01:03.833 --> 01:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Born Henry Saint
Clair Fredericks, Taj Mahal is
a living legend in the world

01:09.733 --> 01:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of roots and blues music, a
singer-songwriter who plays
many instruments and draws from

01:14.433 --> 01:19.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
many musical influences.

01:21.366 --> 01:25.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Kevin Moore, Keb' Mo''s
given name, spent many
years in various R&amp;B,
rock, and pop bands,

01:27.766 --> 01:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
until he went out on his own
in the early 1990s and focused
on his first love, the blues,

01:33.800 --> 01:36.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
gaining renown as
a master guitarist,
singer, and songwriter.

01:36.766 --> 01:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEB' MO', Musician: It was
like a missing piece that
made everything relevant.

01:43.833 --> 01:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what I did was, I took all
of those things that I had been
doing before, those experiences,

01:48.333 --> 01:52.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
took the blues and
wrapped it in there.

01:52.633 --> 01:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And what came out was Keb' Mo'.

01:56.700 --> 02:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, together,
they are TajMo, the name of
their new album, which features

02:07.866 --> 02:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
several songs they co-wrote,
including "Don't Leave Me Here."

02:18.133 --> 02:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On "Take a Giant Step," one
of Taj Mahal's earlier songs,
they were joined on stage by

02:26.733 --> 02:31.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his daughters.

02:33.733 --> 02:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then there was the more raw
acoustic duet of "Diving Duck
Blues," a song that Taj Mahal

02:43.633 --> 02:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first recorded on his
debut album back in 1968.

02:46.466 --> 02:51.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have heard you for a
long time, blues, folk,
world music, I mean,
different kinds of elements,

03:09.700 --> 03:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
different kind of influences.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAJ MAHAL: My grandparents
come from the Caribbean.

03:13.133 --> 03:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I grew up listening to Caribbean
music, as much as I listened
to the Southern gospel.

03:16.733 --> 03:18.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My dad liked bebop.

03:18.666 --> 03:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had bebop and jazz, and
jump blues, you know, and
spirituals, and classical music,

03:24.800 --> 03:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
opera, everything, you know?

03:26.633 --> 03:30.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, it's like it didn't
hurt me because I
heard all those things.

03:30.933 --> 03:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It didn't take away from -- if
I heard a real deep blues song,
I don't care how much ragtime

03:37.033 --> 03:39.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I listen to, that
song's going to get me.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's going to get somebody
else too, if they get
a chance to hear it.

03:42.900 --> 03:47.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KEB' MO': It's a
beautiful -- the beauty
in it is just so deep.

03:49.766 --> 03:52.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I heard the old Muddy
Waters stuff, but, wait a
minute, now, that's what it is.

03:52.933 --> 03:56.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I could feel the slave
ship coming over the ocean.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TAJ MAHAL: Yes.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KEB' MO': I could feel the
Jim Crow, the cotton-picking.

04:00.766 --> 04:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I could feel the sense of
pride welling up in a man out
of his own circumstances, that

04:07.633 --> 04:11.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he had to rise up out of a
challenging circumstance of
Jim Crow and slavery and stuff.

04:12.933 --> 04:15.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I hear all of that.

04:15.166 --> 04:17.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that resonates universally.

04:17.266 --> 04:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But what you
two have managed to do is make
a life of this, right, without

04:23.966 --> 04:24.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
worrying about
the commercialism?

04:24.966 --> 04:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEB' MO': Yes, commercialism.

04:27.033 --> 04:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's something working in
life and in the universe in the
bigger picture that has nothing

04:32.466 --> 04:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to do with commerce and money.

04:34.666 --> 04:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, for me, I found that after
20 years going after money, that
the faster I ran after money,

04:43.366 --> 04:45.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the faster the money ran.

04:45.066 --> 04:46.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

04:46.066 --> 04:47.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

04:47.066 --> 04:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That sounds like a blues song.

04:48.466 --> 04:53.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAJ MAHAL: Yes, yes, the
faster I run after the money...

04:53.766 --> 04:55.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

04:55.833 --> 04:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEB' MO': And so I finally
just got out of breath and
stopped -- stopped running.

05:01.300 --> 05:02.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

05:02.933 --> 05:05.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, of
course, neither of them
has stopped playing.

05:05.833 --> 05:09.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Together, the sound
they're creating is both
upbeat and uplifting.

05:09.800 --> 05:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAJ MAHAL: Did we know
what it was going to
sound like at this point?

05:13.166 --> 05:14.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

05:14.633 --> 05:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we knew that it was
going to be something good.

05:16.100 --> 05:17.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes, we knew it was going
to be something good.

05:17.466 --> 05:19.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, it could have
gone the other way too.

05:19.233 --> 05:21.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I could have said,
Moore, get out of here.

05:21.900 --> 05:23.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

05:23.133 --> 05:27.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KEB' MO': That's what
I thought might happen.

05:29.266 --> 05:31.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

05:31.266 --> 05:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: As always,
there's the question of how long
the blues will live on and who

05:37.233 --> 05:39.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will take up the mantle.

05:39.400 --> 05:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Taj Mahal and Keb' Mo' are
supremely confident the music
will take care of itself.

05:44.333 --> 05:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KEB' MO': Taking on the blues
is a big responsibility.

05:47.300 --> 05:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I understand why
people would be concerned.

05:49.266 --> 05:52.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the music and riches
is about happiness.

05:52.533 --> 05:54.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The blues will be fine.

05:54.666 --> 05:56.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAJ MAHAL: Disciples?

05:56.400 --> 05:58.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have got plenty of them.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

06:01.000 --> 06:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Taj Mahal and
Keb' Mo', TajMo, are touring the
country throughout the summer

06:08.300 --> 06:09.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and into the fall.

06:09.866 --> 06:14.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Jeffrey Brown in
Boulder, Colorado.

06:16.666 --> 06:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you -- yes,
you -- can watch Taj Mahal
and Keb' Mo' perform "Diving

06:24.233 --> 06:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Duck Blues" on our Web
site at PBS.org/NewsHour.
