JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to another
in our Brief But Spectacular
series, where we ask people

00:02.966 --> 00:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to describe their passions.

00:04.933 --> 00:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from Academy
Award-winning documentary
filmmaker Laura Poitras.

00:06.933 --> 00:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her latest film is "Risk,"
which looks at WikiLeaks
and Julian Assange.

00:08.833 --> 00:10.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAURA POITRAS, Documentary
Filmmaker: It's a bit surprising
that I do documentaries,

00:10.366 --> 00:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because I consider myself
to be a really shy person.

00:12.433 --> 00:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's something about
the documentary form that I
guess it sort of -- it kind of

00:14.400 --> 00:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gives you an invitation, maybe,
to go places you wouldn't go
otherwise or to take risks

00:15.333 --> 00:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you wouldn't take otherwise.

00:22.566 --> 00:27.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
My filmmaking is -- kind
of comes in a tradition
of observational cinema
or cinema verite.

00:29.533 --> 00:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Legendary founders of it
is D.A. Pennebaker, Albert
Maysles, Frederick Wiseman.

00:34.333 --> 00:35.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They capture human stories.

00:35.866 --> 00:37.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They capture drama, and they
capture history as it unfolds.

00:37.966 --> 00:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you talk to people and
who they tell you who they are
is oftentimes different than

00:42.333 --> 00:43.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their actions.

00:43.800 --> 00:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so I'm interested in
people's actions and choices.

00:45.900 --> 00:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, for instance, sitting in a
hotel room with Edward Snowden,
as he's making this monumental

00:53.166 --> 00:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decision to leak this
information, is an example
of the type of cinema
that I'm interested

00:56.000 --> 00:57.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in doing.

00:57.933 --> 01:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The last two films I have
done, "Citizenfour" and
"Risk," I became a participant.

01:00.700 --> 01:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were things that were
happening that were happening
because of work that I was

01:05.300 --> 01:07.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
doing, reporting on the NSA.

01:07.366 --> 01:12.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, if you expose the
deepest levels of intelligence
agencies, they do tend to pay

01:14.333 --> 01:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
attention to what you're doing.

01:16.400 --> 01:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was placed on a government
terrorist watch list in 2006,
and was detained at the U.S.

01:22.066 --> 01:27.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
border for -- probably
50 times, interrogated.

01:28.133 --> 01:29.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have had computers
confiscated.

01:29.500 --> 01:32.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have had notebooks
photocopied.

01:32.200 --> 01:34.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have subpoenaed my records.

01:34.266 --> 01:37.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They would send FBI agents
to my film screenings to
see what I said in Q&amp;As.

01:37.966 --> 01:41.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: There's a filmmaker
named Laura Poitras.

01:41.766 --> 01:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Laura Poitras is known through
the defense community as a
documentary filmmaker who is

01:47.533 --> 01:49.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
anti-U.S.

01:49.633 --> 01:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAURA POITRAS: I became really
interested in WikiLeaks and
Julian Assange in 2010, like

01:53.366 --> 01:58.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of people, first when
they published the video of
Collateral Murder, the Apache

02:00.366 --> 02:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
helicopter footage
that showed killings of
Iraqis, by U.S. military.

02:03.100 --> 02:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And having made a film about
the war in Iraq, I knew that
this was the kind of thing that

02:07.266 --> 02:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was happening every day there.

02:11.233 --> 02:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I reached out to WikiLeaks and
Assange during that time and
then started filming in 2011.

02:18.100 --> 02:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I was interested in how
they were changing journalism.

02:20.633 --> 02:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I had somewhat of a falling out
with him over the film, where
he wanted me not to use scenes

02:27.700 --> 02:29.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the film.

02:29.800 --> 02:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the scenes that Julian
wanted removed from the film
is the scene where his lawyers

02:32.800 --> 02:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are giving him advice about
how to speak publicly of
-- around these allegations
of sexual assault.

02:40.166 --> 02:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIAN ASSANGE, Founder,
WikiLeaks: It's just a
thoroughly tawdry, radical,
feminist, political

02:47.066 --> 02:48.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
positioning thing.

02:48.333 --> 02:50.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's some stereotype.

02:50.700 --> 02:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAURA POITRAS: I still have
enormous respect for, like, the
project of WikiLeaks and its

02:59.133 --> 03:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
importance, because I
think they have done
extraordinary publishing.

03:02.100 --> 03:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm always interested in access.

03:04.133 --> 03:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like -- you know, like, I would
love to have access to Robert
Mueller's investigation into

03:10.200 --> 03:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Donald Trump, or James Comey.

03:12.666 --> 03:17.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But I think those are
going to be pretty tough
to get access to that.

03:17.533 --> 03:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, yes, I'm really looking
forward to like the really good
documentary that's capturing

03:23.700 --> 03:25.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what's happening right
now in our politics.

03:25.300 --> 03:27.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I hope it's being
documented by someone.

03:27.433 --> 03:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My name is Laura Poitras,
and this is my brief take
on documentary filmmaking.

03:35.033 --> 03:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
