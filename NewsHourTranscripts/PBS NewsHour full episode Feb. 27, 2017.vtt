JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:01.700 --> 00:02.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:02.633 --> 00:04.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:04.167 --> 00:05.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: We have to win.

00:05.367 --> 00:07.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have to start
winning wars again.

00:07.300 --> 00:09.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
calls for a budget significantly
boosting money to the

00:09.367 --> 00:12.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
military with deep cuts
to domestic spending.

00:12.967 --> 00:17.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: The Republican chair
of the House Intelligence
Committee says he's seen
no evidence of contact

00:19.733 --> 00:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
between the Trump campaign and
Russian intelligence officials.

00:24.333 --> 00:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And hospitals brace for big
changes in health coverage, as
Republicans work to unravel the

00:30.867 --> 00:32.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Affordable Care Act.

00:32.933 --> 00:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNETTE SCHNABEL, CEO, Perry
Memorial Hospital: We have spent
the last six years gearing up

00:36.200 --> 00:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
towards everything that we were
responsible for doing in the
ACA, and the idea of we might

00:43.200 --> 00:45.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have to totally go a different
direction or how will we do
that, it's going to take a

00:45.633 --> 00:47.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lot of work.

00:47.133 --> 00:49.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:49.567 --> 00:53.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:53.900 --> 00:58.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: More for defense,
less for most domestic programs.

01:06.233 --> 01:10.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's the message from
the White House as it
works up a spending
blueprint for the coming

01:10.967 --> 01:12.367 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

01:12.367 --> 01:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage,
from the White House.

01:14.433 --> 01:18.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Meeting with
the nation's governors
today, President Trump
outlined a spending

01:18.833 --> 01:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plan to fulfill his campaign
promise to dramatically
beef up the Pentagon.

01:22.833 --> 01:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: This budget will
be a public safety and national

01:26.833 --> 01:28.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
security budget.

01:28.933 --> 01:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it will include an historic
increase in defense spending to
rebuild the depleted military

01:34.600 --> 01:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the United States of America
at a time we most need it.

01:38.733 --> 01:40.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:40.867 --> 01:44.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The president wants
to hike defense spending 10
percent, to $603 billion, for

01:46.633 --> 01:49.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the budget year
beginning October 1.

01:49.433 --> 01:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Budget officials said Mr. Trump
will also seek increases for law
enforcement and first-responders

01:54.400 --> 01:56.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and money for the border wall.

01:56.467 --> 02:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We're going to
do more with less and make the
government lean and accountable

02:00.600 --> 02:01.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the people.

02:01.833 --> 02:04.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We can do so much more
with the money we spend.

02:04.633 --> 02:08.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
With $20 trillion in debt,
can you imagine that?

02:08.167 --> 02:13.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The government must learn to
tighten its belt, something
families all across the country

02:14.333 --> 02:16.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have had to learn to
do, unfortunately.

02:16.400 --> 02:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: To avoid adding to
the deficit, Mr. Trump wants
to cut domestic spending by

02:22.633 --> 02:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the same $54 billion he wants
to boost military spending.

02:26.333 --> 02:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officials said virtually every
federal agency will see cuts,
along with major reduction

02:31.933 --> 02:33.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in foreign aid.

02:33.433 --> 02:35.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
White House Budget
Director Mick Mulvaney:

02:35.967 --> 02:38.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY, White
House Budget Director:
Yes, it's a fairly small
part of the discretionary

02:38.167 --> 02:40.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
budget, but it's still
consistent with what
the president said.

02:40.633 --> 02:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you see these reductions,
you will be able to tie it
back to speech the president

02:44.133 --> 02:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gave or something the
president has said previously.

02:46.133 --> 02:50.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Budget officials
said proposals for taxes and
entitlement programs like Social

02:50.500 --> 02:52.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Security and Medicare
will come later.

02:52.733 --> 02:55.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: Nobody
knew that health care
could be so complicated.

02:55.733 --> 03:00.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Trump also talked
to the governors and later with
top health insurance executives

03:00.667 --> 03:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about repealing and replacing
the Affordable Care Act.

03:03.433 --> 03:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We must
work together to save
Americans from Obamacare.

03:07.700 --> 03:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People know that and everyone
knows that at this point, to
create more competition and

03:12.400 --> 03:14.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to bring down the
prices substantially.

03:14.433 --> 03:18.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That was echoed
by Republican governors like
Rick Snyder of Michigan.

03:18.300 --> 03:20.367 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICK SNYDER (R), Michigan:
This is a time for reform, to
broaden the issue from beyond

03:22.633 --> 03:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coverage to how do we do better
quality, better cost containment
for the long term and ultimately

03:29.367 --> 03:30.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it's about compassion.

03:30.800 --> 03:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're talking real people here.

03:33.433 --> 03:38.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Democrats,
led by National Governors
Association Chairman Terry
McAuliffe of Virginia,

03:40.300 --> 03:43.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
warned that ending
Obamacare would create major
funding gaps for Medicaid.

03:43.267 --> 03:45.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

03:45.333 --> 03:47.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TERRY MCAULIFFE (D), Virginia:
At this point, we have not
been provided any information

03:47.367 --> 03:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we want, other than we
want everybody to have health
care, we want to make accessible

03:50.633 --> 03:52.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and affordable to all.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The devil is in the details.

03:54.100 --> 03:56.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think the rhetoric of
the campaign has hit the
reality of governing.

03:56.833 --> 04:00.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The president
promised his address to Congress
tomorrow night would include a

04:00.867 --> 04:04.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
big statement on rebuilding
the nation's roads and bridges.

04:04.667 --> 04:09.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
White House Press Secretary
Sean Spicer said the president
would talk about solving real

04:09.167 --> 04:14.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
problems for real Americans,
like creating jobs and
ending urban violence.

04:16.167 --> 04:19.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In addition to that 10 percent
increase for Pentagon spending
next year, senior administration

04:21.500 --> 04:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
officials say that Mr. Trump
will ask for $30 billion
more for the Pentagon in this

04:25.767 --> 04:27.267 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
budget year.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not clear yet how they are
going to pay for that -- Judy.

04:29.733 --> 04:32.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John,
that was my question.

04:32.433 --> 04:36.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What are they saying about --
$30 billion is not chump change.

04:36.067 --> 04:38.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Where are they going
to come up with that?

04:38.033 --> 04:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, it's not only
that, also in this supplemental
appropriations request,

04:40.300 --> 04:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they are going to ask for money
for that first down payment
to start building the border

04:46.033 --> 04:48.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wall with Mexico.

04:48.167 --> 04:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they don't want to add to
the deficit, which they say
they won't, and also to the

04:50.933 --> 04:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
national debt, they're going
to have to find offsetting
cuts somewhere else because the

04:57.100 --> 04:59.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president says he's
not raising taxes.

04:59.100 --> 05:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly,
John, we know there were, as
you just reported, concerns

05:02.600 --> 05:07.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
among Democratic governors
about the changes to Obamacare,
but over the weekend, there

05:07.567 --> 05:09.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
were concerns expressed
by Republicans, too.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: That's right.

05:11.233 --> 05:13.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This is one of those
complications that the
president talked about.

05:13.733 --> 05:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A number of Republicans,
Republican governors
like John Kasich of Ohio,
used Obamacare money

05:20.000 --> 05:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to expand Medicaid coverage,
Medicaid, the program that
takes care of health care for

05:25.033 --> 05:26.967 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the needy.

05:26.967 --> 05:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Ohio, he added 525,000
uninsured people to
the Medicaid rolls.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the Medicaid goes away,
they are going to either have
to find the money elsewhere

05:37.800 --> 05:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or start pushing people off
Medicaid rolls, neither of which
is very politically palatable.

05:42.433 --> 05:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, John
Yang reporting for us from
the White House, thank you.

05:49.433 --> 05:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in the day's other news,
the Senate moved to confirm the
president's nominee for commerce

05:53.333 --> 05:55.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
secretary.

05:55.300 --> 05:58.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Billionaire investor Wilbur
Ross has said the administration
will work quickly to redo

05:58.800 --> 06:01.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NAFTA, the North American
Free Trade Agreement.

06:01.667 --> 06:06.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, the nominee
for Navy secretary, Philip
Bilden, withdrew last night.

06:08.100 --> 06:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He cited trouble in separating
from his business interests.

06:10.333 --> 06:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Army secretary nominee,
Vincent Viola, withdrew earlier
this month over similar issues.

06:17.300 --> 06:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More bomb threats were called
in today to Jewish community
centers and day schools in

06:21.500 --> 06:23.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at least 12 states.

06:23.567 --> 06:25.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
All appeared to be hoaxes.

06:25.600 --> 06:30.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The threats follow the weekend
destruction of more than 100
headstones at a Jewish cemetery

06:31.433 --> 06:33.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Philadelphia.

06:33.033 --> 06:36.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Interfaith leaders in the
city called today for unity.

06:36.067 --> 06:41.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JILL MADERER, Rabbi: Every time
we are attacked by hate in the
cemetery or beyond, we have

06:42.633 --> 06:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
come together in solidarity.

06:45.933 --> 06:50.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We will not only defend
our particular group.

06:50.067 --> 06:52.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Too many are vulnerable.

06:52.100 --> 06:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A White House
spokesman said President Trump
condemns the vandalism and

06:56.133 --> 06:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bomb threats -- quote --
"in the strongest terms."

06:59.800 --> 07:04.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the Philippines, the
military confirmed today that
Islamist militants linked to the

07:04.067 --> 07:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Islamic State group have
beheaded a German captive.

07:07.333 --> 07:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Abu Sayyaf had been holding
the 70-year-old hostage on a
southern island since last fall.

07:14.300 --> 07:18.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They demanded $600,000, but
the ransom deadline passed
Sunday without payment.

07:20.633 --> 07:24.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dozens of shops were ransacked
overnight in Johannesburg,
South Africa, the latest in

07:24.833 --> 07:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a wave of violence apparently
aimed at immigrants.

07:28.333 --> 07:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's been similar looting
in Pretoria this month.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Friday, hundreds of
anti-immigrant protesters
marched in Pretoria.

07:35.267 --> 07:40.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It comes amid claims that
foreigners are fomenting crime
and taking jobs from locals.

07:42.533 --> 07:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in this country, theft of
opioid drugs has become a major
problem at veterans' hospitals.

07:49.033 --> 07:53.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Associated Press
reports more than
11,000 cases since 2010.

07:53.200 --> 07:58.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it says that VA staffers
were disciplined in only
3 percent of the cases.

08:00.300 --> 08:03.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A top VA official, Dr. Carolyn
Clancy, told a House hearing
today that most of the missing

08:03.467 --> 08:06.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

35 years, I have never heard

08:30.200 --> 08:32.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

the Dow Jones industrial average

the 12th session in a row.

09:12.933 --> 09:16.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

DEVIN NUNES (R), California:
We still have not seen any
evidence of anyone that's from

10:32.633 --> 10:36.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Trump campaign or any other
campaign for that matter that's
communicated with the Russian

JUDY WOODRUFF: House
Intelligence Chair Devin
Nunes met reporters this
morning, and responded

10:42.567 --> 10:47.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to questions over his
committee's investigation
into whether President
Trump's associates

10:49.033 --> 10:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had ties to Russia during the
presidential campaign or after.

10:54.967 --> 10:58.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nunes drew criticism after a
Washington Post article revealed
that he agreed to talk to

11:00.000 --> 11:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a reporter at the White House's
request about a New York
Times story that alleged Trump

11:04.400 --> 11:06.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
associates spoke with
Russian intelligence.

REP.

11:08.267 --> 11:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEVIN NUNES: That story was a
little odd, I thought, because
if you ask me to contact

11:14.267 --> 11:17.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the White House and
said, hey, could you set
me up with somebody at
DOD or the intelligence

11:17.333 --> 11:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
agencies, I would say sure.

11:19.533 --> 11:24.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: CIA Director
Mike Pompeo and Senator Richard
Burr, chair of the Senate

11:26.567 --> 11:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Intelligence Committee, were
also reported to have been
contacted by the White House

11:30.700 --> 11:33.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
press secretary to make
calls about the story.

11:33.233 --> 11:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

investigation was ongoing,
but said he wanted to
be careful not to jump

11:39.233 --> 11:42.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into a witch-hunt, comparing it
to the Red Scare of the 1950s.

11:46.667 --> 11:51.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can't have the government,
the U.S. government or

branch of government

11:58.633 --> 12:00.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

JUDY WOODRUFF: At the White
House, spokesman Sean Spicer
defended his request to see CIA

12:07.167 --> 12:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Director Pompeo and the
Congressional Intelligence
Committee chairs and,
echoing Nunes, declared

12:12.500 --> 12:14.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
there was no story.

12:14.533 --> 12:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary: We have heard the
same people, the same anecdotes,

12:17.433 --> 12:20.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and we have heard reports
over and over again.

12:20.167 --> 12:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as Chairman Nunes very
clear today, he has seen
nothing that corroborates that.

12:24.400 --> 12:27.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So at what point you got
to ask yourself, what
are you investigating?

12:27.267 --> 12:32.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Among
those still not convinced,
former President George
W. Bush, who told

12:34.267 --> 12:38.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NBC's "Today Show" that the
questions about links to
Russia need to be answered.

12:41.300 --> 12:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amid growing calls for an
independent investigation
into Russia's attempts
to influence the U.S.

12:44.633 --> 12:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election, I spoke earlier
with Senator Mark Warner,
vice chairman of the
Senate Intelligence

12:49.600 --> 12:51.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Committee.

12:51.733 --> 12:55.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I asked for his reaction to
the White House enlisting U.S.
intelligence community leaders

12:55.367 --> 13:00.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and congressional Intelligence
Committee chairs to help counter
news stories about the Trump

13:01.733 --> 13:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaign's contacts with
Russia's intelligence officials.

13:03.133 --> 13:05.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:05.233 --> 13:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER (D), Virginia: Well,
my reaction was grave concern
and an awful lot of frustration.

13:10.833 --> 13:15.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are at the early stages
of our investigation.

13:15.567 --> 13:20.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have bipartisan
Intelligence Committee
staff today working over
reviewing basic intelligence.

13:23.367 --> 13:26.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have been at this now
for a couple of weeks.

13:26.033 --> 13:28.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're making progress.

13:28.533 --> 13:33.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For anyone to try to
interfere at this early
stage of an investigation
just makes no sense.

13:35.633 --> 13:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's take for a moment, even
if the White House's position
was correct, by asking these

13:42.667 --> 13:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
figures to interfere and lobby,
they then potentially color the
results of this investigation.

13:51.367 --> 13:56.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have no idea why they would
try to interfere at this point,
when this investigation is

13:56.867 --> 13:58.867 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ongoing.

13:58.867 --> 14:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The good news is, Judy, though,
that we have heard, over the
last couple of days, from

14:04.600 --> 14:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a number of the members of
the committee, Democrats and
Republicans alike, folks like

14:07.800 --> 14:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Rubio and Senator
Collins, who have all
said very strongly they
continue to support

14:15.267 --> 14:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an investigation that's
bipartisan, that will
follow the facts wherever
they may lead, that

14:20.900 --> 14:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
won't allow outside interference
like the White House and others.

14:23.633 --> 14:28.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as long as we have got a
strong majority of the committee
that's committed to that

14:28.467 --> 14:32.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
process, I think we're
the best place and best
forum to go forward.

14:32.033 --> 14:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, what the
White House press secretary,
Sean Spicer, said today,

14:35.333 --> 14:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator, was, he said, this
was simply in response to the
request from these reporters.

14:39.933 --> 14:42.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The reporters were asking
for the White House version.

14:42.967 --> 14:47.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House said, in order
to give you any corroboration,
it was the only way they

14:49.367 --> 14:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could do that was to send
them to these other officials.

14:51.533 --> 14:53.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:53.633 --> 14:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER: One of the things
about an Intelligence Committee
investigation is that you don't

14:59.100 --> 15:02.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
talk about the ongoing
processes before you
have a finished product.

15:03.933 --> 15:06.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're really still
at the early stages.

15:06.400 --> 15:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are enormous amounts
of information that
has to be gone through.

15:10.133 --> 15:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have seen massive Russian
intervention in the election.

15:13.333 --> 15:15.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have seen hacking.

15:15.933 --> 15:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen a number of
indications of individuals
affiliated with Mr.
Trump who've had contacts

15:23.200 --> 15:25.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with Russian officials.

15:25.400 --> 15:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need to find the extent
of those contacts, the
content of those contacts.

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, somehow, asking folks to
interfere on a press story
before this investigation is

15:37.500 --> 15:41.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
completed, to me, is both
inappropriate, improper
and, frankly, weakens
the White House's case

15:45.500 --> 15:47.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
dramatically.

15:47.533 --> 15:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Senator,
that sounds different from
what Devin Nunes, who is the

15:49.500 --> 15:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
House Intelligence
Committee chair, said today.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said there is no
evidence that he knows
of now of any contacts
between the Trump campaign

15:57.867 --> 15:59.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and Russian
intelligence officials.

15:59.633 --> 16:01.767 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:01.767 --> 16:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER: Judy, there are
-- the one thing I think that
has been made clear is there

16:05.333 --> 16:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are ongoing investigations.

16:08.533 --> 16:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anyone that jumps to a
conclusion while there
are ongoing investigations
and tries to make

16:15.633 --> 16:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a definitive fact and definitive
statement I think does a great
disservice to the American

16:21.100 --> 16:23.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

16:23.100 --> 16:27.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is nothing more important
than, when we have got the
potential of a foreign nation,

16:29.033 --> 16:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not only interfering in
our election process,
but lord knows what else.

16:32.333 --> 16:34.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well,
two other quick things.

16:34.333 --> 16:37.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chairman Nunes went on to
say that this shouldn't
become a witch-hunt.

16:37.567 --> 16:39.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is that a legitimate
concern here?

16:39.433 --> 16:41.467 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:41.467 --> 16:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER: Listen, what
the chairman of the House has
done by trying to interfere

16:46.800 --> 16:50.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the investigation really
raises huge concerns.

16:52.500 --> 16:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As somebody who has to go back
and continue to make the case
to my Democratic colleagues

16:57.833 --> 17:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that this investigation is
going to be done straight up,
in an honest and straightforward

17:01.533 --> 17:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way, obviously, Chairman Nunes'
actions don't help that cause.

17:08.433 --> 17:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, and if this
ends up defaulting into some
kind of partisan food fight, at

17:14.433 --> 17:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the end of the day, what happens
is, the American public don't
get the answers they deserve.

17:20.867 --> 17:24.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have said from the outset,
Judy, there's nothing I have
done in my Senate career that's

17:25.833 --> 17:28.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
more important than
this investigation.

17:28.133 --> 17:32.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has to be done right, it
has to be done bipartisan,
and it has to follow the facts

17:32.867 --> 17:35.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wherever they lead.

17:35.167 --> 17:39.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you have got
particularly an administration
like this one, which
has, unfortunately, in

17:41.000 --> 17:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president, disrespected
the intelligence community so
many times during the campaign,

17:47.100 --> 17:50.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's more important than
ever that the intelligence
community feels that
there is somebody that

17:50.100 --> 17:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has got their back and that
they can do their job in
an honest and truthful way.

17:54.233 --> 17:58.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Senator,
your Democratic in the Senate
Senator Dick Durbin is saying

17:58.567 --> 18:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there needs to be an
outside independent
commission looking into it.

18:02.800 --> 18:04.867 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

18:04.867 --> 18:08.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK WARNER: If I find
that we can't get access
to the information we
need, yes, I will be

18:08.333 --> 18:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
willing to call for that.

18:10.433 --> 18:14.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, let's remember,
if we were to pass an
independent commission,
it would require passage

18:16.233 --> 18:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the House, passage of the
Senate, and a significant
by this president.

18:21.733 --> 18:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Who would say that that
independent commission
would truly be independent?

18:23.733 --> 18:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would also take that
commission literally
months to get up to speed.

18:28.333 --> 18:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have people working today
in a bipartisan fashion trying
to get the facts to get to

18:34.400 --> 18:36.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the bottom of this.

18:36.033 --> 18:39.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think the American
public deserve answers
sooner than later.

18:39.300 --> 18:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And my fear is the independent
commission, one, would
it truly be independent?

18:43.933 --> 18:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Would it truly get passed and
be signed by this president?

18:47.600 --> 18:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then it would take
literally months to get
it set up and established.

18:51.333 --> 18:55.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, as long as we can
continue to do this with the
majority of the Intelligence

18:55.867 --> 19:00.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Committee committed to
doing this bipartisan,
independent, and making
sure we get the facts,

19:01.733 --> 19:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this is still the way to go.

19:03.833 --> 19:06.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Mark
Warner, the vice chair of the
Senate Intelligence Committee,

19:06.567 --> 19:07.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we thank you.

19:07.567 --> 19:08.567 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

19:08.567 --> 19:10.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK WARNER: Thank you, Judy.

19:10.600 --> 19:12.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And for the
record, we reached out to every
Republican member of the Senate

19:12.900 --> 19:14.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Intelligence Committee.

19:14.333 --> 19:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They either declined or
didn't respond to our request.

19:17.933 --> 19:21.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Now more on Russian
and U.S. actions that
led us to this moment.

19:21.867 --> 19:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the subject of a lengthy
article in this week's "New
Yorker" magazine, and to

19:26.500 --> 19:29.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
William Brangham.

19:29.033 --> 19:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So,
what is known, and not
known, about Russia's
involvement in our recent

19:32.033 --> 19:33.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election?

19:33.033 --> 19:35.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm joined now by Evan Osnos.

19:35.067 --> 19:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a staff writer at "The
New Yorker" and one of the
author's of "Active Measures,"

19:38.833 --> 19:41.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a deep look into
Russia's actions.

19:41.133 --> 19:43.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's in the latest
edition of the magazine.

19:43.133 --> 19:45.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I'm also joined
by John Sipher.

19:45.200 --> 19:49.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He spent 28 years in the CIA's
clandestine service, including
assignments in Russia and

19:50.567 --> 19:52.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Eastern Europe.

19:52.067 --> 19:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's now at a consulting
company called CrossLead.

19:54.033 --> 19:56.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

19:56.233 --> 20:00.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, Evan Osnos, really
a wonderful primer in
"The New Yorker" that
you wrote and several

20:01.033 --> 20:02.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of your colleagues.

20:02.267 --> 20:04.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Can you just bring
us up to speed.

20:04.300 --> 20:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do we know, what don't
we know about Russia's
involvement in the election?

20:06.800 --> 20:07.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
EVAN OSNOS, "The
New Yorker": Sure.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This stories, which was a
collaboration with David Remnick
and Josh Yaffa in Moscow, was

20:11.900 --> 20:16.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an attempt to say, let's clarify
exactly what we have learned,
because this is an extraordinary

20:16.167 --> 20:17.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
moment.

20:17.333 --> 20:18.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We now know that
three things happened.

20:18.833 --> 20:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The first thing is that, as
you know, the DNC was hacked.

20:22.633 --> 20:24.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
John Podesta's
e-mail was hacked.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the one Americans I
think know the most about.

20:26.267 --> 20:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The second thing is that we
also know that there was an
influence campaign, an attempt

20:29.933 --> 20:33.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to really change what it
is that people believed
about the candidates.

20:33.500 --> 20:37.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The director of national
intelligence has said
that this occurred.

20:37.033 --> 20:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not a -- fake news is
a term that's now become
politicized in its own way.

20:40.733 --> 20:44.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But from the intelligence
community's perspective,
this is a known fact.

20:44.067 --> 20:47.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then the third piece --
is this the one that I think
we're at the stage now of trying

20:47.067 --> 20:51.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to learn more about --
is whether or not and
to what degree there
were contacts between

20:51.467 --> 20:56.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian representatives
and elements perhaps of
Trump's campaign, his
advisers or his associates.

20:58.433 --> 21:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's really where
the center of gravity is
moving in the investigation.

21:00.433 --> 21:02.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: John
Sipher, you spent a
quarter-century in the CIA.

21:02.467 --> 21:06.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do all of those allegations
against the Russians and their
involvement, does this all ring

21:06.367 --> 21:07.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
true to you?

21:07.633 --> 21:09.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN SIPHER, Former CIA
Officer: Oh, absolutely.

21:09.267 --> 21:11.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Russians have been doing
this for decades, if
not hundreds of years.

21:11.767 --> 21:14.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is what they do.

21:14.233 --> 21:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's interesting about this
is what fertile soil it took
place on, the fact that these

21:18.633 --> 21:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
type of things, some of it
quite sloppy and open, actually
caused the problems they did

21:24.233 --> 21:25.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for us.

21:25.900 --> 21:26.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Do you
mean fertile soil here
in the United States?

21:26.700 --> 21:27.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN SIPHER: I do.

21:27.467 --> 21:29.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I do.

21:29.500 --> 21:33.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fact that they were able to
break in and steal DNC e-mails
and take advantage of that,

21:34.600 --> 21:36.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm surprised at
the effect that had.

21:36.667 --> 21:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's unusual that you
had a campaign that was able
to use that and spin that up

21:40.333 --> 21:43.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and deal with the
Russian service here.

21:43.267 --> 21:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What I find interesting is
that there is a lot of concern
that the Trump campaign was

21:47.500 --> 21:51.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying they didn't have
improper contact with
Russians during the campaign.

21:51.067 --> 21:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And my question would be,
what is proper contact?

21:55.300 --> 21:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Did they have contacts with
Germans, Indians, Japanese?

21:58.833 --> 22:00.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why with Russians?

22:00.967 --> 22:03.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why would a campaign in the
United States need to have
any contact with Russians?

22:03.933 --> 22:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: There could
be innocent explanations,
if members to have the Trump

22:07.933 --> 22:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaign or his entourage
were talking with Russians.

22:10.533 --> 22:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Couldn't there be innocent
explanations for those?

22:12.600 --> 22:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EVAN OSNOS: Well, I think
that's the reason why we need
now a robust, independent and

22:16.400 --> 22:18.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thorough investigation.

22:18.433 --> 22:21.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We decided as an institution
that we needed to understand
this as best we could.

22:21.467 --> 22:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We interviewed dozens of people.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We spent months on this.

22:24.333 --> 22:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I consider it the very
beginning of chapter one.

22:27.300 --> 22:31.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are now in a position where
the legislative branch, the
executive branch has the ability

22:31.167 --> 22:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to go out and say, well,
what was the full universe of
contacts, what were the nature

22:34.433 --> 22:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of those contacts, and were they
serving the American public,
and do we know everything

22:37.900 --> 22:39.167 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
we can?

22:39.167 --> 22:41.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Because, look, we
did that for 9/11.

22:41.667 --> 22:45.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We established a bipartisan,
independent commission
composed of five Republicans
and five Democrats.

22:45.167 --> 22:48.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, as a result, we know a
huge amount about what happened.

22:48.267 --> 22:50.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We don't know that
yet about this event.

22:50.367 --> 22:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think we are really at
the stage where we're trying
to decide, what are the right

22:52.233 --> 22:54.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
investigative tools and
who is going to do it?

22:54.300 --> 22:57.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: John, let's
just say that the evidence bears
out that the Russians really

22:57.467 --> 23:00.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
were trying to put their
thumb on the scale here.

23:00.300 --> 23:04.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What were their
ambitions, in your sense?

23:04.167 --> 23:05.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What would they be
trying to do here?

23:05.367 --> 23:07.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN SIPHER: This is
not much of a surprise.

23:07.367 --> 23:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Vladimir Putin's interests
have always been to divide
the United States from Europe.

23:11.200 --> 23:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has a zero sum view of
working with the United States.

23:14.333 --> 23:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So anything that causes
chaos or creates problems
here is a win for him.

23:18.800 --> 23:22.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We see the same thing
happening now in France,
Germany, the Balkans.

23:22.800 --> 23:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's even working with the
Taliban in Afghanistan.

23:25.100 --> 23:27.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, this is the kind
of thing they do.

23:27.733 --> 23:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their goal is to
essentially create
fissures in our alliances.

23:34.733 --> 23:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Anything that creates chaos and
tries to provide some sort of
moral equivalence between his

23:38.233 --> 23:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regime and the West, he likes
to say that, oh, this is no
different than you guys messing

23:42.933 --> 23:45.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
around#~ in Libya and Egypt and
Syria and those type of things.

23:45.267 --> 23:48.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EVAN OSNOS: One of the
things, the surprise for
me in the course of this
work was to discover,

23:48.733 --> 23:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in effect, that the United
States was susceptible to
this kind of operation.

23:52.233 --> 23:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke to people who used
to work on this in the State
Department who said, a couple

23:55.533 --> 23:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of years ago, we were worried
that Moldova, for instance,
would be vulnerable to this

23:59.500 --> 24:00.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
kind of interference.

24:00.767 --> 24:01.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Little, teeny Moldova.

24:01.567 --> 24:02.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

24:02.567 --> 24:04.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EVAN OSNOS: Exactly.

24:04.633 --> 24:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, in a sense, the agents
behind this operation -- and
that's really what this was

24:07.433 --> 24:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - it was an intelligence
operation -- discovered that our
politics were so divided, people

24:11.333 --> 24:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were already open to a
highly kind of propagandistic
form of political
communication, that we were

24:18.967 --> 24:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a prime target, in effect,
a soft target for this kind
of influence operation.

24:22.433 --> 24:25.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: One of the
things I was struck by in your
article is that you wrote,

24:25.567 --> 24:30.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
towards the end of your piece,
where you described how some of
the intelligence agents think

24:32.600 --> 24:36.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that this was more of
an improvisation on
behalf of the Russians,
not a sort of strategic

24:36.867 --> 24:38.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

24:38.100 --> 24:40.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Can you explain the
distinction there?

24:40.133 --> 24:42.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EVAN OSNOS: Well,
speaking broadly about
sort of the impression
that people have who are

24:42.067 --> 24:45.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
focused on this issue, is that
there's one way to think of it.

24:45.867 --> 24:50.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you look at this dossier
of unverified claims that was
submitted earlier to the FBI

24:52.867 --> 24:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and was then presented to the
president, one of the claims
in there was that this was a

24:56.400 --> 25:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
longstanding, five-, six-,
seven-year operation to
cultivate Donald Trump.

25:00.200 --> 25:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, at the moment, what
you find is that more people
who are focused on this issue

25:03.433 --> 25:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are inclined to believe that
this was an improvisation
that was changing.

25:07.033 --> 25:11.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were elements that were
brought in at different points,
meaning it may have started

25:11.000 --> 25:13.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as a hacking operation.

25:13.167 --> 25:17.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It may have started as
an intelligence -- it
may have started as an
influence operation.

25:19.067 --> 25:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the idea that this started
six, seven years ago, with a
discrete, fully formed plan

25:21.933 --> 25:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with a clear objective is
hard to defend at this point.

25:25.200 --> 25:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that's one of the
reasons why we need to learn
more, because we don't know

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
exactly when and how it started.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Why would the
Russians have been interested
in Donald Trump back then?

25:32.167 --> 25:34.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Because, then, he was
a reality TV star.

25:34.900 --> 25:36.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He had no intention, seemingly,
of running for office.

25:36.933 --> 25:38.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN SIPHER: I don't
know that they did.

25:38.867 --> 25:41.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think we have that
information, if they were
particularly interested in him.

25:41.667 --> 25:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They certainly do collect
on any American of
interest who visits Russia.

25:44.733 --> 25:49.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The notion that they would
have videotapes in hotel rooms
or follow people around or

25:49.567 --> 25:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
try to collect compromising
information on people,
this is what they do.

25:53.533 --> 25:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: John, how
does what we're seeing today
compare to what the Soviets used

25:57.700 --> 25:59.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to do back in the USSR?

25:59.800 --> 26:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN SIPHER: What they're
doing now is very similar
to what they did before.

26:01.900 --> 26:04.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They just have new tools.

26:04.100 --> 26:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have Mr. Snowden, who
gives them a lot of information
about the kind of things we

26:07.733 --> 26:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have and where to attack.

26:09.833 --> 26:14.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And they have some
really talented computer
programmers and hackers
there in Russia that...

26:16.000 --> 26:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And the
Internet more broadly.

26:16.800 --> 26:17.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN SIPHER: Right.

26:17.733 --> 26:18.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Exactly.

26:18.733 --> 26:20.767 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Exactly.

26:20.767 --> 26:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Evan Osnos, John Sipher,
thank you both very much.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN SIPHER: Thank you.

26:25.900 --> 26:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVAN OSNOS: Glad to be here.

26:32.933 --> 26:36.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now what
hospitals fear about
the possible costs of
repealing and replacing

26:38.433 --> 26:40.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the health care law.

26:40.500 --> 26:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Efforts by President Trump and
congressional Republicans to
unravel the Affordable Care

26:44.733 --> 26:48.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Act are unnerving many
hospital executives.

26:48.133 --> 26:52.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say they're worried about
big changes to their bottom
line, particularly after they

26:52.600 --> 26:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
overhauled how care is delivered
in response to the health
law's rewards and penalties.

26:59.500 --> 27:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
While Republicans try to figure
out their game plan, special
correspondent Sarah Varney

27:02.800 --> 27:06.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reports on how hospitals
are bracing for the unknown.

27:06.367 --> 27:11.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This story was produced
in collaboration with our
partner Kaiser Health News.

27:13.400 --> 27:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Driving to work
amid the barren winter fields
in Northern Illinois, Cathie

27:17.833 --> 27:19.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Chapman is worried
about the future.

27:19.267 --> 27:21.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She lost her job after a
nearby rural hospital closed.

27:21.967 --> 27:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CATHIE CHAPMAN, Perry Memorial
Hospital: I was really lucky.

27:24.033 --> 27:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I found another great hospital
to work in with a wonderful
group of people who deliver

27:28.000 --> 27:29.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
high-quality care.

27:29.433 --> 27:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But not everyone was as lucky.

27:31.633 --> 27:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: And as Republicans
work to dismantle the Affordable
Care Act, she wonders if it

27:36.033 --> 27:38.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
might happen again.

27:38.167 --> 27:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now she runs the pharmacy
at Perry Memorial in
Princeton, Illinois.

27:42.400 --> 27:45.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And she's watching
the Republicans'
repeal efforts warily.

27:45.300 --> 27:50.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CATHIE CHAPMAN: I think
everybody who works in health
care now feels a little uneasy.

27:50.100 --> 27:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even if you're a large,
profitable hospital,
we don't know what's
coming around the corner,

27:54.100 --> 27:56.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and how it will affect us.

27:56.500 --> 28:00.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Rural
hospitals have long
struggled to stay open:
They have far fewer patients

28:00.267 --> 28:02.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and thin margins.

28:02.300 --> 28:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dozens have closed across the
country in recent years, mostly
in states that didn't expand

28:06.133 --> 28:08.467 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Medicaid.

28:08.467 --> 28:13.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, in Illinois, which did
extend Medicaid to nearly all
poor adults, patients at Perry

28:15.833 --> 28:20.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Memorial have gained
coverage under the
Affordable Care Act and many
hospitals have found firmer

28:21.233 --> 28:23.267 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
footing.

28:23.267 --> 28:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Annette Schnabel, the
hospital's CEO, says if large
numbers of people lose their

28:30.900 --> 28:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
insurance under the Republicans'
replacement, the hospital's
finances and its patients would

28:37.833 --> 28:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be at risk, especially after
the hospital has invested so
much money and time in complying

28:42.233 --> 28:44.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with the health law.

28:44.267 --> 28:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNETTE SCHNABEL, CEO, Perry
Memorial Hospital: We have spent
the last six years gearing up

28:46.300 --> 28:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
towards everything that we were
responsible for doing in the
ACA, and the idea of we might

28:53.200 --> 28:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have to totally go a different
direction or how will we do
that, it's going to take a

28:55.633 --> 28:56.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lot of work.

28:56.900 --> 28:59.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's a lot of effort
that is going into this.

28:59.400 --> 29:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: And for
some hospitals to survive
or break even, it will
require Congress to

29:05.500 --> 29:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
restore billions of dollars
in funding that kept hospitals
afloat before the law took

29:09.767 --> 29:11.867 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
effect.

29:11.867 --> 29:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hospitals made a high-stakes
trade when they signed on
to the Affordable Care Act.

29:14.400 --> 29:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They agreed to massive
cuts in federal aid that
defrayed the cost of
caring for the uninsured.

29:18.733 --> 29:23.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In exchange, they would
gain tens of millions of
newly insured customers.

29:23.433 --> 29:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now that deal is in jeopardy
and hospital executives are
anxiously waiting to see what

29:27.700 --> 29:30.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
comes next.

29:30.233 --> 29:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Stroger Hospital of Cook County,
in Chicago, is one of the
busiest hospitals in the nation.

29:37.200 --> 29:41.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Its emergency and trauma teams
have inspired shows like "E.R."
and "Chicago Med" and handle

29:43.367 --> 29:46.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
most of the city's
gunshot victims.

29:46.267 --> 29:50.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The vast majority of patients
here used to be uninsured,
and the county-run hospital

29:50.967 --> 29:55.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
struggled to take care
of all of their medical
and mental health needs.

29:55.833 --> 30:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those patients now have
Medicaid coverage because of the
Affordable Care Act, and the

30:00.333 --> 30:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cook County hospital system
has gained $200 million in new
revenue to cover their services,

30:06.600 --> 30:08.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
breaking even for
the first time ever.

30:08.367 --> 30:10.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

30:10.800 --> 30:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY SHANNON, CEO, Cook
County Health and Hospitals
System: We have no
interest in slipping back

30:11.733 --> 30:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in what we have been able to do.

30:14.500 --> 30:19.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Dr. Jay Shannon
is CEO of the Cook County
Health and Hospitals System.

30:19.967 --> 30:22.067 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

30:22.067 --> 30:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAY SHANNON: We're not able
to do the kind of work that we
do today with good will alone.

30:24.733 --> 30:27.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Our staff are not
a volunteer staff.

30:27.333 --> 30:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We can't get I.V. fluids
and medical equipment on
credit and a wink and a nod.

30:34.333 --> 30:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Two hospital trade
groups, the American Hospital
Association and the Federation

30:37.433 --> 30:42.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of American Hospitals,
have warned of -- quote
- - "an unprecedented
public health crisis"

30:42.200 --> 30:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
if the law is hastily scuttled.

30:44.533 --> 30:49.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say if Congress repeals
the law entirely and 20 million
people are kicked off their

30:49.267 --> 30:54.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
insurance, hospitals
will lose $166 billion
in Medicaid payments
alone in the next decade

30:56.500 --> 31:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and face much steeper losses if
certain Medicare cuts that were
part of the law aren't restored.

31:03.433 --> 31:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Chicago, limo driver Jerold
Exson (ph) is one of those
patients who could lose coverage

31:09.100 --> 31:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and have his hospital
bills once again go unpaid.

31:11.200 --> 31:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As of now, the hospital helps
enroll low-income adults
like Exson into Medicaid.

31:15.933 --> 31:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2014, he was shot nearly
a dozen times in a case
of mistaken identity.

31:22.900 --> 31:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His medical care is covered now,
and the hospital can provide
follow-up surgeries, physical

31:26.733 --> 31:31.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
therapy and mental health

off-limits to the uninsured.

WOMAN: How are
you feeling today?

31:33.567 --> 31:34.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I see you.

31:34.733 --> 31:36.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You're kind of down.

31:36.700 --> 31:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEROLD EXSON, Chicago: I'm
not as edgy when I'm, like,
driving or out in public, around

31:42.400 --> 31:44.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a lot of people.

31:44.533 --> 31:48.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SARAH VARNEY: Exson sees
clinical psychologist
Natalia Ruiz (ph) to
manage the after-effects

31:48.067 --> 31:50.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of gun violence.

31:50.067 --> 31:52.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEROLD EXSON: I had that
episode where I was driving that
time, and the little rock hit

31:52.567 --> 31:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the window, and it kind of
sent me into a tailspin.

31:55.433 --> 32:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: The health law
also shifted the business
model for U.S. hospitals.

32:00.133 --> 32:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It offered them financial
incentives to move away from
expensive E.R. visits to primary

32:05.033 --> 32:10.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
care and managing
chronic conditions.

32:11.600 --> 32:14.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Earl Williams Sr,. has
finally brought his
diabetes under control.

32:14.900 --> 32:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's diligent about exercising,
taking his medication,
and seeing his doctor.

32:21.333 --> 32:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EARL WILLIAMS SR., Chicago:
My sugars was in the 200s.

32:28.300 --> 32:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're now from 80 to 120,
where they're supposed to be.

32:31.833 --> 32:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then they took some of the
medication away because I have
maintained due to teachings

32:38.267 --> 32:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of my doctors and the staff
here at Woodlawn Hospital.

32:40.900 --> 32:45.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SARAH VARNEY: Before
the Affordable Care Act,
hospitals had little
incentive to reduce E.R.

32:47.867 --> 32:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
visits, especially from
Medicare patients who
generate a lot of revenue.

32:53.800 --> 32:58.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the University of Chicago
Medicine, an academic medical
center, Dr. Kenneth Polonsky

33:00.833 --> 33:03.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says, if those incentives are
rescinded and patients forgo
preventive care, they will

33:04.933 --> 33:06.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
clog up already strained
emergency rooms.

33:06.267 --> 33:08.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

33:08.333 --> 33:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KENNETH POLONSKY, University
of Chicago Medicine: We will go
back to a very frustrating time,

33:11.633 --> 33:16.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
where people had limited
options for health care
because of inability to
get health insurance.

33:19.433 --> 33:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: The uncertainty is
also roiling county governments,
which often fund medical

33:25.167 --> 33:27.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
care for the poor.

33:27.233 --> 33:31.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The burden on local taxpayers
to fund the Cook County Health
System has dropped by $300

33:32.433 --> 33:36.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
million since the health
law went into effect.

33:38.900 --> 33:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners
Toni Preckwinkle says
repealing the law could

33:40.800 --> 33:43.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
force local governments
to raise taxes.

33:43.167 --> 33:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONI PRECKWINKLE, President,
Cook County Board of
Commissioners: For us,
it's a $300 million

33:45.400 --> 33:47.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hole in our budget.

33:47.133 --> 33:50.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, there aren't a lot
of options, other than
raising more revenue.

33:50.633 --> 33:52.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a nightmare for us.

33:52.600 --> 33:56.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: She says the
county and the country have
been making progress and repeal

33:56.467 --> 33:59.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is a step backward.

33:59.867 --> 34:01.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In Waukegan, Illinois,
near the Wisconsin border:

34:01.967 --> 34:03.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BARBARA MARTIN, CEO,
Vista Health System:
What we're entering here
is our new open heart

34:03.700 --> 34:05.767 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
surgery suite.

34:05.767 --> 34:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Vista Health
System CEO Barbara Martin says
with more insured patients and

34:11.933 --> 34:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
additional reimbursement from
the health law, she's invested
in new equipment and hired

34:14.500 --> 34:19.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hundreds of new employees
across Vista's two
for-profit hospitals.

34:21.533 --> 34:24.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She says, if the 900,000
Illinois residents who
gained insurance under
the law lose coverage

34:27.300 --> 34:30.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and hospital revenue
drops suddenly, hospital
executives estimate
95,000 jobs could be lost.

34:32.433 --> 34:36.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARBARA MARTIN: That could just
be catastrophic to the state
and catastrophic, not to only

34:38.000 --> 34:40.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Vista, to all hospitals
across the country.

34:40.533 --> 34:44.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: But Edmund
Haislmaier, a senior
fellow at the Heritage
Foundation, a conservative

34:46.200 --> 34:50.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
think tank, says U.S.
taxpayers already spend
too much on health care.

34:50.633 --> 34:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Haislmaier, who was a member
of President Trump's transition
team on health policy,

34:55.533 --> 35:00.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says communities and states
and local governments shouldn't
rely on hospitals to create new

35:01.667 --> 35:04.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
jobs and fill
their budget holes.

35:04.100 --> 35:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDMUND HAISLMAIER, Heritage
Foundation: Hospitals in
particular have become
economic development

35:07.000 --> 35:08.967 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
projects.

35:08.967 --> 35:13.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you're paying tax dollars
for a public program like
Medicare or Medicaid and you're

35:14.833 --> 35:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
paying private insurance
premiums, this is all what
makes health care unaffordable.

35:20.967 --> 35:25.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SARAH VARNEY: More than
a dozen top Republican
lawmakers declined to
be interviewed for this

35:26.333 --> 35:28.367 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
story.

35:28.367 --> 35:31.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But a spokesperson for Senator
Lamar Alexander, chairman of
the Senate Committee on Health,

35:31.667 --> 35:36.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Education, Labor and Pensions,
said in a statement that he is
listening to hospitals, doctors,

35:38.233 --> 35:40.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
patients, governors and
others as they draft
the replacement plan.

35:40.833 --> 35:45.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in Chicago, that all
adds up to more questions for
patients like Earl Williams.

35:47.467 --> 35:51.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
EARL WILLIAMS SR.: Am I
going to have insurance
in a month or two?

35:51.633 --> 35:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Questions doctors
are struggling to answer.

35:54.333 --> 35:56.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: I'm going to give
it to you straight.

35:56.100 --> 36:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is, it's likely
that it's going to change.

36:01.967 --> 36:04.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not going to be the same.

36:04.400 --> 36:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: With President
Trump and congressional
Republicans now saying
a final replacement

36:08.033 --> 36:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plan may not be ready
until later this year, the
uncertainty is likely to linger.

36:15.033 --> 36:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour" and
Kaiser Health News, I'm
Sarah Varney in Chicago.

36:23.967 --> 36:28.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

36:33.800 --> 36:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
reshaping our view of Africa
and its central role in human

36:39.400 --> 36:41.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
civilization.

36:41.900 --> 36:44.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, from the
president's budget signals
to a new Democratic
Party leader, it's time

36:46.833 --> 36:51.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for Politics Monday with Tamara
Keith of NPR, and joining us
tonight from Miami, Amy Walter

36:52.633 --> 36:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of The Cook Political Report.

36:54.700 --> 36:55.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome to both of you.

36:55.967 --> 36:57.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Happy Monday.

36:57.500 --> 36:59.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, the White House is talking
budgets and health care today.

36:59.567 --> 37:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Amy, we're going to hear more
about what the president has in
mind in terms of their budget

37:03.500 --> 37:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
blueprint tomorrow, but
essentially they're talking big
increases in defense, military

37:08.400 --> 37:12.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spending and big cuts in
domestic discretionary spending.

37:12.767 --> 37:14.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What are the political
realities here?

37:14.933 --> 37:16.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER, The Cook
Political Report: Yes.

37:16.633 --> 37:20.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The president is trying
to fulfill another one
of his campaign pledges.

37:20.733 --> 37:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw him earlier in
his presidency talking
about immigration,
passing executive orders,

37:27.167 --> 37:30.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and now wanting to
pass legislation
restricting immigration.

37:30.033 --> 37:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now we're getting to the part
where he talked on the campaign
trail of making sure that

37:33.433 --> 37:38.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our defense spending is
increased and that we're going
to cut budgets domestically.

37:40.333 --> 37:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The question, of course, Judy,
is how you do that without
running up the deficit.

37:43.133 --> 37:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His OMB director today said we
can do this if we make those
cuts on domestic spending.

37:50.667 --> 37:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the reality is, it's
going to be really tough,
especially when you add
into this discussions

37:56.667 --> 37:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the president also
had today about increasing
funding for infrastructure
spending, and then,

37:58.733 --> 38:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of course, how we are going
to pay for that wall and all
of those extra agents who are

38:02.700 --> 38:04.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
supposed to be
patrolling the border.

38:04.700 --> 38:08.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a party that for years
talked about reducing the
deficit, not spending more money

38:08.767 --> 38:10.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than you have.

38:10.067 --> 38:12.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This could be a
big budget buster.

38:12.033 --> 38:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's always
tougher to execute these things
than it is to talk about the

38:16.733 --> 38:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
outline of what you want to do.

38:18.200 --> 38:19.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH, National
Public Radio: Yes.

38:19.733 --> 38:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Budgets, however, presidential
budgets, are vision documents.

38:22.433 --> 38:24.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This a vision document.

38:24.433 --> 38:28.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is not what Congress
will ultimately end up voting
on or putting into place.

38:30.567 --> 38:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other thing to point out
is that the president wants to
vastly increase defense spending

38:33.133 --> 38:35.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and cut it from discretionary
domestic spending.

38:35.767 --> 38:39.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there is actually a
law in place right now that
says you can't do that.

38:39.267 --> 38:41.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's the Budget
Control Act of 2011.

38:41.733 --> 38:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so they would actually
have to find a way
around that law as well.

38:45.100 --> 38:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So it's always a bit more
complicated than it seems.

38:47.600 --> 38:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this is just a blueprint.

38:49.100 --> 38:52.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is very early, very
early in the process.

38:52.400 --> 38:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Earlier in the process --
usually, the White House doesn't
even talk about these kinds

38:55.700 --> 38:57.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of things at this
point in the process.

38:57.733 --> 39:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, so
speaking of political realities,
Amy, the Democrats chose a new

39:01.200 --> 39:04.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
party chair over the
weekend, Tom Perez.

39:04.333 --> 39:06.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's the former labor secretary.

39:06.967 --> 39:08.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Hard-fought contest.

39:08.500 --> 39:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What does this say about the
Democratic Party right now?

39:11.433 --> 39:13.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And what do you look
to Tom Perez to do?

39:13.533 --> 39:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, whoever was
elected DNC chair was coming
into a pretty rough position.

39:20.533 --> 39:25.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, what's not talked about
all that much is that, despite
the big loss for Democrats

39:27.533 --> 39:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 2016 of the White
House, they have been
losing seats, especially
at the state legislative,

39:31.333 --> 39:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
governor's level, and of
course at the congressional
level, ever since
President Obama was elected

39:37.000 --> 39:38.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 2009.

39:38.233 --> 39:40.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So Tom Perez is coming
into a deep, deep hole.

39:40.367 --> 39:45.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The most important thing he
can do -- I know the candidates
talked a lot about philosophy.

39:47.333 --> 39:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We heard a lot during the
campaign for DNC chair about
this being a proxy between the

39:52.333 --> 39:54.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth
Warren wing and the
Hillary Clinton wing.

39:54.667 --> 39:59.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In reality, the number one
challenge for Tom Perez or any
DNC chairman is to get the party

40:01.100 --> 40:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back to winning, especially
at the legislative level.

40:03.133 --> 40:06.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Remember, redistricting
comes back up in 2020.

40:06.233 --> 40:10.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If Democrats want any shot
getting control of Congress,
getting a better map, if they

40:10.867 --> 40:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want to be able to start
controlling some of these state
legislative bodies, they have

40:15.000 --> 40:17.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
got to start winning
on the ground.

40:17.467 --> 40:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so unless and until
Democrats start to do
that, all this discussion
about philosophy

40:22.833 --> 40:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and direction of the party
don't mean very much.

40:24.733 --> 40:26.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He's
got his work cut out.

40:26.300 --> 40:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, absolutely.

40:28.400 --> 40:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also, just to note that this is
an organization that -- the DNC
itself was hacked in the last

40:34.567 --> 40:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
year and was completely rocked
by that hacking, and is simply
an organization that is back

40:40.367 --> 40:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on its heels and needs
to recover just simply
as an organization,
never mind the Democratic

40:44.700 --> 40:46.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Party more broadly.

40:46.667 --> 40:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, we
are talking about the Democrats
and Republicans tonight.

40:49.100 --> 40:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Amy, you wrote this week about
what you called divided America,
and you looked at how different

40:55.467 --> 40:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
groups of voters see
President Trump differently.

40:58.133 --> 41:00.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Give us a taste of that.

41:00.733 --> 41:02.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, Judy,
you know this quite well.

41:02.767 --> 41:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Usually, when a president comes
in -- he's only been in a month
-- he has something called

41:04.900 --> 41:06.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a honeymoon period.

41:06.833 --> 41:09.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This president didn't
even really get a
weekend at Niagara Falls.

41:09.767 --> 41:14.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He went from before a
very polarizing candidate
for president to being a
very polarizing president.

41:16.800 --> 41:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, to be fair, I went and I
looked and I said, well, where
was President Obama at this

41:20.033 --> 41:24.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
point -- not at this
point, but in his last
month of his presidency?

41:24.333 --> 41:29.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And we were almost as
polarized then by race,
by gender, by education.

41:31.333 --> 41:35.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And what we have seen
with President Trump
is the same fault lines
we saw on the campaign

41:35.400 --> 41:37.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
trail.

41:37.500 --> 41:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you are white, if you are
male, if you didn't attend
college, you have a stronger

41:43.367 --> 41:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
approval rating than if you're
female, if you're non-white,
if you attended college.

41:47.533 --> 41:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're a little bit bigger,
these gaps, than when President
Obama was in office, but the

41:52.200 --> 41:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bottom line is, Donald Trump
didn't invent polarized
America, but it is certainly as

41:59.233 --> 42:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
polarized, if not slightly
more, than even where we were
a year ago, or less than year

42:03.567 --> 42:05.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ago, a month ago.

42:05.567 --> 42:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it
seems like a hundred years
ago, or a minute ago.

42:08.533 --> 42:09.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I can't tell which.

42:09.533 --> 42:10.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:10.533 --> 42:12.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Both.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Tamara, you
got a close-up look at this.

42:14.067 --> 42:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You were on the ground in Saint
Louis, Missouri, this past week
talking to voters about it.

42:17.433 --> 42:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, and I
talked to a range of voters.

42:20.533 --> 42:24.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What really stood out
to me is, I interviewed
three Trump voters.

42:24.267 --> 42:27.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And they have three sort
of different views of
President Trump already.

42:27.833 --> 42:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have sort of the base,
core voter who is a factory
worker who lost his job about

42:33.800 --> 42:35.867 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a decade ago.

42:35.867 --> 42:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he loves everything Donald
Trump is doing, can't get enough
and loves it every time there

42:42.133 --> 42:44.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a bad headline, because
he thinks Donald Trump must
be doing something right.

42:44.167 --> 42:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His wife, on the other hand,
feels like the president moved
a little too fast with the

42:48.300 --> 42:50.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
executive orders.

42:50.400 --> 42:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then another Trump voter I
talked to said that he really
figured that the president

42:57.367 --> 42:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would be more presidential
when he came into office, and
he wants him to have a thicker

42:59.433 --> 43:01.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
skin and stop tweeting.

43:01.433 --> 43:06.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says, you know, we're
looking up to you with our eyes
hoping that you're going to

43:06.033 --> 43:07.467 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
help us.

43:07.467 --> 43:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We need to see more from you.

43:09.500 --> 43:13.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then I talked to one other
voter who voted for Hillary
Clinton, and she feels like he's

43:15.833 --> 43:18.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not her president and
that she's invisible.

43:18.367 --> 43:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So it's
interesting that, already,
these voters are forming
clearer impressions

43:25.100 --> 43:26.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of this president.

43:26.333 --> 43:28.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, in
that first month...

43:28.233 --> 43:29.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's not
fuzzy, in other words.

43:29.233 --> 43:30.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: It's not fuzzy.

43:30.667 --> 43:33.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have strong views of him.

43:33.267 --> 43:37.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's already sort of setting
in after just a month in office.

43:37.000 --> 43:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tamara Keith
of NPR, Amy Walter on the
road in Miami, thank you both.

43:41.533 --> 43:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

43:42.600 --> 43:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

43:44.633 --> 43:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, looking
ahead, please join us tomorrow
night for special "PBS NewsHour"

43:48.633 --> 43:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coverage of President
Trump's address to a
joint session of Congress.

43:53.033 --> 43:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It begins on Twitter at 7:00
p.m. Eastern and on your
local station at 9:00 p.m.

44:06.900 --> 44:11.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Next: a preview of a new
PBS documentary series,
"Africa's Great Civilizations."

44:21.067 --> 44:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Audie Cornish of NPR's "All
Things Considered" has our look.

44:25.200 --> 44:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: The history of
the African continent, home to
the 15 percent of the world's

44:29.733 --> 44:32.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
population, remains
a mystery for many.

44:32.667 --> 44:37.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Historian and Harvard Professor
Henry Louis Gates Jr. admits,
in his youth, it was a place

44:37.067 --> 44:39.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he rarely considered.

44:39.533 --> 44:43.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now he has a new PBS
documentary series that
reveals great moments in
the continent's pre-colonial

44:44.433 --> 44:45.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
history.

44:45.700 --> 44:47.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's called "Africa's
Great Civilizations."

44:47.633 --> 44:49.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He joins me now to
discuss that work.

44:49.767 --> 44:51.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Henry Louis Gates Jr.,
welcome to the program.

44:51.200 --> 44:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HENRY LOUIS GATES JR.,
Harvard University: Thanks.

44:52.133 --> 44:54.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for having me on.

44:54.300 --> 44:57.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AUDIE CORNISH: So, you
have tackled all kinds
of African-American
history, but this goes

44:57.433 --> 45:00.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all the way back, way
back to cave paintings.

45:00.200 --> 45:02.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, what was the
genesis of this idea?

45:02.200 --> 45:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HENRY LOUIS GATES JR.: I wanted
to do a comprehensive history
of Africa, and this is it.

45:08.100 --> 45:08.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have been thinking
about it five years.

45:08.967 --> 45:10.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Took us a year to shoot.

45:10.633 --> 45:13.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We went to 12 African countries.

45:13.267 --> 45:18.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's exhilarating,
six-hour series on 200,000
years of African history.

45:20.133 --> 45:22.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I was growing up, Africa
was a place to be avoided,
even for black people.

45:22.867 --> 45:27.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our images of Africa came
from Tarzan and Ramar
and Sheena of the jungle.

45:28.900 --> 45:30.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we were embarrassed
about Africa.

45:30.933 --> 45:32.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: As you
talked about the effort to
kind of distance, right?

45:32.267 --> 45:34.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was used as an insult
within the community.

45:34.467 --> 45:38.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HENRY LOUIS GATES JR.: You
black African, oh, my God,
that was like the N-word.

45:38.167 --> 45:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But all that changed for me.

45:40.600 --> 45:44.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It began to change in 1960,
when I was 10 years old,
and 17 African nations
became independent.

45:46.733 --> 45:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I had a very smart
geography teacher, Mr.
McHenry, our only male teacher.

45:51.600 --> 45:54.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And he was very much
into current events.

45:54.533 --> 45:56.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I was very much into
being a good student.

45:56.533 --> 46:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a lot of the current
events featured these emerging,
new African countries.

46:03.933 --> 46:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I mesmerized
romantic sounding, rhythmic
names like Masha Chubay
(ph) and Patrice Lumumba

46:08.800 --> 46:11.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and Mogadishu, words like that.

46:11.033 --> 46:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I became fascinated with
Africa, slowly, but surely
making my way to Africa when I

46:16.767 --> 46:18.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was 19 years old.

46:18.267 --> 46:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: I think we can
hear that in your introduction.

46:20.033 --> 46:21.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I want to play a clip of that.

46:21.467 --> 46:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HENRY LOUIS GATES JR.: OK.

46:23.433 --> 46:26.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Africa is the home
of the world's most
ancient civilizations.

46:26.567 --> 46:31.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Far to too often, Africa has
been thought of isolated and
static, but nothing could

46:34.533 --> 46:37.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be further from the truth.

46:37.067 --> 46:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The roots of every
family tree trace here to
Africa, and so does the
history of civilization.

46:46.133 --> 46:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In this series, we will be
going on a journey through
200,000 years of history.

46:53.100 --> 46:57.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will explore great cities
built along Africa's extensive
trade networks, discover art of

46:59.533 --> 47:04.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
unparalleled beauty,
technical brilliance,
and marvel at thousands
of years of breathtaking

47:06.567 --> 47:08.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
architecture.

47:08.700 --> 47:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: What struck me
watching this is that you use
words like merchants and trade

47:12.533 --> 47:14.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and engineering.

47:14.233 --> 47:16.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It seemed like you were
really trying to stress
the achievements here.

47:16.400 --> 47:18.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HENRY LOUIS GATES JR.: Mm-hmm.

47:18.400 --> 47:20.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Why do you
think those achievements
have been obscured?

47:20.400 --> 47:22.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HENRY LOUIS GATES JR.: I think
the achievements have been
obscured, first of all, because

47:22.467 --> 47:27.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of slavery -- 12.5 million
Africans were shipped across the
Atlantic Ocean between the 16th

47:31.567 --> 47:36.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
century and the 19th century,
12.5 million Africans shipped
to enslavement in the new

47:38.033 --> 47:40.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
world.

47:40.000 --> 47:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then after 1884 was the
conference in Berlin, when
European powers sat down, looked

47:45.967 --> 47:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at an empty map of Africa,
and basically carved it up
like you carve up a pizza pie.

47:49.100 --> 47:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they go, you're Spain.

47:50.200 --> 47:51.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you want?

47:51.200 --> 47:52.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You're Italy.

47:52.200 --> 47:53.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you want?

47:53.200 --> 47:54.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You're England.

47:54.200 --> 47:55.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you want?

47:55.200 --> 47:56.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You're King Leopold.

47:56.200 --> 47:58.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He personally got the Congo.

47:58.167 --> 48:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, they had to create a
fiction of Africa as an empty
place or a static place full of

48:00.433 --> 48:02.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
primitive people who
were stuck in time.

48:02.600 --> 48:06.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And those were
ostensibly our ancestors.

48:06.867 --> 48:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the pre-colonial world
knew all about Africa.

48:10.133 --> 48:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There wasn't a moment
really since the ancient
Egyptians when Northern
Africa, the Mediterranean

48:17.100 --> 48:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
world and the larger world
wasn't in touch with African
civilizations, with some part

48:22.433 --> 48:23.467 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Africa.

48:23.467 --> 48:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Red Sea was a highway.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The Nile was a highway.

48:27.433 --> 48:31.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Sahara was a highway,
particularly after
the domestication of
camels, and the Indian

48:32.167 --> 48:34.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Ocean, highways.

48:34.067 --> 48:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The emperor of great Zimbabwe
ate off porcelain plates
that came from China.

48:38.533 --> 48:40.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's the 13th century.

48:40.900 --> 48:42.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's incredible.

48:42.900 --> 48:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most of Europe's gold
between 1000 A.D. and 1500
A.D. came from West Africa.

48:48.233 --> 48:50.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
All our history
was stolen from us.

48:50.833 --> 48:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were robbed of a history
because Europeans wanted to
justify an economic order which

48:57.267 --> 48:59.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
depended upon our
ancestors' exploitation.

48:59.533 --> 49:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: It's almost as
though you are taking these
stories out of the footnotes

49:03.333 --> 49:05.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of history and elevating them.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HENRY LOUIS GATES JR.:
That's an excellent metaphor.

49:07.233 --> 49:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need for the facts of Africa
and African-American history to
be a normal, naturalized part of

49:13.700 --> 49:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the curriculum, to be moved from
the footnotes up into the text.

49:17.500 --> 49:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Black History Month is
great, but we need every day
to be Black History Month.

49:21.833 --> 49:23.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And what does that mean?

49:23.800 --> 49:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you take a course in
the history of civilization,
Africa should be there as well.

49:27.133 --> 49:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm not talking about
mythic claims that won't
stand scholarly scrutiny.

49:34.533 --> 49:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean facts about the
history of the world
which every educated
person should know about.

49:40.233 --> 49:42.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Knowing your history
is empowering.

49:42.133 --> 49:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Africa stands poised
on the birth of resurgence,
a new renaissance.

49:46.300 --> 49:51.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you said, 15 percent of the
world's population lives on
the great African continent.

49:53.333 --> 49:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And knowing about this rich and
splendid history will be crucial
to the individual self-esteem

49:58.900 --> 50:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of every African and to the
collective, as it were, sense
of itself of the African people.

50:04.900 --> 50:07.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Henry Louis
Gates Jr., thank you so much
for speaking with us about this

50:07.267 --> 50:08.767 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
project.

50:08.767 --> 50:10.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HENRY LOUIS GATES JR.: Thank you
for having me on the program.

50:10.800 --> 50:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The series runs
tonight, tomorrow, and Wednesday
at 9:00 p.m./8:00 Central on

50:16.267 --> 50:21.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
most PBS stations.

50:27.033 --> 50:31.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now to our "NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught our eye
that might be of interest to

50:31.167 --> 50:33.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you, too.

50:33.200 --> 50:37.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
February is Hockey Is for
Everyone Month in the National
Hockey League, and one woman

50:38.667 --> 50:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
traveled all the way from Abu
Dhabi to join the celebration.

50:41.600 --> 50:44.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s Julia Griffin
caught up with her on the ice.

50:44.267 --> 50:48.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Though you
wouldn't expect it, given her
country's climate, Fatima Al

50:48.467 --> 50:51.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ali is an ace on the ice.

50:51.367 --> 50:56.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The 27-year-old is from
the United Arab Emirates
and is shattering
preconceptions of what a

50:57.267 --> 50:59.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hockey player looks like.

50:59.267 --> 51:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Al Ali picked up a hockey stick
for the first just six years
ago, but her puck-handling

51:05.700 --> 51:08.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
skills have already earned
her a spot on the UAE's
women's national team.

51:10.900 --> 51:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In November, those skills caught
the eye of former Washington
Capitals star Peter Bondra.

51:16.600 --> 51:18.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER BONDRA, Former NHL
Player: I played the game
professionally for 23 years.

51:18.600 --> 51:19.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if I tried to do the stuff
which she does, I have to
learn, and I'm not sure exactly

51:19.767 --> 51:22.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
how it be accomplished,
just to be honest.

51:23.900 --> 51:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Bondra was
so impressed by Al Ali's
abilities that he posted a video

51:30.133 --> 51:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Twitter, saying, "She
has better hands than me."

51:34.700 --> 51:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That video went viral, and a
few weeks later, he surprised
Al Ali with a dream trip to meet

51:40.300 --> 51:41.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Caps.

51:41.567 --> 51:43.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Coincidentally, that's
her favorite NHL team.

51:43.667 --> 51:46.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PETER BONDRA: February
is a month for of
Hockey for Everyone.

51:46.967 --> 51:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think you will be a
great ambassador for this.

51:49.200 --> 51:53.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: For soft-spoken
Al Ali, taking the ice with the
team was a thrill of a lifetime.

51:53.967 --> 51:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FATIMA AL ALI, Hockey
Player: It's not expected.

51:56.433 --> 51:58.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's just unbelievable.

51:58.167 --> 52:00.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Over the
next hour, the rink was
a level playing field.

52:00.767 --> 52:05.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she wasted no time sliding
into drills and scoring goals.

52:09.633 --> 52:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Al Ali's idol, Caps captain Alex
Ovechkin, praised her talent.

52:13.533 --> 52:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
®MD-BALEX OVECHKIN, Washington
Capitals: She's going to be
famous and she's going to

52:14.533 --> 52:16.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be a star.

52:16.533 --> 52:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: But Al Ali
doesn't just impress male
counterparts here in the U.S.

52:23.067 --> 52:26.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She also holds her own back
home as a men's games referee.

52:26.400 --> 52:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FATIMA AL ALI: I had two
fights before coming here.

52:28.733 --> 52:30.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The first one ended up bad.

52:30.367 --> 52:32.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I got punched in the
face with, but I kept -
- I finished the game.

52:32.800 --> 52:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then the second fight,
they told me how to break the
fight, so I was just pulling

52:38.600 --> 52:40.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
them from their pants.

52:40.633 --> 52:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: No matter what
side of the puck she is on,
Al Ali hopes she can be a

52:45.300 --> 52:47.367 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
role model.

52:47.367 --> 52:50.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FATIMA AL ALI: I hope
that I can inspire enough
people, or at least women.

52:50.800 --> 52:53.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Have a dream, just
go make it come true.

52:53.600 --> 52:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Fitting advice
for pursuing goals from a woman
who excels at scoring them.

53:00.200 --> 53:03.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Julia Griffin
in Washington, D.C.

53:03.200 --> 53:07.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And an
inspiration for a lot of little
girls looking at hockey.

53:07.867 --> 53:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online right
now, we take a look inside the
secret process that's supposed

53:12.833 --> 53:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to prevent mishaps at the
Academy Awards like the one that
occurred last night over the

53:17.733 --> 53:19.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
best picture award.

53:19.733 --> 53:24.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We also have a trove
of conversations with
the filmmakers and
artists behind the award

53:24.533 --> 53:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
season's most acclaimed movies.

53:27.100 --> 53:31.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can find all of our
coverage in our Beyond the
Red Carpet series on our
Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:35.167 --> 53:37.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

53:37.200 --> 53:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Tuesday, a reminder: We will
have special coverage of the
president's speech to a joint

53:41.433 --> 53:43.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
session of Congress.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:45.067 --> 53:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank you,
and we will see you soon.
