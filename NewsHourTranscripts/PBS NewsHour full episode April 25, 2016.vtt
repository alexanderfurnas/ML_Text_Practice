a choice between a party insider
and an insurgent

00:24.691 --> 00:29.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- how Maryland's Democratic

mirrors the Democratic contest
for president.

00:29.296 --> 00:35.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And one year
after a deadly
earthquake in Nepal kills 8,000,
we examine

00:35.669 --> 00:39.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the struggles to rebuild amid
poverty and
political instability.

millions of dollars that were
raised that

00:44.077 --> 00:50.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still have not been deployed and
could be
and should be given to people so
they could

00:50.384 --> 00:52.252 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rebuild.

00:52.352 --> 00:54.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Plus, Beyonce

latest album, "Lemonade," and

JUDY WOODRUFF: The Republican
presidential
race is suddenly boiling again
over a deal

01:17.678 --> 01:23.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to deny the nomination to the
front-runner.
The news came last night that
John Kasich

01:23.150 --> 01:27.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Ted Cruz will give each
other a clear
path in selected states.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The response came today.

01:29.790 --> 01:33.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Did you see the news today? Did
you see where

01:33.193 --> 01:37.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they band together, where they
collude? You
know, it's collusion.

01:37.531 --> 01:43.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Donald Trump had
already blasted
his rivals in late-night tweets.
Today, he

01:43.270 --> 01:45.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
railed against them in Rhode
Island.

01:45.172 --> 01:49.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: If you collude in
business or
if you collude in the stock
market, they put

01:49.176 --> 01:55.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you in jail. But, in politics,
because it's
a rigged system, because it's a
corrupt enterprise,

01:55.916 --> 01:58.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in politics, you're allowed to
collude.

01:58.585 --> 02:04.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Cruz-Kasich

calls for the Texas senator to

Cruz reveled in the opportunity
to go head-to-head

02:18.772 --> 02:20.607 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with Trump in the May 3 primary.

02:20.707 --> 02:23.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
I understand that Donald will
whine. That

02:24.077 --> 02:32.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is what he does. Donald is a
sore loser. I
get that the Trump campaign is
scared. They're

02:32.252 --> 02:34.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
scared of Indiana.

02:34.154 --> 02:39.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kasich campaigned
in Philadelphia,
painting the agreement as
nothing out of the

02:39.393 --> 02:41.128 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ordinary.

02:41.228 --> 02:43.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate:
What's the big deal? We're going
to go to

02:43.196 --> 02:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a convention. It's going to be
an open convention
and then the delegates will pick
that person

02:47.100 --> 02:49.002 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who can do the best in the fall.

02:49.102 --> 02:54.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All of which had
Trump stepping
up the insults. He called Kasich
a stubborn

02:54.908 --> 03:02.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
child who eats in a disgusting
fashion. And
he dismissed Cruz as a basket
case.

03:02.783 --> 03:07.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrat Hillary Clinton took
her own shots
at Trump as she stumped in
Wilmington, Delaware.

03:07.354 --> 03:10.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),

If you want to be president of
the United

03:10.557 --> 03:17.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States, you have got to get
familiar with
the United States. Don't just
fly that big

03:17.230 --> 03:23.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
jet in and land it and go make a
big speech
and insult everybody you can
think of.

03:23.570 --> 03:28.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton's
increasingly long-shot
rival, Bernie Sanders,
campaigned through

03:29.042 --> 03:32.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Connecticut and Pennsylvania,

03:33.046 --> 03:35.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),

In fact, if you look at some of
the national

03:35.348 --> 03:38.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
polls in the last couple weeks,
guess what?
We're winning a few of them.

03:38.351 --> 03:40.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:40.153 --> 03:43.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Turns out
that in all
the national polls and the state
polls, we

03:43.990 --> 03:46.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are 15, 20 points ahead of
Trump.

03:46.626 --> 03:52.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Both Sanders and
Clinton will
appear in town halls in
Philadelphia tonight.

03:52.332 --> 03:55.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will analyze all of this

of faults or facts or anything,
that shouldn't

04:16.756 --> 04:22.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have happened. And, believe me,
if I had my
rathers, I wouldn't be standing
here in front

04:22.462 --> 04:26.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of you today talking about this.
If I had
my rathers, it would not have
happened. But

04:27.067 --> 04:34.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's not the case, is it? So,
we deal with

05:17.484 --> 05:23.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ambitions will encompass
unemployment, housing,

is how we develop

05:23.456 --> 05:28.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the economy and how we can
create an attractive
and great environment in our
country, and

05:28.528 --> 05:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be part of development on

05:46.880 --> 05:53.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
largest oil terminal from

the facility a day after taking
Mukalla along

05:53.687 --> 05:59.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the southwestern coast. Al-Qaida
had established
a mini-state in that part of
Yemen, as the

05:59.359 --> 06:01.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

06:01.328 --> 06:05.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

just a week after a Taliban

06:14.140 --> 06:19.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ASHRAF GHANI, President of
Afghanistan (through

Pakistan to bring

06:19.980 --> 06:25.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Taliban into peace talks. We
want Pakistan
to stand by what they pledged
and to conduct

06:25.385 --> 06:30.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
military operations against
Taliban bases
and leadership, who, according
to our intelligence,

according to Pakistani

fueled by drug gangs, has
claimed another

06:45.939 --> 06:51.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%

the country's southwest, the
latest in a series

06:51.144 --> 06:57.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of such attacks. And on Sunday,
an independent
panel accused the Mexican
government of undermining

06:57.350 --> 07:02.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a probe into the deaths of 43
college students.
They disappeared in 2014.

agreement with

07:06.826 --> 07:10.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Europe as he wrapped up a visit

He and Chancellor Angela Merkel
toured the

07:11.031 --> 07:15.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world's largest industrial
technology trade
fair in Hannover and tested some
of the wares.

07:16.002 --> 07:19.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They included virtual reality
glasses complete
with plastic googly eyes.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

what it looked
like.

07:22.909 --> 07:27.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, Wall Street's week got off
to a sluggish
start. The Dow Jones industrial
average lost

07:27.747 --> 07:35.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
26 points to close at 17977. The
Nasdaq fell
10, and the S&amp;P 500 slipped
three.

07:35.155 --> 07:39.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And a federal
appeals court
panel has restored a four-game
suspension

07:39.559 --> 07:44.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for New England Patriots
quarterback Tom Brady.
It stems from his use of
underinflated footballs

07:44.931 --> 07:50.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the 2015 conference

JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
the president orders 250 more
military personnel

07:57.243 --> 08:02.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Syria; two Democrats fight it
out for a
U.S. Senate seat in Maryland, a
microcosm

08:02.148 --> 08:08.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the national intraparty
divide; Nepal's
reconstruction one year after a
devastating

08:08.955 --> 08:14.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
earthquake; and much more.

08:14.627 --> 08:26.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: More American
troops are
heading for Syria as the U.S.
looks to press

08:26.373 --> 08:30.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fight against ISIS. This
comes just days
after the secretary of defense
announced the

08:30.844 --> 08:34.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deployment of additional forces
to Iraq to
take on the militants there.

08:34.981 --> 08:39.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
I have approved the deployment
of up to 250

08:39.119 --> 08:43.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
additional U.S. personnel in
Syria, including
special forces, to keep up this
momentum.

08:43.189 --> 08:47.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: With that,
President Obama
pledged to boost the number of
American troops

08:47.360 --> 08:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inside Syria by five-fold. Most
are special
forces, and the president said
again to PBS

08:53.233 --> 08:57.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and CBS News host Charlie Rose
they won't
be in a combat role.

08:57.137 --> 09:02.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Although we are
not going to
be sending ground troops in to
fight, we are

09:02.142 --> 09:08.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to try to find out what
works and then
double down. And one of the
things that's

09:08.648 --> 09:14.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worked so far is us putting
special forces
in for training and advising of
local forces,

09:14.921 --> 09:16.790 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but also intelligence-gathering.

09:16.890 --> 09:21.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The first 50
special forces
troops deployed to Syria last
fall. They have

09:21.694 --> 09:25.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
helped opposition fighters make
gains, and
the Pentagon says one of the
goals now is

09:25.432 --> 09:28.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to capture Raqqa, the Islamic
State's de facto
capital.

09:28.401 --> 09:32.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER COOK, Pentagon Press
Secretary: And
we think this deployment will
certainly help

09:32.939 --> 09:38.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to amp the pressure even higher
at a critical
time and perhaps, again, speed
up the overall

09:38.244 --> 09:42.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
timeline for when we might be
able to retake
-- when these forces can retake
Raqqa.

09:42.248 --> 09:46.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Turkey has
also exchanged
artillery fire with ISIS along
its southern

09:46.953 --> 09:51.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
border. Meanwhile, the
cease-fire in Syria's
other war, between government
forces and rebel

09:51.891 --> 09:57.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
groups, is unraveling. In recent
days, fighting
has erupted around contested
Aleppo, the country's

09:57.497 --> 09:59.499 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
largest city.

09:59.599 --> 10:04.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Opposition groups say government
airstrikes
killed dozens of people there
over the weekend.

10:05.004 --> 10:08.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Around
five people
died. I carried two dead, one
woman from this

10:08.942 --> 10:13.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
location and a man from nearby.
The attacks
on Aleppo in this latest period
have been

10:13.413 --> 10:15.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fierce and strong.

10:15.181 --> 10:19.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The resumption
in heavy
fighting has all but derailed
U.N. efforts

10:19.118 --> 10:23.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at peace talks in Geneva. U.N.
mediators met
with Syrian government officials
today, but

10:23.990 --> 10:28.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the main opposition group backed
out of the
discussions last week.

10:28.695 --> 10:32.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on all this, I'm joined
now by Andrew
Tabler of the Washington
Institute. He's in

10:32.465 --> 10:36.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Moscow learning more about
Russia's role in
Syria. And Nancy Youssef, she is
the senior

10:36.936 --> 10:39.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
national security correspondent
for The Daily
Beast.

10:39.539 --> 10:41.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Nancy, let me start with you.

10:41.541 --> 10:44.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's the purpose of these
additional troops?
What are they going to be doing
on the ground?

10:44.544 --> 10:48.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY YOUSSEF, The Daily Beast:
There are
upwards of 250 special forces
and support

10:48.448 --> 10:55.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
staff, medical staff and
otherwise, and their
job there is to build a capable,
bigger, stronger

10:56.022 --> 11:01.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syrian democratic force that
could potentially
and eventually go in reclaim the
city of Raqqa,

11:01.928 --> 11:04.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Islamic State's capital in
Syria.

11:04.631 --> 11:08.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their mission is twofold, to
work with Kurdish
forces and provide them with
support, and

11:08.902 --> 11:12.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then to also find Arab forces
who will work
with the Kurds. Because Raqqa is
an Arab city,

11:12.906 --> 11:17.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. military believe that Arab
fighters should
be in to reclaim the city and
lead the fight

11:17.210 --> 11:18.611 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to reclaim Raqqa.

11:18.711 --> 11:20.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Andrew,
strategically, how
likely is that to happen?

11:20.547 --> 11:22.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW TABLER, Fellow,
Washington Institute
for Near East Policy: The Kurds
are quite

11:22.815 --> 11:28.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strong fighters. They lack
depth, particularly
demographic depth among the Arab
populations

11:28.721 --> 11:30.557 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in Raqqa.

11:30.657 --> 11:36.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why, as Nancy said, the
Syrian democratic
forces is a way to get those
Arab forces to

11:36.930 --> 11:42.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work together with the Kurds and
hopefully
oust, eventually, the Islamic
State from Raqqa.

11:42.268 --> 11:46.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Nancy, is the
Pentagon concerned
about the increased military
activity that's

11:46.472 --> 11:50.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been happening from Russia right
now just
in the past few weeks?

11:50.176 --> 11:52.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NANCY YOUSSEF: Some people are
and some people
aren't.

11:52.245 --> 11:57.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're having a hard time
really assessing
with certainty whether this is
an attempt

11:57.216 --> 12:01.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
by the Russians to really
escalate their presence
in Syria or this is a rotational
movement

12:01.554 --> 12:07.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's happening now, that
they're not seeing
what portends of a full-fledged
assault. While

12:07.126 --> 12:11.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're seeing incremental
increases by the
Russians, they're also seeing
the withdrawal

12:11.864 --> 12:13.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of some of their assault
aircraft.

12:13.766 --> 12:18.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there has been a lot of sort
of wait and
see in terms of assessing the
Russian movement

12:18.137 --> 12:22.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Syria and what it means. This
all comes
in the backdrop of a cessation
of hostilities

12:22.542 --> 12:26.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agreement that appears to be in
peril. And
so, because of that, it's been
hard to make,

12:26.846 --> 12:31.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from what I hear in the
Pentagon, definitive
assessments on what the Russians
are doing

12:31.150 --> 12:32.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Syria right now.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Andrew Tabler,
what's behind
some of these moves where the
Russians seem

12:36.022 --> 12:38.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be pulling some equipment
back and putting
other equipment in?

12:38.925 --> 12:42.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW TABLER: Well, there is a
real concern
about the negotiations that are
going on in

12:42.629 --> 12:49.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Geneva. They felt previously
that President
Assad perhaps received too much
Russian support.

12:49.135 --> 12:52.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was becoming increasingly
rigid in his
negotiating positions.

12:52.438 --> 12:55.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They were a little bit
disappointed with him
on the battlefield as well. He
only gained

12:55.341 --> 13:04.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about 5 percent back of Syrian
territory over
the last few months. But, in
reality, someone

13:04.651 --> 13:09.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
among the opposition has shot
down three regime
planes in the last two months.

13:09.355 --> 13:14.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's the reason
why we have
seen some Russian aircraft
cycled out of Syria

13:14.627 --> 13:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and some helicopters with some
countermeasures
brought in that can make their
forces more

13:20.333 --> 13:22.068 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
effective.

13:22.168 --> 13:25.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Nancy, is
there concern
in the Pentagon right now that
this could

13:25.605 --> 13:30.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
draw out into something much
longer? I mean,
the phrase usually has been
mission creep

13:30.309 --> 13:31.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or resource creep.

13:32.078 --> 13:35.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NANCY YOUSSEF: Well, the
military doesn't
really embrace the idea of the
term mission

13:35.615 --> 13:39.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
creep, but you are starting to
hear the term
resource creep, because the
reality is this

13:39.585 --> 13:42.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strategy against the Islamic
State hasn't
changed.

13:42.588 --> 13:46.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The goal is to degrade and
ultimately defeat
ISIS, as the president spelled
out in September

13:46.592 --> 13:51.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
2014. The resources keep
changing towards
that. And so there is some
frustration in

13:51.631 --> 13:55.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the Pentagon about the
incrementalism of the
deployment of troops.

13:55.468 --> 13:59.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some are even openly asking
what would
have happened had, instead of
sending 200

13:59.439 --> 14:04.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here and 200 there, 1,000 or
2,000 had been
deployed earlier on? Would the
war against

14:04.177 --> 14:06.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Islamic State being going
quicker?

14:06.112 --> 14:11.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so, today, you really
started to hear
the phrase resource creep about
whether sending

14:11.350 --> 14:16.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in troops incrementally is less
for military
reasons and more for political,
and whether

14:16.389 --> 14:22.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that calculation is actually
delaying or slowing
down the effort to defeat the
Islamic State.

14:22.695 --> 14:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Andrew Tabler,
also, the
city of Aleppo right now, a
large city in

14:26.666 --> 14:29.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syria, it seems to be almost
poised for a
significant onslaught.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANDREW TABLER: That's right.

14:31.838 --> 14:35.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
During the cessation of
hostilities which
is not a cease-fire, there has
been a lot

14:35.374 --> 14:39.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of fighting and a lot of raids,
particularly
by the regime, to close the ring
around Aleppo.

14:39.779 --> 14:44.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We think that they intend to
close it and
then squeeze, which will then
expel people

14:44.317 --> 14:47.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the neighboring areas and
also create
a huge humanitarian disaster.

14:47.653 --> 14:53.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The question is, will the
Russians go along
with it or will they hold back
as negotiations

14:53.960 --> 14:58.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
continue in Geneva? But since
those negotiations
aren't going well, we will have
to wait and

14:58.965 --> 15:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see what the Russians choose in
the coming
days.

15:01.300 --> 15:05.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Nancy, it
seems the military
has a couple of different lines
of thinking

15:05.571 --> 15:10.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here. On the one side, there's
the Assad regime,
and there's the ISIS attacks,
right? So how

15:10.543 --> 15:14.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do they deploy their military
resources effectively
enough?

15:14.580 --> 15:18.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY YOUSSEF: What you're
seeing is a real
focus on the defeat of the
Islamic State from

15:18.551 --> 15:20.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a military perspective.

15:20.486 --> 15:24.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You will hear that said
repeatedly. And the
deployment of these forces both
in Iraq and

15:24.657 --> 15:30.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syria sort of suggest that. In
Iraq, you have
had more forces moved along the
route to Mosul,

15:30.196 --> 15:35.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is ISIS' capital in Iraq.
And in Syria,
these forces are going to be
going in the

15:35.935 --> 15:40.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
northeast corner of Syria, where
Kurdish forces
have been able to move toward
Raqqa.

15:40.706 --> 15:45.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so militarily you're seeing
a focus on
the defeat of the Islamic State
and not a

15:45.478 --> 15:49.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
focus on the Assad regime. That
may be Russia's
focus, but there has been a real
effort by

15:49.382 --> 15:53.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Pentagon to keep the focus
on the defeat
of that terror group.

15:53.486 --> 15:56.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Andrew, when
you talk about
these -- not just the peace
talks that don't

15:57.089 --> 16:00.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seem to be going well or the
cessation that
isn't going well, that tension
between the

16:01.093 --> 16:04.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States and Russia right
now on trying
to go on these multiple fronts
and trying

16:04.964 --> 16:06.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to get cooperation from the
Russians?

16:06.599 --> 16:08.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANDREW TABLER: That's right.

16:08.601 --> 16:13.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's strange. You know, in
Syria, we're negotiating
with Russia, and also trying --
the Russians

16:13.840 --> 16:19.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
desperately want military
cooperation in Syria
as well, at the same time that
planes are

16:19.278 --> 16:21.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
buzzing our battleships in the
Baltic Sea.

16:21.447 --> 16:24.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Andrew Tabler
joining us from Moscow, Nancy
Youssef of The

16:24.517 --> 16:29.722 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Daily Beast, thanks so much.

16:29.822 --> 16:34.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NANCY YOUSSEF: Thank you.

16:34.794 --> 16:41.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tomorrow, voters
will go to
the polls in five East Coast
states to choose

16:41.667 --> 16:44.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their party's nominee to be the
next president.

16:44.403 --> 16:50.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in Maryland, it's the
Democratic primary
race to replace longtime U.S.
Senator Barbara

16:50.643 --> 16:56.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mikulski that is dominating the
headlines,
and exposing some of the same
divisions playing

16:56.282 --> 16:59.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out in the national Democratic
contest for
president.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has our report.

17:01.587 --> 17:08.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: At a rally for
striking Verizon
workers, two candidates for the
Maryland Democratic

17:08.561 --> 17:15.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senate nomination appealed to a
key constituency:
organized labor.

17:15.134 --> 17:19.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donna Edwards was elected to
Congress the
same year Barack Obama was
elected the first

17:19.739 --> 17:21.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
African-American president.

17:21.674 --> 17:26.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. DONNA EDWARDS (D-MD),
Senatorial Candidate:
I think it is time for Verizon
exclusives

17:26.746 --> 17:28.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to set aside their $1.8 billion
a month. I
can't even conceive that.

17:29.015 --> 17:35.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: She's running as a
fresh face challenging
the establishment.

17:35.221 --> 17:39.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chris Van Hollen is a seven-term
member of
Congress from a wealthy
Washington suburb,

17:39.992 --> 17:42.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a member of his party's
leadership in the
House.

17:42.228 --> 17:45.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD),
Senatorial Candidate:
Who do you think is responsible
for generating

17:45.464 --> 17:48.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all those profits? You are
responsible.

17:48.134 --> 17:53.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The two are locked in
an unexpectedly
close race. Analysts say it
mirrors tensions

17:53.873 --> 17:59.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the presidential contest
between mainstream
Democrats backing Hillary
Clinton and supporters

17:59.278 --> 18:03.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Bernie Sanders, who feel left
out of the
political process.

18:03.683 --> 18:08.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whoever wins the Democratic
primary will be
the overwhelming favorite in the
fall to succeed

18:08.955 --> 18:14.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Barbara Mikulski, the
longest-serving female
senator. In Maryland, registered
Democrats

18:14.961 --> 18:17.964 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
outnumber Republicans 2-1.

18:18.064 --> 18:23.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Van Hollen believes he's the
natural heir
to Mikulski's legacy, a rising
star in the

18:23.536 --> 18:29.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
party, a protege of Democratic
Leader Nancy
Pelosi who helped push Obamacare
through Congress.

18:29.342 --> 18:33.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REP. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: My
argument is that
there is a big difference
between simply voting

18:33.245 --> 18:38.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a certain way on issues and
actually doing
the hard work to get results. I
have always

18:38.384 --> 18:44.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recognized that, when you have
divided government,
you fight hard and to the finish
to protect

18:45.057 --> 18:48.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things that should never be
touched, like
a woman's right to choose, but
you also look

18:48.761 --> 18:52.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for common ground to try to make
sure that
the country can move forward, if
not 100 yards

18:52.765 --> 18:54.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at a time, five, 10 yards at a
time.

18:55.067 --> 19:01.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Edwards says she
would bring a
unique and much-needed voice as
only the second

19:01.540 --> 19:04.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
African-American woman ever to
serve in the
Senate.

19:04.110 --> 19:08.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. DONNA EDWARDS: I don't hide
the fact
that I'm an African-American
woman. I raised

19:08.881 --> 19:12.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my son mostly on my own when I
was growing
up. And it gives me a
perspective about issues

19:12.852 --> 19:17.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that impact working people and
working families
that is distinct from any that
is present

19:17.723 --> 19:19.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the United States Senate
right now.

19:19.458 --> 19:22.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: Powerful interests
don't want Democrat
Donna Edwards.

19:22.328 --> 19:25.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: National progressive
groups have
stepped in with television ads
supporting

19:25.931 --> 19:28.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Edwards to counter Van Hollen's
fund-raising
edge.

19:28.901 --> 19:34.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. DONNA EDWARDS: I have
worked with the
Progressive Caucus. I have
supported progressive

19:35.074 --> 19:39.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
budgets, none of which my
opponent has done.
And so I don't think it's a
great surprise.

19:39.812 --> 19:42.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Long before I came into
Congress, I was a
progressive, and long after I
leave, I will

19:43.049 --> 19:44.550 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
be.

19:44.650 --> 19:47.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Van Hollen has
responded by emphasizing
his own progressive roots.

19:47.253 --> 19:50.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: We have
got the Maryland
progressives because, in
Maryland, progressives

19:51.023 --> 19:54.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are actually interested in
getting results.
They're not interested in sound
bites. They're

19:54.927 --> 19:58.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not interested in rhetoric.
They're interested
in results. They're interested
in seeing measurable

19:59.065 --> 20:02.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
progress. And I'm proud to have
a record of
doing that.

20:02.968 --> 20:08.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The choice between
two candidates
who are otherwise so similar on
policy issues

20:08.140 --> 20:11.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and voting records has torn many
Maryland
Democrats.

20:11.644 --> 20:13.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: I like both of them. I
like where they
both stand.

20:13.646 --> 20:16.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Toni Price (ph) is a
striking Verizon
worker.

20:16.348 --> 20:20.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Donna Edwards, I have
talked to her
a number of times, and we have a
lot in common.

20:20.853 --> 20:25.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think they both can get the
job done, but
I am leaning more toward
Edwards.

20:25.157 --> 20:27.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Leepo Yu is a Van
Hollen volunteer.

20:27.960 --> 20:33.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEEPO YU, Van Hollen Volunteer:
I would like
to see a female senator, but, on
the other

20:33.866 --> 20:41.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hand, we have the issues, the
pros and cons.
And I think Van Hollen will be
ready day one.

20:41.507 --> 20:47.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The state's largest
city has emerged
as the key battleground. Polls
show both candidates

20:47.913 --> 20:52.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
handily winning their home
districts in the
Washington suburbs. The race
could be decided

20:52.985 --> 20:57.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here in Baltimore, played out
against the
backdrop of the death last year
of Freddie

20:57.857 --> 21:01.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gray, fatally injured while in
police custody.

21:01.427 --> 21:06.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Voters will go the polls one
year to the week
after the demonstrations against
police turned

21:06.398 --> 21:09.168 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
violent.

21:09.268 --> 21:13.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Reverend Jamal Bryant, a
Baltimore community
leader, delivered Gray's eulogy.
We spoke

21:13.973 --> 21:16.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with him on the anniversary of
Gray's death.

21:16.242 --> 21:21.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. JAMAL BRYANT, Empowerment
Temple Church:
I think that America is in a
place of change.

21:21.180 --> 21:25.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People are looking for someone
different,
somebody who is not afraid to
challenge the

21:25.518 --> 21:28.120 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
system, who is not part of the
old boy network.

21:28.220 --> 21:33.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What happened a year
ago, a year
ago today, does that make it
more urgent,

21:33.626 --> 21:37.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
more necessary for
representation by someone
like Donna Edwards?

21:37.763 --> 21:43.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. JAMAL BRYANT: I think it's
a reminder
of what's left undone, that
given our current

21:43.769 --> 21:49.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crisis, a Band-Aid doesn't take
the place
of open heart surgery. I just
think that America,

21:49.575 --> 21:53.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, all the more, Baltimore is
looking for
a new voice and a new face.

21:53.546 --> 21:57.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YVETTE LEWIS, Former Maryland
Democratic Party
Chair: We cannot sit back and
say this is

21:57.183 --> 21:58.984 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

21:59.084 --> 22:02.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Making history with a
new voice
and a new face doesn't motivate
former Maryland

22:02.388 --> 22:07.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democratic Party Chair Yvette
Lewis, an African-American
voter backing Van Hollen.

22:07.593 --> 22:12.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YVETTE LEWIS: I think that votes
are too important
to be reduced to a demographic,
whether it's

22:12.965 --> 22:18.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
race or gender. I think votes
need to be given
to those people who have earned
it and who

22:18.871 --> 22:22.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have shown that they will
deliver the results
for their constituents. I don't
think you

22:22.641 --> 22:26.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
necessarily need to look like me
in order
to do what's best for me.

22:26.312 --> 22:33.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: A big challenge for
Van Hollen
is convincing black voters that
he can represent

22:33.352 --> 22:35.187 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
them effectively.

22:35.287 --> 22:39.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REP. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN:
Regardless of race,
regardless of background,
ethnicity, or gender,

22:39.959 --> 22:44.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people want somebody who is
going to be able
to deliver results on issues
that matter to

22:44.230 --> 22:46.765 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their community.

22:46.866 --> 22:54.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Whoever wins on
Tuesday, the dynamics
of this race have already
reshaped the debate

22:55.040 --> 23:00.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
within the Democratic Party,
broadening the
issues being discussed and the
people discussing

23:00.446 --> 23:01.480 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

23:01.580 --> 23:04.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang in Baltimore.

23:04.750 --> 23:10.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And on the eve of
the Northeast
primaries, now is the perfect
time for Politics

23:10.522 --> 23:12.358 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Monday.

23:12.458 --> 23:17.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amy Walter of The Cook Political
Report joins
me here. Tamara Keith of NPR is
in Philadelphia.

23:18.030 --> 23:19.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we welcome both of you.

23:19.798 --> 23:23.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Amy, let's pivot back to the
headline
on the Republican side. And that
is Ted Cruz

23:24.036 --> 23:30.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and John Kasich colluding, in
Donald Trump's
words, getting together to try
to divide up

23:30.142 --> 23:36.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the next few states, not
tomorrow, but next
week, to try to undercut Trump.
Is this a

23:36.181 --> 23:37.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
smart thing on their part?

23:38.050 --> 23:39.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: You
know that saying, Judy, about
the horse in

23:39.918 --> 23:42.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the barn and closing the barn
door after the
horse has gone out?

23:42.855 --> 23:48.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It feels as if this was a really
smart strategy
maybe a month ago, but now it's
really too

23:48.227 --> 23:51.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
late. We have gone through 43
contests, and
they're now deciding that by
they should come

23:51.530 --> 23:53.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
together. We only have 13 left.

23:53.465 --> 23:58.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, I think what we're in,
we're in a phase
right now that I'm calling
momentum vs. math,

23:58.504 --> 24:03.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the reality is the math is
working against
Donald Trump in some ways. There
is a way

24:03.509 --> 24:11.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in which Kasich and Cruz could
stop, prevent
Donald Trump from getting the
1,237 delegates

24:11.317 --> 24:16.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he needs to be the nominee or to
get it on
the very first ballot in
Cleveland in July,

24:16.388 --> 24:19.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but the momentum is with Donald
Trump right
now.

24:19.158 --> 24:22.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is expected to do very well
tomorrow night
in the primaries. He's going to
come out with

24:22.795 --> 24:27.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a head of steam. He's going to
come out with
a lot of votes and with the most
delegates

24:27.333 --> 24:32.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going into the convention. It's
going to get
harder and harder for the math
argument to

24:32.671 --> 24:34.373 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
win over the momentum argument.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tamara, what do
you think?
Does this make sense? And we
should point

24:36.775 --> 24:43.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out that today, after this
agreement was cut,
you had John Kasich saying,
well, I still

24:43.182 --> 24:45.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
expect people in Indiana to vote
for me.

24:45.884 --> 24:49.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Right.
So it's not clear how strong
this agreement

24:49.855 --> 24:55.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really is. In some ways, it
might just be
a Bat Signal to the super PACs
to say, hey,

24:55.227 --> 24:58.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
super PACs, put your emphasis
over here, put
your emphasis over there.

24:58.964 --> 25:03.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In California, I know that the
never Trump
movement or -- well, movement
may not be the

25:04.002 --> 25:08.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right word, but the people
working on the
never Trump campaign are going
to be going

25:09.007 --> 25:15.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
congressional district by
congressional district
very soon, telling voters
directly which way,

25:15.114 --> 25:18.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which candidate they think they
should vote
for if they want to have the
best chance to

25:19.084 --> 25:23.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
stop Trump, congressional
district by congressional
district, because that's the way
delegates

25:23.722 --> 25:25.557 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are allocated.

25:25.657 --> 25:30.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But it's really not clear
whether in California
or Indiana or New Mexico or
Oregon whether

25:30.362 --> 25:36.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is really, truly going to
work, or whether
Donald Trump already has such a
prohibitive

25:36.201 --> 25:37.903 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lead.

25:38.003 --> 25:40.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy, it does seem
to play into
Donald Trump's argument, the one
he's been

25:40.272 --> 25:42.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
making for weeks now, that the
system is rigged.

25:42.408 --> 25:43.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Absolutely.
Absolutely.

25:43.308 --> 25:44.977 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

25:45.077 --> 25:47.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Here, his two
main opponents
are saying let's get together to
deny him

25:48.046 --> 25:49.848 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
delegates.

25:49.948 --> 25:51.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You could not have
written the
script better for Donald Trump.
He's saying

25:52.084 --> 25:55.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the establishment is against me,
the system
is rigged against me.

25:55.120 --> 25:59.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then his two opponents go,
yes, it kind
of is, we're going to do
whatever we can to

25:59.391 --> 26:04.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prevent you from getting the
needed number
of delegates before we get to
the convention.

26:04.363 --> 26:09.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it only further plays into
this momentum
argument that I made before.
Plus, if you

26:09.168 --> 26:13.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look at the polling that's been
coming out
in these last few days asking
about Republican

26:13.372 --> 26:16.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters, how do you feel about a
contested
convention, what if the
candidate with the

26:16.742 --> 26:21.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most votes, the most delegates
doesn't get
the nomination, right now, 38
percent of Republicans

26:21.980 --> 26:27.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say they would be -- it will be
acceptable
to them if the person with the
most delegates

26:27.519 --> 26:32.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lost, didn't have the majority,
but came in,
but then lost the nomination.

26:32.991 --> 26:38.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And most of those are Trump
supporters, but
a good chunk, probably 45
percent or 46 percent

26:38.530 --> 26:41.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of those people, saying it would
be unacceptable
for Trump not to win or the
person with the

26:41.767 --> 26:44.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
most votes not to win are Cruz
voters.

26:44.369 --> 26:47.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A sense of
fairness at some
point.

26:47.739 --> 26:49.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Exactly. Exactly.

26:49.641 --> 26:51.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Tamara,
meanwhile -- I
will just mention this quickly
-- Ted Cruz's

26:51.510 --> 26:55.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
camp put out the word today that
he's already
got a short list of vice
presidential running

26:55.581 --> 26:57.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
mate possibilities.

26:57.449 --> 27:02.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, this is
crazy times. And
you don't know what's going to
happen with

27:02.187 --> 27:05.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Republican Convention, a
possible contested
convention.

27:05.257 --> 27:12.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it seems that candidates
could potentially
be trying to do things to help
themselves

27:12.164 --> 27:16.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look more like they're running
for president,
like they could be the nominee.
Having a short

27:16.468 --> 27:21.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
list for vice president, even
though you're
way, way, way behind in the
delegate count,

27:21.340 --> 27:23.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
could be part of that.

27:23.275 --> 27:27.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy, over on the
Democratic
side, Bernie Sanders has in the
last few days

27:27.546 --> 27:33.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
started to talk about what he
has been able
to get Hillary Clinton to shift,
I guess,

27:33.552 --> 27:35.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in terms of what she believes in
and what
she will push for.

27:36.088 --> 27:41.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He started talking, I guess, on
Friday to
Andrea Mitchell on NBC about
looking at what

27:41.360 --> 27:46.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Clinton will do with her
platform at the convention.
That's a shift for him, isn't
it?

27:46.899 --> 27:48.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

27:48.934 --> 27:50.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, we have already seen a
shift in his language
about, we're going to take this
all the way

27:50.836 --> 27:53.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the convention floor, to,
well, we're going
to take this all the way to
June, which is

27:53.906 --> 27:55.707 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the last primary.

27:55.807 --> 27:58.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, look, when I talked about
math and momentum
on the Republican side, it's
happening on

27:58.777 --> 28:03.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Democratic side, too. Math
is on Hillary
Clinton's side, but the momentum
is on Bernie

28:03.315 --> 28:08.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders' side. He continues to
do better and
better in national polling. His
approval rating

28:08.353 --> 28:10.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
numbers are much better than
hers.

28:10.289 --> 28:14.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, it's quite remarkable
that she's
going to have a very good night
Tuesday, likely

28:14.293 --> 28:19.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be close enough to sort of wrap
this thing
up if she does as well as the
polls are showing,

28:19.331 --> 28:25.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and yet her overall negative
ratings among
all voters has really
skyrocketed since the

28:25.404 --> 28:27.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
beginning of this campaign.

28:27.272 --> 28:32.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So he's done two things. I think
the debate
within the Democratic Party has
shifted her

28:32.144 --> 28:37.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
focus in some ways a little more
to the left,
but it's also taken a big toll
on her standing

28:37.983 --> 28:39.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with all voters.

28:39.851 --> 28:42.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tamara, how are
you reading
that in talking to the Clinton
people? How

28:42.554 --> 28:44.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are they dealing with this right
now?

28:44.656 --> 28:48.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: They're out with a
new ad today
that is running in some of the
states that

28:49.061 --> 28:55.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will be voting tomorrow that is
a very positive
campaign ad. It shows Hillary
Clinton being

28:55.667 --> 29:05.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
very human, engaging with
people, including
Sandra Bland's mother, and
really just giving

29:05.110 --> 29:06.912 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
people hugs.

29:07.012 --> 29:12.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's a very human ad and
it's about love
and kindness. And, really,
they're turning

29:12.351 --> 29:19.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
toward the general election with
that ad,
trying to paint an opposing
vision to that

29:19.891 --> 29:23.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Donald Trump and his
negativity.

29:23.161 --> 29:29.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump today again going
after his opponents,
saying that John Kasich is
disgusting when

29:29.368 --> 29:36.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he eats. So Clinton is trying to
paint that
contrast that she thinks, that
her campaign

29:36.675 --> 29:42.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thinks will smooth over a lot of
the challenges
that she may be having in this
primary.

29:42.381 --> 29:45.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Of course, Sandra
Bland the
young African-American woman who
died in her

29:45.550 --> 29:47.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
jail cell in Texas.

29:47.653 --> 29:52.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Very quickly, Amy, Charles Koch,
the billionaire
conservative who has been giving
a lot of

29:52.157 --> 29:56.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
money to Republicans, hinting or
saying that
he would even consider Clinton,
although he

29:56.862 --> 29:59.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said she would have to shift
some positions.

29:59.998 --> 30:00.532 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's a change.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

30:02.601 --> 30:05.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think this shows how
splintered the Republican
establishment is on so many
different levels,

30:05.737 --> 30:10.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even though he's sort of the
anti-establishment.
And it also goes to show how
much focus I

30:10.409 --> 30:14.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think we're going to see from
the donor class
on races that aren't the
presidential.

30:14.312 --> 30:18.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot more money, I think, is
going to get
spent at the down-ballot level
to protect

30:18.483 --> 30:23.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans in the Senate and
the House more
so that -- and, P.S., Hillary
Clinton doesn't

30:23.522 --> 30:28.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want Charles Koch's money or his
endorsement,
as you very well know. That
would play right

30:28.293 --> 30:32.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into the hands not only of
Bernie Sanders,
but her detractors who think
she's too close

30:32.264 --> 30:33.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to big money interests.

30:33.699 --> 30:37.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter,
Tamara Keith, thank
you both.

30:37.302 --> 30:43.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

30:43.108 --> 30:50.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

30:50.348 --> 30:55.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Beyonce's marketing
genius in the changing world of
music; and

30:55.854 --> 31:01.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
getting to green, a bipartisan
solution to
climate change.

31:01.326 --> 31:06.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, one year ago today,
a massive
earthquake shook Nepal, killing
more than

31:06.298 --> 31:11.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
8,000 people. Some $4 billion
dollars of assistance
was pledged, but the rebuilding
has been hampered

31:11.269 --> 31:15.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by rugged conditions, poverty,
and politics.

31:15.173 --> 31:19.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Fred de
Sam Lazaro explores
the reconstruction efforts as
part of our

31:19.344 --> 31:23.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
partnership with the Pulitzer
Center on Crisis
Reporting and with the
Under-Told Stories

31:23.849 --> 31:27.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Project at the University of St.
Thomas, in
Minnesota.

31:27.652 --> 31:33.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Kathmandu
still bears
scars from the quakes, but many
people in

31:33.191 --> 31:38.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nepal's bustling capital have
pushed the rubble
aside and started rebuilding
their homes and

31:38.897 --> 31:41.199 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lives.

31:41.299 --> 31:46.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's not possible in the
quake's worst-hit
regions, villages high up in the
rugged Himalayan

31:46.938 --> 31:52.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
landscape, places that were hard
to reach
even before the disasters
struck. Most people

31:52.477 --> 31:57.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
here were displaced into
makeshift camps miles
away in valleys miles away.

31:57.449 --> 32:04.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On April 25, 2015, the village
of Mailung
literally slid out of existence;
38 people

32:04.489 --> 32:10.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
died instantly as boulders
rained down from
the mountainside. Five bodies
have never been

32:10.295 --> 32:12.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
recovered from under them.

32:12.697 --> 32:18.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parma Singh Tamang ran a grocery
store and
tailoring business in this
abandoned community

32:18.236 --> 32:25.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
once home to 400 people. The
remnants from
his shops peek out from under
tons of granite.

32:25.744 --> 32:30.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two daughters-in-law and two
grandchildren
perished here. Others in the
large extended

32:30.916 --> 32:33.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
family that lived here barely
escaped.

32:33.251 --> 32:37.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PARMA SINGH TAMANG, Survivor
(through translator):
When they heard the loud
rumbling, they were

32:37.589 --> 32:40.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very confused and ran down by
the river.

32:40.192 --> 32:44.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Down the
street is the
spot where Selnam Tamang lived.
She wasn't

32:44.796 --> 32:49.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
home on that fateful day. She
was visiting
her mother, leaving her four
children with

32:49.534 --> 32:52.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
her in-laws and eldest child,
Asmita.

32:52.737 --> 32:57.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SELNAM TAMANG, Survivor (through
translator):
Her grandfather was cooking
fish, and all

32:57.342 --> 33:02.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the family was gathered in the
main floor
area, but Asmita didn't like
fish, so she

33:02.214 --> 33:04.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
climbed to the second floor of
the house.

33:04.382 --> 33:09.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, suddenly, the earthquake
came, and the
whole house fell, and she was
thrown some

33:09.254 --> 33:12.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
distance away. But the whole
family, they
were crushed.

33:12.591 --> 33:17.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Including
two younger
daughters and infant son. She
did manage to

33:17.929 --> 33:19.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rescue their pictures.

33:19.931 --> 33:22.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm really sorry.

33:22.601 --> 33:28.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their current situation stokes
the despair.
Most people in the camp say they
have no money

33:28.139 --> 33:34.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and have received little
assistance to rebuild.
Selnam Tamang scrapes by on
about $3 a day

33:34.746 --> 33:40.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a daily laborer, working
about 10 days
each month. And conditions in
the metal-roofed

33:40.485 --> 33:43.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shacks are not healthy, says
12-year-old Asmita,
who is learning English.

33:43.722 --> 33:46.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ASMITA TAMANG, Survivor: When
sun is rising,
then very hot.

33:47.092 --> 33:52.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: It gets very
hot when
the sun rises. Are there many
people who are

33:53.098 --> 33:54.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sick in this camp?

33:54.599 --> 33:55.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ASMITA TAMANG: Yes.

33:55.834 --> 33:58.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: What kind of
sickness
do they have?

33:58.637 --> 34:05.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ASMITA TAMANG: Diarrhea, and
winter season,
people have pneumonia.

34:05.243 --> 34:12.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: For Nepal's
inadequate
health care system, the quake
has added demands.

34:12.450 --> 34:17.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shanti Uprety, a public health
nurse, says
many of the displaced have
migrated closer

34:18.056 --> 34:21.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to population centers, like the
one she serves,
in pursuit of work.

34:22.060 --> 34:26.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHANTI UPRETY, Nepal (through
translator):
They can't farm their land, and
have no sources

34:26.564 --> 34:31.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of food, and conditions in the
temporary shelters
are hazardous. Pregnant women
are especially

34:31.670 --> 34:33.705 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
vulnerable now.

34:33.805 --> 34:37.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: We followed
along as she
coached Anu Biswakarma, a new
mother, on breast-feeding.

34:37.676 --> 34:43.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Her 19-day-old son wasn't
thriving.

34:44.049 --> 34:48.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Days earlier, she'd urged that
the child be
taken to regional hospital, but
this family

34:48.486 --> 34:54.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could not afford the bus fare.
Uprety has
seen many preventable illnesses
end in tragedy,

34:54.693 --> 34:56.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and recalled another recent
pregnant patient.

34:56.861 --> 35:00.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SHANTI UPRETY (through
translator): I knew
that the mother was anemic and
told them to

35:01.099 --> 35:06.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take her to hospital to deliver,
but they
couldn't afford it, so they both
died. That

35:06.237 --> 35:10.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
case happened three months back.
I have experienced
a few cases like this since the
earthquake.

35:10.842 --> 35:15.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The health
system she
works for can't do much to help,
having only

35:15.880 --> 35:21.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
begun to rebuild facilities.
Some social enterprises
did try to help.

35:21.686 --> 35:26.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One Heart World-Wide has worked
for years
in Nepal on maternal and child
health.

35:26.224 --> 35:30.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ARLENE SAMEN, One Heart
World-Wide: We had
met a company in Utah that made
these tents

35:30.962 --> 35:36.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are 12-by-12, and they're
big enough
to set up as literally a
birthing room. And

35:36.901 --> 35:42.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so we distributed those and set
them up immediately
after the earthquake. So, in
less than a year,

35:42.240 --> 35:49.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have delivered over 1,000,
with no maternal
or newborn deaths in any of
those situations

35:49.347 --> 35:51.149 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in our tents.

35:51.249 --> 35:53.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: But One
Heart's founder,
Arlene Samen, says much of the
international

35:53.985 --> 35:58.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
relief efforts were
uncoordinated and have
met only a tiny fraction of the
need.

35:58.790 --> 36:02.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARLENE SAMEN: There's millions
of dollars
that were raised that still have
not been

36:02.460 --> 36:09.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deployed and could be and should
be given
to people, so they could
rebuild.

36:09.367 --> 36:14.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: She says
many non-government
aid groups were reluctant to
deploy in Nepal,

36:14.839 --> 36:23.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
blaming the political
dysfunction in a country
that's endured years of
instability.

36:23.148 --> 36:29.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For five months last winter, an
internal dispute
over a new constitution and
regional politics

36:29.454 --> 36:35.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
led to an unofficial blockade of
the main
trade routes into landlocked
Nepal from India,

36:35.393 --> 36:38.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for which the two neighbors
blame each other.

36:38.263 --> 36:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even today, people spend hours
in line for
cooking fuel and gasoline.

36:42.500 --> 36:46.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the country is essentially
paralyzed by
political gridlock?

36:46.271 --> 36:49.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUJEEV SHAKYA, Economist: Yes.
It has been.

36:49.274 --> 36:53.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: As a result,
economist
Sujeev Shakya says some four
billion dollars

36:53.945 --> 36:59.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in earthquake aid pledged by
several nations
have remained largely unspent,
as rival factions

37:00.085 --> 37:02.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fight over who should control
how it is dispensed.

37:02.954 --> 37:07.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUJEEV SHAKYA: For folks in the
politics,
this is like $4 billion dollars
coming in,

37:07.358 --> 37:11.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so how much can we make out of
this? This
is how they think. And they need
the right...

37:11.563 --> 37:13.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: How much can
they line
their pockets, you mean?

37:13.765 --> 37:15.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUJEEV SHAKYA: Yes, line their
pockets. And
that's the whole question.

37:15.767 --> 37:20.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: However, the
newly formed
National Reconstruction
Authority says it

37:20.238 --> 37:26.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
now has support from all
political factions
and will soon shift into high
gear.

37:26.111 --> 37:30.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Families will be entitled to
grants of about
$2,000 to rebuild homes.
Communities will

37:30.982 --> 37:33.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
receive aid for schools and
health facilities.

37:33.418 --> 37:36.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAM PRASAD THAPALIYA, National
Reconstruction
Authority (through translator):
Within this

37:37.088 --> 37:41.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
four years we will make a new
Nepal. This
Nepal will not be made by
government, but

37:41.493 --> 37:46.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the people. The process of
making the new
Nepal will be created by the
government for

37:46.898 --> 37:48.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the people.

37:48.900 --> 37:52.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Spokesman
Ram Prasad Thapaliya
said the slow start has two main
causes, the

37:52.570 --> 37:58.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
daunting task of surveying
extensive damage
over forbidding terrain and
setting up a transparent

37:58.810 --> 38:00.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
accountability system.

38:00.712 --> 38:03.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAM PRASAD THAPALIYA (through
translator):
To spend this amount of money
that is coming

38:04.015 --> 38:08.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in, the authority has to spend
that money
with partners. The donors and
the people are

38:08.887 --> 38:11.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to be watching to see if
there is any
corruption.

38:11.256 --> 38:17.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And there's
growing public
access to information to hold
the government

38:17.128 --> 38:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
accountable. Civic groups, using
technology
and media, have set up Web sites
to track

38:22.333 --> 38:29.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aid dollars. There's even a TV
show called
"Integrity Idol" to single out
government

38:29.741 --> 38:32.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
officials, a group widely viewed
as corrupt.

38:32.443 --> 38:35.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BLAIR GLENCORSE, Accountability
Lab: In the
beginning, everyone said you
won't find anyone

38:35.313 --> 38:41.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Nepal. And, actually, we had
hundreds of
nominations, and the five
finalists were incredible

38:41.886 --> 38:43.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people at the local level.

38:43.821 --> 38:47.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Blair
Glencorse and Narayan
Adhikari with the
Washington-based nonprofit

38:47.559 --> 38:50.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
company Accountability Lab,
which produces
the show.

38:50.895 --> 38:54.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARAYAN ADHIKARI, Accountability
Lab: Seeing
all this energy coming from
young people and

38:54.365 --> 38:57.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also especially technology front
as well gives
me a hope.

38:57.268 --> 39:02.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: But back at
the displaced
people's camp, Parma Singh
Tamang and his

39:02.106 --> 39:06.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wife, Jyomo, say they're not
holding their
breath for the promised
government assistance.

39:06.411 --> 39:09.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JYOMO TAMANG, Survivor (through
translator):
I have no hope that we will ever
get back

39:09.847 --> 39:11.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the life we used to have.

39:11.816 --> 39:15.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: A few doors
down, Selnam
Tamang is spending a lot of her
meager income

39:15.954 --> 39:19.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on school fees, investing her
hopes in Asmita's
aspiration.

39:19.824 --> 39:20.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ASMITA TAMANG: Doctor.

39:20.892 --> 39:24.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: You want to
be a doctor?

39:24.562 --> 39:30.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will be an uncertain, at
times even desperate
journey for many years for her
and so many

39:30.501 --> 39:31.936 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Nepalis.

39:32.036 --> 39:36.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Fred de Sam
Lazaro in Nuwakot, Nepal.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Anticipation had
been building
all week, and it took just a
matter of hours

40:08.840 --> 40:14.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the weekend for Beyonce to
create a major
phenomenon surrounding her
latest work.

40:14.779 --> 40:20.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Titled "Lemonade," it's her
sixth solo album,
but it has charted new territory
for how she's

40:20.785 --> 40:26.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
created a different a path in a
digital era
of music streaming and
downloading.

40:26.557 --> 40:28.393 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

40:28.493 --> 40:32.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It was a surprise
record, released
at first exclusively on the
music streaming

40:32.864 --> 40:38.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
service Tidal, but also as a
so-called visual
album, a one-hour film shown on
HBO.

40:38.803 --> 40:42.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Once again, the pop music
phenomenon Beyonce
is doing things her own way, and
this time

40:42.874 --> 40:48.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with songs and stories that
address both personal
troubles and the larger history
of black women.

40:48.479 --> 40:53.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Joining us with more is
Salamishah Tillet,
a scholar and professor on black
women performers

40:53.217 --> 40:55.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at the University of
Pennsylvania.

40:55.687 --> 40:57.355 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome to you.

40:57.455 --> 41:01.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, surprise albums aren't such
a surprise
anymore, but Beyonce and
"Lemonade" takes

41:01.459 --> 41:05.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it to a whole 'nother level.
Tell us what's
going on. What do you see?

41:05.797 --> 41:08.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALAMISHAH TILLET, University of
Pennsylvania:
Well, I think it's Beyonce
pulling a Beyonce.

41:08.599 --> 41:15.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And by that, I mean, she is an
artist who
has -- this is her second
consecutive visual

41:15.840 --> 41:21.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
album that was dropped
unexpectedly. I think
it's akin to Michael Jackson's
"Thriller"

41:21.679 --> 41:28.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
premiere on MTV in 1983, and, of
course -- and
this may be controversial, but
to -- it's

41:28.353 --> 41:33.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
comparable to Dylan going
electric at the
Newport Folk Festival in '65,
meaning that

41:33.358 --> 41:38.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you have an artist who's at
their peak who
is conjuring and converging with
the sound

41:38.663 --> 41:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
technologies and the political
demands of
the moment.

41:41.833 --> 41:47.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's unexpected and it's a
surprise, but
only Beyonce could do this in
this magnificent

41:47.939 --> 41:49.774 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of a fashion.

41:49.874 --> 41:54.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, is it fair to
see it as
part of these big changes and a
kind of continuing

41:54.312 --> 41:58.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a battle of changes of artists,
music labels,
streaming services, to figure
out sort of

41:58.916 --> 41:59.984 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who's in control?

42:00.084 --> 42:01.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SALAMISHAH TILLET: Definitely.

42:02.053 --> 42:08.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In many ways, I think it's
Beyonce both aligning
herself with the new
technologies, whether

42:08.559 --> 42:15.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's Tidal came about as a way
of artists
being able to control the
content and benefit

42:15.366 --> 42:20.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the new streaming services
like Spotify
or Apple Music.

42:20.238 --> 42:24.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so Beyonce is responding to
that, but
also she's innovating that,
right? So, it's

42:24.375 --> 42:29.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not simply, like, releasing
music on a music
streaming service, but she's
also innovating

42:29.547 --> 42:33.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the artistic form of what we
think of as an
album, what we think of a music
video.

42:33.284 --> 42:40.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's a convergence of an
artist's reinventing
her sound and herself and using
and benefiting

42:40.925 --> 42:47.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from new technologies, and also
making a statement
to the music industry that
artists can continue

42:47.598 --> 42:52.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to benefit from, not simply be
exploited by
these changing tides.

42:52.403 --> 42:56.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And grabbing --
so a statement
to the industry and then gabbing
a lot of

42:57.041 --> 43:02.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quick attention from consumers
with a message
that in this case got a lot of
attention because

43:02.180 --> 43:09.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it went to some perhaps marital
infidelities
with her famous husband, Jay-Z,
right, and

43:09.387 --> 43:11.122 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
then to some much larger issues.

43:11.222 --> 43:16.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALAMISHAH TILLET: Yes, I think
it's the way
in which Beyonce has been able
to tightly

43:16.928 --> 43:22.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
control her narrative, whether
it's around
issues of marital infidelity or
simply what

43:22.500 --> 43:24.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
she wants to say politically.

43:24.569 --> 43:29.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think this album is a
convergence
of those things. But I think
it's a mistake

43:29.106 --> 43:33.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to think about it only as a kind
of confessional
tale, right? It's not simple a
woman who has

43:33.711 --> 43:37.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been scorned speaking truth to
her man or
speaking truth to power.

43:38.015 --> 43:45.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It also is an album that I think
exposes another
truth about the United States,
and it's re-imagining

43:45.356 --> 43:49.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American history through the
performances,
through the music and through
the visual imagery

43:49.627 --> 43:51.395 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of black women.

43:51.496 --> 43:57.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it starts in Louisiana
plantations, and
yet it's clearly tied to a kind
of narrative

43:57.201 --> 44:04.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of racial oppression and gender
oppression
that Beyonce feels like she can
now be a spokesperson

44:04.408 --> 44:07.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
for and an activist in a
movement such as
Black Lives Matter.

44:07.712 --> 44:12.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that's why you have Trayvon
Martin and
Michael Brown's mothers featured
so prominently

44:12.316 --> 44:17.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and poignantly, and Eric
Garner's mother featured
so prominently in this video.
It's not only

44:17.455 --> 44:21.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about Beyonce and Jay-Z. It's
about something
much deeper and larger.

44:21.759 --> 44:25.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's retelling
American history
through the voices of those who
usually are

44:25.897 --> 44:31.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on the margins. Beyonce
recenters them and
then allows us to see America
differently

44:31.469 --> 44:33.104 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as a result.

44:33.204 --> 44:36.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And very briefly,
she's one
of the few artists who can do it
this way,

44:36.507 --> 44:38.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
right, her own way.

44:38.476 --> 44:41.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALAMISHAH TILLET: She's one of
the few artists
who can have this kind of
platform, but that

44:41.512 --> 44:43.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doesn't mean that the artist
will do that.

44:43.314 --> 44:49.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think she's coming from a
tradition
of political activists who are
artists as

44:49.787 --> 44:53.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well. And so I think this is a
new Beyonce.
We are going to figure out what
we do with

44:53.291 --> 44:57.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a pop star who's gone political.
And I think
it's tremendous.

44:57.161 --> 45:00.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she features someone like
Nina Simone
in this. And I think she sees
herself as part

45:00.798 --> 45:04.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of that tradition, an heir to
that legacy.

45:04.569 --> 45:08.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Salamishah
Tillet, thank you
very much.

45:08.773 --> 45:16.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SALAMISHAH TILLET: Thank you.

45:16.414 --> 45:24.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Last Friday,
Earth Day was
celebrated for the 47th time
since its inception

45:24.589 --> 45:29.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 1970. From the beginning, the
environmental
movement had strong support from
both Democrats

45:30.061 --> 45:31.896 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Republicans.

45:31.996 --> 45:36.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Returning to the movement's
bipartisan roots
is key for future success, says
Fred Rich.

45:37.001 --> 45:42.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I recently spoke to rich for
this latest addition
to the "NewsHour" Bookshelf.

45:42.206 --> 45:43.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Fred Rich, thanks for joining
us.

45:43.975 --> 45:45.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED RICH, Author, "Getting to
Green": You're
welcome Hari. I'm glad to be
here.

45:45.910 --> 45:48.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You have been
a corporate
lawyer for 30 years and worked
with industry

45:48.646 --> 45:51.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that perhaps the green movement
wouldn't find
friendly.

45:51.449 --> 45:55.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, on the other hand, you have
been a conservationist
for just as long working with
land trusts.

45:55.686 --> 45:57.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, where are you coming at this
book from?

45:58.022 --> 46:02.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED RICH: When I criticize the
green movement
and call them on some of their
recent failings,

46:02.593 --> 46:06.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
so they know it's from a
position of solidarity,
right, I mean, complete sympathy
with the

46:07.031 --> 46:08.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
goals.

46:08.833 --> 46:11.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to see the green movement
succeed.
So they know that I'm coming at
it from that

46:11.402 --> 46:17.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
side. Equally, the right at
least knows I
was a registered Republican
until 2012, pretty

46:17.608 --> 46:24.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
solid fiscal conservative. It
breaks my heart
to see that the conservative
movement in America

46:24.548 --> 46:29.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has really abandoned a century
of tradition
of support for conservation of
the environment.

46:30.021 --> 46:33.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I hope each side will have
something they
don't like and I hope that
there's something

46:33.557 --> 46:35.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
equally that each side sees that
it does like.

46:35.660 --> 46:39.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: I want to pull
up a quote
from a State of the Union
address: "Shall

46:39.530 --> 46:43.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we make peace with nature and
begin to make
reparations for the damage we
have done to

46:43.501 --> 46:47.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our land, to our air, and to our
water? It
has become a common cause of all
people of

46:47.905 --> 46:53.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this country, clean air, open
spaces. These
should once again be the
birthright of every

46:53.177 --> 46:54.311 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
American."

46:54.412 --> 46:57.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was 1970. It was Richard
Nixon delivering
this.

46:57.648 --> 46:58.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FRED RICH: Correct.

46:58.649 --> 46:59.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: To bipartisan
applause.

46:59.650 --> 47:01.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED RICH: Correct. It was
amazing.

47:01.619 --> 47:07.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Richard Nixon, who I have to say
was no nature
lover, but he was a very savvy
politician.

47:08.025 --> 47:12.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Richard Nixon believed that
clean air
and clean water was a cause that
transcended

47:12.496 --> 47:20.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
class, it transcended party. He
was very nervous
that the Democrats not get out
front on environment.

47:20.438 --> 47:25.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he was dealing in 1970 with
deep divisions
in the country from the civil
rights movement

47:25.576 --> 47:30.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and especially at that moment
the Vietnam
War. And Nixon had the idea that
environment

47:30.715 --> 47:35.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could heal those wounds, that
environment
was an issue that would bring
both sides together.

47:36.087 --> 47:38.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Pretty ironic, given where we
are today.

47:38.155 --> 47:43.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, we're in
this almost
hyper-partisan world where we
can't even acknowledge

47:43.127 --> 47:45.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the other side should have
a right to
exist.

47:45.596 --> 47:48.599 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You called it the great
estrangement that
has happened. Explain that.

47:48.699 --> 47:50.401 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
FRED RICH: Right.

47:50.501 --> 47:52.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We always seem to think that the
political
landscape of the moment is
permanent. Right?

47:53.070 --> 47:59.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not permanent. I think that
it's absolutely
not only required that we return
to some degree

47:59.777 --> 48:02.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of bipartisan action, but also
that it's possible.

48:03.013 --> 48:08.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you study what happened
as late as
1990, when we solved acid rain
on a completely

48:08.185 --> 48:13.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bipartisan basis, you understand
that it is
possible and it's the norm. The
current situation

48:13.524 --> 48:15.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is the aberration.

48:15.493 --> 48:19.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How did
individual Americans
get to this point, where in the
'70s, we thought

48:19.797 --> 48:24.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the environment was one of our
top three priorities,
and today not even in the
ballpark?

48:24.301 --> 48:31.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED RICH: I looked at a lot of
very interesting
social science work and also
work of the so-called

48:31.275 --> 48:36.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moral psychologists, who look at
how we develop
our political opinions in the
first place.

48:36.380 --> 48:40.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there were two things that
came out of
it. This wasn't a bottoms-up
change. It was

48:40.818 --> 48:47.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a top-down change. The leaders
of movement
conservatism and the tactical
leaders of the

48:47.391 --> 48:52.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right decided that this change
of position
was tactically desirable. And
the rank and

48:52.229 --> 48:54.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
file followed suit.

48:54.198 --> 48:57.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It wasn't the other way around,
which I think
is fascinating and very
promising. What the

48:58.068 --> 49:04.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moral psychology teaches us is
to change the
hearts and minds of the people
for whom anti-environmentalism

49:04.208 --> 49:09.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a mark of identity. It's a
mark of what
it is to be a conservative.
Right?

49:09.246 --> 49:13.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
To change that requires
leadership from within
that community, and some people
have emerged

49:13.717 --> 49:15.052 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do just that.

49:15.152 --> 49:17.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, you also
take the green
movement to task.

49:17.188 --> 49:21.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is a quote here. You
say that it's
aging, it lacks the diversity of
the nation

49:21.492 --> 49:25.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it serves, and rests on a base
of support
that is broad, but perilously
shallow.

49:25.963 --> 49:27.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FRED RICH: Exactly.

49:27.932 --> 49:31.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Seventy to 80 percent of
Americans consistently
say they care about clean air
and clean water

49:31.135 --> 49:34.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and consider themselves
environmentalists.
That's what I mean by broad. But
when you

49:34.538 --> 49:41.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ask them to rank the things they
say they
care about in order of priority,
consistently,

49:41.111 --> 49:43.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
environment has come in dead
last.

49:43.714 --> 49:48.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will never translate into
political power
until people prioritize it,
right, in their

49:48.652 --> 49:52.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
list of issues, and hold the
politicians accountable.

49:52.423 --> 49:57.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The movement has to become
politically active
again, Hari. On Earth Day in
1970, 20 million

49:57.228 --> 50:02.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people turned out on the street,
20 million
people from both parties. So, we
have to recover

50:02.233 --> 50:06.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that energy of a mass political
movement that
we had in the early days.

50:06.537 --> 50:11.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, you have
prescriptions
here. You say reconnecting
conservatives to

50:11.141 --> 50:15.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conservation, the philosophy
that puts people
first, and reforming the green
movement.

50:15.379 --> 50:17.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do your prescriptions, how
would they
work?

50:17.281 --> 50:21.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED RICH: We have to take away
the -- some
of the reasons and some of the
perceptions

50:21.986 --> 50:25.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the part of the right that
have led to
the attitude on climate change,
right?

50:25.556 --> 50:32.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of those is that the
green movement
is against growth, right, is
against business,

50:33.097 --> 50:39.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is anti-capitalist, that it
doesn't care about
people. I mean, the criticism
that environmentalists

50:39.470 --> 50:43.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
care more about the snail darter
than the
people is a politically
devastating one, and

50:43.941 --> 50:45.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it can be somewhat true.

50:45.809 --> 50:50.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, 50 percent of our
population is now
going to live in cities. We have
to be relevant

50:50.714 --> 50:54.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to that 50 percent, or we're
never going to
have the political power to do
what it takes

50:55.019 --> 50:56.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on climate change. Right?

50:56.787 --> 51:00.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to learn to take smaller
steps and
incremental steps and show that
there are

51:00.758 --> 51:06.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things that we can do to make
progress, to
get rid of hopelessness. You
know, one of

51:06.297 --> 51:10.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the great critics of the
environmental movement
said that Martin Luther King
said, I have

51:10.367 --> 51:13.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a dream, and 40 years later, we
had an African-American
president.

51:13.837 --> 51:19.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The environmentalists said, I
have a nightmare,
and 40 years later haven't
really accomplished

51:19.376 --> 51:24.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much. People respond to a vision
of hope.
So, we have to change the style
of the movement.

51:24.715 --> 51:30.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have to change the
perceptions of what
we want. And, basically, we
can't do it ourselves.

51:31.055 --> 51:34.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People on the right have to show
leadership.
And they're starting to do that.
That's one

51:34.491 --> 51:35.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of my reasons for real optimism.

HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online right
now: Thousands of people are
released from

51:57.581 --> 52:03.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. prisons every year, often
without access
to health coverage and care,
jeopardizing

52:03.721 --> 52:07.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their own safety and sometimes
the public's.

52:07.191 --> 52:12.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Maryland, fewer than a 10th
of those who
leave prisons and jails enroll
in Medicaid.

52:12.963 --> 52:18.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our partners at Kaiser Health
News examine
the sometimes dire consequences
for these

52:18.235 --> 52:19.703 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
former inmates.

52:19.803 --> 52:22.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

Five states go to the polls, and

we cover vote
2016.
