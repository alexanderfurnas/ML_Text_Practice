KARZAI PLAYING A ROLE LIKE THAT,

29:07.262 --> 29:08.361
>> Brown: ANDREW, DO YOU SEE    
KARZAI PLAYING A ROLE LIKE THAT,
POTENTIALLY, A NEGATIVE ROLE?   

29:08.363 --> 29:09.628
KARZAI PLAYING A ROLE LIKE THAT,
POTENTIALLY, A NEGATIVE ROLE?   
>> I THINK HE'S PLAYED A        

29:09.630 --> 29:10.593
POTENTIALLY, A NEGATIVE ROLE?

I RARELY DISAGREE WITH THE      

29:14.165 --> 29:15.396
I RARELY DISAGREE WITH THE      
CTOR, BUT I THINK PRESIDENT     

29:15.398 --> 29:17.364
CTOR, BUT I THINK PRESIDENT     
KARZAI LOST CONTROL OF THE      
PROCESS.                        

29:17.366 --> 29:19.030
KARZAI LOST CONTROL OF THE      
PROCESS.                        
I THINK THE PALACE IS           

29:19.032 --> 29:20.164
PROCESS.                        
I THINK THE PALACE IS           
POLITICALLY VERY FRAGMENTED.    

29:20.166 --> 29:21.765
I THINK THE PALACE IS           
POLITICALLY VERY FRAGMENTED.    
I THINK THE ELECTORAL           

29:21.767 --> 29:23.466
POLITICALLY VERY FRAGMENTED.    
I THINK THE ELECTORAL           
INSTITUTIONS ARE FRAGMENTED.    

29:23.468 --> 29:24.700
I THINK THE ELECTORAL           
INSTITUTIONS ARE FRAGMENTED.    
THE AFGHAN NATIONAL SECURITY    

29:24.701 --> 29:27.234
INSTITUTIONS ARE FRAGMENTED.    
THE AFGHAN NATIONAL SECURITY    
FORCE IN SOME WAYS ARE          

29:27.236 --> 29:27.635
THE AFGHAN NATIONAL SECURITY    
FORCE IN SOME WAYS ARE          
FRAGMENTED.                     

29:27.637 --> 29:29.802
FORCE IN SOME WAYS ARE          
FRAGMENTED.                     
SO THE IDEA PRESIDENT KARZAI    

29:29.803 --> 29:31.336
FRAGMENTED.                     
SO THE IDEA PRESIDENT KARZAI    
COULD MASTERMIND THIS ENTIRE    

29:31.338 --> 29:32.703
SO THE IDEA PRESIDENT KARZAI    
COULD MASTERMIND THIS ENTIRE    
RIGGING IN ONE DIRECTION OR     

29:32.704 --> 29:34.303
COULD MASTERMIND THIS ENTIRE    
RIGGING IN ONE DIRECTION OR     
ANOTHER, I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK 

29:34.305 --> 29:35.671
RIGGING IN ONE DIRECTION OR     
ANOTHER, I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK 
HE'S POWERFUL ENOUGH ANYMORE TO 

29:35.673 --> 29:37.038
ANOTHER, I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK 
HE'S POWERFUL ENOUGH ANYMORE TO 
DO THAT BECAUSE MANY OF THE     

29:37.039 --> 29:38.904
HE'S POWERFUL ENOUGH ANYMORE TO 
DO THAT BECAUSE MANY OF THE     
POLITICAL ELITES ARE LOOKING    

29:38.907 --> 29:41.707
DO THAT BECAUSE MANY OF THE     
POLITICAL ELITES ARE LOOKING    
BEYOND KARZAI FOR PATRONAGE, NOT

29:41.709 --> 29:44.174
POLITICAL ELITES ARE LOOKING    
BEYOND KARZAI FOR PATRONAGE, NOT
LOOKING TO HIM AND LISTENING TO 

29:44.176 --> 29:44.573
BEYOND KARZAI FOR PATRONAGE, NOT
LOOKING TO HIM AND LISTENING TO 
HIM ANYMORE.                    

29:44.576 --> 29:46.008
LOOKING TO HIM AND LISTENING TO 
HIM ANYMORE.                    
>> Brown: ON THAT POINT,        

29:46.010 --> 29:46.974
HIM ANYMORE.                    
>> Brown: ON THAT POINT,        
HAVING JUST COME FROM THERE,    

29:46.976 --> 29:48.442

ATMOSPHERE AMONG PEOPLE THAT YOU

29:50.278 --> 29:51.910
ATMOSPHERE AMONG PEOPLE THAT YOU
TALKED TO?                      
ARE THEY EAGER TO GET THIS      

29:51.912 --> 29:53.144
TALKED TO?                      
ARE THEY EAGER TO GET THIS      
BEHIND THEMND AOVE M ON?        

29:53.145 --> 29:54.745
ARE THEY EAGER TO GET THIS      
BEHIND THEMND AOVE M ON?

29:54.747 --> 29:55.945
BEHIND THEMND AOVE M ON?        
>> I THINK THE PEOPLE ARE       
GETTING FRUSTRATED AND WANT A   

29:55.947 --> 29:58.946
>> I THINK THE PEOPLE ARE       
GETTING FRUSTRATED AND WANT A   
RESULT AND AN OUTCOME, YOU KNOW,

29:58.948 --> 30:02.513
GETTING FRUSTRATED AND WANT A   
RESULT AND AN OUTCOME, YOU KNOW,
BECAUSE THEY REALIZE AFGHAN'S   

30:02.515 --> 30:03.714
RESULT AND AN OUTCOME, YOU KNOW,
BECAUSE THEY REALIZE AFGHAN'S   
FUTURE DEPENDS ON THIS AND      

30:03.716 --> 30:06.414
BECAUSE THEY REALIZE AFGHAN'S   
FUTURE DEPENDS ON THIS AND      
THAT'S WHY WE SAW SO MANY VOTERS

30:06.416 --> 30:08.249
FUTURE DEPENDS ON THIS AND      
THAT'S WHY WE SAW SO MANY VOTERS
TURN OUT TO VOTE IN THE FIRST   

30:08.250 --> 30:10.551
THAT'S WHY WE SAW SO MANY VOTERS
TURN OUT TO VOTE IN THE FIRST   
AND SECOND ROUND.               

30:10.553 --> 30:12.985
TURN OUT TO VOTE IN THE FIRST   
AND SECOND ROUND.               
>> MORE THAN PEOPLE EXPECTED.   

30:12.987 --> 30:14.118
AND SECOND ROUND.               
>> MORE THAN PEOPLE EXPECTED.   
YES, AND CERTAINLY SOME OF      

30:14.120 --> 30:16.019
>> MORE THAN PEOPLE EXPECTED.   
YES, AND CERTAINLY SOME OF      
THAT WE CAN ATTRIBUTE TO FRAUD. 

30:16.021 --> 30:18.420
YES, AND CERTAINLY SOME OF      
THAT WE CAN ATTRIBUTE TO FRAUD. 
BUT I SAW IT WITH MY EYES THE   

30:18.422 --> 30:20.687
THAT WE CAN ATTRIBUTE TO FRAUD. 
BUT I SAW IT WITH MY EYES THE   
LONG LINES OF PEOPLE TURNING OUT

30:20.689 --> 30:22.555
BUT I SAW IT WITH MY EYES THE   
LONG LINES OF PEOPLE TURNING OUT
TO VOTE WAS HIGHER THAN         

30:22.557 --> 30:24.055
LONG LINES OF PEOPLE TURNING OUT
TO VOTE WAS HIGHER THAN         
ANTICIPATE AND I THINK THAT WAS 

30:24.057 --> 30:25.656
TO VOTE WAS HIGHER THAN         
ANTICIPATE AND I THINK THAT WAS 
BECAUSE THEY WERE VOTING FOR A  

30:25.658 --> 30:27.122
ANTICIPATE AND I THINK THAT WAS 
BECAUSE THEY WERE VOTING FOR A  
PEACEFUL FUTURE, WANTING, YOU   

30:27.124 --> 30:28.490
BECAUSE THEY WERE VOTING FOR A  
PEACEFUL FUTURE, WANTING, YOU
