WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And now to
a "NewsHour" Shares, something
that caught our eye here

00:04.300 --> 00:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that may be of interest to you.

00:06.400 --> 00:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you think of the most
popular sports in the world,
even us Americans know that

00:09.766 --> 00:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
soccer is number one worldwide.

00:11.600 --> 00:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But what about number two?

00:13.500 --> 00:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Believe it or not, it's cricket.

00:15.533 --> 00:19.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Now that English game
is starting to catch on
in the United States.

00:19.366 --> 00:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tina Martin from PBS station
WGBH in Boston reports.

00:22.666 --> 00:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Suiting up,
stretching out and getting in a
little batting practice before

00:31.333 --> 00:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a cricket match on a
remote field in Wrentham.

00:38.866 --> 00:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an unusual game that
most resembles baseball,
except you have a bowler
instead of pitcher,

00:43.100 --> 00:45.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the ball has to
bounce before you hit it.

00:45.466 --> 00:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Games can last for hours,
even days, and scores
go into the hundreds.

00:49.833 --> 00:52.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NITIN MEWEDA, Player: I
am completely into it.

00:52.200 --> 00:55.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TINA MARTIN: Nitin
Meweda has played since
he was a boy in India.

00:55.500 --> 00:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says American co-workers
were often confused
about his favorite sport.

00:59.633 --> 01:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NITIN MEWEDA: That's one thing
which used to happen with me
maybe five, six years ago.

01:03.733 --> 01:05.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I would say -- they
would say, what did
you do this weekend?

01:05.666 --> 01:07.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I was like, oh,
I played cricket.

01:07.166 --> 01:09.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they were like,
cricket, what is that?

01:09.200 --> 01:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Cricket was played
in the United States back in
colonial times, but had pretty

01:12.633 --> 01:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
much died out by the Civil War.

01:15.533 --> 01:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it has thrived
in other parts of the
world, with international
matches that are among

01:22.633 --> 01:24.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the most watched
global sporting events.

01:24.933 --> 01:28.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
At some games, there are
even royal photo-ops.

01:28.033 --> 01:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RAVI UPPALAPATI, Organizer:
Cricket in India is a religion.

01:31.666 --> 01:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's more than three times
the population of the United
States, and there is one sport.

01:38.533 --> 01:42.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you imagine like, in States,
if you have one professional
sport all over the year,

01:43.266 --> 01:43.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
how crazy it would be, right?

01:43.966 --> 01:46.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It is crazy.

01:46.066 --> 01:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Most of the players
in Massachusetts are immigrants,
representing far corners of

01:49.900 --> 01:52.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the world.

01:52.033 --> 01:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAVI UPPALAPATI: Most of us
are from India, but there are
a lot of people from Pakistan,

01:54.200 --> 01:58.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and other countries, Sri Lanka,
and Australia, and England.

01:58.066 --> 02:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Ravi Uppalapati
is one of the organizers of
the Massachusetts State Cricket

02:03.000 --> 02:04.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
League.

02:04.466 --> 02:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He says they now have
several thousand players.

02:06.533 --> 02:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAVI UPPALAPATI: I think there
were 12 teams in Massachusetts
Cricket League in probably

02:11.133 --> 02:13.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
'97.

02:13.066 --> 02:17.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are more than 30-plus
teams now, so things
have picked up so much.

02:19.100 --> 02:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: The MSCL is trying
to create a new generation of
players, sponsoring clinics

02:22.500 --> 02:23.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and camps.

02:23.700 --> 02:26.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RAVI UPPALAPATI: You
see lacrosse these days.

02:26.133 --> 02:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Last two, three years,
nobody was playing lacrosse.

02:29.233 --> 02:30.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Kids are loving lacrosse.

02:30.866 --> 02:35.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So it's just a matter of
like how we introduce,
where we introduce.

02:35.333 --> 02:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: A bigger
challenge might be educating
the parents on what
they're actually watching

02:39.700 --> 02:41.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their kids play.

02:41.333 --> 02:45.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Tina Martin in
Wrentham, Massachusetts.
