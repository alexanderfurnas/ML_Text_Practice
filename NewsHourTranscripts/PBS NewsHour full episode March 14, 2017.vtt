JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.707 --> 00:10.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: where
the Republican
leaders' health care bill stands
following

00:10.978 --> 00:14.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
analysis from the Congressional
Budget Office.

00:14.615 --> 00:20.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead this Tuesday: all
eyes on the Netherlands
-- what the implications are of
tomorrow's

00:20.554 --> 00:25.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dutch election on the rise of
the right in
Europe and populism around the
world.

00:26.026 --> 00:30.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NIEK STATEMENT, Labor Union
Organizer: People
are fed about the government for
the last

00:30.297 --> 00:36.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
couple of years. During the
economic crisis,
we pay a lot more taxes. They
cut our pension

00:36.770 --> 00:38.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
benefits. It's a protest vote.

00:38.972 --> 00:45.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the revival
of the groundbreaking
play "Zoot Suit" shines a
spotlight on Mexican-American

00:45.946 --> 00:47.748 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
culture.

00:47.781 --> 00:51.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEMIAN BICHIR, Actor: It's a
masterpiece of
American playwriting. It's about
discrimination

00:51.351 --> 00:55.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and it's about we Mexicans being
a target
for so many years.

00:55.622 --> 01:03.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:03.430 --> 01:06.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:06.199 --> 01:15.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There is less
than a week to
go before the official start of
spring, but

01:15.542 --> 01:19.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you wouldn't have known it today
in the Northeastern
United States.

01:19.179 --> 01:25.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A blizzard grounded more than
6,000 passenger
flights, shuttered schools and
claimed at

01:25.285 --> 01:26.887 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
least one life.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.323 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang has our report.

01:29.356 --> 01:37.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: From Western
Pennsylvania to New
England, snow fell at a furious
pace. This

01:37.164 --> 01:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time-lapse video shows it piling
up in New
York state.

01:40.434 --> 01:43.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: After Daylight Savings
Time, I wouldn't
have expected a storm like this.
It kind of

01:43.470 --> 01:46.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
feels more like January than it
does March.

01:46.406 --> 01:53.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Wind gusts of more
than 70 an hour
sent waves pounding into the
shore from Delaware

01:53.180 --> 01:54.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to Massachusetts.

01:54.848 --> 01:56.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. DANNEL MALLOY (D),
Connecticut: Good
day to make brownies and/or read
a book.

01:56.683 --> 02:00.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Connecticut Governor
Dannel Malloy
banned all but emergency travel,
so plows

02:00.988 --> 02:03.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could do their work in near
white-out conditions.

02:03.657 --> 02:08.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. DANNEL MALLOY: This is New
England. We're
used to handling snow. But when
you get predictions

02:08.261 --> 02:15.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of 18 to 30 inches with
potentially four-,
five- and 6-inch snowfalls in an
hour, that's

02:15.902 --> 02:17.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
when you have to act.

02:17.671 --> 02:22.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Boston was on track
for up to 18
inches. Schools there were
closed, as they

02:22.743 --> 02:27.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were in cities like Philadelphia
and New York.
That left thousands of kids with
a day to

02:27.914 --> 02:32.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
play. Even four-legged
frolickers got in the
act.

02:32.219 --> 02:38.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For air travelers, it was
anything but a holiday.
Southwest Airlines, which flies
more domestic

02:38.325 --> 02:43.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
passengers than any other
carrier, canceled
all flights at 14 airports from
Portland,

02:43.997 --> 02:50.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maine, to Washington, D.C.
Thousands of people
were stranded, like this new
bride from Britain.

02:50.037 --> 02:53.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURA BALDERSTONE, Traveler:
We're here on
honeymoon, and we flew to New
York and we

02:53.273 --> 02:58.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got here fine, but now we're
stuck here on
our way to Orlando. We can't get
a flight

02:58.745 --> 03:03.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out until tomorrow now. We're
hoping to get
a hotel room, but at the moment,
there aren't

03:03.583 --> 03:05.285 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
any.

03:05.318 --> 03:08.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: NCAA Tournament-bound
basketball
teams and fans had to change
plans to get

03:08.388 --> 03:14.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to March Madness games later
this week. Amtrak
suspended or modified rail
service along the

03:14.227 --> 03:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
busy Northeast Corridor. Nearly
a quarter-million
customers lost power.

03:20.367 --> 03:25.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New York City was spared the
worst, as the
arctic blast shifted north and
west, bringing

03:25.172 --> 03:27.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
less snow and more pelting
sleet.

03:28.008 --> 03:34.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D), New York:
Mother Nature
is an unpredictable lady
sometimes. She was

03:34.648 --> 03:36.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
unpredictable once again today.

03:36.883 --> 03:42.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The nation's capital
got less than
expected as well, allowing
federal agencies

03:42.489 --> 03:45.125 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to open on a three-hour delay.

03:45.158 --> 03:47.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

03:47.861 --> 03:52.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: The
commandant of the U.S. Marine
Corps faced

03:52.265 --> 03:58.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a grilling today over a scandal
involving
photos shared online of female
Corps members

03:58.638 --> 04:00.507 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the nude.

04:00.540 --> 04:05.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
General Robert Neller pledged to
fix the problem
and culture that led to the
scandal. But women

04:05.579 --> 04:11.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
senators in particular said
they'd heard it
all before, including New York
Democrat Kirsten

04:11.251 --> 04:12.986 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Gillibrand.

04:13.019 --> 04:17.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D), New
York: When
you say to us it's got to be
different, that

04:17.591 --> 04:22.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rings hollow. I don't know what
you mean when
you say that. Why does it have
to be different?

04:22.496 --> 04:26.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because you all of a sudden feel
that it has
to be different? Who has been
held accountable?

04:26.299 --> 04:28.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEN. ROBERT NELLER, Commandant
of the U.S.
Marine Corps: I don't have a
good answer for

04:28.335 --> 04:33.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you. I'm not going to sit here
and duck around
this thing. I'm not. I'm
responsible. I'm

04:34.007 --> 04:40.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the commandant. I own this.
That's a lame
answer, but, ma'am, that's all I
-- that's

04:40.981 --> 04:42.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the best I can tell you right
now.

04:42.749 --> 04:46.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The general
acknowledged the
scandal may hurt the Marine
Corps efforts

04:46.887 --> 04:48.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to recruit women.

04:48.855 --> 04:54.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The European Union's highest
court ruled today
that employers may bar Muslim
women from wearing

04:54.861 --> 05:00.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
head scarves on the job. The
ruling says that
a ban is permitted, so long as
it is part

05:00.300 --> 05:07.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a company policy, and not a
sign of prejudice.
It's a response to cases brought
by two women,

05:07.040 --> 05:12.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one Belgian and one French. Both
were fired
for refusing to remove their
head scarves

05:12.212 --> 05:13.914 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at work.

05:13.947 --> 05:18.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N. Human Rights Office is
demanding
that the Syrian government
release tens of

05:18.552 --> 05:24.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thousands of prisoners. In a
statement today,
the agency's head said: "The
entire country

05:24.424 --> 05:30.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has become a torture-chamber, a
place of savage
horror and absolute injustice."

05:30.363 --> 05:35.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the past, Syria has denied
allegations
of systematic torture in its
prisons. It had

05:36.002 --> 05:38.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
no direct response today.

05:38.605 --> 05:44.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Iraq, government troops
pushed deeper into
Western Mosul, and killed a key
Islamic State

05:44.411 --> 05:49.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
commander. Military leaders now
say it's only
a matter of time before they
crush the remaining

05:49.749 --> 05:53.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIS fighters in Iraq's second
largest city.

05:53.220 --> 05:57.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Irvine of Independent
Television News
reports from the front lines.

05:57.290 --> 06:03.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN IRVINE: Rolling back the
Islamic State
has been tortuous. The fighting
here is intense

06:03.997 --> 06:05.799 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and brutal.

06:05.832 --> 06:11.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Advances made by the Iraqi army
have been
slow and the extent of the
damage being wrought

06:11.838 --> 06:19.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by this inch-by-inch battle for
a city is
simply appalling. In 2014, the
Iraqi army

06:19.279 --> 06:26.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lost Mosul in six hours. Getting
it all back
is going to take them at least
six months.

06:27.020 --> 06:33.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The battle for Eastern Mosul
lasted 100 days,
and it cost the Iraqi army at
least 500 dead.

06:33.994 --> 06:42.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They want to limit the
casualties this side
of the river in Western Mosul.
And, to that

06:42.302 --> 06:48.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
end, they're using far more
ordnance, artillery,
and airstrikes, like the one you
have just

06:48.775 --> 06:50.577 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
heard.

06:50.610 --> 06:56.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I.S. can also strike from the
air. That was
a grenade dropped close to us by
one of their

06:56.182 --> 07:03.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drones. This propaganda video
appears to confirm
the commitment of their fighters
here in Mosul.

07:03.723 --> 07:10.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It also shows they are far from
running short
on ammunition. No quarter is
being given or

07:10.730 --> 07:11.698 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
asked for.

07:11.731 --> 07:13.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Are they good fighters?

07:13.600 --> 07:19.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAJ. GEN. BAHAA AZZAWI, Iraqi
Federal Police:
Actually, they fight, they
fight, they fight,

07:19.072 --> 07:22.909 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they fight. But we have also
good fighters.

07:22.942 --> 07:29.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN IRVINE: (INAUDIBLE) in
Mosul Museum today
was rubble. This where I.S.
sledgehammered

07:29.983 --> 07:36.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
history. And while much of what
they bludgeoned
was replica stuff, some
priceless artifacts

07:36.056 --> 07:40.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
were destroyed here.

07:40.460 --> 07:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now the museum is on the front
line of more
history being made. And the
records will show

07:46.666 --> 07:55.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the battle of Mosul was one
of the most
brutal urban fights the world
has ever seen.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Much of the place is
uninhabitable.

07:57.043 --> 08:03.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as the advance continues,
more districts
are being abandoned. As they
fled today, they

08:04.017 --> 08:09.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can only have been wondering,
what will be
left of Mosul to return to?

08:09.289 --> 08:14.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: More than 200,000
Mosul residents
have been displaced since the
start of the

08:14.427 --> 08:17.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Iraqi government offensive last
October.

08:18.031 --> 08:23.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Off the coast of Somalia,
pirates today seized
an oil tanker, the first such
hijacking since

08:23.670 --> 08:31.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2012. The Aris 13, manned by Sri
Lankan sailors,
was carrying fuel from Djibouti
to the Somali

08:31.144 --> 08:36.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
capital of Mogadishu. The
pirates forced it
to sail to a port town near the
country's

08:36.683 --> 08:41.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tip. European Union officials
said the men
demanded a ransom.

08:41.354 --> 08:46.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Mexico, authorities say they
have found
more than 250 skulls in what
appears to be

08:46.760 --> 08:52.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a drug cartel burial ground. A
prosecutor
confirms that the hidden site
was discovered

08:52.599 --> 08:58.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the outskirts of Veracruz.
Only one-third
of the site has been excavated,
opening the

08:58.037 --> 09:01.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
possibility of more victims to
be found.

09:01.708 --> 09:06.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here in Washington, the new head
of Medicaid
and Medicare Services was sworn
in today,

09:06.679 --> 09:11.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as lawmakers grapple with the
federal government's
role in health care. Vice
President Pence

09:11.885 --> 09:17.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administered the oath of office
to Seema Verma.
She had been working as a health
care consultant

09:17.690 --> 09:19.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in his home state of Indiana.

09:20.026 --> 09:25.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the nominee to be
U.S. trade representative,
Robert Lighthizer, had his
Senate confirmation

09:25.832 --> 09:30.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hearing. He argued for an
America-first trade
policy.

On Wall Street today, another
slide in oil
prices pulled stocks lower
again. The Dow

09:35.508 --> 09:43.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jones industrial average lost 44
points to
close at 20837. The Nasdaq fell
almost 19,

09:43.750 --> 09:46.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the S&amp;P 500 slipped eight.

09:46.686 --> 09:52.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Goodyear is saying goodbye
to an icon.
In pre-dawn darkness, the last
of the company's

09:52.692 --> 09:58.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
blimps was decommissioned and
deflated in
Carson, California. Goodyear
began flying

09:59.032 --> 10:05.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
blimps more than 90 years ago.
The tire company
is shifting to semi-rigid
dirigibles that

10:05.238 --> 10:11.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are larger and faster in
providing aerial
television coverage at major
sports and entertainment

10:11.211 --> 10:13.012 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
events.

10:13.046 --> 10:17.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the political
battle to repeal and replace
Obamacare; the

10:17.917 --> 10:24.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first major test for Europe's
far right, as
the Dutch head to the polls;
what school choice

10:24.290 --> 10:34.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
looks like in the vice
president's home state
of Indiana; and much more.

10:34.334 --> 10:39.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
looks like in the vice
president's home state
of Indiana; and much more.

10:39.772 --> 10:44.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Leading Republicans in the House
of Representatives
aim to pass their Obamacare
replacement bill

10:44.744 --> 10:46.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by the end of the month.

10:46.579 --> 10:51.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the analysis of the
legislation from the
nonpartisan Congressional Budget
Office yesterday

10:51.718 --> 10:54.120 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
may have complicated that
timeline.

10:54.153 --> 10:58.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For some of the party's
conservatives, the
bill still has too much of the
Affordable

10:58.658 --> 11:03.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Care Act left in it. For some of
its moderates,
the number of people the bill
wouldn't provide

11:03.930 --> 11:09.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coverage for is cause for alarm.
Today, the
White House and some leading
Republicans left

11:09.836 --> 11:12.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the door open to change.

11:12.138 --> 11:17.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From both ends of Pennsylvania
Avenue today,
talk of amending the House
Republican health

11:17.410 --> 11:18.845 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
care bill.

11:18.878 --> 11:21.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell spoke
at the Capitol.

11:21.447 --> 11:25.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader:
It will be open to amendment in
Senate, like

11:25.118 --> 11:29.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all reconciliation bills are.
We're anxious
to get past the status quo.

11:30.023 --> 11:34.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At almost the
same time, White
House spokesman Sean Spicer also
sounded a

11:34.861 --> 11:36.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
note of compromise.

11:36.596 --> 11:39.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
If you can come with a good idea
that will

11:39.132 --> 11:41.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strengthen this bill that will
benefit American
patients, we will do it.

11:41.668 --> 11:46.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All of this after
Monday's
report from the Congressional
Budget Office.

11:46.539 --> 11:54.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The CBO says the GOP plan would
leave 14 million
fewer people insured by next
year, and a total

11:54.547 --> 12:02.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of 24 million fewer by 2026. It
would also
bring savings that would cut
federal deficits

12:02.255 --> 12:06.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by $337 billion over that time
frame.

12:06.893 --> 12:12.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House sent out Budget
Director Mick
Mulvaney this morning to
challenge the CBO's

12:12.932 --> 12:14.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
estimates of the uninsured.

12:14.701 --> 12:16.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY, White House
Budget Director:
I don't believe the facts are
correct. I'm

12:16.536 --> 12:22.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying that because of a track
record of the
CBO being wrong before, and we
believe the

12:22.175 --> 12:24.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CBO is wrong now.

12:24.043 --> 12:28.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the other
hand, House Speaker
Paul Ryan embraced the analysis,
saying it

12:28.081 --> 12:35.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exceeded his expectations. But
hard-line conservatives
in Ryan's caucus, including Ohio
Republican

12:35.655 --> 12:39.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jim Jordan, blamed Ryan for
rushing the bill
through the House.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. JIM JORDAN (R), Ohio: This
bill doesn't
unite Republicans. This bill
doesn't bring

12:42.629 --> 12:44.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
down the cost of premiums.

12:44.397 --> 12:49.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Several Senate
Republicans
also warned the bill needs
reworking, among

12:49.402 --> 12:51.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them, North Carolina's Thom
Tillis:

12:51.237 --> 12:54.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. THOM TILLIS (R), North
Carolina: The
bill right now, we have
questions that we

12:54.040 --> 12:58.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to have answered. Again,
this is not
just about this House bill. It's
series of

12:58.511 --> 13:03.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
things that we have to
accomplish in the coming
months to solve the problem of
the failure

13:03.249 --> 13:05.018 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Obamacare.

13:05.051 --> 13:08.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, the
Congressional
Budget Office figures bolstered
Democrats'

13:08.554 --> 13:10.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
opposition to the bill.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senate Minority Leader Chuck
Schumer:

13:12.392 --> 13:17.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY),
Minority Leader:
It's vintage Donald Trump. Talks
like a populist,

13:17.730 --> 13:22.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but when he acts, it's
hard-right, favoring
the special interests, and
hurting the middle

13:22.468 --> 13:24.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
class and those trying to get
there.

13:24.270 --> 13:28.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Democratic
leaders brought
out people who said they have
benefited from

13:28.408 --> 13:30.276 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Obamacare.

13:30.309 --> 13:33.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAULA CHENEVEY, Obamacare
Supporter: The solution
is not to take away care. The
solution is

13:33.312 --> 13:41.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to find a better way of
providing that care.
I'm not asking for something for
free. I'm

13:41.287 --> 13:43.022 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just trying to stay alive.

13:43.056 --> 13:47.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The GOP bill will
next head
to the House Budget and Rules
Committees.

13:47.860 --> 13:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining me now, a member of the
House Freedom
Caucus who has expressed some
reservations

13:53.700 --> 13:58.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the bill, Republican
Congressman Ted
Yoho of Florida.

13:58.771 --> 14:01.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Representative Yoho, welcome to
the program.

14:01.040 --> 14:04.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What are your reservations, and
could you
support the bill as it is right
now?

14:04.711 --> 14:06.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. TED YOHO (R), Florida:
Thanks, Judy,
for having me.

14:07.013 --> 14:12.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My reservations are many. I like
the direction
we're moving in, but I could not
support the

14:12.051 --> 14:13.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bill as it is right now.

14:13.553 --> 14:14.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why not?

14:14.787 --> 14:17.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. TED YOHO: There are several
things.

14:17.156 --> 14:23.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is the refundable tax
credits. What that
means is the government has to
take money

14:23.429 --> 14:27.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from us, the taxpayers, and give
it back.
It's a government program. And
what I have

14:28.000 --> 14:32.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
seen with the government
programs in my short
period of time up here, but
being a citizen

14:32.839 --> 14:38.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for almost 62 years come April,
is a government
program. They tend to get bigger
and bigger,

14:38.945 --> 14:42.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and they're more -- they're less
efficient.

14:42.415 --> 14:46.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And any time you give control to
the government,
it costs more money and they're
less efficient.

14:46.185 --> 14:47.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think we have seen this
over and over
again.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me ask
you about
that.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.357 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

14:51.390 --> 14:55.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. TED YOHO: One of the other
things is
a work requirement for
able-bodied citizens

14:55.194 --> 14:58.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
without dependents, that they're
either looking
for work or they're getting
work, they're

14:58.998 --> 15:02.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
getting reeducated or they're
doing community
service, I think this is a must.

15:02.835 --> 15:07.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If not you're going to have
growth of people
on the Medicaid system.

15:07.073 --> 15:10.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, well,
I want to
ask you what you -- about what
you mentioned

15:10.476 --> 15:16.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first, the tax -- refundable tax
credit, because
Speaker Ryan, as you may know,
is arguing

15:16.048 --> 15:17.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that that's not an entitlement.

15:17.750 --> 15:22.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says letting people keep more
of their
own money and doing what they
want with it

15:22.522 --> 15:27.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not an entitlement. He said
it's simply
letting them have the freedom to
purchase

15:27.593 --> 15:31.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a plan that they feel is best
without the
government forcing them to buy
insurance.

15:31.764 --> 15:36.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. TED YOHO: Well, I agree
with getting
rid of the mandates, because,
again, it goes

15:36.302 --> 15:41.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back to, if government can
mandate what you
have to do, and then they fine
you with a

15:41.707 --> 15:46.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fee for not doing it, what else
can they do
in the future, you know, if the
government

15:46.245 --> 15:48.281 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
says you should do this or that?

15:48.314 --> 15:55.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm all in favor of having
people keep more
of their money. I'm in favor of
the tax credits,

15:55.655 --> 15:59.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not the refundable ones that go
back to buy
insurance or go into people's
health savings

15:59.926 --> 16:06.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
account. Again, I'm OK with the
tax credits
where you can write off the cost
of your health

16:06.065 --> 16:11.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
insurance if you're an
individual, because
that's incentivizing people to
do that, which

16:11.270 --> 16:14.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we want them to be, and that's
to be responsible
for their health care.

16:14.140 --> 16:19.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you think this
bill could
be changed, amended in the
direction that

16:19.745 --> 16:21.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
your concerns are?

16:21.881 --> 16:25.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm asking because, in the
Senate, the concerns
seem to be in the other
direction. Senator

16:25.852 --> 16:31.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tom Cotton, Republican from
Arkansas, is saying
he is worried that the bill
doesn't cover

16:31.490 --> 16:37.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enough people who need care. In
other words,
the pushes and pull seem to be
in the other

16:37.363 --> 16:39.131 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
direction.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. TED YOHO: No, I think this
bill will
get amended. I think you will
have a product

16:41.767 --> 16:45.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that comes out of the House and
the Senate
that's going to fulfill the
needs that we're

16:45.471 --> 16:47.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
trying to accomplish.

16:47.240 --> 16:51.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we need to all step
back for a
moment. The Affordable Care Act
was full of

16:51.477 --> 16:56.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
good intentions, but yet it's
collapsing on
its own. And if we did nothing,
which the

16:56.048 --> 17:00.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats don't want us to
interfere, if we
do nothing, it's going to
collapse, and all

17:00.519 --> 17:03.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these people that are on that
are going to
lose insurance.

17:03.322 --> 17:08.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Our goal is to make sure
everybody has access
to health care, that it's an
affordable health

17:08.527 --> 17:13.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
care, but, more importantly,
it's quality
health care. With the Affordable
Care Act,

17:13.332 --> 17:16.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what's happened is, all these
people have
been running to Medicaid, and
it's been proven

17:16.736 --> 17:21.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over and over again Medicaid has
the worst
outcomes in the industrialized
world as far

17:21.908 --> 17:24.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as the quality of health care.

17:24.143 --> 17:28.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is not a way to go just
to say we
have health insurance, but it's
not good health

17:28.180 --> 17:32.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
insurance. We want quality
health insurance
that the American industries,
the American

17:32.518 --> 17:36.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health care providers can
provide, I feel,
better than anywhere else in the
world.

17:36.656 --> 17:39.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Congressman,
there are
a number of Republican senators
who are concerned

17:40.026 --> 17:43.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about the loss of Medicaid
coverage.

17:43.162 --> 17:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. TED YOHO: Well, again, I
look five to
10 years down the road. If we
don't fix the

17:47.533 --> 17:51.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
underlying problems now, there's
going to
be a lot of people without basic
coverage

17:52.004 --> 17:53.806 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and needs.

17:53.839 --> 17:57.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, they're talking about
cutting Social
Security 25 percent across the
board within

17:57.043 --> 18:01.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
12 years. Nobody wants that. And
so, if we
don't get these things right and
make the

18:01.547 --> 18:07.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
proper reforms now in the
mandatory spending,
this is going to be a disaster
five to 10

18:07.586 --> 18:11.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years down the road for all
Americans. So,
let's get this right.

18:11.190 --> 18:15.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are you clear on
where President
Trump comes down on this? Has he
tried -- has

18:15.294 --> 18:17.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he reached out to you to ask for
your support?

18:17.763 --> 18:22.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. TED YOHO: He's not asked
for me personally,
but being a member of the
Freedom Caucus,

18:22.134 --> 18:25.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're going to meet with him
this week, and
we will meet with him in the
future.

18:25.071 --> 18:29.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are things that -- these
are not Republican
issues or Democratic issues that
one side

18:29.241 --> 18:33.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is trying to show which one can
come up with
the better plan. This is
something that it's

18:33.179 --> 18:38.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to affect all Americans.
And we need
to put what's best for America
right now.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.419 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And let's get that together.

18:40.453 --> 18:45.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we invite buy-in from the
Democrats to
come onto our side. And just we
want to hear

18:45.458 --> 18:49.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your issues, instead of just
having a political
debate and have everybody
divided over this.

18:49.695 --> 18:53.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Would the
president be able
to change your mind on this, do
you think?

18:53.299 --> 18:58.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. TED YOHO: I'm opening to
listening to
anybody. And I look forward to
that debate.

18:58.270 --> 19:03.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I will stand where I stand
on my issues,
and if somebody can convince me
different,

19:03.109 --> 19:08.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yes, you know, I'm agreeable.
I'm willing
to compromise, but it has to be
in the right

19:08.647 --> 19:10.349 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
direction.

19:10.383 --> 19:11.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm asking
because, at this
point, the president has signed
off on the

19:12.018 --> 19:17.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thing that you don't like, and
that is those
refundable tax credits.

19:17.356 --> 19:20.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is the fact that there
is no work
requirement in here.

19:20.559 --> 19:24.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. TED YOHO: Well, I have also
heard him
say that he's open to a lot of
suggestions,

19:24.630 --> 19:28.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that was one of the meetings
we're going
to meet with him with the
Freedom Caucus.

19:28.401 --> 19:33.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as long as people are open
to the dialogue,
they're willing to listen to
other sides,

19:33.672 --> 19:39.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's where you are going to
get your compromise.
And this is something we have to
do. Every

19:39.945 --> 19:43.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican in the House and the
Senate ran
on repealing and replacing the
Affordable

19:43.749 --> 19:45.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Care Act 100 percent.

19:45.718 --> 19:51.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can only think that we're
going to come
together to accomplish that goal
to get quality

19:51.424 --> 19:53.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
health care that's affordable
for all Americans.

19:53.826 --> 19:57.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, again, the
-- some of
the opposition from Republicans
is coming

19:57.863 --> 19:59.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from another direction from
yours.

19:59.799 --> 20:03.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Congressman, I do want to
ask you about
the ads being run in your
congressional district

20:03.235 --> 20:06.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by the American Action Network
for this bill...

20:06.138 --> 20:07.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
REP. TED YOHO: Yes.

20:07.973 --> 20:11.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... saying just
what you have
been saying: It's time to go
ahead and vote

20:11.677 --> 20:16.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for repeal, to do it with this
bill. Are those
ads going to influence your
vote?

20:16.248 --> 20:20.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. TED YOHO: Not at all. It's
a waste of
money, as far as I'm concerned.

20:20.252 --> 20:24.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The people sent me up here
again. I'm going
into my third term. We have
taken a strong

20:24.423 --> 20:31.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stance on this, and people sent
me up here
to go up here and fix this
problem, not to

20:31.964 --> 20:36.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fall down and -- or, you know,
placate to
the other side.

20:36.469 --> 20:40.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to fix this and
we're going to
get rid of the Affordable Care
Act, and we

20:40.873 --> 20:45.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will replace it with commonsense
reforms,
so that people have access to
quality care

20:45.878 --> 20:47.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that's affordable.

20:47.446 --> 20:49.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's
conservative Republicans
who are paying for those ads.

20:49.849 --> 20:54.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. TED YOHO: It's a -- a
Republican paid
for their ad. I don't know how
conservative

20:54.687 --> 20:55.654 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they are.

20:55.688 --> 20:56.655 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

20:56.689 --> 20:58.023 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

20:58.057 --> 21:00.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congressman Ted Yoho, Republican
of Florida,
thank you very much.

21:00.659 --> 21:02.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. TED YOHO: Thank you. Judy,
appreciate
it.

21:02.761 --> 21:06.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we should
note that the
American Action Network is a
not-for-profit

21:06.665 --> 21:11.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
group allied with the House
Republican leadership.
It's running these ads for the
health care

21:11.570 --> 21:21.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
repeal bill in 30 congressional
districts.

21:21.614 --> 21:27.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
repeal bill in 30 congressional
districts.

21:27.253 --> 21:32.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the Netherlands, voters head
to the polls
tomorrow, in Europe's first big
and closely

21:32.091 --> 21:38.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
watched election of the year. An
ardent nationalist,
running on an anti-immigrant
agenda, is bidding

21:38.397 --> 21:43.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the prime minister's office,
hoping to
lead the way for similar
candidates in France

21:43.402 --> 21:45.104 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Germany.

21:45.137 --> 21:49.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The election also comes amid an
escalating
war of words between the Dutch
government

21:49.475 --> 21:55.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Turkey over a referendum
next month that
could give President Recep
Tayyip Erdogan

21:55.447 --> 21:57.249 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
vast new powers.

21:57.283 --> 22:04.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just today, Erdogan accused
Dutch troops of
complicity in the 1995 massacre
of 8,000 Bosnian

22:04.723 --> 22:10.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Muslims at Srebrenica. That's a
charge which
a Dutch court had previously
cleared.

22:10.663 --> 22:15.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our special correspondent,
Malcolm Brabant,
traveled throughout Holland for
us, and he

22:15.401 --> 22:17.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
brings us this report.

22:17.703 --> 22:25.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Convicted of
inciting discrimination,
he's labeled Moroccans as scum,
one of Europe's

22:25.344 --> 22:31.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most divisive politicians, Geert
Wilders is
hoping to emulate Donald Trump's
anti-establishment

22:31.450 --> 22:33.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
victory, while maintaining a
Dutch veneer.

22:33.586 --> 22:37.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEERT WILDERS, Leader, Freedom
Party: I'm
no Mr. Trump. I am my own man.
And so we are

22:37.923 --> 22:42.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
having a Dutch campaign here
about Dutch issues,
and not about America.

22:42.161 --> 22:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The would-be
prime minister's
manifesto is only one-page long.
It's a full-frontal

22:47.299 --> 22:49.101 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
attack on Islam.

22:49.134 --> 22:52.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEERT WILDERS: It certainly is a
threat. It's
an existential threat. I'm not
talking about

22:52.071 --> 22:58.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all the Muslims, but the Islamic
ideology
is an ideology of violence, of
hate, of submission,

22:58.744 --> 23:02.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and not of assimilation. And I
believe Islam
and freedom are incompatible.

23:02.748 --> 23:07.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if we want to stay free
countries also
for our children and
grandchildren in the

23:07.086 --> 23:12.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
future, we have to have less
Islam in our
societies, because the more it
dominates and

23:12.258 --> 23:15.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the stronger it becomes, then
the less freedom
we will have.

23:15.394 --> 23:22.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This mosque in
Rotterdam
is the country's biggest. If
Wilders gets

23:22.868 --> 23:27.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his way, every mosque will be
closed down,
the Koran will be banned, as
will Islamic

23:27.740 --> 23:29.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
scarves in public places.

23:29.541 --> 23:36.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At Friday prayers, security
guard Rocalita
Angelista celebrated his
conversion to Islam.

23:36.849 --> 23:41.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to a recent survey,
most Dutch people
estimated that 20 percent of the
17 million

23:41.720 --> 23:45.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
population were Muslims. The
true figure is
6 percent.

23:45.391 --> 23:49.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROCALITA ANGELISTA, Netherlands:
You cannot
change us. We are here, and
maybe we were

23:49.295 --> 23:56.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not born here, but some of us,
my son, my
daughter, is born here, because
they are Dutch.

23:56.035 --> 23:57.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think Wilders will lose.

23:57.836 --> 24:02.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: At the end of
Friday prayers,
there was a collection to raise
money for

24:02.041 --> 24:08.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a new mosque in the city of
Utrecht. This
expansionism concerns voters in
the picturesque

24:08.180 --> 24:12.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
southern town of Valkenburg,
where Wilders
made a rare pre-election
appearance.

24:12.584 --> 24:17.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM KEIDENER, Student: A lot of
criminals
are Muslims. It's not that all
Muslims are

24:17.656 --> 24:23.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bad, but a lot of them have that
ideology,
and they want to take over the
Christians,

24:23.162 --> 24:29.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they think that Muslims are
better and
the rules of Sharia have to be
the rules of

24:29.902 --> 24:33.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- are more important than rules
of the law,
the Dutch law.

24:33.238 --> 24:39.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): I'm
not worried
about an attack, but I am most
worried about

24:39.745 --> 24:46.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the influence of our way of
life. And we have
to stop that.

24:46.285 --> 24:51.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FERRY SCHIPPERS, Netherlands:
Wilders is like
a hot air balloon. He is just
telling the

24:51.223 --> 24:57.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people what they want to hear.
We have to
keep moving in the right
direction. And with

24:57.229 --> 25:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wilders, we are moving in the
opposite direction.
We are going backwards.

25:01.100 --> 25:06.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: We have met
Ferry Schippers
before, on the front line of
Europe's immigration

25:06.271 --> 25:10.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crisis. He was leading the
Doctors Without
Borders team on board the aid
ship Aquarius

25:10.976 --> 25:16.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last summer, rescuing African
migrants off
the Libyan coast and taking them
to Italy.

25:16.515 --> 25:21.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FERRY SCHIPPERS: A good society
is a society
that take care of the weak. It's
kind of strange,

25:21.453 --> 25:23.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because we used to be such a
tolerant country.

25:23.989 --> 25:28.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: We have come to
Maastricht
to get a reaction to Wilders'
plan to reject

25:28.727 --> 25:34.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
all asylum seekers, ban
immigrants from Muslim
countries, and close down asylum
centers.

25:34.333 --> 25:40.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nader Elawa is from Damascus. He
landed on
the Greek island of Lesbos in
December 2015

25:40.539 --> 25:45.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and managed to reach the
Netherlands just
before the migrant trail to
Northern Europe

25:45.344 --> 25:47.146 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was closed down.

25:47.179 --> 25:49.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADER ELAWA, Refugee (through
translator):
The refugees are somehow very
peaceful, and

25:49.815 --> 25:56.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think they will make any
problem for
here. Me, I told you about
myself. If something

25:56.088 --> 26:02.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happen to Netherlands, I protect
it with my
life, because my Netherlands
people, I found

26:02.494 --> 26:07.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them they help me a lot. So why
I must do
something bad to them?

26:08.000 --> 26:12.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This is
Rotterdam, whose
prosperity is partly due to its
location as

26:12.638 --> 26:17.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the gateway to Europe. Geert
Wilders wants
the Netherlands to follow
Britain out of the

European Union, and there are
sympathizers
at the port.

Niek Stam claims to be the
country's most
militant labor union organizer.
He says the

26:25.517 --> 26:31.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
working class feel insecure
about their prospects
because of relentless automation
and a constant

26:31.290 --> 26:36.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drive to be competitive. The
union is campaigning
for robots to be taxed.

26:36.195 --> 26:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Robots do not buy cars.
Neither do they
shop for groceries, which leads
to a fundamental

26:41.934 --> 26:47.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
question: Who's going to buy all
these products
when up to 40 percent of present
jobs vanish?

26:47.606 --> 26:50.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No, we're not just going to sit
and wait and
do nothing.

26:50.676 --> 26:55.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NIEK STAM, Labor Union
Organizer: Twenty percent
of my membership will vote for
Geert Wilders,

26:55.180 --> 26:59.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but it doesn't mean that they
are racist.
I mean, it's a vote -- it's a
protest vote.

26:59.985 --> 27:05.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
People are fed about the
government for the
last couple of years. During the
economic

27:05.724 --> 27:11.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crisis, we pay a lot more taxes.
They cut
our pension benefits. It's a
protest vote.

27:11.530 --> 27:13.265 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not a solution vote.

27:13.298 --> 27:17.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But forming a
government
here is never smooth sailing; 28
parties are

27:17.636 --> 27:23.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contesting the election. A
coalition of four
or five is needed to create a
government.

27:23.542 --> 27:27.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wilders' big problem is that no
one wants
to get on board with him.

27:27.679 --> 27:31.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to the latest opinion
polls, Geert
Wilders is no longer in the
lead, and has

27:31.917 --> 27:36.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dropped back to second place.
But after the
surprise results in the Brexit
referendum

27:36.321 --> 27:41.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the American presidential
election, the
sitting Dutch prime minister is
not taking

27:41.126 --> 27:43.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
victory for granted.

27:43.529 --> 27:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prime minister Mark Rutte called
on the Dutch
to set an example to voters in
France and

27:48.166 --> 27:52.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Germany, where right-wing
nationalists are
flourishing ahead of elections
later this

27:52.137 --> 27:53.939 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

27:53.972 --> 27:56.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK RUTTE, Prime Minister of
the Netherlands:
These elections are crucial. Let
us stop the

27:56.875 --> 28:03.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
domino effect right here, this
week, this
Wednesday, the domino effect of
the wrong

28:03.315 --> 28:06.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sort of populism winning in this
world.

28:06.251 --> 28:10.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Are there any
circumstances
under which you would enter into
a coalition

28:10.789 --> 28:12.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
partnership with Geert Wilders?

28:12.558 --> 28:19.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK RUTTE: The answer is, no,
we won't do
that. The reasons are that he --
at -- when

28:19.565 --> 28:23.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the crisis was the deepest in
2012, he ran
away from responsibility.

28:23.669 --> 28:28.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Political
scientist Jean
Tillie believes that, although
Rutte finds

28:28.273 --> 28:32.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Wilders' views on Islam
distasteful, it's
a mistake not to engage with
him.

28:32.644 --> 28:35.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEAN TILLIE, Political
Scientist: We saw it
in England in the Brexit. People
were ignored,

28:35.781 --> 28:40.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and look what happened. We saw
it in America.
People were ignored, and look
what happened.

28:40.385 --> 28:43.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, don't ignore people when
they have strong
feelings.

28:43.789 --> 28:48.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You are not obliged to
incorporate them in
the political system, but you
cannot ignore

28:48.760 --> 28:52.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a very large group of people
consistently
for 30 years.

28:52.130 --> 28:57.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The election is
taking place
amid an escalating dispute with
Turkey. The

28:57.669 --> 29:02.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Netherlands prevented two
Turkish ministers
from addressing a rally in
Rotterdam, backing

29:02.174 --> 29:05.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Erdogan's referendum
request for
greater powers.

29:05.677 --> 29:09.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, Turkish
President (through
translator): Some European
countries have

29:09.681 --> 29:14.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
become hostages in the hands of
racist and
fascist parties. We have been
pointing to

29:14.252 --> 29:18.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the rise of fascism, racism and
xenophobia
in Europe and warning our
interlocutors about

29:18.924 --> 29:20.626 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this issue.

29:20.659 --> 29:23.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK RUTTE: Turkey is a proud
country. But,
also, the Netherlands is a proud
country.

29:23.762 --> 29:26.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will never negotiate under
threats.

29:26.331 --> 29:30.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Dutch analysts
believe that
Mark Rutte's handling of this
crisis could

29:30.602 --> 29:36.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
boost his chances. With so much
at stake,
rarely has there been this level
of tension

29:36.174 --> 29:37.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
beneath the Netherlands'
tranquil facade.

29:37.776 --> 29:44.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour" I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Amsterdam.

29:44.783 --> 29:53.425 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

29:53.458 --> 30:00.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": an
old play sparks
new discussions on
Mexican-American life;

30:00.399 --> 30:05.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and sweaters for chickens living
out of their
comfort zones.

30:05.971 --> 30:10.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But first: The Trump
administration has made
it very clear that it
wholeheartedly supports

30:10.542 --> 30:12.377 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
school choice.

30:12.411 --> 30:17.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of Education Betsy
DeVos is a strong
advocate of vouchers, which
allow parents

30:17.115 --> 30:22.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to use public tax dollars to pay
for a private
school education. Supporters say
vouchers

30:22.954 --> 30:29.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
help students succeed, but
opponents say they
siphon away crucial public
school resources.

30:29.494 --> 30:32.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Indiana has one of the largest
voucher programs
in the country.

30:32.831 --> 30:37.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And special correspondent Lisa
Stark of our
partner Education Week went to
see how it's

30:37.402 --> 30:42.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
working for our regular segment
Making the
Grade.

30:42.374 --> 30:50.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: It's the start of
the day at Emmaus
Lutheran School in Fort Wayne,
Indiana, where

30:50.749 --> 30:56.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
chapel is held once a week.

30:56.555 --> 31:01.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
About 20 miles away, this is how
the day begins
at Fairfield Elementary, the
city's largest

31:01.460 --> 31:03.762 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
public elementary school.

31:03.795 --> 31:10.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fairfield is warm and welcoming.
So is Emmaus.
Fairfield get top grades from
the state for

31:10.168 --> 31:16.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
academics. So does Emmaus. But
one is a public
school, the other a private
school that accepts

31:16.908 --> 31:18.610 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
vouchers.

31:18.643 --> 31:23.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They symbolize opposite sides of
the heated
voucher debate, only likely to
intensify,

31:23.882 --> 31:29.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
given the administration's
strong support
for school choice.

31:29.888 --> 31:35.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the heart of the debate,
money, and how
education dollars are divvied
up. Normally,

31:35.060 --> 31:40.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the state distributes tax
dollars to public
schools to educate students. In
Indiana, that's

31:40.232 --> 31:47.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about $5,800 a student. Vouchers
change that.
A portion of the money, the tax
dollars, follow

31:47.506 --> 31:53.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the student instead, allowing
parents the
use those dollars to pay tuition
at the private

31:53.879 --> 31:55.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
school of their choice.

31:55.147 --> 31:58.016 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's the voucher program.

31:58.049 --> 31:59.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Robert Enlow is an advocate.

31:59.851 --> 32:03.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT ENLOW, President,
EdChoice: We have
seen over time our traditional
school systems,

32:03.255 --> 32:07.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because they're based on zip
code assignment
and where you live, not
providing always the

32:07.359 --> 32:10.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
best options for families.

32:10.195 --> 32:12.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's put the money in the
backpacks of the
parent and let them choose where
they want

32:12.364 --> 32:16.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to go by giving parents the best
options for
their kids.

32:16.334 --> 32:21.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Indiana is one of
nearly 30 states
that offers vouchers or similar
programs.

32:21.973 --> 32:29.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All have the same goal: allowing
parents to
use public funds for private
schooling.

32:29.915 --> 32:34.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jerry and Miriam Lunz use
vouchers to send
their children to private
Lutheran schools,

32:34.486 --> 32:36.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rather than their local public
schools.

32:36.321 --> 32:40.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JERRY LUNZ, Parent: I would say
the schools
in our particular area are not
the best from

32:40.325 --> 32:46.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the academic standpoint. That
played into
some of it, but mostly the moral
aspect is

32:46.331 --> 32:51.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what we wanted, the Christian
aspect, same
taught at the school as at the
home.

32:51.670 --> 32:55.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Without vouchers,
private high
school was mostly out of reach.

32:55.240 --> 32:59.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIRIAM LUNZ, Parent: We looked
at the financial
aspect, and we had no idea how
we were going

32:59.177 --> 33:04.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to cover the cost. Jerry is the
hardest-working
truck driver I know, but that
doesn't pay

33:04.850 --> 33:06.618 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a lot.

33:06.651 --> 33:12.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: More than 300
private schools
in Indiana accept vouchers. The
vast majority

33:12.858 --> 33:14.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are religious schools.

33:14.593 --> 33:17.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Keith Martin is the principal at
Emmaus Lutheran.

33:17.529 --> 33:19.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why does this school participate
in the voucher
program?

33:19.531 --> 33:22.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEITH MARTIN, Principal, Emmaus
Lutheran School:
Simply because it allows us to
serve more

33:23.001 --> 33:24.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
students and more families.

33:24.803 --> 33:31.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: In fact, nearly half
of the 193
students at Emmaus rely on
vouchers, bringing

33:31.176 --> 33:36.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in about $400,000 for the
school, more than
a third of its budget.

33:36.281 --> 33:40.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEITH MARTIN: It's obviously
very helpful,
but you know, our school was
here 100 years

33:40.986 --> 33:46.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before the voucher program, and
I'm confident
that we will have it here 100
years with or

33:46.858 --> 33:48.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
without the voucher program.

33:48.727 --> 33:54.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: At Fairfield
Elementary, a drop
in students and resources due
partly to vouchers

33:54.900 --> 33:58.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has strained budgets, according
to principal
Lindsay Amstutz-Martin.

33:58.403 --> 34:00.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LINDSAY AMSTUTZ-MARTIN,
Principal, Fairfield
Elementary: I do know I have
lost teachers

34:00.605 --> 34:06.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
every year. I have lost
allocations of teachers
every year, because we're losing
students,

34:06.111 --> 34:10.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and sometimes that makes --
certain grade
levels' class sizes are large.

34:10.148 --> 34:16.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: In kindergarten, for
example,
there are 28 students and just
one teacher.

34:17.022 --> 34:21.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fort Wayne Superintendent Wendy
Robinson sees
vouchers as an assault on public
schools.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WENDY ROBINSON, Fort Wayne
Community Schools
Superintendent: You have
established a totally

34:24.029 --> 34:29.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
separate school system on the
back of a structure
that was intended for public
schools.

34:29.768 --> 34:35.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Another concern,
Robinson says
this is unfair competition, that
public schools,

34:35.941 --> 34:41.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
unlike private ones, are
required to educate
everyone who comes in the door,
including

34:41.313 --> 34:45.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
students with disabilities or
limited English
skills, who require more
resources.

34:45.517 --> 34:49.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WENDY ROBINSON: If they took
every student,
if they were responsible for
special ed, if

34:49.888 --> 34:54.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they took ELL, if they were not
allowed to
pick and choose which kids they
took, bring

34:54.859 --> 34:56.728 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it on.

34:56.761 --> 35:01.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Indiana's program
started out
for low-income students. It was
greatly expanded.

35:01.199 --> 35:06.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It now includes students who
never attended
public schools, and middle-class
families

35:06.371 --> 35:09.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were added under then Governor,
now Vice President
Mike Pence.

35:09.674 --> 35:12.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE, Vice President of
the United States:
I have also long believed that
parents should

35:12.143 --> 35:14.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be able to choose where their
kids go to school.

35:14.412 --> 35:20.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: Enrollment
skyrocketed from 9,000
students to more than 34,000, 3
percent of

35:20.852 --> 35:30.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the school population. This
year, $146 million
in tax dollars is going to
private schools.

35:30.628 --> 35:35.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
School choice, including
vouchers, is high
on the agenda of President Trump
and Education

35:35.266 --> 35:40.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary Betsy DeVos. Trump's
first school
visit was to a Florida Catholic
school that

35:40.872 --> 35:42.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
accepts vouchers.

35:42.707 --> 35:46.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Education is the civil rights
issue of our

35:46.845 --> 35:51.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time. And it's why I have asked
Congress to
support a school choice bill.

35:51.316 --> 35:56.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Nationally, the
results on vouchers
are mixed, with little or no
improvement in

35:56.054 --> 36:01.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
test scores for voucher
students. Still, some
29 states are considering dozens
of bills

36:01.726 --> 36:05.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that would start or expand
vouchers and similar
programs.

36:05.864 --> 36:10.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT ENLOW: We have seen
dramatic growth.
What we're going to see more of
is more and

36:10.802 --> 36:12.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more parents demanding more and
more options.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But public school officials
wonder, at what
cost?

36:15.840 --> 36:22.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WENDY ROBINSON: I'm worried that
people aren't
alarmed. Public education is the
backbone

36:22.747 --> 36:23.882 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of this country.

36:23.915 --> 36:27.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: A backbone
increasingly under
pressure.

36:27.786 --> 36:40.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm Lisa Stark of Education Week
in Fort Wayne,
Indiana, for the "PBS NewsHour."

36:40.098 --> 36:50.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: A landmark
play about
the struggles of
Mexican-Americans gets an

36:50.675 --> 36:55.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
acclaimed revival, one that
speaks to the
times we live in.

36:55.046 --> 36:57.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story from
Los Angeles.

36:57.248 --> 37:07.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It is a deeply
American story,
a Mexican-American story, "Zoot
Suit" the

37:07.559 --> 37:13.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
play, set in Los Angeles in the
1940s, amid
rampant discrimination, a
real-life murder

37:13.465 --> 37:16.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trial and the so-called Zoot
Suit Riots.

37:16.267 --> 37:19.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACTOR: The grand jury has just
indicted you
all for the same identical
crime, not just

37:19.871 --> 37:23.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you four, the whole entire 38th
Street Gang.

37:23.208 --> 37:28.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And "Zoot Suit,"
the cultural
phenomenon, reaching from its
premiere in

37:28.746 --> 37:37.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1978 at L.A.'s Mark Taper Forum,
to Broadway,
to a 1981 film, and now, 38
years later, to

37:37.822 --> 37:44.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a revival at the theater where
it began.

37:44.863 --> 37:47.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Its writer and director, then
and now, is
Luis Valdez.

37:47.799 --> 37:50.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUIS VALDEZ, Writer/Director,
"Zoot Suit":
I believe in entertainment. I
love entertainment,

37:50.802 --> 37:54.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know? But I love it with a
purpose. I
want people to come out of here
thinking about

37:54.339 --> 37:59.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what they saw, and perhaps
reassessing what's
happening in their own lives
with their families.

37:59.911 --> 38:04.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, more than anything I hope
that people
leave here with hope and
inspiration.

38:04.582 --> 38:09.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Valdez received a
National
Medal of the Arts from President
Obama in

38:09.988 --> 38:16.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
2015 for -- quote --
"illuminating the human
spirit in the face of social
injustice."

38:16.895 --> 38:20.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He spent his early years in a
family of migrant
workers.

38:20.698 --> 38:25.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is it correct what I read, that
you were 6
when you first discovered your
love of theater

38:25.036 --> 38:26.804 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in a camp?

38:26.838 --> 38:30.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUIS VALDEZ: In a camp, labor
camp, I got
hooked, yes. I auditioned, and I
won my first

38:30.175 --> 38:34.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
role. Unfortunately, the week of
the show,
we were evicted from the labor
camp where

38:34.445 --> 38:39.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we were staying, and I was never
in the play.
So, that left a big gap, a big
hole in my

38:39.284 --> 38:40.718 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
chest, you know?

38:40.752 --> 38:42.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's an early
lesson in theater
and in politics, right?

38:42.587 --> 38:46.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUIS VALDEZ: Well, exactly, the
desire to
do theater, and anger, residual
anger, because

38:46.991 --> 38:51.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we had been evicted. So, 20
years later, roughly,
I went to Cesar Chavez and
pitched him an

38:51.462 --> 38:53.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
idea of theater of, by and for
farmworkers.

38:53.665 --> 38:58.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That was the
beginning of El
Teatro Campesino, a bilingual
theater group

38:58.970 --> 39:04.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of farmworkers who performed
short plays for
other migrants, often on flatbed
trucks in

39:04.909 --> 39:07.579 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the middle of California fields.

39:07.612 --> 39:12.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Valdez continued to write and
produce larger
works as well, becoming known as
the godfather

39:13.017 --> 39:19.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Chicano theater. In 1977, he
was asked
to create a new production for
the Mark Taper

39:19.157 --> 39:26.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Forum. He chose the story of
Pachuco culture,
Mexican-American urban street
life, and a

39:26.164 --> 39:31.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sensational murder trial from
the 1940s in
which more than a dozen Chicano
gang youth

39:31.803 --> 39:34.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were convicted, followed by
riots.

39:34.839 --> 39:40.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Valdez used actual transcripts
and news headlines
from the era. The original
production helped

39:40.778 --> 39:46.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
launch the career of many
Chicano actors,
including Edward James Olmos.
Luis' brother

39:46.851 --> 39:52.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Daniel Valdez and Rose Portillo
were also
part of the original cast,
playing the young

39:52.323 --> 39:54.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lovers at the heart of the
drama.

39:54.092 --> 39:56.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL VALDEZ, Actor: It was
ahead of its
time. Very few Chicanos were
really in the

39:56.995 --> 40:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
acting business. So, for us, you
know, so
young a cast that was coming
together, we

40:02.267 --> 40:07.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were people off the street
making our first
mark on the industry.

40:07.805 --> 40:14.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But seeing the reactions of the
audience and
seeing what the audience
responded to, because

40:14.479 --> 40:19.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Zoot Suit" is much more than a
play -- it's
an event. In many ways, it was a
spiritual

40:19.083 --> 40:20.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
experience in that sense.

40:20.818 --> 40:24.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It was also
putting people
on the stage and a story on the
stage that

40:24.322 --> 40:25.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
most audiences haven't seen.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL VALDEZ: Exactly.

40:27.392 --> 40:31.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSE PORTILLO, Actress: They
hadn't seen characters
like this. They'd not seen
Hispanic, Latino,

40:31.763 --> 40:34.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chicano, whatever you want to
call us, Mexican-Americans,
on the stage.

40:34.832 --> 40:40.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was a moment where
several things were
going on. One is, you don't
always know what

40:40.972 --> 40:48.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're missing until you see it.
So, to suddenly
see this play and the stage
filled with people

40:48.646 --> 40:56.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that looked like us was, oh, my
God, I didn't
realize I was missing that, and
so that sense

40:56.788 --> 41:02.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of pride and I belong here, too.

41:02.226 --> 41:09.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All these years
later, they
still belong, this time playing
the parents

41:09.967 --> 41:14.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the young protagonist, Henry
Reyna. I asked
how it felt to return.

41:14.639 --> 41:18.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSE PORTILLO: When I walked
into the audition
room, and it was the same room
that I had

41:18.843 --> 41:24.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
walked into 38 years ago, and
this person
was also at the other end of the
table, and

41:24.649 --> 41:25.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Luis was on the other end of the
table.

41:25.917 --> 41:28.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Looking just the
same as all
those years ago?

41:28.052 --> 41:31.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROSE PORTILLO: Exactly the same.
We had not
changed at all.

41:31.489 --> 41:36.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I just took a breath, and I
put my bag
down, and I went, a moment,
please. This is

41:36.694 --> 41:37.795 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
so surreal.

41:37.829 --> 41:41.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL VALDEZ: Yes. I would say
it's Groundhog
Day.

41:41.199 --> 41:43.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:43.034 --> 41:49.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now a new
generation of younger
Latino actors has taken the
stage, joined

41:49.073 --> 41:55.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by one of Mexico's leading film
and TV stars,
Demian Bichir, who fell in love
with the "Zoot

41:55.546 --> 41:57.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Suit" story as a teenager.

41:57.215 --> 42:02.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEMIAN BICHIR, Actor: I wanted
to be in it.
It was my idea. And I pursued
it.

42:02.954 --> 42:05.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. You heard
about it and
you said, I have to do this?

42:05.123 --> 42:08.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEMIAN BICHIR: That's pretty
much the way
it happened.

42:08.059 --> 42:14.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Bichir plays what
would become
the most iconic role in "Zoot
Suit," El Pachuco,

42:14.465 --> 42:19.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a kind of trickster spirit
figure who hovers
around and over the action,
connecting the

42:19.871 --> 42:25.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
streets of 1940s Los Angeles to
a mythological
and spiritual past.

42:25.209 --> 42:30.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEMIAN BICHIR: He's the story of
us. He is
every Mexican from the beginning
of times

42:30.581 --> 42:36.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up until now. He's a devilish
presence, he's
an angel, he's your best
adviser, your best

42:36.587 --> 42:38.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
friend and your worst enemy.

42:38.790 --> 42:45.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Taking on the
role, says Bichir,
was irresistible. But, like
others we spoke

42:45.930 --> 42:50.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to, he had another reason he
wanted to take
part in the new "Zoot Suit": for
moments like

42:50.468 --> 42:53.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this one, from a defense lawyer
in the 1940s
trial.

42:53.404 --> 43:00.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEMIAN BICHIR: I have tried to
defend what
is most precious to our American
society,

43:00.711 --> 43:06.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a society that is now at war
against the forces
of racial intolerance.

43:06.150 --> 43:12.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A big part of me making that
decision was
how important this play is for
the times that

43:12.323 --> 43:19.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we live in. This is a classic.
It's a masterpiece
of American playwriting. It's
about discrimination

43:19.063 --> 43:23.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and it's about we Mexicans being
a target
for so many years.

43:23.634 --> 43:28.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Zoot Suit" plays

with a look at one effort to
keep our fowl

43:38.950 --> 43:40.618 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
friends warm.

43:40.651 --> 43:44.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, take a moment to
hear from your
local PBS station. It's a chance
to offer

43:44.789 --> 43:51.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your support, which helps to
keep programs
like ours on the air.

winter storm
bearing down on Massachusetts,
one group of

44:05.843 --> 44:10.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plucky individuals in Milton,
Massachusetts,
got together to help out their
neighbors across

44:10.681 --> 44:11.816 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the road.

44:11.849 --> 44:15.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

CRISTINA QUINN: What happens
when the chicken
across the road is cold? You ask
your neighbors

44:23.361 --> 44:32.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to knit him a sweater, which is
exactly what
Erica Max, program director of
the Wakefield

44:32.370 --> 44:39.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Estate, did, when she noticed
that Prince
Peep, a Malaysian Serama
rooster, started

44:39.644 --> 44:41.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shivering when the temperature
dropped.

ERICA MAX, Program Director,
Wakefield Estate:
I discovered that Serama
roosters, you know,

44:48.286 --> 44:58.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
normally would live very close
to the equator,
and they are not well suited to
this climate

44:58.229 --> 44:59.997 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in New England.

45:00.031 --> 45:04.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRISTINA QUINN: So Max called up
Nancy Kearns,
who lives at Fuller Village, a
retirement

45:04.368 --> 45:10.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community across the street, and
asked her
if she and her knitting group
could help Prince

45:10.174 --> 45:12.009 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Peep.

45:12.043 --> 45:17.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY KEARNS, Friend: I said,
let's give it
a try. So I went online. There's
a very wonderful

45:17.281 --> 45:30.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
site called Pinterest. And I
just typed in
the words "chicken sweater," and
I found a

45:31.028 --> 45:32.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
pattern from England.

45:32.997 --> 45:39.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRISTINA QUINN: These ladies do
a lot of knitting
for charities like Project
Linus, a nationwide

45:39.870 --> 45:47.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
organization that donates
homemade blankets
to sick children, so knitting
for chickens

45:47.678 --> 45:56.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was a departure for them, and it
came with
a lot of trial and error.

45:56.887 --> 46:03.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY KEARNS: Because the
pattern really was
for big chickens. And Prince
Peep, in particular,

46:03.728 --> 46:06.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY KEARNS: Because the
pattern really was
for big chickens. And Prince
Peep, in particular,

46:50.808 --> 46:52.610 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is a miniature.

46:52.643 --> 46:58.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRISTINA QUINN: Weighing in at
roughly one
pound, he's certainly
diminutive. But what

46:58.883 --> 47:07.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't fit Prince Peep looked
tailor-made
for the larger hens. And it
worked out perfectly,

47:07.558 --> 47:19.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since many of them were molting,
making them
more vulnerable to

47:19.637 --> 47:20.705 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the elements.

47:20.738 --> 47:23.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ERICA MAX: Oh, well, you look
marvelous, darling.

47:23.841 --> 47:30.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CRISTINA QUINN: On this
particular day, Erica
Max couldn't find Prince Peep's
sweater. It's

47:30.781 --> 47:40.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so tiny that it's easy to
misplace. So we
found another easygoing chicken
to try one

47:40.825 --> 47:54.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so tiny that it's easy to
misplace. So we
found another easygoing chicken
to try one

47:55.005 --> 47:56.841 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

47:56.874 --> 48:03.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERICA MAX: We have chicken and
we have a sweater.
We're going to attempt to put a
sweater on

48:03.647 --> 48:06.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERICA MAX: We have chicken and

We're going to attempt to put a
sweater on

48:21.966 --> 48:32.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a chicken. We are going to
attempt.

48:32.877 --> 48:42.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And this beautiful hen

48:42.920 --> 48:56.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And this beautiful hen

48:56.567 --> 49:02.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is not used to having sweaters
put on her.
But this

49:02.673 --> 49:06.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is not used to having sweaters
put on her.
But this

49:28.833 --> 49:40.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is her first time, so we can
give her a little
credit for being nervous. But
it's certainly

49:40.845 --> 49:42.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a fetching sweater.

49:42.246 --> 49:43.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRISTINA QUINN: It's lovely.

49:43.814 --> 49:46.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERICA MAX: Yes, that's a very
good-looking
sweater.

49:46.984 --> 49:52.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CRISTINA QUINN: That really
suits you. Chicken,
this really suits you.

they had sweaters

50:32.730 --> 50:38.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
