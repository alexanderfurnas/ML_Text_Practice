GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: North
Korea claims it has successfully
tested a

00:11.478 --> 00:16.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hydrogen bomb, as the White
House and world
leaders condemn the attempt.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Wednesday:
how South Dakotans are fighting
back against

00:21.388 --> 00:26.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
payday loans with sky-high
interest rates
that leave many in a cycle of

STEVE HILDEBRAND, South Dakotans
for Responsible
Lending: I have had employee
after employee

00:29.830 --> 00:34.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after employee over the last
three years in
the coffee shop, going through
horrible, horrible

00:34.668 --> 00:37.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
financial experiences, taking
out these emergency

ALEX TRUESDELL, Founder,
Adaptive Design Association:
It makes the child, one, believe
in their

00:47.281 --> 00:51.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
own capacity, and then everyone
who knows
and loves the child believe in
what they're

00:51.752 --> 00:52.986 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
able to do.

00:53.020 --> 01:00.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:00.727 --> 01:03.497 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:03.530 --> 01:13.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The earth rumbled
today in North
Korea with a big bang that shook
capitals

01:13.507 --> 01:19.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around the world. The communist
regime declared
it had carried out a
thermonuclear explosion,

01:19.579 --> 01:24.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which, if it turns out to be
true, would represent
a quantum leap beyond anything
it's managed

01:25.018 --> 01:26.787 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
before.

01:26.820 --> 01:32.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The nuclear news was trumpeted
on North Korean
state television.

01:32.426 --> 01:39.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): The
first hydrogen
bomb test was successfully
conducted at 10:00

01:39.066 --> 01:42.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on January 6, 2016.

01:42.069 --> 01:48.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: State TV also showed
photos of
the North Korean leader, Kim
Jong-un, signing

01:48.742 --> 01:55.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
orders for what it called a
hydrogen bomb
test. But the announcement
broadcast on big

01:55.816 --> 02:01.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
screens in the capital,
Pyongyang, was quickly
condemned around the world,
especially in

02:02.022 --> 02:04.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
China, the North's last major
ally.

02:04.558 --> 02:07.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HUA CHUNYING, Spokeswoman,
Chinese Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (through
translator): Today,

02:07.394 --> 02:12.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Korea carried out a
nuclear bomb test
once again, despite the
international community's

02:12.199 --> 02:17.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
objections. The Chinese
government firmly
opposes this. To fulfill
denuclearization,

02:17.571 --> 02:24.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nuclear nonproliferation, peace
and stability
on the Korean Peninsula is
China's firm stance.

02:24.511 --> 02:29.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Whether it was
really a hydrogen
bomb was also widely questioned,
especially

02:29.783 --> 02:31.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in neighboring South Korea.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEE CHEOL-WOO, South Korean
National Assembly
(through translator): Judging
from the measurements,

02:34.154 --> 02:38.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it probably falls short of being
a hydrogen
bomb, although North Korea
claims it is a

02:38.492 --> 02:40.327 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
hydrogen bomb.

02:40.360 --> 02:44.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In Washington, White
House spokesman
Josh Earnest said the U.S. is
skeptical too.

02:44.631 --> 02:47.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
The initial analysis that's been
conducted

02:47.434 --> 02:52.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the events that were reported
overnight
is not consistent with North
Korean claims

02:52.572 --> 02:58.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of hydrogen bomb test. There's
nothing that's
occurred in the last 24 hours
that's caused

02:58.478 --> 03:03.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United States government to
change our
assessment of North Korea's
technical and

03:03.550 --> 03:05.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
military capabilities.

03:05.285 --> 03:09.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Meanwhile, Japan's
government
immediately sent an aircraft out
to collect

03:09.756 --> 03:13.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
air particles for radiation
analysis.

03:13.293 --> 03:18.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A working hydrogen bomb would be
hundreds
of times more powerful than what
North Korea

03:18.198 --> 03:25.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
detonated in three earlier
underground tests.
And, if miniaturized, it might
fit on a missile,

03:25.472 --> 03:27.841 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as the communist regime claims.

03:27.874 --> 03:33.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pyongyang has long sought to
develop missiles
that could reach the Western
United States.

03:33.814 --> 03:38.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N. Security Council
branded the test
a clear threat to international
peace and

03:38.885 --> 03:43.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
security and it pledged to
pursue additional
sanctions.

03:43.423 --> 03:45.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon:

03:45.392 --> 03:49.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BAN KI-MOON, United Nations
Secretary-General:
This act is profoundly
destabilizing for regional

03:49.729 --> 03:58.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
security and seriously
undermines international
nonproliferation efforts. I
condemn it unequivocally.

03:58.105 --> 04:03.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: And U.S.
presidential candidates
weighed in, with Democrat
Hillary Clinton

04:03.944 --> 04:09.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
calling for new sanctions as
well, and Republican
Ted Cruz saying the test showed
the folly

04:09.816 --> 04:12.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of failed Democratic policies.

04:12.352 --> 04:16.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A number of sanctions are
already in place
against North Korea, an isolated
nation with

04:17.023 --> 04:21.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more than 12 million people
living in extreme
poverty.

04:21.094 --> 04:26.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will examine North Korea's
claims about
today's test, and what it all
means, after

04:26.233 --> 04:28.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the news summary.

04:28.068 --> 04:32.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in the day's
other news,
the chief justice of Alabama's
highest court

04:32.305 --> 04:39.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
urged local officials to deny
marriage licenses
to same-sex couples. That's
despite the U.S.

04:39.212 --> 04:44.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Supreme Court's decision in June
to legalize
gay marriage nationwide.

04:44.484 --> 04:49.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State Chief Justice Roy Moore
said the Supreme
Court decision is at odds with
his court's

04:49.956 --> 04:56.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
earlier rulings and is causing
-- quote -- "confusion
and uncertainty." Moore stopped
short of directly

04:56.129 --> 04:59.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ordering Alabama officials not
to issue licenses.

04:59.132 --> 05:05.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For the 62nd time,
the Republican-led
House has voted to repeal
President Obama's

05:05.605 --> 05:10.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health care law. But this time,
it's going
all the way to his desk. House
Speaker Paul

05:10.477 --> 05:16.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ryan conceded Congress won't be
able to override
a promised veto, but he said
it's worth the

05:16.183 --> 05:17.884 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
effort anyway.

05:17.918 --> 05:21.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House:
We are confronting the president
with the

05:21.154 --> 05:28.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hard, honest truth: Obamacare
doesn't work.
Higher premiums and fewer
choices and restricted

05:28.995 --> 05:35.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
access, these are not signs of
success. Obamacare
is not successful. They are
signs of failure,

05:35.569 --> 05:37.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the American people deserve
better.

05:37.604 --> 05:42.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Senate already
passed the
repeal measure, which also cuts
funding for

05:42.309 --> 05:47.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Planned Parenthood. But
Massachusetts Congressman
Jim McGovern and other Democrats
said it's

05:47.480 --> 05:49.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wrong-headed and a waste of
time.

05:49.883 --> 05:54.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REP. JIM MCGOVERN (D),
Massachusetts: I can't
understand how you can get up
every morning

05:54.054 --> 05:58.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and go to work and that's your
mission, to
make it more difficult for
people in this

05:58.525 --> 06:05.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country, to throw 22 million
people off the
health insurance rolls, to make
it more difficult

06:05.065 --> 06:09.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for vulnerable women to get
preventative care
at Planned Parenthood. That's
the mission.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's how we're beginning this
new year.

06:11.972 --> 06:16.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The bill would
eliminate the requirement
that most people obtain health
coverage, and

06:16.910 --> 06:21.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it would curb the expansion of
Medicaid, as
well as the taxes imposed to pay
for the law.

06:22.015 --> 06:26.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The man who
bought the rifles
used in the San Bernardino
shootings pleaded

06:26.553 --> 06:32.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not guilty today in a federal
court in California.
Enrique Marquez is accused of
conspiring to

06:32.926 --> 06:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aid terrorists, among other
charges. His friend
Syed Farook and Farook's wife,
Tashfeen Malik,

06:40.033 --> 06:46.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shot 14 people to death at a
holiday party
in December. Marquez goes on
trial next month.

06:46.640 --> 06:52.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: There's evidence
today that years
of drug violence in Mexico has
actually cut

06:52.045 --> 06:57.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
life expectancy in the last
decade. Research
in the journal "Health Affairs"
finds the

06:57.050 --> 07:04.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
projected life span of Mexican
men fell by
more than seven months between
2005 and 2010;

07:04.324 --> 07:08.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
50,000 people died during that
period in Mexico's
war with drug cartels.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Iraq is offering
to mediate
the diplomatic dispute between
Saudi Arabia

07:14.267 --> 07:20.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Iran. The Saudis' Sunni
regime cut off
relations with Shiite Iran last
weekend, after

07:20.840 --> 07:27.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attacks on Saudi diplomatic
sites in Tehran
and elsewhere. That followed
Riyadh's execution

07:27.480 --> 07:29.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of a top Shiite cleric.

07:29.683 --> 07:36.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Tehran today, Iraq's foreign

Ibrahim Al-Jaafari, met with his
Iranian counterpart

07:36.256 --> 07:39.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and talked of finding a way to
restore calm.

IBRAHIM AL-JAAFARI, Iraqi
Foreign Minister
(through translator): Iraq is at
the heart

07:43.563 --> 07:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the region, and we have
sought to use our
broad relations with Arab
countries and other

07:47.534 --> 07:52.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
countries so that Iraq can play
its role and
alleviate tensions between Iran
and Saudi

07:52.405 --> 07:57.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

the early
moments to prevent a disaster
from happening

07:57.610 --> 07:59.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that could affect the entire
region.

07:59.679 --> 08:05.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Iraq's Shiite-led
government
has relied on Iran for help
fighting Islamic

08:05.185 --> 08:10.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State forces. Separately today,
the White
House said President Obama spoke
by phone

08:10.290 --> 08:15.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider
al-Abadi
on their -- quote -- "mutual
concern" about

the situation.

08:17.030 --> 08:22.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Germany now says a
record 1.1
million people sought asylum
there last year.

08:22.469 --> 08:26.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
About two-thirds of the migrants
came from
Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.

08:26.973 --> 08:30.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the numbers came out, German
Chancellor
Angela Merkel told reporters --
quote -- "It

08:30.944 --> 08:37.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is very important that we

presidential candidate Ted Cruz
dismissed

08:44.991 --> 08:50.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
questions from rival Donald
Trump about his

senator said

08:50.797 --> 08:56.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's settled law that having at
least one
American parent makes you a U.S.
citizen,

08:56.903 --> 09:01.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even if you are born abroad.

09:07.247 --> 09:13.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the woman who died in jail after

09:22.629 --> 09:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A major federal assessment finds

class of insecticides can be
harmful to honeybees

09:27.634 --> 09:36.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in some crops. The Environmental
Protection
Agency says neonicotinoids pose
a significant

09:36.810 --> 09:42.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
risk to honeybees on cotton and
citrus crops,
but not on corn and berries.
Today's report

09:42.182 --> 09:47.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the first of four planned by
the EPA as
it decides whether to ban the
insecticide.

09:47.187 --> 09:52.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the bears
were back in
charge today on Wall Street
after oil prices

09:52.425 --> 09:58.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plunged again and worries built
about China's
slowdown, as well as North
Korea's weapons

09:58.665 --> 10:07.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
test. The Dow Jones industrial
average lost
252 points to close at 16906.
The Nasdaq fell

10:07.207 --> 10:10.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
55, and the S&amp;P 500 dropped 26.

10:10.877 --> 10:17.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a deeper
look at North Korea's power
play; why Americans

10:17.450 --> 10:28.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are buying more and bigger cars;
efforts to
cap sky-interest rates on payday
loans; and

10:28.595 --> 10:32.765 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
much more.

10:32.799 --> 10:41.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We return now to
North Korea's
bombshell claims today.

10:41.407 --> 10:46.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Siegfried Hecker is former
director of Los
Alamos National Laboratory, and
he now teaches

10:46.079 --> 10:52.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at Stanford University. He has
visited North
Korea and its nuclear facilities
seven times.

10:52.118 --> 10:57.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Wendy Sherman was
undersecretary of state
for political affairs during the
Obama administration.

10:57.957 --> 11:01.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
During the Clinton
administration, she was
a State Department official
focused on North

11:01.494 --> 11:05.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Korea. And she now advises the
Hillary Clinton
campaign.

11:05.265 --> 11:08.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wendy Sherman, how much of a
threat is this
latest test?

11:08.034 --> 11:09.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WENDY SHERMAN, Former U.S.
Undersecretary
of State for Political Affairs:
Well, I think

11:09.736 --> 11:14.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fact that North Korea has
now conducted
a fourth nuclear test is of
concern.

11:14.107 --> 11:18.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I agree with the White House's
assessment,
at least so far -- and I will be
glad to hear

11:18.144 --> 11:24.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what Mr. Hecker has to say --
that this isn't
a hydrogen test, but,
nonetheless, four nuclear

11:24.117 --> 11:26.152 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tests is a concern to us.

11:26.185 --> 11:29.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, the fact of the
test is more
concerning to you than the type
of test?

11:29.956 --> 11:33.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WENDY SHERMAN: Well, no. Had it
been a hydrogen
bomb -- and, of course, it will
still be several

11:33.293 --> 11:37.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
days before we know that for
sure -- that
is much, much, much more
powerful.

11:37.330 --> 11:41.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, we're also
concerned about
miniaturization of the weapon,
so that it

11:41.968 --> 11:47.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
might be carried on a weapon to
South Korea,
or Japan or even to the United
States. So,

11:47.440 --> 11:52.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I this is an acceleration and
escalation by
North Korea. And I think that
the United States

11:52.912 --> 11:55.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the world community need to
act with resolve.

11:55.415 --> 12:01.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Siegfried Hecker,
tell us, what
exactly is possible for North
Korea to have

12:01.287 --> 12:03.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
pulled off in this case?

12:03.056 --> 12:04.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SIEGFRIED HECKER, Former
Director, Los Alamos
National Laboratory: Well, it's
not clear

12:04.257 --> 12:06.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
exactly what they did.

12:06.292 --> 12:11.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Ms. Sherman pointed out, they
did another
nuclear test. And, actually, my
greatest concern

12:11.664 --> 12:17.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that they did the fourth
nuclear test.
With that nuclear test, they
clearly achieved

12:17.737 --> 12:23.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
greater sophistication, in most
likelihood
meaning being able to make the
bomb smaller,

12:23.109 --> 12:27.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lighter, and, therefore, have
greater reach,
if they're able to get them on a
missile.

12:27.413 --> 12:33.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether it was a hydrogen test
or not, we
don't know. My sense is, we will
probably

12:33.653 --> 12:41.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
never really know. So far, from
what is the
information that's there, it
appears the size

12:41.628 --> 12:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the blast, in other words,
the power from
the seismic signal that can be
measured, it's

12:47.133 --> 12:54.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the same level as the
third nuclear
test in 2013, which we put at
the level of

12:54.674 --> 13:01.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
approximately a Hiroshima bomb.
That's saying
10 to 15 kilotons.

13:01.147 --> 13:08.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, whether it actually
achieved the sophistication
of going to a fusion bomb --
that is, the

13:08.087 --> 13:14.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
normal bombs are fission or
atomic bombs -- the
fusion or hydrogen bomb, that is
a very big

13:14.394 --> 13:22.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
step technologically. And it's
not clear that
that was done, but we also can't
rule out

13:22.101 --> 13:24.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the North Koreans have made
a significant
advancement.

13:24.704 --> 13:28.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Wendy Sherman, we
talked about
the U.S. reaction. Let's walk
through some

13:28.741 --> 13:31.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the other intersectional
reaction, especially
China.

13:31.611 --> 13:36.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the past, they have been as
protective
of North Korea as any nation.
Not so today.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WENDY SHERMAN: Right.

13:38.151 --> 13:41.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, today, they said they are
resolutely
opposed to what North Korea has
done. Now

13:41.387 --> 13:47.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we need some resolute action
from China as
well. It is significant and
useful that the

13:47.427 --> 13:52.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.N. Security Council held an
emergency session.
The reports out of that session
are that nobody

13:52.532 --> 13:57.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
objected to further sanctions.
And Ambassador
Power, the U.S. ambassador,
called for more

13:57.403 --> 13:59.205 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sanctions.

13:59.238 --> 14:03.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And many candidates today who
are running
for president have called for
greater action.

14:03.509 --> 14:09.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Secretary Clinton, who
certainly understands
what's happening in Asia, has
called for greater

14:09.315 --> 14:14.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sanctions and to ensure, as I
think we all
feel, that we not allow North
Korea to blackmail

14:14.287 --> 14:19.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the international community, but
that we take
resolute action to tell them,
this is not

14:19.592 --> 14:21.360 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
acceptable.

14:21.394 --> 14:24.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Siegfried Hecker,
let's talk about
resolute action for a moment. A
year ago,

14:24.330 --> 14:28.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the president signed an
executive order to
freeze assets in North Korea.

14:28.935 --> 14:35.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everyone, as Wendy Sherman
pointed out, is
calling for resolute action,
universal condemnation.

14:35.842 --> 14:38.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What difference does that make
for a rogue
state like North Korea?

14:38.978 --> 14:44.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIEGFRIED HECKER: Quite frankly,
I think none,
because we have been through
this at least

14:44.350 --> 14:51.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since 2003 or so, when North
Korea pulled
out of a nonproliferation
treaty.

14:51.457 --> 14:56.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the attempts, not only by
the United States,
but by the international
community, has been,

14:56.763 --> 15:06.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in essence, to threaten North
Korea, to sanction
North Korea, to isolate North
Korea. And it

15:06.272 --> 15:12.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
simply hasn't worked. I think we
failed to
engage North Korea appropriately
when we had

15:12.779 --> 15:18.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opportunities in these last 12
or 13 years.

15:18.217 --> 15:24.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whatever engagement was there
didn't work.
The bottom line is, over this
time, from 2003,

15:24.924 --> 15:32.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when they most likely built
their first primitive
device which they tested in
2006, until today,

15:32.331 --> 15:37.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have gone from building a
device, 2003,
testing one that didn't work so
well in 2006,

15:37.703 --> 15:43.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to just now where they had the
fourth test,
the successful test.

15:43.342 --> 15:49.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in the meantime, at the
same time, they
have scaled up their ability to
make more

15:49.782 --> 15:54.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bombs. And so where we used to
have a problem
of having this country that
could perhaps

15:54.387 --> 15:59.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
build a simple nuclear device,
today, they
appear to have a nuclear
arsenal. That's of

15:59.926 --> 16:01.761 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
great concern.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, to me, that means we have
to do something
different than what's been done
over the last

16:04.797 --> 16:06.599 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
12 years.

16:06.632 --> 16:10.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Wendy Sherman, we
know that Kim
Jong-un is a tough read. Not
many people have

16:10.436 --> 16:15.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gotten inside and figured out
what he's really
up to. But if from -- based on
what we know,

16:15.308 --> 16:20.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if what he was trying to do
today was provoke,
what was that provocation
intended to do?

16:20.613 --> 16:23.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WENDY SHERMAN: Well, I think
he's -- it's
several things.

16:23.649 --> 16:29.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, it's really to
bring together
his own country to believe that
he is strong

16:29.155 --> 16:33.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and powerful. He is still a
young leader.
He's trying to consolidate his
power. He's

16:33.860 --> 16:38.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
done that through a tyrannical
set of actions,
including killing off some of
his closest

16:38.831 --> 16:42.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
advisers, when he thought they
were getting
out of control and he wasn't
being seen as

16:42.702 --> 16:44.570 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
primary.

16:44.604 --> 16:48.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So this was a way to bring his
country together,
which we find completely
reprehensible, but,

16:48.074 --> 16:52.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nonetheless, he's taken that
action. Second,
he's sending a message to the
region and to

16:52.245 --> 16:57.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United States that he will
do whatever
he thinks he needs to do to
protect his country.

16:57.550 --> 17:00.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He will not go down, as other
leaders have
gone down around the world.

17:00.920 --> 17:07.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I take Sieg's statements, and I
understand
them, the frustration here to
get North Korea

17:07.260 --> 17:11.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do something, but to get
action takes a
couple of things. It takes a
leader who is

17:11.097 --> 17:14.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
willing to engage. And North
Korea has not
been willing to engage, though
the United

17:14.934 --> 17:18.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States and others have made many
entreaties
to them to do so.

17:18.738 --> 17:24.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, secondly, I think we have
to get China,
who has really one of the only
relationships

17:24.877 --> 17:30.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
left with North Korea, along
perhaps a little
bit with Russia, to not only
engage, but also

17:30.750 --> 17:35.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to take tougher action to take
away some of
the goodies that they still
provide to North

17:35.955 --> 17:37.757 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Korea.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, finally,
Siegfried Hecker,
your take on Kim Jong-un and
whether he is

17:39.892 --> 17:41.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a real threat in this situation.

17:41.994 --> 17:46.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIEGFRIED HECKER: So, I like to
be able to
say that I am just a scientist,
and so these

17:46.499 --> 17:51.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
diplomatic matters are certainly
beyond my
own personal reach.

17:51.470 --> 17:58.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the thing that seems clear,
just in terms
of the nuclear weapons piece of
this, is that

17:58.277 --> 18:03.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Korea looks at these
nuclear weapons
as a deterrent. During all of my
visits and

18:03.549 --> 18:08.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the discussions with their
Foreign Ministry
and the diplomats, rather than
the technical

18:08.554 --> 18:10.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people, they talked about their
deterrent.

18:11.023 --> 18:17.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the emphasis was always
deterrent, meaning
deterring the United States from
essentially,

18:17.763 --> 18:25.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, going into North
Korea, or, as they
like to say, you know, our
hostile policies.

18:25.604 --> 18:32.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I think we need to
understand exactly
what is the North Korean
security concern,

18:32.878 --> 18:37.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because without getting over
that concern,
in North Korea, to come to
resolution, it

18:37.483 --> 18:41.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seems to me -- and, again, not
being a diplomat
-- that the issue is much bigger
than just

18:41.887 --> 18:47.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the nuclear issue. And so
focusing on the
nuclear issue by itself is not
going to be

18:47.893 --> 18:49.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
able to get us there.

18:49.829 --> 18:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Siegfried Hecker,
former director
of the Los Alamos Laboratory,
and Wendy Sherman,

18:54.133 --> 18:59.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many former titles, but you were
former undersecretary,
most recently, of political
affairs at the

18:59.605 --> 19:00.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Department of State.

19:00.473 --> 19:01.307 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

19:01.340 --> 19:02.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Thank you both very
much.

19:02.241 --> 19:03.843 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WENDY SHERMAN: Thank you.

19:03.876 --> 19:09.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SIEGFRIED HECKER: Thank you very
much. It's
my pleasure.

19:09.548 --> 19:19.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: 2015 turned out
to be a boom
year for the auto industry,
despite some of

19:19.592 --> 19:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: 2015 turned out
to be a boom
year for the auto industry,
despite some of

19:27.099 --> 19:31.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the worst news about its
practices in recent
years.

19:31.170 --> 19:39.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Americans spent roughly $570
billion on 17.5
million cars and trucks last
year, an almost

19:39.578 --> 19:45.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
6 percent increase over the
prior year, and
breaking a record set 15 years
earlier.

19:45.618 --> 19:53.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in the same 12 months, GM
faced public
congressional hearings and paid
a $900 million

19:53.192 --> 19:58.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
settlement over its handling of
a defective
ignition switch. U.S. regulators
recalled

19:58.764 --> 20:05.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than 19 million vehicles
over faulty
air bags, and Volkswagen
admitted to rigging

20:05.271 --> 20:08.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
diesel cars to pass emissions
tests.

20:08.707 --> 20:14.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some insight into this from
David Shepardson
of Reuters news service. He
covers the automotive

20:14.447 --> 20:16.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
industry, as well as other
regulatory matters.

20:16.816 --> 20:17.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome back to the program.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID SHEPARDSON, Reuters:
Thanks, Judy.

20:19.485 --> 20:23.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Dave, should
we be surprise
at this jump in auto sales last
year?

20:23.255 --> 20:27.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SHEPARDSON: No, I think
it's continuing
a record-setting six-year trend,
really the

20:27.159 --> 20:29.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
longest increase in auto sales
since the 1920s.

20:29.995 --> 20:35.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it says Americans, our cars
in the garages
are still pretty old, a record
11.5 years

20:35.634 --> 20:40.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on average. And there's been a
lot of pent-up
demand. Plus, you have got low
gas prices,

20:40.039 --> 20:46.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
low interest rates, and a lot of
good deals
on -- in showrooms. And
Americans are feeling

20:46.178 --> 20:49.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more confident. Unemployment has
declined.
So, really, all the economic
indicators that

20:49.949 --> 20:52.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would help boost sales have been
in the auto
companies' favor.

20:52.885 --> 20:55.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I want to ask
you about
some of those factors.

20:55.754 --> 21:00.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this happened, as we just
reported, despite
all this bad news about the
industry. What

21:00.092 --> 21:01.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
does that say about consumers?

21:01.961 --> 21:05.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SHEPARDSON: It's pretty
remarkable that
consumers have shrugged off all
the bad news.

21:05.798 --> 21:10.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, really, it's hard to keep
it straight,
from the air bags, to the fines
to companies

21:10.970 --> 21:17.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for not disclosing defects and
handling recalls
properly, not to mention
Volkswagen, Takata

21:17.877 --> 21:19.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and General Motors.

21:19.712 --> 21:23.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, consumers have been able to
separate some
of those issues, especially
because they're

21:23.616 --> 21:28.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
older vehicles not in the
showrooms, in part
they need cars and trucks, and
they're not

21:28.721 --> 21:34.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to sort of wait for the
industry to
get all its practices back in a
row.

21:34.059 --> 21:38.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But what does it
say, though,
I'm just curious, in terms of
the auto industry's

21:38.998 --> 21:44.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
advertising and reaching out?
They were clearly
trying to put out the good
story, while some

21:44.803 --> 21:46.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of these other bad stories were
out there.

21:46.338 --> 21:48.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID SHEPARDSON: Right.

21:48.207 --> 21:53.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think -- and also, with
recalls, remember,
we had a record 60 million
vehicles recalled

21:54.013 --> 22:00.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 2014. Last year, 2015, was
the second highest.
I think there's a little recall
fatigue. Americans

22:00.386 --> 22:04.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can't keep tracks of all the
recalls. There
is an onslaught. So I think
people have sort

22:04.523 --> 22:08.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of said, yes, there are recalls,
yes, there
are issues, but I still need a
car and I'm

22:08.827 --> 22:11.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still confident in my brand or
the vehicle
I choose to buy.

22:11.697 --> 22:14.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What's
interesting, too, is
not just that people are buying
more cars,

22:14.733 --> 22:20.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but the kind of cars they're
buying, I mean,
bigger cars, SUVs. How do you
explain that?

22:20.539 --> 22:22.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID SHEPARDSON: Right, and not
cars at all.

22:22.441 --> 22:28.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, as car sales declined,
and SUVs and
pickups and crossovers have
spiked dramatically.

22:28.314 --> 22:33.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Take GM. GM sold -- just 30
percent of all
vehicles in the U.S. last year
were cars.

22:33.252 --> 22:37.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And 70 percent were trucks, SUVs
and crossovers.

22:37.856 --> 22:42.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because these crossovers are
car-based SUVs,
get pretty good gas mileage, but
they have

22:42.494 --> 22:46.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the utility for people to haul
more stuff
around, get more kids in the
back or dogs,

22:46.599 --> 22:51.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or what have you, people have
just shifted
away from cars. And, as a
result, the -- it's

22:52.004 --> 22:56.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a big concern. Will people be
able to -- will
the auto companies be able to
meet these fuel-efficiency

22:56.041 --> 22:57.743 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
standards?

22:57.776 --> 23:02.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remember, the administration has
proposed
doubling them to 55 miles per
gallon by 2025.

23:02.147 --> 23:06.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Because we know
the price of
gas is down, but these are
vehicles that gobble

23:06.352 --> 23:07.519 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up more fuel.

23:07.553 --> 23:09.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID SHEPARDSON: Exactly.

23:09.388 --> 23:13.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are more fuel-efficient
than predecessors,
but they still do use more fuel
than cars.

23:13.259 --> 23:20.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dave, what about
the industry,
the health of the industry
overall? Does this

23:20.532 --> 23:24.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say that this is an industry
that's out of
its slump and is going to stay
strong for

23:24.870 --> 23:29.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
some time, or is this a
temporary thing? What's
your reading on that?

23:29.742 --> 23:33.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SHEPARDSON: It is a strong
industry.
And all the analysts think sales
in 2016 are

23:33.245 --> 23:37.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to go back up, although
there are some
warning signs. Interest rates
are going to

23:37.049 --> 23:38.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
start to rise again.

23:38.851 --> 23:42.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a lot of used cars,
cars coming
off leases that will go back on
the market,

23:42.721 --> 23:47.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is a concern. Will used
car prices go
down, make people less likely to
buy new cars?

23:47.526 --> 23:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the bigger threat is the
massive disruption
from Silicon Valley coming to
the auto industry

23:54.366 --> 23:57.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through Google and autonomous
cars, Tesla,
Apple potentially?

23:57.770 --> 24:02.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean the
self-driving cars,
cars with batteries, still a
small part of

24:02.641 --> 24:04.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the market, but...

24:04.476 --> 24:06.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SHEPARDSON: Yes, right,
but down the
road, fully electric cars with
batteries with

24:06.845 --> 24:12.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
longer ranges. People will feel
more confident
in buying those cars. And,
presumably, gas

24:12.785 --> 24:14.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
prices will go back up.

24:14.787 --> 24:19.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the big question is, will
people ultimately
completely revisit how they use
cars for personal

24:19.825 --> 24:25.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mobility? Will they share cars,
not just in
big cities? Will they not want
to own a car?

24:25.164 --> 24:29.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cars sit in driveways and
garages and are
not used 90 percent of the time.
Should people

24:29.968 --> 24:34.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- are people willing to share
cars and not
perhaps actually take it home
from the dealership?

24:34.907 --> 24:40.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the industry is preparing
for a major
disruption in the current way we
buy and sell

24:40.412 --> 24:42.247 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cars.

24:42.281 --> 24:43.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Presumably
spending a lot of
time trying to figure out the
answers to all

24:43.082 --> 24:44.383 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those questions.

24:44.416 --> 24:45.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SHEPARDSON: And stay in
business and
do it profitably.

24:45.784 --> 24:51.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Shepardson
with Reuters,
thank you.

24:51.724 --> 24:57.830 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID SHEPARDSON: Thanks, Judy.

24:57.863 --> 25:01.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

25:01.867 --> 25:07.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
life in Mexico
after deportation; and using
cardboard to

25:07.072 --> 25:09.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
help children with disabilities.

25:09.641 --> 25:17.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, payday lending is a
$46 billion
industry in the U.S. About 12
million Americans

25:17.416 --> 25:24.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
borrow more than $7 billion
annually from
over 22,000 storefronts.

25:24.056 --> 25:27.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the industry's practices
have long been
under scrutiny.

25:27.092 --> 25:31.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Andrew
Schmertz has
the story from South Dakota,
part of our ongoing

25:32.030 --> 25:37.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reporting initiative Chasing the
Dream: Poverty
and Opportunity in America.

25:37.536 --> 25:42.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: Living paycheck
to paycheck
isn't easy. Sometimes, you have
to come up

25:42.574 --> 25:44.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with creative ways to relieve
the stress.

25:44.710 --> 25:48.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRISTI MCLAUGHLIN, South Dakota:
A good way
to just live in denial is just
throw away

25:48.480 --> 25:51.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your bills. I know I can't pay
them anyway,
so...

25:51.583 --> 25:55.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: Kristi
McLaughlin and her
husband, T.J., were getting by
on T.J.'s salary

25:55.788 --> 26:02.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a manufacturing plant manager
here in Sioux
Falls, South Dakota, that was,
until T.J.

26:02.161 --> 26:03.929 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
got sick.

26:03.962 --> 26:09.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
T.J. MCLAUGHLIN, South Dakota: I
was working
the night shift, and I was on my
feet a lot.

26:09.201 --> 26:12.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I had a couple of wounds
start developing
on my leg. And they were pretty
small at first,

26:12.204 --> 26:15.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then they got infected and
just started
growing.

26:15.841 --> 26:20.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: When T.J. went
to get treatment,
the doctor said it would only
take a day,

26:20.212 --> 26:23.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but, in fact, he ended up
missing a whole
week of work.

26:23.348 --> 26:26.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
T.J. MCLAUGHLIN: They ended up
docking my
pay. We ended up being short on
bills. I panicked,

26:26.618 --> 26:28.387 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
so...

26:28.420 --> 26:33.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: So McLaughlin
came here,
a title loan place just a few
miles from his

26:33.759 --> 26:38.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
home. He says the process was
simple and quick.
They inspected his car and then
handed him

26:38.764 --> 26:44.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
$1,200 in cash. He agreed to pay
$322 a month
for a year.

26:44.837 --> 26:48.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
T.J. MCLAUGHLIN: I was making
good money.
I didn't really foresee a
problem paying it

26:48.273 --> 26:50.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
back at that time.

26:50.075 --> 26:53.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: But then his
leg got worse,
and he had to go back to the
hospital for

26:53.345 --> 26:55.080 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
another week.

26:55.113 --> 27:00.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRISTI MCLAUGHLIN: And on
Wednesday of the
following week, the H.R. person
called from

27:00.586 --> 27:06.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his job and fired him, and, on
that day, we
pretty much lost everything.

27:06.058 --> 27:10.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: But not the
loan. After nine
months, the total amount they
owed grew from

27:10.996 --> 27:18.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
$1,200 to over $3,000. That's an
annual interest
rate of more than 300 percent.

27:18.837 --> 27:22.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Title loans and payday loans are
supposed
to be short-term quick fixes for
people who

27:22.941 --> 27:24.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
can't get traditional credit.

27:24.576 --> 27:27.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTRESS: Do you need fast cash?
You have come
to the right place.

27:27.312 --> 27:31.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: They use
high-energy commercials
and bank-like storefronts to
entice people

27:31.416 --> 27:38.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to borrow money at triple-digit
interest rates.
The problem? They are rarely
short-term. Borrowers

27:38.156 --> 27:42.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
frequently need to take out a
second loan
to pay off the first one. It's
called flipping.

27:42.928 --> 27:45.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE HICKEY (R), Former South
Dakota State
Legislator: The average payday
loan in the

27:45.531 --> 27:49.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States is flipped eight
times. And
they are a debt trap that's
intentionally

27:50.002 --> 27:55.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
marketed to the financially
unsophisticated,
intending to lock them in on
something that

27:55.574 --> 27:57.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they can't pay back.

27:57.409 --> 28:00.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: Former state
lawmaker Steve
Hickey tried to rein in the
industry, which

28:00.445 --> 28:07.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
charges an average of 574
percent, with legislation
to cap interest rates. But he
could never

28:07.152 --> 28:08.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
get his bills out of committee.

28:08.854 --> 28:11.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE HICKEY: Just not much
stomach in the
legislature, because the
financial sector

28:12.024 --> 28:16.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in our state is such a huge
deal. There's
millions and millions at stake.

28:16.161 --> 28:20.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: South Dakota
has been the
epicenter of high interest since
the 1980s,

28:20.732 --> 28:24.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when the state repealed laws
capping rates
to attract jobs from credit card
companies

28:24.736 --> 28:26.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like Wells Fargo and Citibank.

28:26.605 --> 28:31.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE HICKEY: The purpose at
that time was
to bring in 400 Citibank jobs,
not to bring

28:31.510 --> 28:33.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in 400 percent interest rates.

28:33.545 --> 28:39.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: Hickey wasn't
alone in recognizing
the problems created by these
short-term loans.

28:39.418 --> 28:43.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Steve Hildebrand runs Josiah's
coffee shop
here in Sioux Falls. He's seen
the detrimental

28:43.889 --> 28:45.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
effects of these high interest
rates firsthand.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE HILDEBRAND, South Dakotans
for Responsible
Lending: I have had employee
after employee

28:48.093 --> 28:52.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after employee over the last
three years in
the coffee shop, going through
horrible, horrible

28:52.931 --> 28:58.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
financial experiences, taking
out these emergency
loans, and just getting into
this terrible

28:58.270 --> 29:04.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cycle of debt that is incredibly
hard for
them to get out of.

29:04.076 --> 29:08.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: Hildebrand, an
openly gay
Democrat who worked on the Obama
campaign,

29:08.447 --> 29:12.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't have much in common with
Hickey, a
Republican and conservative
Christian pastor

29:12.751 --> 29:17.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who has railed against
homosexuality, but
they did see eye to eye on what
they consider

29:17.689 --> 29:19.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
predatory lending.

29:19.491 --> 29:22.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE HICKEY: We created a
campaign called
South Dakotans for Responsible
Lending. Steve

29:22.794 --> 29:27.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I are chair and co-chair.
It's brought
people on the right and the left
together

29:27.232 --> 29:29.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a very healthy way.

29:29.067 --> 29:32.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: They decided to
use a tactic
that was born right here in the
Mount Rushmore

29:32.437 --> 29:34.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
state in 1898, the ballot
initiative.

29:34.239 --> 29:34.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REYNOLD NESIBA, South Dakotans
for Responsible
Lending: And you're registered
to vote in

29:34.940 --> 29:36.208 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
South Dakota?

29:36.241 --> 29:38.076 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Yes.

29:38.110 --> 29:41.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: Reynold Nesiba
is a volunteer
gathering signatures to put a
measure on the

29:41.947 --> 29:47.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ballot that would do what
lawmakers could
not: cap interest rates on all
loans at 36

29:47.352 --> 29:49.187 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
percent.

29:49.221 --> 29:52.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REYNOLD NESIBA: And I feel so
strongly about
this that I'm the treasurer of
this campaign,

29:52.290 --> 29:55.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so that's my name on the bottom.
If you're
registered to vote, I would love
to have your

29:55.560 --> 29:57.329 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
signature.

29:57.362 --> 30:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: The goal? To
get well more
than the 13,871 signatures
required to put

30:01.466 --> 30:06.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the issue in front of voters
next November.
With millions of dollars in
revenue at stake,

30:06.038 --> 30:10.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the lending industry is strongly
opposed to
any new regulation.

30:10.409 --> 30:14.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two-thirds of U.S. states allow
some form
of high-interest-rate loans, and
when similar

30:14.479 --> 30:18.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
initiatives have sprung up in
other states,
the industry has fought back.
Here in South

30:18.950 --> 30:22.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dakota, the lending industry is
fighting back
using a ballot initiative
itself.

30:22.654 --> 30:29.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE HILDEBRAND: They were
putting forward
an 18 percent rate cap in order
to convince

30:29.261 --> 30:33.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people they should sign that
one, instead
of the 36, because 18 sounds
better than 36,

30:33.231 --> 30:34.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right?

30:34.966 --> 30:37.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: By that
initiative comes
with a catch. It only caps rates
at 18 percent

30:37.969 --> 30:43.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- quote -- "unless the borrower
agrees to
another rate in writing,"
meaning if the borrower

30:43.241 --> 30:47.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wants the loan, they have to
agree to whatever
terms the lender demands.

30:47.479 --> 30:50.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE HILDEBRAND: So, the 18
percent rate
cap is just a fake cap.

30:50.716 --> 30:54.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: Teams of paid
circulators
have been out across the state
gathering signatures

30:54.986 --> 30:59.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for that petition. None were
willing to speak
with us on camera, and repeated
requests for

30:59.324 --> 31:01.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
comment went unanswered.

31:01.226 --> 31:06.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When asked about capping rates
at 36 percent,
the one payday lender who did
speak with us

31:06.932 --> 31:08.734 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was unequivocal.

31:08.767 --> 31:11.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK BRENNAN, CEO, Dollar Loan
Center: It's
a kill-bill for the state. The
entire lending

31:11.703 --> 31:13.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
industry would be out of
business with it.

31:13.572 --> 31:16.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: Chuck Brennan,
a Sioux Falls
native, is the founder and CEO
of Dollar Loan

31:16.842 --> 31:21.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Center, a chain of more than 90
short-term
lending stores, with 11
locations in South

31:21.646 --> 31:23.582 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Dakota.

31:23.615 --> 31:26.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK BRENNAN: We have a huge
customer base.
In South Dakota, we have had
over 40,000 applicants

31:26.818 --> 31:31.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for loans over the years. Over
20 percent
of the state who is over 18 has
applied for

31:31.189 --> 31:35.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a loan here, which really shows
there's a
need for the product out there.

31:35.227 --> 31:39.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: Further,
Brennan says a rate
cap will actually harm the
people it is intended

31:39.331 --> 31:41.199 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to help.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK BRENNAN: It isn't like
when the industry
goes out of business people are
going to stop

31:43.602 --> 31:47.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
needing money. They're going to
have to turn
to online loans, illegal
sources, and something

31:47.606 --> 31:49.407 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that the state can't regulate.

31:49.441 --> 31:53.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: But Hickey
says, in reality,
there are plenty of ways to help
people who

31:53.378 --> 31:56.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need money without charging them
triple-digit
interest.

31:56.047 --> 32:00.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE HICKEY: As an employer
with employees,
I would give a payday advance. I
know Steve

32:01.019 --> 32:06.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hildebrand does at his coffee
shop. He will
lend somebody money on their
paycheck at zero

32:06.224 --> 32:11.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
percent interest, and maybe
there could even
be regulation on that. Four
times a year,

32:11.663 --> 32:13.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's an employee benefit.

32:13.465 --> 32:18.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: After months of
hard work,
the campaign gathered over
20,000 signatures

32:18.470 --> 32:23.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Hildebrand to deliver to the
secretary
of state. But the opposing
lender-supported

32:23.208 --> 32:26.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaign also managed to gather
enough signatures
to get on the ballot.

32:26.845 --> 32:30.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE HILDEBRAND: The payday
lenders are going
to spend millions of dollars on
television

32:31.016 --> 32:35.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trying to confuse voters and
misrepresent
our side.

32:35.754 --> 32:39.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: So, the fight's
not over.
Hildebrand has one year to
convince South

32:39.925 --> 32:46.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Dakotans to vote for his
interest rate cap.
In the meantime, T.J. ended up
losing his

32:46.765 --> 32:50.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fight to save his leg. It was
amputated six
months after he lost his job.

32:50.602 --> 32:53.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KRISTI MCLAUGHLIN: It needs to
go at least
to there.

32:53.872 --> 32:58.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: T.J. and Kristi
are now focused
on rehab, instead of the title
loan.

32:58.810 --> 33:03.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRISTI MCLAUGHLIN: I told them
to come and
get the car. Take it. You know,
our world

33:03.815 --> 33:07.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has fallen out from underneath
us, and if
you want it that badly, come and
get it.

33:07.385 --> 33:10.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: Over
Thanksgiving, the lender
repossessed their car.

33:10.822 --> 33:19.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
T.J. MCLAUGHLIN: People get
sick. And, you
know, if it's serious enough,
they can lose

33:19.231 --> 33:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
everything. We lost everything
in a matter
of a week, it seems like.

33:21.600 --> 33:24.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: T.J. and Kristi
may have
to find their way out of this
devastation

33:24.202 --> 33:28.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on their own. But they hope, by
speaking out,
they can at least save other
South Dakotans

33:28.607 --> 33:32.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from becoming trapped in a
nightmare of high
interest rates.

33:32.477 --> 33:37.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," Andrew
Schmertz in
Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

33:37.182 --> 33:42.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now Hari Sreenivasan takes a
broader look
at the problems lower-income
Americans face

33:42.187 --> 33:44.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when it comes to getting the
money they need.

33:44.556 --> 33:49.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: South Dakota
isn't the only
place where payday loans are
such a big problem.

33:49.928 --> 33:54.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While a few states have banned
or imposed
strict regulations on these
fringe lenders,

33:54.733 --> 34:00.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're ubiquitous in most of
the country.
In fact, there are more payday
lending storefronts

34:00.138 --> 34:03.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than there are Starbucks and
McDonald's combined.

34:03.808 --> 34:09.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In her book "How the Other Half
Banks," Mehrsa
Baradaran explores the booming
industry providing

34:09.414 --> 34:16.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
financial services to the poor
at exorbitant
costs and offers some more
equitable solutions.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for joining us.

34:17.789 --> 34:22.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, why -- where is this gap
created? And
why isn't there an incentive for
all banks

34:22.360 --> 34:24.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to reach out to all people with
money?

34:24.162 --> 34:26.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MEHRSA BARADARAN, Author, "How
the Other Half
Banks": The gap is fairly new.

34:26.097 --> 34:31.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, starting in the 1980s, a lot
of community
banks started shutting down
branches in lower-income

34:31.336 --> 34:35.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
areas, inner-city neighborhoods,
areas where
their profit margins were lower
than in other

34:35.740 --> 34:41.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
areas. And so part of it is,
it's higher cost
to lend to someone or to take a
small deposit

34:41.947 --> 34:47.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than it is to get a big deposit.
Right? Your
overhead is the same whether
you're, you know,

34:47.085 --> 34:54.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taking in $100,000 vs. taking in
$500, but
your revenue off of that
$100,000 is much

34:54.693 --> 34:57.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
higher than it is off of that
small deposit.

34:57.228 --> 35:02.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so these banks started
leaving these areas.
And part of it is that the
government deregulatory

35:02.600 --> 35:07.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forces allowed them to merge and
form these
huge conglomerates such as Bank
of America.

35:07.272 --> 35:12.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, as these banks leave, they
leave this
void for banking service. And
this is a void

35:12.043 --> 35:16.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that quickly is filled by these
fringe lenders,
so payday loans, check cashing.

35:16.681 --> 35:19.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, when you
go through
certain cities, just like there
are food deserts

35:20.018 --> 35:23.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where you don't have a grocery
store, it seems
like there are almost bank
deserts, where

35:23.221 --> 35:26.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's populated primarily with
these lenders
that you're talking about.

35:26.491 --> 35:28.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How much money is there to be
made?

35:28.293 --> 35:34.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEHRSA BARADARAN: It's an $89
billion industry
yearly. And it doesn't seem that
way.

35:34.265 --> 35:37.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when you go into these
neighborhoods,
these check cashers or payday
lenders, they

35:37.702 --> 35:44.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seem like neighborhood joints.
But they're
really sort of multinational
corporations.

35:44.309 --> 35:47.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're large, very profitable
organizations.

35:47.145 --> 35:52.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have this, what I call
a facade of
informality, right? So it seems
as though,

35:52.083 --> 35:55.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look, they speak your language.
They're in
your neighborhood, but, really,
behind them,

35:55.620 --> 35:59.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there is a lot of bank
financing. These are
very sort of corporate, big, big
firms.

35:59.858 --> 36:04.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: These
companies are going
to say, look, I'm taking a
greater risk. This

36:04.295 --> 36:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a person that is not as
creditworthy as
someone who maybe walks into a
Bank of America

36:08.633 --> 36:13.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a much larger amount of
assets, right,
so shouldn't I be able to charge
a higher

36:13.805 --> 36:15.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interest rate to get them this
money fast?

36:15.807 --> 36:20.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MEHRSA BARADARAN: It is
certainly a higher
risk to lend to someone who's
low-income.

36:20.211 --> 36:24.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, there's a lot of
studies to show
that the price that they're
actually charging

36:24.416 --> 36:29.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
isn't the cost of the loan. It's
also fairly
misleading when you compare it
to the credit

36:29.287 --> 36:32.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
markets that the middle class
and higher income
have access to.

36:32.924 --> 36:38.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the big points of the
book is,
even assuming that this is a
market price

36:38.663 --> 36:43.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they're charging and it is
the cost of
credit because of the risks and
the defaults,

36:43.535 --> 36:48.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
et cetera, the rest of us don't
pay market
prices for credit.

36:48.306 --> 36:52.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The credit markets, whether it's
for our mortgages,
our student loans, any sort of
bank credit

36:52.844 --> 36:55.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you get is heavily subsidized by
the federal
government.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The book is
called "How
the Other Half Banks."

36:57.582 --> 37:01.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mehrsa Baradaran, thanks so much
for joining
us.

37:01.052 --> 37:08.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEHRSA BARADARAN: Thank you.

37:08.193 --> 37:16.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S.
Department of Homeland
Security conducted a series of
raids over

37:16.701 --> 37:22.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
New Year's weekend on
undocumented immigrants
in a number of states, including
Georgia,

37:22.740 --> 37:25.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
North Carolina and Texas.

37:25.076 --> 37:30.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Federal officials said they have
taken more
than 100 people into custody,
most of whom

37:30.115 --> 37:35.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
arrived in the U.S. within the
past two years,
and are now awaiting
deportation.

37:35.887 --> 37:40.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But immigration groups are
fighting back,
and the nation's highest
immigration court

37:40.658 --> 37:44.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issued a ruling last night to
delay some of
the deportations.

37:44.662 --> 37:51.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Even before these moves,
hundreds of thousands
of undocumented immigrants were
being deported

37:51.536 --> 37:55.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
annually. And for those who grew
up in the
U.S., that means they have found
themselves

37:55.840 --> 37:59.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
living in what feels like a
foreign country.

37:59.144 --> 38:03.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Fred de
Sam Lazaro reports
from Mexico.

38:03.915 --> 38:09.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Miguel
Ramirez works in
Mexico City, and an almost daily
ritual is

38:09.487 --> 38:15.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to call his mother in Saint
Louis. He lived
there too, until he was deported
three years

38:15.160 --> 38:18.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ago, and banned for life from
ever reentering
the U.S.

38:18.930 --> 38:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIGUEL RAMIREZ, Returnee: She's
-- she's devastated,
you know?

38:21.933 --> 38:28.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The shy
23-year-old, brought
to the U.S. by his mother as a
young child,

38:28.339 --> 38:32.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
admits he fell in with the wrong
crowd. He
got caught in a burglary and his
sentence

38:32.944 --> 38:35.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was community service, until:

38:35.113 --> 38:42.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIGUEL RAMIREZ: I get a note
from the judge
telling me that, because you're
an illegal

38:42.754 --> 38:47.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immigrant, you don't qualify for
this program,
and you're going to have to
start doing your

38:47.125 --> 38:48.993 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

38:49.027 --> 38:51.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Most of his
time was actually
done in immigrant detention
centers before

38:51.262 --> 38:53.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he was dropped off at the
Mexican border.

38:53.464 --> 38:56.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIGUEL RAMIREZ: That, to me, was
rough. It
was one of the roughest things
ever. But,

38:56.601 --> 38:59.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, I had to accept it. I
had no choice.

38:59.470 --> 39:03.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Ramirez is
one of several
young Mexican returnees profiled
in a book

39:03.875 --> 39:09.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
called "Los Otros Dreamers" by
scholar and
social activist Jill Anderson.

39:09.247 --> 39:13.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some have committed felonies,
she says, but
the vast majority have no
criminal history

39:13.952 --> 39:15.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or just minor infractions.

39:15.820 --> 39:19.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JILL ANDERSON, Author, "Los
Otros Dreamers":
For many, it's contact with
their local police

39:19.190 --> 39:27.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for anything from underage
drinking, accusations
from a neighbor or friends. One
young woman

39:27.365 --> 39:30.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was baby-sitting and had a
problem with the
family.

39:30.335 --> 39:35.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: In 2012,
President Obama
issued an executive order that
allowed the

39:35.607 --> 39:39.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
children of undocumented
workers, many of
whom had grown up in the United
States, the

39:39.811 --> 39:41.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
option to remain.

39:41.679 --> 39:44.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Specifically for certain young
people sometimes

39:44.816 --> 39:46.718 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
called dreamers.

39:46.751 --> 39:50.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The order
came after Congress
rejected similar legislation
called the DREAM

39:50.622 --> 39:56.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Act. And it came after perhaps a
half-million
young Mexicans were either
deported or chose

39:56.327 --> 39:57.629 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to return.

39:57.662 --> 40:00.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: This was a cute guy I had
a crush on
in my freshman year.

40:00.965 --> 40:05.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Viridiana
and Maggie belong
to Los Otros Dreamers, or the
Other Dreamers,

40:05.770 --> 40:09.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a group that mostly meets
online, brought
together by Anderson's book.

40:09.974 --> 40:15.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Viridiana says, growing up in
Iowa, she felt
no stigma over her illegal
status.

40:15.613 --> 40:19.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIRIDIANA, Returnee: My parents
always told
me, never tell anyone that we're
here undocumented.

40:19.250 --> 40:24.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, at first, it was just
kind of like,
OK, I'm young and who cares?
Like, I mean,

40:24.522 --> 40:27.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what's so -- what's wrong in
being undocumented?

40:27.258 --> 40:33.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: It was no
big deal growing
up, she says, until:

40:33.164 --> 40:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Dad goes to work one day and...

40:35.300 --> 40:40.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIRIDIANA: Never comes home.
They went to
his workplace, and they took
him.

40:40.638 --> 40:45.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Twenty-two
years after
he arrived and settled quietly
in small-town

40:45.877 --> 40:52.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iowa, Juan Vargas (ph) was
arrested and deported.
That brought abrupt, wrenching
decisions for

40:52.417 --> 40:54.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
others in the family.

40:54.285 --> 41:01.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIRIDIANA: My older sister, she
-- she decided
to stay in the United States,
and I totally

41:01.225 --> 41:07.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
understand that. It is my home
too. I do miss
it, but, you know, I would
rather stay with

41:07.765 --> 41:09.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my parents.

41:09.534 --> 41:14.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Viridiana
quit her job
and, with her mother, returned
to Mexico,

41:14.105 --> 41:15.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
against her father's wishes.

41:15.907 --> 41:20.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIRIDIANA: He said: "I don't
want you here.
I don't want you to be here.
Just stay home."

41:20.178 --> 41:24.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
Twenty-five-year-old Maggie
got the same advice from her
parents. Home

41:24.615 --> 41:29.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for her was Dalton, Georgia,
where she too
felt no different from her wide
circle of

41:29.821 --> 41:31.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
friends until high school.

41:31.522 --> 41:35.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAGGIE, Returnee: I wanted to go
to work.
I wanted to find scholarships.
That's when

41:35.526 --> 41:41.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things started to -- wait, so
you're different?
That's when I started to
actually recognize

41:41.933 --> 41:46.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was undocumented and that I
wasn't -- I
didn't have the same
opportunities.

41:46.070 --> 41:50.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Lacking
money to go to
college or get a legal,
good-paying job, she

41:50.608 --> 41:56.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decided, agonizingly, to move to
Mexico, a
country she'd left at age 3.

41:56.280 --> 42:04.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAGGIE: My parents stayed. I
came by myself
at 18. And it was during -- this
month, it

42:04.322 --> 42:10.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was like if somebody had died
inside of me,
because it was like, OK, bye,
house, bye,

42:10.828 --> 42:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
church, bye, friends, bye,
school, bye, dog.
I mean, I wasn't prepared.

42:15.566 --> 42:21.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Mexico
wasn't prepared
for her or other returnees
either. Until recently,

42:21.572 --> 42:28.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. education credentials were
not even recognized.
Aside from official
indifference, Viridiana

42:28.179 --> 42:32.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says there's social stigma and
suspicion that
they are criminal deportees.

42:32.750 --> 42:37.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIRIDIANA: Why are you back?
That's like the
first thing that they ask. Why
are you back?

42:37.221 --> 42:39.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is the problem? They treat
us like crap.

42:39.857 --> 42:41.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Author Jill
Anderson:

42:41.793 --> 42:47.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JILL ANDERSON: They realize,
wow, I thought
I was Mexican. I don't talk like
a Mexican

42:47.298 --> 42:57.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because of my accent when I
speak Spanish.
People actually will call me
pocho or gringo,

42:57.074 --> 42:59.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and question as to why I'm even
here.

42:59.444 --> 43:05.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: There is one
industry
that is happy they're here: call
centers,

43:05.082 --> 43:07.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whose operators speak American
English.

43:07.552 --> 43:12.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I get to meet people from
all over
the United States when they call
my employer

43:12.089 --> 43:14.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with their customer service
questions.

43:14.058 --> 43:18.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Call centers
have proliferated
across Mexican cities, their
promotional videos

43:19.030 --> 43:25.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like this one on the Internet
geared to American
customers. It's one of few
places where returnees

43:25.603 --> 43:31.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can find work. They even waived
the requirement
of a high school diploma for
Miguel Ramirez,

43:31.642 --> 43:33.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and he says they pay a decent
wage.

43:33.578 --> 43:37.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIGUEL RAMIREZ: This job is very
tedious.
You feel like you're getting
nowhere. It doesn't

43:37.548 --> 43:41.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make me feel very successful or
proud of myself,
to be honest with you. I want to
do something

43:41.719 --> 43:43.488 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

43:43.521 --> 43:46.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Call centers
do report
a high turnover. And living in
Mexico, where

43:46.491 --> 43:51.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many people struggle with life's
more basic
needs, Viridiana says it was
hard for her

43:51.729 --> 43:54.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to deal with what she saw as
trivial concerns.

43:54.632 --> 43:58.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIRIDIANA: I couldn't handle the
calls. I
was just like, oh, my God, like,
these people

43:58.336 --> 44:04.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that -- why are they just
complaining about
their dish service? Like,
really? And then

44:04.675 --> 44:09.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm thinking like, girl, you
used to be one
of those dish people that would
call and be

44:09.313 --> 44:11.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like, what is wrong with you?
Your service
sucks.

44:11.582 --> 44:12.950 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

44:12.984 --> 44:15.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VIRIDIANA: Like, that really
bothers me, and
I cannot do this job.

44:15.753 --> 44:21.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: She now
works as a transportation
dispatcher and lives with her
parents. Her

44:21.626 --> 44:27.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mother, Patrice Hidalgo, says,
on a fraction
of their former income, life
here is difficult.

44:27.665 --> 44:32.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICE HIDALGO, Returnee
(through translator):
Here, because of my age I can't
get a job.

44:32.537 --> 44:38.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the security situation is
not good. It's
much worse now in Mexico than it
was before

44:38.175 --> 44:40.044 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
we left.

44:40.077 --> 44:44.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And the
security situation
along the migration routes to
the U.S., now

44:44.549 --> 44:51.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
overrun by gangs trafficking in
drugs and
people, keeps many from fleeing
Mexico again.

44:51.122 --> 44:53.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you ever contemplate going
back to the
United States illegally?

44:53.858 --> 45:00.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIGUEL RAMIREZ: I do. I do
contemplate it,
not a lot, because there's a
risk.

45:00.431 --> 45:05.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: For her
part, Maggie got
a job teaching English, and she
attends college,

45:05.836 --> 45:08.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hoping to get into tourism
promotion.

45:08.039 --> 45:15.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAGGIE: I want to travel more in
this country.
I know it's beautiful. I know it
has many

45:15.880 --> 45:19.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
positive things. And I'm
starting to see that
beautiful side of Mexico.

45:19.951 --> 45:25.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And she
plans to visit
the U.S. again, and often, only
now with passport

45:26.023 --> 45:27.592 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and visa.

45:27.625 --> 45:32.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Fred de Sam
Lazaro in Leon, Mexico.

45:32.096 --> 45:37.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fred's reporting
is a partnership
with the Under-Told Stories
Project at the

45:37.468 --> 45:43.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
University of St. Thomas in
Minnesota.

45:43.674 --> 45:56.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now to an inspiring
story about
one of last year's MacArthur
grant winners

45:56.821 --> 45:59.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and how design can change lives.

45:59.590 --> 46:05.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Jackie
Judd reports
for our Breakthroughs series on
innovation

46:05.229 --> 46:07.064 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and invention.

46:07.098 --> 46:14.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: In the hands of
Alex Truesdell,
a simple piece of cardboard
turns into a world

46:14.405 --> 46:19.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of possibilities. Her life's
mission began
by accident.

46:19.610 --> 46:24.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Truesdell was rooting around in
a closet at
a school where she was teaching
and found

46:24.215 --> 46:27.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a chair that had been made for a
disabled
adult.

46:27.084 --> 46:30.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALEX TRUESDELL, Founder,
Adaptive Design Association:
The armrest and the footrest on
it were actually

46:30.821 --> 46:34.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at different heights on the left
side than
the right side. And I asked
about it, and

46:34.959 --> 46:38.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they said, oh, that's made of
cardboard. And
I think my head exploded.

46:38.896 --> 46:40.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Why did your head
explode?

46:40.765 --> 46:44.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX TRUESDELL: The idea that
you could take
that material and turn it into
what you needed,

46:44.402 --> 46:46.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, if you needed something,
you could make
something.

46:46.937 --> 46:53.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Truesdell has been
making something
ever since with her triple-ply
cardboard,

46:53.310 --> 46:59.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
glue and simple tools. In New
York City, at
the Adaptive Design Association,
which she

46:59.650 --> 47:05.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
founded, cardboard furniture and
learning
tools are built for children
with disabilities.

47:05.556 --> 47:10.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX TRUESDELL: It makes the
child, one, believe
in their own capacity, and then
everyone who

47:11.028 --> 47:16.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
knows and loves the child
believe in what
they're able to do. I think it
upends the

47:16.467 --> 47:22.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prognosis, because, so often,
unfortunately,
the word disability signals
broken, can't,

47:22.506 --> 47:24.208 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
isn't.

47:24.241 --> 47:31.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Creating this very
individualized
furniture often involves a house
call. In

47:31.716 --> 47:38.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
suburban New Jersey,
21-month-old Austin Kellenberger
is getting his first fitting for
a chair and

47:38.756 --> 47:40.524 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a table.

47:40.558 --> 47:42.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KELLENBERGER, Father of
Austin: Austin
has significant motor
development issues.

47:42.860 --> 47:45.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has difficulty even moving
his arm.

47:45.596 --> 47:51.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Today, even as a
toddler, dad
John Kellenberger says, Austin
feels apart

47:51.635 --> 47:54.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from his twin brother and older
sister.

47:54.171 --> 47:57.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KELLENBERGER: Oftentimes,
my other son,
Dylan (ph), and my daughter,
Savannah (ph),

47:57.441 --> 48:03.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will be playing at the table
with toys. He's
not able to do that. So, you do
see he is

48:03.280 --> 48:06.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very frustrated. He wants to --
he's a very
social boy. He wants to be part
of the group.

48:06.884 --> 48:11.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: This furniture is
supposed to
make that possible, to make
Austin feel less

48:11.989 --> 48:14.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
different and to build his
physical strength.

48:14.892 --> 48:21.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX TRUESDELL: Right now, he
fatigues quickly,
but he hasn't had the right
chair in order

48:21.632 --> 48:29.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to build strength. So, the
angles of this
will actually give him a bit of
a challenge.

48:29.640 --> 48:36.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Cardboard is
relatively inexpensive,
readily available and really
sturdy, a trifecta

48:36.380 --> 48:43.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for growing kids and for
families, often burdened
by medical costs, who are asked
for contributions

48:43.154 --> 48:47.925 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of just $500.

48:47.958 --> 48:53.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Austin's chair is measured, and
measured again,
and cut to within an eighth of
an inch, so

48:53.664 --> 48:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it is just exactly right for the
little boy.

48:56.167 --> 49:01.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX TRUESDELL: We need a custom
fit in an
off-the-rack world. And if it
doesn't fit,

49:01.071 --> 49:05.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if the child struggles, and
they're already
struggling, it's going to use up
that energy

49:05.976 --> 49:11.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and be discouraging. And then
they or someone
else will give up, and get the
wrong idea

49:11.715 --> 49:18.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the child's potential, as
opposed to
being inspired enough to change
the thing,

49:18.489 --> 49:20.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
change the environment to make
it work.

49:20.257 --> 49:24.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Truesdell saw that
happen in
her own family, and it was a
life-changer.

49:25.029 --> 49:30.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her uncle turned conventional
household tools
into something her aunt, who had
lost the

49:30.201 --> 49:32.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
use of her hands, could
manipulate.

49:32.136 --> 49:38.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX TRUESDELL: My uncle was
able to repurpose
things, bend things that were
too straight,

49:38.075 --> 49:43.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cut things that were too long,
connect things.
And that thought, that you could
engineer

49:43.080 --> 49:47.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
change to suit her specific
needs, is really
the root of this.

49:47.751 --> 49:52.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: The workshop has
turned out pieces
this year for more than 200 New
York area

49:52.990 --> 49:56.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kids, but many more children can
use them.

49:56.260 --> 50:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Alex Truesdell and her team
spend as much
time teaching as they do
designing and building.

50:02.299 --> 50:06.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the last several years alone,
they have
led several hundred design
workshops and have

50:06.570 --> 50:11.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
answered inquiries from around
the globe.
As a result, these cardboard
creations are

50:11.175 --> 50:17.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being built in about six U.S.
locations and
in countries as diverse as
India, Romania

50:17.314 --> 50:19.049 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Peru.

50:19.083 --> 50:22.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX TRUESDELL: We try to use
methods here
that could be used anywhere in
the world.

50:22.152 --> 50:28.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, any technique, anything we
make, the materials
we use, we want other people to
see what we

50:28.525 --> 50:33.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do and copy it. We really are
trying to supply
the movement, so that we would
inspire imitation,

50:33.764 --> 50:36.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cooperation, and collaboration
throughout.

50:36.200 --> 50:43.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Truesdell sees some
children
only once and others throughout
their lives.

50:43.340 --> 50:48.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She met New York City teenager
Hannah Auchincloss
(ph) as a toddler, when Hannah's
mother, Tracy

50:48.646 --> 50:53.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ehrlich, was struggling to find
a chair in
which Hannah could feed sitting
up.

50:53.617 --> 50:56.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACY EHRLICH, Mother of Hannah:
She couldn't
do any of those things, and she
was much too

50:56.887 --> 50:58.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
small for conventional
wheelchairs.

50:58.722 --> 51:02.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: So there was
nothing you could
have ordered online, or gone
into a medical

51:02.860 --> 51:06.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supply store and say, that's
what I need,
that's what would help her?

51:06.830 --> 51:09.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRACY EHRLICH: No, absolutely
not, because
she was so young.

51:09.133 --> 51:14.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Ehrlich has lost
track of all
the pieces Truesdell has made
for Hannah,

51:14.138 --> 51:19.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and even some for her sisters,
so the family
feels bound together, instead of
separated

51:19.576 --> 51:26.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by Hannah's challenges. But some
pieces stand
out, like the bike, the scooter
and a beloved

51:26.317 --> 51:29.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rocking chair that Hannah can
get moving on
her own.

51:29.586 --> 51:36.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX TRUESDELL: The experience
of moving herself
at just -- one thing she can
really control

51:36.694 --> 51:38.629 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
every day.

51:38.662 --> 51:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACY EHRLICH: I think that all
of the different
pieces of equipment have opened
up the possibilities

51:42.833 --> 51:48.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for her, the opportunities for
her to interact
with her world, interact with
the people who

51:48.472 --> 51:50.374 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are around her.

51:50.407 --> 51:54.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: In New Jersey,
Austin Kellenberger
is just beginning to interact
with his world.

51:54.945 --> 52:00.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
His furniture has been
delivered. And what
most see as a simple chair, his
parents, John

52:00.784 --> 52:02.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Danielle (ph), see as
transformative.

52:02.820 --> 52:07.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KELLENBERGER: I want Austin
to reach
whatever the potential that he
has. I want

52:07.624 --> 52:11.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him to reach that. I don't know
what that
is. The doctors don't know what
that is at

52:11.462 --> 52:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this point. But whatever it is,
I want to
give him every chance to meet
that. And this

52:16.633 --> 52:20.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is one of the -- frankly, this
is one of the
things that's helping us do
that.

52:20.104 --> 52:25.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Alex Truesdell
started out as
a teacher for the blind. What
she has done

52:25.042 --> 52:31.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is let children, thousands of
them, see and
experience movement, growth and
confidence,

52:32.016 --> 52:36.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all through a simple piece of

its first ever digital map of
the nation's

53:02.646 --> 53:09.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
northernmost state. In vibrant
colors, it
reveals thousands of Alaska's
geological details

53:09.353 --> 53:15.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that can be used to contribute
to mineral,
energy, hazard, and other types
of scientific

53:15.392 --> 53:17.161 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
assessments.

where rare-earth
elements, like those used in
electronics,

53:21.899 --> 53:27.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are most likely to be uncovered,
while green
represents the rocks where most
dinosaur fossils

some 20 years to create. They
drew on more
than 750 references, some dating
back to the

bring tropical diseases like the
mosquito-borne
dengue and Zika viruses. How do
warmer conditions

54:07.644 --> 54:13.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
affect the rates of disease, and
which areas
are most susceptible? Read the
