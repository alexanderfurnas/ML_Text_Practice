JUDY WOODRUFF: And
now a story about the
founding of our nation.

00:03.800 --> 00:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A distant ancestor of Rohulamin
Quander was enslaved at George
Washington's Mount Vernon

00:09.766 --> 00:11.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
estate in Virginia.

00:11.833 --> 00:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Quander is now a tour guide
there, where he offers a unique
perspective on the contributions

00:17.633 --> 00:19.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of African-Americans to
our country's history.

00:19.866 --> 00:24.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This story was filmed, edited
and produced by middle and
high school students who are

00:26.200 --> 00:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
part of the "NewsHour"'s
Student Reporting Labs program.

ROHULAMIN QUANDER, Family
Historian: The past always
has an impact on the future.

00:34.433 --> 00:38.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Those who do not know
their past are kind of
destined to repeat it.

00:38.433 --> 00:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have that program every year.

00:40.433 --> 00:42.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have been coming
here all my life.

00:42.400 --> 00:44.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I remember when I was
like about 12 years old.

00:44.800 --> 00:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I didn't fully understand
or appreciate the family's
longstanding connection.

00:51.866 --> 00:53.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to go up to the
exhibit, Lives Bound Together:
Slavery at George Washington's

00:53.300 --> 00:55.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mount Vernon.

00:55.366 --> 00:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am a licensed tour guide
in the District of Columbia,
and I come and I bring groups

00:58.833 --> 01:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all over the metropolitan
Washington, D.C.,
including to George
Washington's Mount Vernon,

01:05.666 --> 01:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which the Quander family
has a longstanding
historical connection with.

01:09.200 --> 01:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN SCHOELWER, Co-Curator,
Mount Vernon: Nancy Carter
was a young girl, really, who

01:16.266 --> 01:19.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was 11 years old in 1799
when George Washington
made provisions in his
will to free his slaves.

01:21.900 --> 01:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her mother, Suckey Bay was her
name, was an enslaved woman who
lived on one of Washington's

01:27.766 --> 01:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
five farms and was a field hand.

01:30.300 --> 01:35.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So when Washington
freed his slaves, then
Nancy Carter was free.

01:35.100 --> 01:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She later married Charles
Quander, who was a member
of the Quander family.

01:42.600 --> 01:46.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so there are many
descendants that come
down from that and are
part of the large Quander

01:48.500 --> 01:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
family, which, as you
know, is one of the
oldest, if not the oldest,
documented African-American

01:52.466 --> 01:54.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
family in the country.

01:54.466 --> 01:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROHULAMIN QUANDER: The
family history goes back
into Maryland in the 1600s.

02:00.166 --> 02:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We hear about the Hamiltons and
the Madisons and the Jeffersons.

02:05.800 --> 02:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, do we hear about the
enslaved people who made sure
the crops were in, who made

02:10.800 --> 02:13.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
sure the fishing was
proper, who made sure
the distillery was run?

02:13.233 --> 02:18.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were the ones who were
the backbone, so that George
Washington could go off and

02:19.100 --> 02:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
become the father of our nation.

02:21.200 --> 02:26.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN SCHOELWER: You
really can't understand
George Washington's life
without understanding

02:28.066 --> 02:31.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the lives of the people whose
lives were intertwined with his,
whose work supported his estate.

02:33.633 --> 02:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROHULAMIN QUANDER: I
try to instill into
everyone the importance of
understanding where we as

02:38.566 --> 02:40.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Americans came from.

02:40.633 --> 02:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I often say this is not a
black history tour; this is
an American history tour.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: I think, for me, it's
really -- it gives me a sense
of history to share with

02:49.000 --> 02:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my kids, and it's also really
neat to be able to participate
in this tour with Mr. Quander,

02:53.633 --> 02:58.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
as he has relatives and
his ancestry line is
here at Mount Vernon.

02:58.266 --> 03:03.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN SCHOELWER: It's also, I
think, important to honor the
lives and the contributions of

03:05.266 --> 03:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the people who were enslaved
here and elsewhere whose stories
have not been told, have perhaps

03:10.900 --> 03:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not been remembered, have
not been appreciated.

03:12.600 --> 03:17.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ROHULAMIN QUANDER: We
are a bridge from the
past to the present.

03:19.133 --> 03:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have a responsibility
of upholding the Quander
name and lifting others as we

03:23.633 --> 03:25.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
climb.

03:25.700 --> 03:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's important for
people to understand that
we have earned our rights.

03:28.900 --> 03:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have built, literally
physically built Mount Vernon,
built the United States Capitol,

03:35.333 --> 03:37.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
built the White House, along
with other people, of course.

03:37.366 --> 03:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we need people in the
African-American diaspora to
understand that we have always

03:43.266 --> 03:44.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been a part of what
constitutes America.
