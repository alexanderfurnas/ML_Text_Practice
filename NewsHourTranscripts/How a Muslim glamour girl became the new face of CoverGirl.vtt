Now to a "NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught our eye
that might be of interest to

00:05.766 --> 00:07.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you, too.

00:07.833 --> 00:11.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just five years ago, Nura Afia
was a young mother in Denver
who enjoyed watching YouTube

00:13.000 --> 00:14.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
videos while taking
care of her daughter.

00:14.966 --> 00:17.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It turns out it was
time well spent.

00:17.533 --> 00:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She began producing her own
videos on how to apply makeup.

00:21.633 --> 00:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now she's a sensation,
becoming the first Muslim
brand ambassador for CoverGirl.

Mary MacCarthy from
Colorado Politics brings
us her story from Denver.

NURA AFIA, Model: CoverGirl
was the big break for me that
I never thought I would get.

00:40.100 --> 00:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was a national beauty
campaign that I never thought
I would see anyone that looks

00:42.433 --> 00:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like me featured in or
anyone that dresses like me.

MARY MACCARTHY, Colorado
Politics: From this humble home
studio, with her daughter's toys

00:49.700 --> 00:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at her feet, Nura Afia has built
an international following.

00:58.833 --> 01:03.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
With 340,000 followers
on Instagram and over
200,000 subscribers to
her YouTube channel,

01:06.300 --> 01:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the 25-year-old makes a very
good living with these tutorials
on the art of applying makeup,

01:12.766 --> 01:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the benefits of skin care, and
how to wear the Muslim hijab.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NURA AFIA: I line the
edge up to my scarf.

01:19.300 --> 01:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I posted I was in the
"Glamour" magazine today.

01:22.300 --> 01:26.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And someone said,
"Congratulations, paving the way
for Muslim women everywhere."

01:26.266 --> 01:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY MACCARTHY: It was after
Afia built up her own following
online that makeup brands

01:31.133 --> 01:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
started reaching out to her.

01:36.033 --> 01:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even though her career has
taken off, Afia admits it's a
complicated time to be a visible

01:41.833 --> 01:43.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Muslim in the U.S.

01:43.966 --> 01:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The atmosphere caused by the
election has made her more
cautious, while, at the same

01:48.466 --> 01:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
time, some in her community
have been reaching out.

01:51.333 --> 01:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NURA AFIA: More people, I
feel like, go out of their
way to smile and are nicer.

01:55.233 --> 02:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I feel like that those few
people that are very angry or,
you know, scared of Muslims,

02:05.166 --> 02:07.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they are still few
and far between.

02:07.566 --> 02:12.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARY MACCARTHY: The
wider fashion world
has begun embracing the
hijab, with retail giant

02:14.400 --> 02:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
H&amp;M featuring a veiled
model, and Nike recently
launching a hijab sports line.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NURA AFIA: Hijab isn't
just how you dress.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's supposed to be how you act.

02:23.733 --> 02:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If someone that has never met
a Muslim and they meet me, and
that's their first experience,

02:27.700 --> 02:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm hoping that it's the best
experience, and that wearing
the hijab reminds me that

02:34.333 --> 02:36.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
it needs to be the best
experience for everyone
that comes across me.

02:36.600 --> 02:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY MACCARTHY: Afia hopes the
greater exposure of Islam in the
fashion world will help reduce

02:42.800 --> 02:45.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
negative stereotypes
of Muslim Americans.

02:45.600 --> 02:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

even ask what took us so long.
