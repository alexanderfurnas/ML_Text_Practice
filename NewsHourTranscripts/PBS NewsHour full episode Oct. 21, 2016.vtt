JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.906 --> 00:07.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.674 --> 00:12.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: less
than three
weeks to Election Day, how some
red-leaning

00:12.479 --> 00:18.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states have become unexpected
battlegrounds
and the impact that's having
down ballot.

00:18.318 --> 00:23.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a Maryland man accused of
stealing a massive
amount of classified data from
the National

00:23.657 --> 00:30.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Security Agency was declared a
flight risk
today and is expected to be
charged with espionage.

00:30.063 --> 00:36.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, Mark Shields and David
Brooks analyze
this week full of election news.

00:36.203 --> 00:39.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Plus, Garrison Keillor hands
over the reins.

00:39.606 --> 00:47.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Musician Chris Thile reimagines
the classic
public radio variety show
"Prairie Home Companion"

00:47.047 --> 00:48.982 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for a younger audience and a new
era.

00:49.016 --> 00:54.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS THILE, Host, "A Prairie
Home Companion":
This show, as a place, has been
one of America's

00:54.588 --> 00:59.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most consistent sources of good
things for
40 years.

00:59.192 --> 01:02.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I feel like it's imperative
that it continue.

01:02.296 --> 01:05.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:05.732 --> 01:10.003 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:10.037 --> 01:23.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The presidential
campaigns
focused on states most up for
grabs today,

01:23.283 --> 01:29.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Republican Donald Trump
promising no
regrets in the remaining weeks
of his campaign.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It was a battle of the
battleground states
today

01:31.992 --> 01:36.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
In 18 days, we are going to win
North Carolina.

01:36.496 --> 01:38.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Hello, Cleveland!

01:38.865 --> 01:43.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Donald Trump
campaigned in
the Tar Heel State, where he
went after Hillary

01:43.770 --> 01:47.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton for a paid speech she
made to a Brazilian
bank.

01:47.407 --> 01:49.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was revealed through hacked
e-mails.

01:49.209 --> 01:55.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Speaking in secret
to a foreign
bank, Hillary Clinton said her
dream is for

01:55.182 --> 01:57.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
totally open trade.

01:57.284 --> 01:58.251 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There goes your business.

01:58.285 --> 01:59.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And open borders.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There goes your country.

02:01.254 --> 02:02.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There goes your country.

02:02.255 --> 02:03.223 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BOOING)

02:03.256 --> 02:04.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Oh, we love
WikiLeaks.

02:04.691 --> 02:09.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Then he was off
to Pennsylvania
for two more rallies.

02:09.129 --> 02:12.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton's battleground stop was
in neighboring
Ohio, in Cleveland.

02:12.566 --> 02:17.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: On
Wednesday night,
Donald Trump did something no
other presidential

02:17.904 --> 02:20.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nominee has ever done.

02:20.240 --> 02:25.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He refused to say that he would
respect the
results of this election.

02:25.278 --> 02:26.246 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BOOING)

02:26.279 --> 02:31.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Now,
make no mistake.

02:31.118 --> 02:35.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
By doing that, he is threatening
our democracy.

02:35.055 --> 02:40.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last night, the
rivals sat
practically side-by-side, at the
Alfred E.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Smith Dinner in New York.

02:42.763 --> 02:48.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fund-raiser for Catholic
charities is
traditionally a place for
political roasts.

02:48.802 --> 02:51.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Neither candidate held their
punches, and
one was booed.

02:51.905 --> 02:54.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We have learned so
much from
WikiLeaks.

02:54.875 --> 03:02.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, Hillary believes
that it is vital
to deceive the people by having
one public

03:02.916 --> 03:09.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
policy and a totally different
policy in private.

03:09.322 --> 03:10.957 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BOOING)

03:10.991 --> 03:13.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Donald
wanted me drug
tested before last night's
debate.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.595 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

03:15.629 --> 03:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: And,
look, I got to
tell you, I am so flattered that
Donald thought

03:19.900 --> 03:22.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I used some sort of performance
enhancer.

03:22.869 --> 03:23.804 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

03:23.837 --> 03:27.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Now,
actually I did.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's called preparation.

03:29.509 --> 03:34.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Clinton
campaign, out with
an ad featuring Khizr Khan, a
Muslim-American

03:34.648 --> 03:38.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whose son died while serving in
the U.S. Army
in Iraq.

03:38.218 --> 03:47.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KHIZR KHAN, Father of Killed
U.S. Soldier:
I want to ask Mr. Trump, would
my son have

03:47.060 --> 03:48.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a place in your America?

03:48.695 --> 03:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The ad will air
in key battleground
states.

03:53.166 --> 03:58.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In New Hampshire, where Trump is
lagging,
conservatives turned their focus
to the Senate.

03:58.271 --> 04:02.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: No matter who the next
president
is, New Hampshire needs a strong
voice in

04:02.843 --> 04:04.144 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the U.S. Senate.

04:04.177 --> 04:06.046 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That senator, Kelly Ayotte.

04:06.079 --> 04:12.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ayotte faces a
difficult reelection
bid, and hers is one the tossup
seats that

04:12.252 --> 04:16.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could determine control of the
Senate in just
18 days.

04:16.223 --> 04:21.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will hear more about those
down-ballot
U.S. Senate and House races
after the news

04:21.361 --> 04:23.063 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
summary.

04:23.096 --> 04:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: Russia
extended a
pause in fighting in Aleppo,
Syria, for a

04:26.933 --> 04:32.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
third day, to allow people to
receive aid,
that after the U.N. said planned
evacuations

04:32.939 --> 04:38.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the rebel-held east were
halted, due to
a lack of security guarantees
from the warring

04:38.745 --> 04:40.480 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sides.

04:40.514 --> 04:43.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, addressing a meeting
in Geneva,
the U.N.'s High Commissioner for
Human Rights

04:43.817 --> 04:46.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
again denounced Russian and
Syrian airstrikes.

04:46.319 --> 04:48.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZEID BIN RA'AD ZEID AL-HUSSEIN,
United Nations
High Commissioner for Human
Rights: Indiscriminate

04:48.555 --> 04:53.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
airstrikes across the eastern
part of the
city by government forces and
their allies

04:53.627 --> 05:00.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are responsible for the
overwhelming majority
of civilian casualties, and
these violations

05:00.901 --> 05:02.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
constitute war crimes.

05:02.936 --> 05:08.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if knowingly committed as
part of a widespread
or systematic attack directed
against civilians,

05:08.542 --> 05:10.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they constitute crimes against
humanity.

05:10.710 --> 05:15.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Separately, the
United Nations
set up a special inquiry today
to investigate

05:15.682 --> 05:18.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
alleged human rights abuses in
Aleppo.

05:18.552 --> 05:23.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Iraq, Islamic State militants
launched
attacks of their own today in
and around the

05:23.790 --> 05:25.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
northern city of Kirkuk.

05:25.525 --> 05:31.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Suicide bombers stormed a power
plant, killing
13 workers, including four
Iranians.

05:31.965 --> 05:36.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Explosions and gunfire echoed
throughout that
area for hours.

05:36.203 --> 05:41.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The assault was apparently aimed
at diverting
Iraqi and Kurdish forces away
from their massive

05:41.975 --> 05:45.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
offensive in the ISIS-held city
of Mosul.

05:45.412 --> 05:50.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A passenger train derailed in
the Central
African country of Cameroon
today, killing

05:50.584 --> 05:55.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at least 55 people and injuring
nearly 600
more.

05:55.121 --> 05:59.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some 1,300 people were on board,
more than
twice the normal load.

05:59.893 --> 06:04.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First-responders struggled to
pull mud-soaked
victims from the wreckage.

06:04.297 --> 06:08.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Heavy rains had caused several
roads in the
area to collapse.

06:08.235 --> 06:14.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, a series
of cyber-attacks
made dozens of popular Web sites
inaccessible

06:14.674 --> 06:18.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today, from Twitter to the music
streaming
site Spotify.

06:18.945 --> 06:23.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The hack targeted the New
Hampshire-based
Internet infrastructure provider
Dyn.

06:23.950 --> 06:29.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The attacks were launched from
devices infected
with malware from millions of
I.P. addresses

06:29.823 --> 06:31.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
around the world.

06:31.524 --> 06:35.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The FBI is still working to
determine who's
behind the hack.

06:35.729 --> 06:41.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president of the Philippines
has clarified
comments he made yesterday about
a -- quote

06:41.067 --> 06:43.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- "separation" from the United
States.

06:43.270 --> 06:48.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rodrigo Duterte says he's not
cutting ties
with the U.S., but rather meant
that the Philippines

06:48.875 --> 06:52.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- quote -- "need not dovetail
the foreign
policy of America."

06:52.712 --> 06:57.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Washington, White House
spokesman Josh
Earnest expressed concern about
the leader's

06:57.384 --> 06:59.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
recent pronouncements.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
We have seen too many troubling
public statements

07:01.788 --> 07:04.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from President Duterte over the
last several
months.

07:04.758 --> 07:11.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the frequency of that
rhetoric has added
an element of unnecessary
uncertainty into

07:11.831 --> 07:15.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our relationship that doesn't
advance the
interests of either country.

07:15.568 --> 07:19.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. and the
Philippines
have been allies for 70 years.

07:19.873 --> 07:26.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A U.S. Navy warship sailed near
disputed islands
in the South China Sea today,
drawing a stern

07:26.179 --> 07:27.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rebuke from China.

07:27.947 --> 07:33.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The USS Decatur drew close to
the Paracel
Islands, one of the territories
contested

07:33.153 --> 07:38.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by China and its neighbors,
before two Chinese
ships warned it to leave.

07:38.658 --> 07:43.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
China's Defense Ministry called
the move illegal
and provocative.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And stocks were mixed on Wall
Street today.

07:45.432 --> 07:50.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 16 points
to close at 18145.

07:50.103 --> 07:56.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 15 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
slipped less than a point.

07:56.609 --> 08:01.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the week, all three indexes
gained a fraction
of a percent.

08:01.214 --> 08:05.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the road
to the White House and the
likelihood Democrats

08:05.585 --> 08:11.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could take back the Senate; a
Maryland man
is expected to be charged with
espionage after

08:11.491 --> 08:16.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a massive data breach at the
National Security
Agency; Mark Shields and David
Brooks take

08:16.763 --> 08:30.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the week's political news;
and much more.

08:30.110 --> 08:34.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We return to the presidential
election now
for a look at where the race
stands, what

08:34.948 --> 08:40.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
each nominee's path to victory
is and how
down-ballot races are shaking
out this year.

08:40.153 --> 08:45.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We are joined by our own
correspondent Lisa
Desjardins and Nathan Gonzales.

08:45.091 --> 08:51.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's editor of The Rothenberg &amp;
Gonzales Political
Report and elections editor for
Roll Call.

08:51.731 --> 08:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And hello to both of you.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.268 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Nathan, let's start with
you.

08:55.301 --> 08:57.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The electoral vote map has
shifted a little.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tell us what things look like
right now.

08:59.606 --> 09:01.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHAN GONZALES, The Rothenberg
&amp; Gonzales
Political Report: Well,
Secretary Clinton

09:01.408 --> 09:05.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has had the advantage both in
the national
polls, the national vote, but
also in the

09:05.578 --> 09:07.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Electoral College for quite some
time.

09:07.947 --> 09:11.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But right now, she continues --
there are
a couple of states, Florida and
North Carolina,

09:11.451 --> 09:17.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we just moved from tossup
to leaning,
tilting Democratic, and that
just adds to

09:17.891 --> 09:19.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the 270 electoral votes.

09:19.526 --> 09:22.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, on our map, we have
over 323 electoral
votes.

09:22.962 --> 09:24.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Whoa.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHAN GONZALES: The two tossups
that are
remaining, I think, are Iowa and
Ohio.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what is remarkable is, you
would have
told Republicans that you are
going to win

09:30.970 --> 09:35.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ohio and you're even going to
win Iowa, a
President Obama that won twice,
I think they

09:35.108 --> 09:37.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would be ecstatic.

09:37.076 --> 09:41.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bad news is Florida, North
Carolina, Wisconsin,
Nevada, all of these other
states are in poor

09:41.548 --> 09:43.316 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
shape.

09:43.349 --> 09:45.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's kind of a soft
underbelly of some
traditionally Republican states
that Trump

09:46.019 --> 09:48.021 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is risking losing as well.

09:48.054 --> 09:51.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lisa, given
that, what
is Donald Trump's path forward?

09:52.025 --> 09:52.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Don't you
wonder?

09:53.026 --> 09:54.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this is the fun part.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is where I get to say let's
look at the
map.

09:56.229 --> 10:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the best way to think of
it is that
he needs to win 64 more
electoral votes than

10:00.834 --> 10:03.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mitt Romney did in 2012.

10:03.336 --> 10:06.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The simplest way to do that is
the big three
states.

10:06.139 --> 10:09.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's Pennsylvania, Ohio and
Florida.

10:09.075 --> 10:13.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Problem there, Pennsylvania,
Donald Trump
has not won a poll in
Pennsylvania since June,

10:13.346 --> 10:14.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
since before his convention.

10:14.781 --> 10:17.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So let's imagine that
Pennsylvania is off
the plate.

10:17.817 --> 10:22.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And let's also imagine this is
not -- we don't
know if this will happen -- that
Florida and

10:22.055 --> 10:24.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ohio, for the sake of argument,
go Trump.

10:24.090 --> 10:26.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what he's hoping for in
his path to
victory.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.994 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What does he have to do then?

10:28.027 --> 10:32.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, look at the remaining
swing states we
have across the country.

10:32.098 --> 10:36.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump now has to win two
or three of
these in order to become
president.

10:36.402 --> 10:39.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are states like Colorado,
Wisconsin,
Michigan, Virginia?

10:39.439 --> 10:41.808 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do they have in common?

10:41.841 --> 10:45.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you just heard from Nathan,
they have all
been moving in Hillary Clinton's
direction

10:45.311 --> 10:46.546 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
strongly.

10:46.579 --> 10:50.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just Iowa remains really as a
swing state
in that group.

10:50.049 --> 10:54.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as Nathan said, Judy, he
has got problems
on home turf like Arizona,
places that are

10:54.621 --> 10:57.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
moving away from him, and North
Carolina that
he needs to keep.

10:57.590 --> 11:01.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Nathan,
confirming, those
are tough gets for Donald Trump,
aren't they?

11:01.694 --> 11:03.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NATHAN GONZALES: It is.

11:03.563 --> 11:05.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's important to
remember that
this was going to be tough for
any Republican

11:06.032 --> 11:07.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nominee, Marco Rubio or John
Kasich.

11:07.867 --> 11:12.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were four tossups coming
into the election,
Ohio, Florida, Colorado, and
Virginia.

11:12.906 --> 11:16.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And once we saw Colorado and
Virginia moving
toward Hillary Clinton, that
means that it

11:16.676 --> 11:19.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had to be Pennsylvania or
another a big state.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it's just not coming
together.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, Lisa, you
have looked
at the polls and you have looked
at why it

11:23.850 --> 11:27.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that Hillary Clinton has
moved up, and
I think it's interesting, these
results.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was wondering, what is going
on?

11:29.489 --> 11:31.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of people might think, oh,
well, women
are shifting.

11:31.324 --> 11:34.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No, when you look at the polls
in these key
states that are moving the most,
it's actually

11:34.427 --> 11:36.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
men who are changing.

11:36.229 --> 11:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you look at polls out of
Nevada, for
example, Monmouth polls this
month vs. last

11:40.366 --> 11:45.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
month show that men under 50
years old, they're
voting 53 percent for Hillary
Clinton right

11:45.972 --> 11:49.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
now, but a month ago, 29
percent.

11:49.208 --> 11:52.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's an unbelievable shift of
24 points
in a month.

11:52.879 --> 11:55.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you see this in other states
and nationally.

11:55.548 --> 11:58.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it seems men are moving away
from Donald
Trump right now.

11:58.151 --> 12:01.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's just there
are stories
all over the map.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, Nathan, let's talk about
the Senate seats.

12:03.923 --> 12:07.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Right now, it is very much in
Republican hands.

12:07.226 --> 12:12.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Republicans seemed to be
holding on to
that majority up until recently,
but now with

12:12.231 --> 12:14.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this shift at the presidential
level, what's
happening?

12:14.701 --> 12:16.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NATHAN GONZALES: Sure.

12:16.369 --> 12:19.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans -- well, Democrats
need to gain
four seats in order to get to
50.

12:19.839 --> 12:21.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Vice President Tim Kaine would
be the tie-breaker.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, four is the magic number.

12:23.109 --> 12:28.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, for most of the
cycle, Republican
candidates were remarkably
resilient, based

12:28.247 --> 12:30.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on Donald Trump being at the top
of the ticket.

12:30.383 --> 12:34.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then there was the "Access
Hollywood"
tape, the second debate, and now
we have seen

12:34.487 --> 12:36.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a steep decline in Trump's
numbers.

12:36.856 --> 12:42.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the presidential race has
always had an
impact on Senate races, but, as
his hole gets

12:42.061 --> 12:46.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deeper, that increases the
number of ticket-splitters
that these Republicans need in
order to survive.

12:46.633 --> 12:52.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lisa, talk
about how then
exactly the Democrats' chances
look for taking

12:53.006 --> 12:54.073 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
over the Senate.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yet again,
let's go to the
map.

12:55.541 --> 12:56.943 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I love it.

12:56.976 --> 12:59.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a case where again
Republicans walked
in with a disadvantage.

12:59.812 --> 13:03.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is why, because, if you
look at all
the seats that are tossups this
year, depending

13:03.750 --> 13:07.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on how you count them, maybe
about eight of
them we will put on this map,
the vast majority

13:07.553 --> 13:09.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of them are red, they are held
by Republicans.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is one, Nevada, that
Democrats are defending.

13:12.392 --> 13:17.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, if you take these seats, it
seems the
most vulnerable for Republicans
are two, Wisconsin

13:17.497 --> 13:18.464 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Illinois.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So let's imagine that they do go
Democratic.

13:20.867 --> 13:24.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's two of the four that
Nathan says that
Democrats need.

13:24.437 --> 13:29.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then we have got six these
remaining swing
states that, of those, Democrats
need to win

13:29.409 --> 13:31.110 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
three.

13:31.144 --> 13:34.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, is that maybe a win in
Pennsylvania and
New Hampshire, where Kelly
Ayotte, who was

13:34.681 --> 13:37.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doing well and now is having a
problem?

13:37.183 --> 13:42.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Same thing in Pennsylvania,
where we see the
incumbent Senator Toomey is also
having a

13:42.288 --> 13:43.256 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
problem.

13:43.289 --> 13:45.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were outperforming Trump a
month ago.

13:45.591 --> 13:47.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now they're on the ropes.

13:47.293 --> 13:51.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Democrats need to just pick
up three of
this group of six swing Senate
seats.

13:51.864 --> 13:54.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's getting more and more
within their
reach.

13:54.400 --> 13:58.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Nathan, if
things look
a little better for the
Democrats in the Senate,

13:58.971 --> 13:59.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what about the House?

13:59.972 --> 14:01.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's been a reach.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What does it look like now?

14:02.508 --> 14:04.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NATHAN GONZALES: Democrats have
always had
a tough reach in the House.

14:04.310 --> 14:06.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They need 30 seats to gain 30
seats.

14:06.412 --> 14:13.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, 30 out of 435 doesn't sound
like very
many, but 30, when only about 40
are competitive,

14:13.086 --> 14:14.053 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is tough.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They basically have to run the
table.

14:15.855 --> 14:21.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, so far, we haven't seen a
uniform drop
in Republican candidate support
across the

14:21.928 --> 14:23.629 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

14:23.663 --> 14:28.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are vulnerable districts
out there,
but I think the margin is
probably closer

14:28.167 --> 14:33.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to 10, 15 seats, 20 seats,
rather than 30,
because Trump is getting
destroyed in the

14:33.406 --> 14:35.041 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
suburbs.

14:35.074 --> 14:38.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is causing some suburban
Republican incumbents
to be vulnerable in the suburbs.

14:38.511 --> 14:43.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Trump is actually going well
in a place
like rural Michigan, Michigan's
1st District,

14:43.082 --> 14:48.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a seat Democrats have to win,
but Trump's
performance is actually helping
Republicans

14:48.321 --> 14:50.089 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
keep that seat.

14:50.123 --> 14:53.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Republicans
losing some
seats, but not anywhere near
enough to lose

14:53.359 --> 14:54.861 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the majority?

14:54.894 --> 14:56.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NATHAN GONZALES: Right now, it
doesn't look
like the majority is in danger.

14:57.029 --> 15:01.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But two weeks can be a lot of
time, and these
House races are the latest ones
to develop.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Two-and-a-half
weeks to go.

15:03.603 --> 15:08.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Nathan Gonzales, Lisa
Desjardins, thank you.

NATHAN GONZALES: Thank you.

15:12.912 --> 15:21.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next: A judge
ruled today that
a Maryland man accused of
stealing massive

15:21.354 --> 15:27.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amounts of information from the
National Security
Agency was a flight risk and
will remain in

15:27.293 --> 15:29.028 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
federal custody.

15:29.061 --> 15:30.830 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the story.

15:30.863 --> 15:34.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This past
August, Harold
Martin III was arrested at his
home in the

15:34.767 --> 15:36.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maryland suburbs of Washington,
D.C.

15:36.936 --> 15:42.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In his house, investigators
discovered the
equivalent of half-a-billion
pages of documents

15:42.175 --> 15:47.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and electronic data, some
allegedly taken
from the NSA's headquarters at
nearby Fort

15:47.180 --> 15:49.048 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Meade.

15:49.081 --> 15:53.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among the documents were ones
marked top-secret
and also tools used by the NSA
to hack into

15:53.553 --> 15:56.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the computer networks of foreign
governments.

15:56.088 --> 16:00.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining me now for more on this
case is Matt
Apuzzo, who's been covering this
story for

16:00.059 --> 16:01.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The New York Times.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Matt Apuzzo, welcome.

16:03.563 --> 16:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wonder if you would just start
off by laying
out the case against this
gentleman, and what

16:07.433 --> 16:09.268 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is his defense?

16:09.302 --> 16:12.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT APUZZO, The New York Times:
Well, I mean,
what is fascinating is there is
the case that's

16:12.638 --> 16:14.340 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been brought.

16:14.373 --> 16:20.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the case that's been
brought, as you said,
is, hey, this guy had terabytes,
billions

16:20.079 --> 16:25.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of pages of documents in his
house, in his
shed, in the back seat of his
car, in the

16:25.418 --> 16:29.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
trunk of his car, and,
obviously, you're not
supposed to do that.

16:29.355 --> 16:31.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, there is that case.

16:31.257 --> 16:34.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then there is this other
case that's kind
of looming over all this, and
the question

16:34.727 --> 16:45.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, is he the guy who, not too
long ago, facilitated
the release of NSA documents,
basically for

16:45.371 --> 16:47.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ransom, put them up for sale
online?

16:47.907 --> 16:51.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These were hacking tools, the
way the government,
the United States government,
hacks into other

16:51.811 --> 16:53.813 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
countries and businesses and
whatnot?

16:53.846 --> 16:58.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that's really what's
going on here,
is, there's, OK, he mishandled
classified

16:59.018 --> 16:59.986 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
information.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He has basically admitted that.

17:01.787 --> 17:04.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But is he the guy, is he part of
some network
that's putting information up
for sale?

17:05.024 --> 17:08.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, this
originally came
about, as you're indicating,
there was this

17:08.227 --> 17:11.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
group called the Shadow Brokers
who were auctioning
off this software.

17:11.664 --> 17:13.599 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT APUZZO: Right.

17:13.633 --> 17:16.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And is it
correct that investigators
who were looking into that
release and that

17:16.903 --> 17:19.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
case, that's how they discovered
Martin?

17:19.405 --> 17:21.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT APUZZO: Yes.

17:21.173 --> 17:26.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we're told here is that
Martin sort of
popped up on their radar screen
during the

17:26.479 --> 17:31.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
early parts of the investigation
into the
Shadow Brokers' release, and
using some clever

17:31.751 --> 17:37.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
forensics and sort of
old-fashioned investigative
skills, were able to identify
Martin.

17:37.757 --> 17:41.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then when they raided his
house, I think
they were stunned to find as
much stuff as

17:41.727 --> 17:42.895 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they found.

17:42.929 --> 17:44.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're talking about 20 years of
classified
information.

17:44.730 --> 17:48.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's basically a catalogue of
how the NSA
has stored data over the past
two decades.

17:48.968 --> 17:50.002 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He has got stuff in paper.

17:50.036 --> 17:51.304 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He has got stuff on C.D.s.

17:51.337 --> 17:52.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has got stuff on thumb
drives.

17:52.338 --> 17:55.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He has got stuff.

17:55.341 --> 17:57.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It just tells a story, and it's
a little archive
of the NSA.

17:57.977 --> 18:00.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And what is
Martin's defense
for all this?

18:00.446 --> 18:01.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What does he say?

18:01.580 --> 18:05.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT APUZZO: Well, we haven't
heard a full
defense.

18:05.384 --> 18:10.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our understanding of what he's
told the FBI
is he acknowledges that he took
the stuff

18:10.489 --> 18:16.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and he wasn't supposed to take
it, but there
seems to be a little bit of,
well, I was taking

18:16.162 --> 18:23.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this stuff home to study it to
become better
at my job, to become a better
patriot, to

18:23.102 --> 18:25.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be a better NSA contractor.

18:25.671 --> 18:31.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unlike somebody like Edward
Snowden, who had,
you know, a privacy, a
libertarian bent, what

18:31.210 --> 18:35.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're hearing about Harold
Martin is that
he was very rah-rah for the NSA
and for the

18:35.781 --> 18:39.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government's programs and
believed that he
was a patriot.

18:39.652 --> 18:44.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, has the
government indicated
at all what they think his
motive might be

18:44.490 --> 18:45.658 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for this?

18:45.691 --> 18:47.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why would he have these tools in
his house?

18:47.126 --> 18:49.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATT APUZZO: No, it's a great
question.

18:49.128 --> 18:52.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And more so than why did he have
these tools
in the house, if he's been doing
it 20 years,

18:52.765 --> 18:57.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why would he start now, like --
and why would
he start with documents?

18:57.636 --> 18:59.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are questions that are at
the heart
of the case.

18:59.605 --> 19:05.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think if the government
knew that in
a really big way, we would have
seen it in

19:05.111 --> 19:06.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the court documents.

19:06.078 --> 19:08.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We might have seen it in court.

19:08.214 --> 19:11.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what you're hearing now
is, I think,
a lot of federal investigators
scratching

19:11.617 --> 19:15.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their head and saying, we know
we have got
a big case here and we know
there's a lot

19:15.454 --> 19:17.223 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of smoke, but can we prove it?

19:17.256 --> 19:21.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can we prove that -- can we link
him to these
leaked documents, can we link
him to some

19:21.527 --> 19:23.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
other -- to a foreign
intelligence service?

19:23.562 --> 19:26.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so far, that hasn't
materialized in a
provable way.

19:26.866 --> 19:30.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: More broadly,
can we just
talk a little bit about how
damaging this

19:30.369 --> 19:32.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
might be for the NSA?

19:32.304 --> 19:37.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the second instance
where an NSA contractor
has walked out the door with
truckloads of

19:37.309 --> 19:39.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
incredibly valuable data.

19:39.145 --> 19:41.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is the impact on the NSA
from this kind
of a thing?

19:41.714 --> 19:43.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT APUZZO: Sure.

19:43.349 --> 19:46.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think one of the things, the
damage assessment,
the risk assessment is going on.

19:46.752 --> 19:52.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the questions they
are going to
have to face is, if they can't
figure out

19:52.191 --> 19:57.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if any of the data has been
compromised, do
they have to assume that it's
all been compromised?

19:57.530 --> 20:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And does that mean you have to
start shutting
down programs or whatnot?

20:00.499 --> 20:05.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But from a practical standpoint,
yes, it really
just does boggle the mind that
you can, for

20:05.337 --> 20:12.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
20 years, just walk out of the
building with
papers and thumb drives and
C.D.s and whatnot.

20:12.778 --> 20:15.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It certainly does make you
wonder how that
happens.

20:16.015 --> 20:19.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you can bet that that's
going to be something
that they are going to be
looking awful hard

20:19.218 --> 20:20.953 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at.

20:20.986 --> 20:24.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And after Edward Snowden, too,
that we're
still having this discussion, it
kind of does

20:24.223 --> 20:25.191 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
boggle the mind.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right.

20:26.625 --> 20:28.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a case we will obviously
keep watching
as it goes forward.

20:28.394 --> 20:31.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Matt Apuzzo of The New York
Times, thanks
so much.

20:31.630 --> 20:43.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATT APUZZO: Thanks for having
me.

20:43.142 --> 20:47.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

20:47.913 --> 20:53.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
growing burden
of student debt; and a new,
younger sound

20:53.285 --> 20:56.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the radio variety show "A
Prairie Home
Companion."

20:56.589 --> 21:02.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, for the second time
this week,
we get the analysis of Shields
and Brooks.

21:02.962 --> 21:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields,
and New York Times columnist
David Brooks,

21:07.700 --> 21:10.302 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who's joining us tonight from
Houston.

21:10.336 --> 21:11.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's so exciting.

21:11.337 --> 21:12.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We get to see you twice this
week.

21:12.404 --> 21:14.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Right.

21:14.306 --> 21:16.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The first time,
Mark, of course
was after Wednesday night's
debate, the final

21:16.675 --> 21:18.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
debate between these
presidential candidates.

21:18.978 --> 21:21.280 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What has changed since then?

21:21.313 --> 21:26.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think the third
debate, Judy,
I think there was an awareness
Donald Trump

21:26.318 --> 21:28.187 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is not an unintelligent man.

21:28.220 --> 21:34.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he understood, I think, two
things after
the debates, A, that Hillary
Clinton had beaten

21:34.894 --> 21:36.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
him in three debates.

21:36.462 --> 21:37.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She was better prepared.

21:37.830 --> 21:40.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She outflanked him tactically.

21:40.466 --> 21:45.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She got him to go for the bait
on things like
choked when meeting with the
president of

21:45.271 --> 21:47.006 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Mexico.

21:47.039 --> 21:50.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And also there has to be the
understanding
that this was -- because he was
trailing,

21:50.709 --> 21:55.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been trailing in the polls,
this was the
last great chance where two
campaigns collide,

21:55.381 --> 22:00.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're on the same stage, he
could challenge,
change the terms of the debate.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.921 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He didn't.

22:01.954 --> 22:09.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he, I think, almost as a
consolation,
has tried to divert the debate
that he's losing

22:09.929 --> 22:15.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a discussion, I mean, a
reckless and dangerous
discussion, about the legitimacy
of the American

22:15.935 --> 22:19.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
elections, something that's
never been challenged
before by any major party
candidate.

22:19.705 --> 22:21.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Where do you see
things right
now, David?

22:21.807 --> 22:24.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I do think
there is an
acceptance, I don't know if in
Donald Trump's

22:24.944 --> 22:28.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
brain, but certainly in the
Republican Party,
about the fact that he's going
to lose, or

22:28.347 --> 22:29.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the likelihood that he's going
to lose.

22:29.648 --> 22:32.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the question becomes, how do
people react
to that?

22:32.484 --> 22:35.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two weeks ago, I was in Idaho,
and I ran into
a guy who said, well, obviously
Trump is going

22:35.654 --> 22:38.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to win because everybody I know
is voting
for him.

22:38.390 --> 22:41.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I tried to persuade -- argue
with this
guy, well, if you look at the
polls, he is

22:41.227 --> 22:42.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
actually not leading.

22:42.228 --> 22:43.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this guy just wouldn't
accept that.

22:43.729 --> 22:45.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That was not part of his lived
reality.

22:45.864 --> 22:49.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you got the sense a guy like
that, if
Trump does lose, will be very
angry and disbelieving

22:49.535 --> 22:52.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and may be sensitive to the idea
that the
election was rigged.

22:52.972 --> 22:55.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Yesterday, I was in Mississippi.

22:55.074 --> 22:57.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there, there was a quietude,
a passivity.

22:57.843 --> 23:01.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know all the stages of
grief, but
acceptance is one of them.

23:01.146 --> 23:04.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And there was a level of
acceptance in a lot
of the folks I spoke to there.

23:04.416 --> 23:09.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I suspect that the latter group
is the larger
part and that, even if he does
protest the

23:09.054 --> 23:15.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
election in some way, there will
be some acceptance
that he lost fair and square.

23:15.194 --> 23:19.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark, how much
fallout is there
over Trump's unwillingness to
say that he

23:19.898 --> 23:24.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will accept the results of the
election, whatever
they are?

23:24.036 --> 23:27.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I think,
first of all,
Judy, it puts other Republican
candidates

23:27.339 --> 23:29.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a terrible position.

23:29.275 --> 23:37.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you have noticed the
parade, the cavalcade
of Republicans attesting to
their belief in

23:37.283 --> 23:43.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the ballot box, the belief in
legitimacy and
validity of American elections.

23:43.222 --> 23:44.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans are on the ballot on
November
8.

23:44.957 --> 23:48.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're going to win or lose by
100 votes
or 200 votes in some cases.

23:48.761 --> 23:52.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do they want the legitimacy of
that election
tested?

23:52.364 --> 23:57.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think, in that sense --
but just enlarging
upon what David -- the point
David made, it's

23:57.136 --> 24:00.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not restricted to the Trump
people who don't
believe.

24:00.105 --> 24:04.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are Democrats who don't
believe that
-- there is a cleavage and a
divide in this

24:04.143 --> 24:06.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country like I have never seen
before.

24:06.378 --> 24:11.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're on the other side from
me, you're
not simply wrong or ill-informed
or mistaken.

24:11.750 --> 24:14.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't share the same country,
the same
values.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You may not be the same kind of
an American
I am.

24:16.922 --> 24:20.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's really dangerous
and it's an
enormous challenge for the next
president.

24:20.926 --> 24:26.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, David, you're
seeing that
out there on the trail, if you
will, where

24:26.665 --> 24:28.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you have been traveling around
the country.

24:28.667 --> 24:34.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to ask you, though, about
Trump's continued,
I don't know -- how do you
describe the state

24:34.273 --> 24:35.507 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
he's in?

24:35.541 --> 24:37.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He goes to the Al Smith Dinner
in New York
City last night.

24:37.676 --> 24:42.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This gets a lot of coverage
today, where he
-- instead of doing the sort of
self-deprecating

24:42.681 --> 24:48.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
jokes that people traditionally
do, he really
continues to go hard after
Hillary Clinton.

24:48.754 --> 24:51.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does it matter at this point
that he's still
angry?

24:51.390 --> 24:54.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, angry is
what he does.

24:54.560 --> 24:59.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have to say, I read all the
coverage, expecting
to be appalled by his speech and
cheered by

24:59.431 --> 25:00.399 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Clinton's.

25:00.432 --> 25:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I thought they were both pretty
bad.

25:01.467 --> 25:03.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I thought they were both a
little too harsh.

25:03.602 --> 25:06.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His was worse, but hers wasn't
funny or particularly
well-delivered.

25:06.305 --> 25:11.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's going to be a dreary
couple of years
of comedy acts, no matter who is
elected.

25:11.377 --> 25:16.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think that his attacks, the
line that
she hates Catholics, is just
tone-deaf and

25:16.849 --> 25:22.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's just inner bitterness that
is coming
to the surface in unattractive
ways.

25:22.054 --> 25:25.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I do think, starting with
the -- not only
starting, but continuing with
the claim that

25:25.624 --> 25:31.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
he won't accept the --
automatically the results
of the election does
fundamentally undermine

25:31.230 --> 25:33.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the etiquette we have built up
in our society.

25:33.265 --> 25:38.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our system is not only based on
rules, but
a series of self-restraints that
we won't

25:38.103 --> 25:42.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be as barbaric as we could be in
competing
for power because we know if
we're all barbaric

25:42.741 --> 25:45.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as we could be, the whole
country and the
whole society falls apart.

25:45.811 --> 25:49.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And my critique with
conservatives who say,
well, I really hate the guy, but
I need to

25:49.715 --> 25:53.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vote for him because of the
Supreme Court,
the problem is that the moral
foundation of

25:53.652 --> 25:57.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the society, the way we interact
with each
other is more fundamental than
the Supreme

25:57.222 --> 25:59.158 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Court.

25:59.191 --> 26:03.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if that gets polluted and
that gets destroyed
by somebody who's just
brutalistic and savage,

26:03.562 --> 26:06.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then it doesn't matter who's on
the Supreme
Court because we have lost our
country.

26:06.632 --> 26:10.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think their argument
that the Supreme
Court is worth it is basically
the wrong argument

26:11.003 --> 26:12.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
when he's behaving this way.

26:12.371 --> 26:14.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Pick up on that,
Mark.

26:14.106 --> 26:15.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Sure.

26:15.507 --> 26:18.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No, the Al Smith Dinner, first
of all, it's
a marvelous occasion.

26:18.710 --> 26:21.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's really where people,
candidates do come.

26:21.146 --> 26:23.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, Judy, you have covered
enough campaigns.

26:23.682 --> 26:27.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the first things every
press secretary
assures you is, the boss has a
wonderful sense

26:27.219 --> 26:33.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of humor, because not to have a
sense of humor
is considered flagrantly
un-American.

26:33.158 --> 26:40.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I remember George W. Bush at
that dinner
in 2000 standing up and saying,
look at this

26:40.232 --> 26:46.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
audience, designer dresses and
white tie and
tails, the haves and the
have-mores.

26:46.572 --> 26:47.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Some people call you the elite.

26:47.773 --> 26:49.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I call you my base.

26:49.475 --> 26:52.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he was laughing at himself
that he was
the candidate of the well-off or
whatever

26:53.011 --> 26:53.979 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
else.

26:54.012 --> 26:57.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think Trump just missed
this completely.

26:57.716 --> 27:04.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I agree with David that
there was too
much of an edge even in
Clinton's remarks.

27:04.890 --> 27:12.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Trump just missed the whole
thing, and
it was -- it's a tone-deafness
that's -- it's

27:12.397 --> 27:14.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unsettling.

27:14.199 --> 27:18.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's talk
a little bit,
Mark and David, about what
Hillary Clinton

27:18.303 --> 27:20.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is saying out on the trail.

27:20.172 --> 27:25.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She isn't hitting as many
campaign stops as
he is, but, David, we see today
she is talking

27:25.511 --> 27:29.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to voters about -- she is saying
things like,
think about the future of the
country.

27:29.748 --> 27:34.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What sort of future do you want,
what sort
of country do you want?

27:34.553 --> 27:36.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She said at one point, you live
your life.

27:36.121 --> 27:38.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I will do the worrying.

27:38.056 --> 27:40.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does it sound like she's already
winding this
thing down?

27:40.425 --> 27:45.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, there is a
lot of let's
go for the landslide talk out of
the Democratic

27:45.297 --> 27:49.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Party, which a normal -- the
normal rules
of campaigning, that's a no-no.

27:49.968 --> 27:51.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You want your people to come
out.

27:51.270 --> 27:53.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You don't want them to think,
oh, we got this
one in the bag.

27:53.372 --> 27:58.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they may be trying to run
up the score
just to renounce the whole idea
of the Trump

27:58.977 --> 27:59.945 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
idea.

27:59.978 --> 28:00.946 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I get that.

28:00.979 --> 28:02.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But it's come out in the
WikiLeaks.

28:02.848 --> 28:03.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's been evident.

28:04.016 --> 28:06.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Mark and I have been talking
about it
at each debate.

28:06.184 --> 28:10.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not clear to people outside
the campaign
and even, as we learned from
WikiLeaks, inside

28:10.889 --> 28:13.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the campaign, what the core
passion is.

28:13.091 --> 28:16.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are -- the core, animating
thing that
she would go to the mat for?

28:16.695 --> 28:18.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I still think that's true.

28:18.730 --> 28:23.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in her rallies this week,
it's still evident
that she doesn't have a core
rally, except

28:23.402 --> 28:27.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for denying Donald Trump -- a
core passion,
except denying Donald Trump the
presidency.

28:27.139 --> 28:30.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I hope she finishes with
something, because,
in the likelihood that she wins,
something

28:30.742 --> 28:37.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to coast off of to sort of give
herself a
sense of priorities for the next
few months

28:37.583 --> 28:39.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and then the first 100 days.

28:39.484 --> 28:42.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You know, Mark,
that's a critique
that you and David have been
making for some

28:42.254 --> 28:43.221 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

28:43.255 --> 28:44.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Repetitively.

28:44.222 --> 28:45.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Competitively.

28:45.324 --> 28:46.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have been making it
repetitively, competitively.

28:46.224 --> 28:47.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I have anyway.

28:47.225 --> 28:48.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
David makes it freshly.

28:48.226 --> 28:49.995 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:50.028 --> 28:52.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But some version
of it, you
both have been critical of her
for not having

28:52.931 --> 28:55.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a theme to her campaign.

28:55.233 --> 28:58.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you just at this point assume
we're not
going to hear it, or...

28:58.604 --> 29:00.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, I don't think
it's there.

29:00.472 --> 29:07.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think the lift of a
driving dream
or whatever, the Obama lift, the
Reagan lift,

29:07.279 --> 29:08.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just don't -- I don't think
it's there.

29:09.014 --> 29:11.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stronger together
doesn't...

29:11.116 --> 29:17.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Stronger together
is, I think,
a preposition and a comparative
adjective,

29:17.823 --> 29:21.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but it's not really an action
verb or what
it is.

29:21.793 --> 29:26.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think it makes sense for
the Democrats
to -- that Trump has done a
favor for them

29:26.999 --> 29:32.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as far as turnout, because there
isn't that
kind of enthusiasm and passion
for her candidacy.

29:32.671 --> 29:38.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And by his question of
legitimacy, the idea
that your vote does count, that
it does matter,

29:38.410 --> 29:42.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because, if it's close, he's
going to raise
questions about it.

29:42.080 --> 29:47.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think, in a strange way,
he's become
the turnout agent for Democratic
voting on

29:47.452 --> 29:53.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
November 8 by his questioning of
the legitimacy
and saying he's going to
challenge whether

29:53.859 --> 29:55.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- the constitutionality of the
vote.

29:55.861 --> 29:57.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I think, in that sense, it
works.

29:57.529 --> 30:02.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I don't think we're going to
get that
-- not going to take us to the
top of the

30:02.534 --> 30:03.502 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mountain.

30:03.535 --> 30:04.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, is he doing
her that favor?

30:04.536 --> 30:05.504 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

30:05.537 --> 30:06.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Go ahead.

30:06.538 --> 30:08.173 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Go ahead, David.

30:08.206 --> 30:08.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I would say I
ran into
a guy in Louisiana, in New
Orleans, because

30:09.007 --> 30:11.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm going to the fun places,
too.

30:11.243 --> 30:15.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said he was going to vote
for neither
of the candidates, just because
he was so

30:15.981 --> 30:19.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
appalled, until that Trump
reference to not
respecting the election results.

30:19.918 --> 30:24.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then he decided to go for
Clinton, because
he said, listen, this guy's got
to lose badly.

30:24.489 --> 30:26.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have got to at least defend
that principle.

30:26.725 --> 30:30.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I do think that what he
said sort of
over -- did overshadow
everything he said

30:30.328 --> 30:33.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the debate and will drive up
some of Clinton's
margins potentially.

30:33.865 --> 30:38.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There is so much
talk in this
country about how divided the
country is still

30:38.770 --> 30:42.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to be, Mark, after this
election.

30:42.507 --> 30:46.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Is there anything these
candidates can do,
either the candidates at the top
of the ticket,

30:46.845 --> 30:52.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Paul Ryan, or any of the other
candidates
can do to begin to address that,
or do you

30:52.684 --> 30:55.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just wait until the election is
over and hope
it works out?

30:55.320 --> 31:00.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: You hope that
there will be
a sense of resolution.

31:00.592 --> 31:07.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Democrats ought to be
concerned, Judy,
that the party, in this
election, has become

31:07.432 --> 31:12.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
almost prideful about the
college-educated
vote that it's getting, the
support that Hillary

31:12.571 --> 31:15.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Clinton is getting against
Donald Trump.

31:15.440 --> 31:24.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, understandably, white
working-class voters
or working-class voters have
felt abandoned,

31:24.216 --> 31:29.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have felt, in many senses,
disparaged by the
political leadership of the
country.

31:29.387 --> 31:33.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have been the core
historically of
the Democratic Party, whether
it's Norma Rae

31:33.258 --> 31:39.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or Joe Hill or the great stories
of fighting
for the underdog.

31:39.097 --> 31:44.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the Democrats, I
would hope that
Hillary Clinton and the
Democratic leadership

31:44.569 --> 31:49.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wouldn't be quite as smug about
saying, oh,
we have got the
college-educated, aren't we

31:49.875 --> 31:55.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something, and understand that
the anger and
the sense of outrage and hurt
that these people

31:55.881 --> 31:59.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are feeling, many of whom are
supporting Donald
Trump, is legitimate and real.

31:59.851 --> 32:05.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they feel abandoned by the
Democratic
Party, by Washington and
certainly hurt by

32:05.490 --> 32:07.425 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Wall Street.

32:07.459 --> 32:10.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, David, no
matter what the
outcome, the Democrats are due
for some soul-searching,

32:10.996 --> 32:12.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
along with the Republicans?

32:12.464 --> 32:14.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, everybody.

32:14.299 --> 32:19.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I certainly hear a lot
of people say
that Trump not only incited some
bad things.

32:19.037 --> 32:20.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He also exposed some things.

32:20.772 --> 32:24.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He exposed pain in the country
that a lot
of us didn't have the full
extent of, some

32:24.409 --> 32:26.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the divisions and chasms in
the country.

32:26.845 --> 32:31.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that's been an education
which Donald
Trump has given us, to his
credit.

32:31.850 --> 32:34.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, secondly -- and maybe it's
just what
people say to me, but I hear a
lot of desire

32:34.753 --> 32:40.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a snap-back, that we have
had so much
vulgarity, so much throwing away
of any standards

32:40.592 --> 32:44.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of decency, that there has been
a lot of people
coming forward and say, no,
let's -- on matters

32:44.830 --> 32:50.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of how we talk to each other, on
matters how
we respect each other and relate
to each other,

32:50.135 --> 32:53.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
let's not only stop doing this,
let's snap
back and address the problems
that we have

32:53.972 --> 32:56.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all been suffering under during
this election
campaign.

32:56.441 --> 32:58.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wouldn't that be
a welcome
thing?

32:58.243 --> 33:02.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, David, the
coarsening
of the culture didn't begin with
Donald Trump.

33:02.214 --> 33:06.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's accelerated it, but it did
not -- we
have coarsened our country over
the last generation.

33:06.918 --> 33:16.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields,
David Brooks,
thank you both.

33:16.962 --> 33:25.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields,
David Brooks,
thank you both.

33:25.971 --> 33:30.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Student debt has been a big
talking point
on the 2016 campaign trail.

33:30.542 --> 33:35.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton proposes making
tuition free
for many students at public
colleges.

33:35.647 --> 33:40.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump would expand limits
on how much
borrowers have to pay back each
month.

33:40.518 --> 33:43.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But what about those already
holding debt?

33:43.388 --> 33:48.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We take a look as part of our
series How the
Deck Is Stacked, funded by the
Corporation

33:48.260 --> 33:52.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for Public Broadcasting, in
partnership with
"Frontline" and Marketplace.

33:52.731 --> 33:56.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Marketplace's Lizzie O'Leary has
the first
of two stories.

33:56.701 --> 34:00.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIZZIE O'LEARY, Marketplace: If
everything
had gone according to plan,
Chris Savelle

34:00.672 --> 34:05.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would be on Wall Street right
now, not biking
through downtown Detroit in a
free weekly

34:05.277 --> 34:06.611 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
community ride.

34:06.645 --> 34:11.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Savelle, who is 31, graduated
into the teeth
of the recession.

34:11.349 --> 34:15.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's got $100,000 in student
loan debt on
his mind.

34:15.320 --> 34:17.122 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What does $100,000 feel like?

34:17.155 --> 34:20.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRIS SAVELLE, Owes Student
Debt: It sucks.

34:20.292 --> 34:23.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: Jessica Love
Jordan is in
a similar situation.

34:23.662 --> 34:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She started college late and is
now working
on finishing her master's in
addiction counseling.

34:28.934 --> 34:31.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She juggles school, work and
being a single
parent.

34:32.003 --> 34:33.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sometimes, the debt feels too
much.

34:33.872 --> 34:36.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSICA LOVE JORDAN, Owes
Student Debt: Now
and again, when I look at the
statement, and

34:36.074 --> 34:38.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see how much I actually have to
pay back,
it's almost suffocating.

34:38.643 --> 34:44.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have those fleeing thoughts,
you know what,
let me just stop now, and go
work, so I can

34:44.082 --> 34:46.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be able to live later on in
life.

34:46.151 --> 34:51.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: When she
graduates, she can
expect to make about $33,000
annually as an

34:51.456 --> 34:52.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
addiction counselor.

34:52.457 --> 34:55.393 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Her debt will be about $90,000.

34:55.427 --> 35:00.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The median student debt is much
lower than
Savelle or Love Jordan's, about
$27,000.

35:00.699 --> 35:05.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But their experiences are
similar to those
of many students who attended
state universities

35:05.971 --> 35:10.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at a time when their budgets
were being cut,
and as the great recession hit.

35:10.241 --> 35:15.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The money for school had to come
from somewhere,
in most cases, students.

35:15.380 --> 35:17.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where did you think you would be
in your life
at 31?

35:17.949 --> 35:24.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS SAVELLE: Go work for an
investment firm
or hedge fund, Chicago, New
York, something

35:24.556 --> 35:26.291 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like that.

35:26.324 --> 35:30.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: But when Savelle
graduated
in 2008, the best job he could
find was at

35:30.195 --> 35:31.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a local Wal-Mart.

35:31.629 --> 35:33.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's recovered somewhat now.

35:33.131 --> 35:37.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He works as a supply chain
engineer, and supports
his mother and sister.

35:37.335 --> 35:41.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Temple University Professor Sara
Goldrick-Rab
has been researching the rising
price of college

35:41.640 --> 35:43.375 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for years.

35:43.408 --> 35:48.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How has the aid picture changed
as median
incomes have stagnated, really,
for the last

35:48.847 --> 35:50.615 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
20 years?

35:50.648 --> 35:52.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARA GOLDRICK-RAB, Temple
University: The
sticker price on a per student
basis has gone

35:52.384 --> 35:57.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up a lot, while the amount of
financial aid
on a per student basis has gone
down.

35:58.023 --> 36:03.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the result is that the net
price, the
amount that the families
actually pay out

36:03.094 --> 36:06.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of their pocket, is rising, and
it's rising
fairly rapidly.

36:06.531 --> 36:09.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: More than 40
million Americans
have student loan debt.

36:09.768 --> 36:13.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The total amount is around $1.3
trillion.

36:13.738 --> 36:18.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even so, there are experts like
Sandy Baum,
who studies student debt at the
Urban Institute,

36:18.476 --> 36:20.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and says only certain people are
being hurt.

36:20.712 --> 36:25.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SANDY BAUM, Urban Institute:
Student debt
is a crisis for some people, but
student debt

36:25.183 --> 36:32.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is not the generalized crisis
that the common
discourse would make it appear.

36:32.057 --> 36:36.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, people are paying more of
their incomes
for a college education, but
still it's worth

36:36.995 --> 36:38.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it for most people.

36:38.530 --> 36:41.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's still a very good
investment for most
people, but not for everyone.

36:41.666 --> 36:46.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: Sara
Goldrick-Rab says far
too many people are being
saddled with substantial

36:46.704 --> 36:47.705 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
debt.

36:47.739 --> 36:50.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You wrote that debt is a
symptom, not the
disease.

36:50.875 --> 36:53.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It sounds like you think the
disease is the
high price.

36:53.978 --> 36:55.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SARA GOLDRICK-RAB: The disease
is the price.

36:55.780 --> 36:59.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have a problem, where
people are being
priced out of college, and in
their effort

36:59.751 --> 37:04.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to not be priced out, they're
taking on debt
that, frankly, they're going to
have real

37:04.055 --> 37:05.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
trouble repaying.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: People like
Jordan Hoeft.

37:07.559 --> 37:10.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's been trying to get a more
manageable
payment plan.

37:10.528 --> 37:13.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He studied film, but couldn't
get a job in
the industry.

37:13.198 --> 37:20.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He now owes $100,000 in private
student loans,
but was paying interest only
until recently.

37:20.038 --> 37:23.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He lives at home in the Chicago
suburbs with
his parents.

37:23.942 --> 37:27.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They already were tapped out
after helping
his siblings with loans.

37:27.078 --> 37:30.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So Jordan's parents asked his
grandparents
to co-sign.

37:30.081 --> 37:32.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when his debt piled up, the
loan servicer
came calling.

37:32.884 --> 37:39.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MELODI HOEFT, Mother of Jordan
Hoeft: My father
co-signed for some of the kids'
loans after

37:39.090 --> 37:43.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Patrick and I were tapped out on
signing,
co-signing for them.

37:43.828 --> 37:52.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My father passed away, and
within 60 days
of my dad passing away, the
private student

37:52.370 --> 37:57.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
loan venders were calling my
mom, harassing
her, wanting her to pay the
balance in full.

37:58.009 --> 37:59.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: The whole thing?

37:59.611 --> 38:03.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MELODI HOEFT: The whole balance,
and that
he -- they were not in arrears
at all.

38:03.648 --> 38:08.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My mom called me crying, saying,
"I don't
have that money and they want me
to pay this

38:08.720 --> 38:09.687 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
loan."

38:09.721 --> 38:10.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I said, oh, no.

38:10.722 --> 38:11.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: She must have
been terrified?

38:11.723 --> 38:13.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MELODI HOEFT: She was
hysterical.

38:13.625 --> 38:17.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: Jordan Hoeft's
loans are serviced
by Navient, which spun off from
Sallie Mae,

38:17.662 --> 38:19.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and now owns its student debt
business.

38:19.397 --> 38:22.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is one of the nation's
largest student
debt servicers.

38:22.667 --> 38:25.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The company handles both private
and federal
loans.

38:25.803 --> 38:29.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hoeft's loans are private, not
federal, and
had a high interest rate.

38:29.874 --> 38:36.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JORDAN HOEFT, Owes Student Debt:
So, I told
them, almost as a joke, I said,
I can either

38:36.414 --> 38:37.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have you guys lower my payments,
so I can
make rent, and then pay you, or
I can live

38:37.682 --> 38:40.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in my truck and make the full
payments to
you every month.

38:40.685 --> 38:48.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the woman on the phone, dead
serious,
told me, "I don't want to tell
you to have

38:48.793 --> 38:51.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to live in your truck, but you
might have
to live in your truck."

38:51.095 --> 38:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: We asked Navient
about that
phone call, and they told us --
quote -- "Our

38:55.833 --> 39:00.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
representative sympathizes with
Mr. Hoeft,
and the two establish a rapport
in which she

39:00.338 --> 39:04.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dismisses his facetious comment
that he may
need to live in his car.

39:04.309 --> 39:06.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our representative didn't urge
him to live
in his car.

39:06.878 --> 39:11.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rather, she encourages him to
consider a practical
option, such as finding a
roommate to split

39:11.115 --> 39:13.318 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
expenses."

39:13.351 --> 39:16.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jordan and his mother decided to
do something
about how they were being
treated by their

39:16.421 --> 39:19.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
servicer and reached out to
their state's
top law enforcement officer.

39:19.691 --> 39:22.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA MADIGAN, Illinois Attorney
General: I
have seen an increasing number
of fraud complaints

39:22.427 --> 39:24.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from current and former higher
education students.

39:24.963 --> 39:28.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: Lisa Madigan is
the attorney
general for Illinois.

39:28.132 --> 39:32.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
After noticing a rise in
complaints against
companies involved in higher
education, Madigan

39:32.303 --> 39:35.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
filed lawsuits against several
for-profit
schools.

39:35.607 --> 39:39.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now she is leading a multistate
investigation
into Navient.

39:39.244 --> 39:41.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why did you decide to look at
Navient?

39:41.045 --> 39:44.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA MADIGAN: It was the volume
of complaints
that we received and the serious
nature of

39:44.249 --> 39:45.984 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

39:46.017 --> 39:50.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have looked at over 5,000
complaints, we
have listened to over 800 phone
calls, and

39:50.154 --> 39:55.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have been able to determine
that, time
and time again, the servicers
are not providing

39:55.260 --> 39:57.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
borrowers with their repayment
options.

39:57.662 --> 40:01.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: The majority of
student loans
are federal and originate with
the Department

40:01.466 --> 40:06.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Education, but they're
contracted out to
a handful of companies who
manage the payments.

40:06.938 --> 40:13.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a $140 billion industry
annually, and
servicers, like Navient, make
about $2 billion

40:13.378 --> 40:15.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in commission per year.

40:15.113 --> 40:17.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA MADIGAN: Most of the time,
what they
do if someone is struggling is,
they will

40:17.782 --> 40:22.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
put them into a forbearance,
which is not
necessarily going to be the best
thing for

40:22.153 --> 40:25.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that borrower in the long run,
certainly not
going to make that debt any more
manageable.

40:25.356 --> 40:27.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In fact, it will often tend to
grow that debt.

40:27.725 --> 40:30.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: There are
several ways to
reduce monthly payments.

40:30.361 --> 40:35.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Deferment or forbearance
temporarily postpones
payments, but interest may
continue to accrue

40:35.700 --> 40:37.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
while payments are on hold.

40:37.902 --> 40:42.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For federal loans, there are
several income-based
repayment options, where a
borrower pays a

40:43.007 --> 40:48.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
portion of their discretionary
income, from
10 percent down to zero if
they're unemployed.

40:48.880 --> 40:52.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Madigan thinks servicers are
pushing borrowers
into forbearance.

40:52.050 --> 40:57.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA MADIGAN: Unfortunately, the
way it ends
up working out is, it's good for
the servicer,

40:57.655 --> 41:02.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because they're incentivized
through their
compensation to get people
through the process,

41:02.660 --> 41:06.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but it is bad for the borrower,
which is ultimately
bad for that person's family and
bad for our

41:06.731 --> 41:08.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
overall economy.

41:08.599 --> 41:12.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: Navient declined
to comment
directly on Madigan's
investigation and instead

41:12.036 --> 41:17.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sent this statement: "Navient is
a leader
in enrolling eligible borrowers
into income-driven

41:17.442 --> 41:19.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
repayment programs.

41:19.310 --> 41:23.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have been strong advocates
for streamlining
the enrollment process to make
it easier for

41:23.981 --> 41:25.450 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
borrowers."

41:25.483 --> 41:28.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"PBS NewsHour" requested an
interview with
the Department of Education.

41:28.519 --> 41:30.355 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It declined.

41:30.388 --> 41:35.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The department pointed us to
this policy memo
suggesting servicers provide
better information

41:35.326 --> 41:41.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to borrowers, but any changes,
if approved,
wouldn't take effect until 2019.

41:41.933 --> 41:44.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Borrowers like Jordan Hoeft may
never see
any changes.

41:44.836 --> 41:49.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Seth Frotman of the Consumer
Finance Protection
Bureau says his agency is
tracking complaints.

41:49.841 --> 41:54.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The agency has started
monitoring many key
financial players, including
loan service

41:54.245 --> 41:55.947 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
companies.

41:55.980 --> 41:57.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SETH FROTMAN, Consumer Finance
Protection
Bureau: And there's an amazing
government

41:57.715 --> 42:03.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
audit that found that 70 percent
of federal
student loan borrowers in
default, so have

42:03.254 --> 42:07.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
defaulted on their loans, were
actually eligible
for an income-generated payment
plan as low

42:07.358 --> 42:08.459 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as zero dollars.

42:08.493 --> 42:10.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that's an abysmal
failure.

42:10.395 --> 42:15.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's a direct
implication of
student loan servicers and the
oversight over

42:15.066 --> 42:16.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
student loan servicers.

42:16.300 --> 42:18.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: The borrowers
most likely
to default?

42:18.903 --> 42:22.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those with $10,000 or less in
student loans.

42:22.173 --> 42:25.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have lower debt, but are
less likely
to have completed their degrees
and may have

42:25.943 --> 42:27.578 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lower earnings.

42:27.612 --> 42:31.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Chris Savelle's debt has
affected his little
sister's future as well.

42:31.582 --> 42:37.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it weren't for Chris' debt,
do you think
Katie would be in a four-year
school now?

42:37.688 --> 42:39.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAN SAVELLE, Mother of Chris
Savelle: I think
she would.

42:39.824 --> 42:45.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think if she could see that
she could get
an education without having a
lifetime of

42:45.096 --> 42:47.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
crushing debt, I think she
would.

42:47.298 --> 42:51.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: The legacy of
Chris Savelle's
debt will be with him, his
sister and his

42:51.369 --> 42:54.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whole generation long after it's
paid.

42:54.105 --> 42:56.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Lizzie O'Leary
in Detroit

42:56.908 --> 43:03.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In our next
piece, the impact
of debt on some students at
for-profit schools.

43:03.614 --> 43:13.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, online, we look at which
student loan
companies accrue the most
complaints by borrowers.

43:13.658 --> 43:18.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, online, we look at which
student loan
companies accrue the most
complaints by borrowers.

43:18.963 --> 43:25.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can imagine it is not easy
to step in
and take over a popular
broadcast show, especially

43:25.069 --> 43:30.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one that was hosted for more
than 40 years
by its creator and stamped with
his personality.

43:31.008 --> 43:36.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as the new season kicks in
for one of
public radio's longtime
favorites, Jeffrey

43:36.047 --> 43:40.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brown has the story of how a new
host is trying
to put his own spin on it.

43:40.918 --> 43:44.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS THILE, Host, "A Prairie
Home Companion":
You know, I suspect we're going
to have some

43:44.655 --> 43:45.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fun this evening.

43:45.656 --> 43:47.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

43:47.458 --> 43:52.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The new "Prairie
Home Companion,"
still at the beautiful
Fitzgerald Theater

43:52.463 --> 44:00.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in downtown St. Paul, Minnesota,
still a two-hour
variety show presented live on
public radio,

44:00.137 --> 44:03.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but now led by 35-year-old Chris
Thile.

44:03.107 --> 44:08.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS THILE: I'm obsessed with
the good things
that people make to give to one
another.

44:08.980 --> 44:16.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This show is a place, has been
one of America's
most consistent sources of good
things for

44:16.320 --> 44:18.589 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
40 years.

44:18.623 --> 44:22.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I feel like it's imperative
that it continue.

44:22.226 --> 44:27.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Since its
founding in 1974,
of course, "Prairie Home
Companion" has been

44:27.765 --> 44:31.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
synonymous with one man,
Garrison Keillor.

44:31.602 --> 44:36.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He hosted it, wrote it, embodied
it with a
sense of the people and place he
knew in his

44:36.874 --> 44:38.776 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bones.

44:38.809 --> 44:39.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARRISON KEILLOR, Host, "A
Prairie Home Companion":
That's the news from Lake
Wobegon, where all

44:39.944 --> 44:41.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the women are strong, all the
men are good-looking.

44:41.746 --> 44:46.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Two years ago on
this very
stage, Keillor told me of the
magic of radio

44:46.551 --> 44:48.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and storytelling.

44:48.352 --> 44:57.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARRISON KEILLOR: I think
there's -- there's
a lot of power in listening to
one person

44:57.328 --> 44:59.997 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
talking to you.

45:00.031 --> 45:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And -- and this should never be
underestimated.

45:02.266 --> 45:08.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It was Keillor
who hand-picked
his successor, one who'd been
performing on

45:08.406 --> 45:11.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the show since age 15 and had
listened to
it even earlier.

45:12.009 --> 45:16.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS THILE: Some of my earliest
memories
are of hearing Garrison
Keillor's voice in

45:16.380 --> 45:18.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our living room, at a point when
I...

45:18.449 --> 45:20.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Really?

45:20.251 --> 45:23.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHRIS THILE: Yes, when I
couldn't even tell
the difference between his voice
and my father's

45:23.054 --> 45:24.855 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
voice.

45:24.889 --> 45:28.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's like an authoritative --
this authoritative,
paternal sound coming from the
radio.

45:28.359 --> 45:33.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Chris Thile, who
grew up in
Southern California, was a child
prodigy on

45:33.164 --> 45:37.001 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the mandolin.

45:37.034 --> 45:43.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With groups like Nickel Creek
and the Punch
Brothers, he grew into a leader
of a new generation

45:43.641 --> 45:49.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of bluegrass-based,
genre-bending musicians.

45:49.347 --> 45:51.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He can seemingly do anything
with his instrument.

45:51.682 --> 45:56.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I first spoke to Thile three
years ago when
he recorded an album of Bach
Partitas.

45:56.821 --> 46:04.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS THILE: The fugal pieces
where they're
all about precision, and these
second voices

46:04.762 --> 46:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
come in and then there's a third
voice.

46:08.399 --> 46:17.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Musician, band
leader, showman,
and now host of a program that's
lost listeners

46:17.441 --> 46:21.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in recent years, but still
reaches some three-and-a-half
million.

46:21.579 --> 46:24.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We watched rehearsal the day
before the first
live show.

46:24.715 --> 46:29.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During a break, Thile spoke of
the challenge
of bringing in new and younger
viewers, while

46:29.854 --> 46:31.656 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
replacing Garrison Keillor.

46:31.689 --> 46:41.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS THILE: I believe strongly
that quality
is not a generationally
exclusive thing, that

46:41.499 --> 46:49.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when you get to a certain level
of goodness,
it will appeal to everyone.

46:49.840 --> 46:58.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there will necessarily
be people who
wanted exactly what Garrison was
delivering

46:58.182 --> 47:01.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and don't want anything else.

47:01.118 --> 47:02.086 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I have to...

47:02.119 --> 47:03.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You may lose some
people.

47:03.187 --> 47:04.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRIS THILE: I have to let them
go...

47:04.188 --> 47:05.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

47:05.956 --> 47:08.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS THILE: ... because they
will be just
as dissatisfied with my best
imitation of

47:08.426 --> 47:12.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Garrison Keillor's delivery of
the show as
they will be with whatever I
would like to

47:12.396 --> 47:14.832 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do with it.

47:14.865 --> 47:19.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I also really think that
they will be
in the minority.

47:19.637 --> 47:23.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now another exciting episode
of Detective
Miller, phone cop.

47:23.774 --> 47:27.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The new news from
Lake Wobegon?

47:27.078 --> 47:31.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's gone, as are some of the
show's regular
storylines.

47:31.749 --> 47:36.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But actor Tim Russell has stayed
on and now
works with new writers.

47:36.754 --> 47:39.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I asked what we might expect,
and he went
right into character.

47:39.924 --> 47:43.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM RUSSELL, Actor: Well, I must
tell you,
Chris -- I mean Jeffrey.

47:43.861 --> 47:44.829 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm sorry.

47:44.862 --> 47:46.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm not good with names, OK?

47:47.031 --> 47:48.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There might be a little
political stuff.

47:48.866 --> 47:50.534 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

47:50.568 --> 47:56.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You could ask Bernie Sanders,
but one-tenth
of what we do will maybe be
comedic.

47:56.240 --> 47:59.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What this public radio station
needs is a
membership revolution.

47:59.610 --> 48:03.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Bernie Sanders
and Donald Trump
did make it into one skit.

48:04.014 --> 48:05.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TIM RUSSELL: It's true.

48:05.349 --> 48:06.317 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's true.

48:06.350 --> 48:09.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Only I can make public radio
great again.

48:09.286 --> 48:10.254 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

48:10.287 --> 48:11.989 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:12.022 --> 48:14.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But the humor is
still more
Saturday evening Minnesota than
"Saturday

48:14.859 --> 48:16.494 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Night Live."

48:16.527 --> 48:26.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The nasty political season did
come up in
a song about autumn that Thile
wrote.

48:26.570 --> 48:31.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead of a Keillor-like
opening monologue,
he plans to begin each show with
an original

48:31.142 --> 48:33.110 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tune.

48:33.144 --> 48:38.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also plans to shake up the
musical offerings
a bit, which is just fine by
longtime bandleader

48:38.582 --> 48:43.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rich Dworsky, who started at
"Prairie Home"
23 years ago and will stay on.

48:43.621 --> 48:46.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICH DWORSKY, Band Leader, "A
Prairie Home
Companion": Chris is 35 years
old, so he knows

48:47.024 --> 48:48.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a different set of music.

48:48.492 --> 48:50.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He knows different cultural
references.

48:50.494 --> 48:55.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, everything is going to be
maybe a little
bit younger and hipper and
edgier, you know,

48:55.432 --> 48:56.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like the kids are today.

48:56.834 --> 48:57.802 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:57.835 --> 49:00.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Like those kids
are.

49:00.171 --> 49:03.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RICH DWORSKY: And now I'm the
old guy.

49:03.674 --> 49:18.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For week one, the
musical muscle
came from a bona fide rock star,
Jack White,

49:18.522 --> 49:22.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and from the pop-soul sound of a
rising group,
Lake Street Dive.

49:22.493 --> 49:27.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rachael Price and Mike Olson
think the new
"Prairie Home" can connect with
young people

49:27.731 --> 49:31.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
eager for a music experience
that goes beyond
Pandora or Spotify.

49:31.735 --> 49:35.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHAEL PRICE, Lake Street Dive:
The more
that formats change, the more
relevant these

49:35.639 --> 49:39.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of older formats become,
because they
have so much value.

49:40.010 --> 49:43.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE OLSON, Lake Street Dive:
The desire to
have a vinyl record and the
desire to listen

49:43.714 --> 49:49.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to a variety show and these
kinds of things
goes beyond nostalgia.

49:49.420 --> 49:51.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's a very visceral
experience.

49:51.188 --> 49:56.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's something I think
directly transferable
to a show like this.

49:56.427 --> 49:59.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: To the extent
that it can even
be a cool thing?

49:59.363 --> 50:01.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RACHAEL PRICE: Yes.

50:01.198 --> 50:05.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's cool that people used to
sit down in
their homes and listen to the
radio together.

50:05.169 --> 50:07.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's a cool thing.

50:07.037 --> 50:10.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's no reason why we
should stop doing
that, even though we have all of
these other

50:10.741 --> 50:14.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ways to, like, entertain
ourselves.

50:14.411 --> 50:19.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This, Chris Thile
believes
in his bones.

50:19.250 --> 50:24.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS THILE: Radio is a podcast
that's happening
right now, live radio.

50:24.255 --> 50:26.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, this is -- our show is a
live show,
so...

50:26.257 --> 50:28.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You like that
aspect, clearly.

50:28.092 --> 50:29.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRIS THILE: I love that.

50:29.960 --> 50:37.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is nothing between you and
what's happening,
like the -- and I love the
communal aspect

50:37.701 --> 50:42.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of that, the idea that we could
be connected
in real time with that many
people.

50:42.273 --> 50:47.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The radio hasn't lost any of its
relevance
in our lives.

50:47.945 --> 50:49.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's still a unique piece of
technology.

50:49.813 --> 50:55.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Lake Wobegon may
be gone, that
is, but a great show, live on
the radio, well,

50:55.619 --> 50:57.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
maybe that lives on.

50:57.421 --> 51:01.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS THILE: It is such a
pleasure to spend
a Saturday evening in this
fashion with you

51:01.425 --> 51:04.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fine people out there in radio
land and here
at the Fitz.

51:04.328 --> 51:05.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I look forward to many, many
more.

51:05.829 --> 51:07.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

51:07.564 --> 51:10.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: From St. Paul,
Minnesota, I'm
Jeffrey Brown for the "PBS
NewsHour."

51:10.567 --> 51:20.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Online, you can
watch Chris
Thile perform his first original
song of the

51:20.644 --> 51:29.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
week for the new show about this
autumn season
of leaves falling and campaign
rhetoric flying.

51:29.486 --> 51:40.264 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

51:40.297 --> 51:45.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later tonight on PBS, an inside
look into
the making of the Broadway hit
"Hamilton."

51:45.269 --> 51:50.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The 90-minute program
"Hamilton's America"
offers a view of Lin-Manuel
Miranda's creative

51:50.607 --> 51:55.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
process during the years leading
up to the
opening of the musical,
including the time

51:55.479 --> 51:58.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he spent in Aaron Burr's
bedroom.

51:58.082 --> 52:01.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA,
Composer/Performer: I
write everywhere.

52:01.785 --> 52:02.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I write on trains.

52:02.786 --> 52:04.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I write wherever I can.

52:04.288 --> 52:08.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, sometimes, a couple of
days, I have written
in Aaron Burr's bedroom.

52:08.058 --> 52:13.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's pretty amazing to be in the
space he
was in the later parts of his
life.

52:13.697 --> 52:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Talk about artist in residence,
literally.

52:16.333 --> 52:18.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is my "Hamilton" writing
desk.

52:18.769 --> 52:20.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I sit here or I sit on the
floor.

52:20.504 --> 52:24.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't sit on the colonial
furniture.

52:24.274 --> 52:28.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is a song in the show
called "My Shot."

52:28.212 --> 52:30.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's Hamilton's big sort of
I want song.

52:30.581 --> 52:32.649 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's the second in the show.

52:32.683 --> 52:38.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We see him make his group of
friends, the
Marquis de Lafayette, John
Laurens, Hercules

52:38.522 --> 52:41.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mulligan, and Aaron Burr, who is
a colleague
and a friend.

52:41.859 --> 52:45.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm sort of putting him into
the song,
because these are guys who are
oil and water,

52:45.696 --> 52:46.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they come up together.

52:46.897 --> 52:48.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're revolutionaries
together.

52:48.232 --> 52:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're soldiers together.

52:49.366 --> 52:50.768 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're lawyers together.

52:50.801 --> 52:52.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're elected officials
together.

52:52.436 --> 52:55.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, at some point, one shoots
the other.

52:55.706 --> 53:01.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: "Hamilton's
America" airs tonight
