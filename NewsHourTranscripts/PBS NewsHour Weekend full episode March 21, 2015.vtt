00:11.111 --> 00:12.980
FOR SATURDAY, MARCH 21: THE

00:12.980 --> 00:14.915
UNITED STATES AND IRAN REPORT

00:14.915 --> 00:16.683
NEW MOMENTUM IN NEGOTIATIONS TO

00:16.683 --> 00:19.419
STRIKE A NUCLEAR DEAL; PROGRESS

00:19.419 --> 00:20.420
IN THE BATTLE AGAINST

00:20.420 --> 00:22.222
ALZHEIMER'S; AND IN OUR

00:22.222 --> 00:23.624
SIGNATURE SEGMENT, TAKING ON

00:23.624 --> 00:25.926
ISIS-- AN AMERICAN ARMY VETERAN

00:25.926 --> 00:28.061
RETURNS TO IRAQ TO "DEFEND

00:28.061 --> 00:29.396
CHRISTIANITY."

00:29.396 --> 00:30.197
>> YOU CAN PUSH CHRISTIANS BACK

00:30.197 --> 00:32.232
SO FAR, BUT, WHEN WE DO PICK UP

00:32.232 --> 00:35.202
THE SWORD, YOU KNOW, WE FIGHT

00:35.202 --> 00:35.869
BACK.

00:35.869 --> 00:36.703
>> Sreenivasan: NEXT ON PBS

00:36.703 --> 00:38.372
NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.307
FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS OF

00:40.307 --> 00:41.708
LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:41.708 --> 00:43.810
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:43.810 --> 00:44.578
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING.

00:44.578 --> 00:45.479
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:45.479 --> 00:46.847
THERE ARE NEW SIGNS OF PROGRESS

00:46.847 --> 00:48.415
IN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN

00:48.415 --> 00:49.583
THE WORLD'S MAJOR POWERS AND

00:49.583 --> 00:50.450
IRAN.

00:50.450 --> 00:52.019
OFFICIALS FROM BOTH SIDES SAID

00:52.019 --> 00:53.220
THE LATEST ROUND OF TALKS IN

00:53.220 --> 00:54.521
SWITZERLAND HAD LEFT THE TWO

00:54.521 --> 00:57.057
SIDES CLOSER TO A DEAL.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.492
>> WE HAVE NOT YET REACHED THE

00:58.492 --> 01:00.994
FINISH LINE, BUT MAKE NO

01:00.994 --> 01:02.095
MISTAKE-- WE HAVE THE

01:02.095 --> 01:03.830
OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO GET THIS

01:03.830 --> 01:04.998
RIGHT.

01:04.998 --> 01:07.634
WE HAVE MADE GENUINE PROGRESS,

01:07.634 --> 01:09.403
AND WE HAVE ALL LIVED UP TO OUR

01:09.403 --> 01:10.871
OBLIGATIONS.

01:10.871 --> 01:13.173
WE HAVE WORKED LONG AND HARD TO

01:13.173 --> 01:14.341
ACHIEVE A COMPREHENSIVE

01:14.341 --> 01:16.310
AGREEMENT THAT RESOLVES

01:16.310 --> 01:18.478
INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS ABOUT

01:18.478 --> 01:20.180
IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

01:20.180 --> 01:20.981
>> Sreenivasan: THAT ASSESSMENT

01:20.981 --> 01:22.582
WAS ECHOED BY IRANIAN PRESIDENT

01:22.582 --> 01:25.185
HASSAN ROUHANI.

01:25.185 --> 01:26.586
>> (translated): IN THIS ROUND

01:26.586 --> 01:28.622
OF TALKS, SHARED POINTS OF VIEW

01:28.622 --> 01:30.290
EMERGED IN SOME OF THE AREAS

01:30.290 --> 01:31.224
WHERE THERE HAD BEEN A

01:31.224 --> 01:32.826
DIFFERENCE OF OPINION, WHICH CAN

01:32.826 --> 01:34.294
BE A FOUNDATION FOR A FINAL

01:34.294 --> 01:35.395
AGREEMENT.

01:35.395 --> 01:36.396
DIFFERENCES ON SOME OF THE

01:36.396 --> 01:38.098
ISSUES STILL REMAIN THAT COULD

01:38.098 --> 01:39.433
HAVE BEEN RESOLVED, BUT MORE

01:39.433 --> 01:40.467
TIME IS NEEDED.

01:40.467 --> 01:41.802
>> Sreenivasan: A DAY AFTER

01:41.802 --> 01:43.103
SUICIDE BOMBERS KILLED AT LEAST

01:43.103 --> 01:45.572
137 WORSHIPPERS IN YEMEN, THE

01:45.572 --> 01:47.007
UNITED STATES IS REPORTEDLY

01:47.007 --> 01:48.608
REMOVING THE LAST OF ITS TROOPS

01:48.608 --> 01:50.177
OUT OF THAT COUNTRY.

01:50.177 --> 01:50.944
YEMENI OFFICIALS SAY THE

01:50.944 --> 01:52.646
AMERICANS EVACUATED AN AIR BASE

01:52.646 --> 01:53.880
FOLLOWING THE CAPTURE OF A

01:53.880 --> 01:55.248
NEARBY CITY BY AL QAEDA

01:55.248 --> 01:56.083
FIGHTERS.

01:56.083 --> 01:57.718
THE U.S. CLOSED ITS EMBASSY IN

01:57.718 --> 01:59.686
THE CAPITAL CITY OF SANAA LAST

01:59.686 --> 02:00.487
MONTH.

02:00.487 --> 02:02.122
AUTHORITIES IN TUNISIA TODAY

02:02.122 --> 02:04.424
ARRESTED 20 SUSPECTED MILITANTS

02:04.424 --> 02:06.026
FOR THEIR ALLEGED ROLE IN THE

02:06.026 --> 02:07.894
MUSEUM ATTACK EARLIER THIS WEEK

02:07.894 --> 02:09.096
THAT LEFT NEARLY TWO DOZEN

02:09.096 --> 02:10.530
TOURISTS DEAD.

02:10.530 --> 02:11.832
IN TUNIS TODAY, THE VICTIMS WERE

02:11.832 --> 02:12.833
REMEMBERED DURING A MASS

02:12.833 --> 02:14.067
ATTENDED BY GOVERNMENT

02:14.067 --> 02:14.935
MINISTERS.

02:14.935 --> 02:15.969
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THE TWO

02:15.969 --> 02:16.970
GUNMEN KILLED DURING THE

02:16.970 --> 02:18.705
INCIDENT HAD TRAINED AT JIHADI

02:18.705 --> 02:20.574
CAMPS IN NEIGHBORING LIBYA.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.009
A FEDERAL JUDGE HAS ORDERED THE

02:22.009 --> 02:23.577
PENTAGON TO RELEASE PHOTOGRAPHS

02:23.577 --> 02:25.145
THAT SHOW THE ABUSE OF DETAINEES

02:25.145 --> 02:26.580
IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.015
SOME OF THE IMAGES, TAKEN BY

02:28.015 --> 02:29.383
AMERICAN SERVICE PERSONNEL,

02:29.383 --> 02:30.417
REPORTEDLY SHOW SOLDIERS

02:30.417 --> 02:31.985
POINTING GUNS AT THE HEADS OF

02:31.985 --> 02:33.987
HOODED AND HANDCUFFED DETAINEES.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.322
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS RELEASING

02:35.322 --> 02:36.590
THE PHOTOS, TAKEN ABOUT A DECADE

02:36.590 --> 02:38.892
AGO, WILL INCITE ATTACKS AGAINST

02:38.892 --> 02:41.194
AMERICAN SERVICEMEN OVERSEAS.

02:41.194 --> 02:42.596
THE RULING YESTERDAY BY DISTRICT

02:42.596 --> 02:43.997
JUDGE ALVIN HELLERSTEIN GIVES

02:43.997 --> 02:45.565
THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT TWO

02:45.565 --> 02:46.867
MONTHS TO APPEAL.

02:46.867 --> 02:47.968
ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS FROM THE

02:47.968 --> 02:50.003
GROUP BOKO HARAM ARE SAID TO BE

02:50.003 --> 02:51.938
BEHIND AN ATROCITY COMMITTED IN

02:51.938 --> 02:52.906
NIGERIA.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.608
A MASS GRAVE WITH AT LEAST 70

02:54.608 --> 02:56.376
DECOMPOSED BODIES WAS DISCOVERED

02:56.376 --> 02:57.911
NEAR A TOWN RECENTLY TAKEN BACK

02:57.911 --> 02:59.012
FROM THE GROUP.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.580
AUTHORITIES SAID MANY OF THE

03:00.580 --> 03:02.649
VICTIMS HAD THEIR THROATS SLIT.

03:02.649 --> 03:03.683
A FEDERAL JUDGE HAS DECLARED

03:03.683 --> 03:05.118
WISCONSIN'S ABORTION LAW

03:05.118 --> 03:06.453
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

03:06.453 --> 03:07.888
THE LAW, CHALLENGED BY PLANNED

03:07.888 --> 03:09.256
PARENTHOOD, HAD REQUIRED DOCTORS

03:09.256 --> 03:10.724
PERFORMING ABORTIONS TO HAVE

03:10.724 --> 03:12.659
ADMITTING PRIVILEGES AT A NEARBY

03:12.659 --> 03:13.427
HOSPITAL.

03:13.427 --> 03:14.795
SUPPORTERS OF THE LAW, INCLUDING

03:14.795 --> 03:15.896
GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER, SAID THE

03:15.896 --> 03:17.664
LAW WOULD HELP GUARANTEE THE

03:17.664 --> 03:19.266
SAFETY OF WOMEN RECEIVING

03:19.266 --> 03:20.200
ABORTIONS.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.902
OPPONENTS SAID IT WAS REALLY

03:21.902 --> 03:23.203
MEANT TO LIMIT ACCESS TO

03:23.203 --> 03:24.638
ABORTIONS BY MAKING WOMEN TRAVEL

03:24.638 --> 03:26.306
FURTHER, ESPECIALLY FROM RURAL

03:26.306 --> 03:27.407
AREAS.

03:27.407 --> 03:28.208
A NEW STUDY DOCUMENTS THE

03:28.208 --> 03:29.443
CONTINUING DECLINE OF THE

03:29.443 --> 03:30.911
NATION'S MIDDLE CLASS.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.679
ACCORDING TO PEW, EVERY SINGLE

03:32.679 --> 03:34.314
STATE SAW ITS PERCENTAGE OF

03:34.314 --> 03:36.083
MIDDLE CLASS RESIDENTS SHRINK

03:36.083 --> 03:38.652
BETWEEN 2000 AND 2013.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.754
THE DARKER THE BLUE, THE STEEPER

03:40.754 --> 03:41.788
THE DECLINE.

03:41.788 --> 03:43.390
STATES LIKE OHIO, WISCONSIN AND

03:43.390 --> 03:44.391
GEORGIA HAD THE STEEPEST

03:44.391 --> 03:46.960
DECLINES, ALL AROUND 5%; IDAHO,

03:46.960 --> 03:49.229
WYOMING, HAWAII AND ALASKA HAD

03:49.229 --> 03:50.597
THE SMALLEST DROPS.

03:50.597 --> 03:52.232
THIS WEEKEND MARKS THE 70th

03:52.232 --> 03:54.167
ANNIVERSARY OF THE BATTLE OF IWO

03:54.167 --> 03:55.535
JIMA, ONE OF THE MOST BRUTAL AND

03:55.535 --> 03:56.937
INFAMOUS BATTLES OF WORLD WAR

03:56.937 --> 03:57.671
II.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.673
MORE THAN 30 U.S. VETERANS, MANY

03:59.673 --> 04:01.441
IN THEIR EARLY 90s, ATTENDED A

04:01.441 --> 04:02.843
CEREMONY ON THE TINY JAPANESE

04:02.843 --> 04:04.444
ISLAND TO COMMEMORATE THE U.S.

04:04.444 --> 04:06.079
VICTORY OVER JAPANESE FORCES IN

04:06.079 --> 04:07.747
1945.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.850
7,000 MARINES DIED AND MORE THAN

04:09.850 --> 04:11.952
20,000 WERE WOUNDED SECURING THE

04:11.952 --> 04:12.652
ISLAND.

04:12.652 --> 04:14.020
THE VETERANS ALSO VISITED THE

04:14.020 --> 04:15.989
HILLTOP WHERE THE ICONIC PHOTO

04:15.989 --> 04:17.757
WAS TAKEN OF THE MARINES RAISING

04:17.757 --> 04:19.226
THE U.S. FLAG.

04:19.226 --> 04:20.727
AND FINALLY, SOME ANCIENT

04:20.727 --> 04:21.428
HISTORY.

04:21.428 --> 04:22.796
PALEONTOLOGISTS FROM NORTH

04:22.796 --> 04:24.030
CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY HAVE

04:24.030 --> 04:25.398
DISCOVERED REMAINS OF WHAT

04:25.398 --> 04:27.367
THEY'VE DUBBED THE "CAROLINA

04:27.367 --> 04:29.836
BUTCHER," AN ANCESTOR OF TODAY'S

04:29.836 --> 04:30.971
CROCODILE.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.372
THE "BUTCHER" HAD SHARP TEETH,

04:32.372 --> 04:34.074
WAS AT LEAST NINE FEET TALL AND

04:34.074 --> 04:35.675
ACTUALLY WALKED ON ITS HIND

04:35.675 --> 04:36.510
LEGS.

04:36.510 --> 04:37.544
SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THE BEASTS

04:37.544 --> 04:39.212
DIED OUT BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT

04:39.212 --> 04:40.981
ULTIMATELY COMPETE WITH EVEN

04:40.981 --> 04:42.616
LARGER DINOSAURS, WHICH PREYED

04:42.616 --> 04:43.583
ON THEM.

04:43.583 --> 04:44.351
IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING, THE

04:44.351 --> 04:45.519
CAROLINA BUTCHER MAY HAVE WALKED

04:45.519 --> 04:48.255
THE EARTH SOME 230 MILLION YEARS

04:48.255 --> 04:49.322
AGO.

04:58.832 --> 04:59.766
>> Sreenivasan: JUST YESTERDAY

04:59.766 --> 05:00.800
CAME WORD ABOUT WHAT COULD BE A

05:00.800 --> 05:01.735
BIG STEP FORWARD IN THE BATTLE

05:01.735 --> 05:03.103
AGAINST ALZHEIMER'S, A NEW DRUG

05:03.103 --> 05:04.871
THAT DURING TESTS SHARPLY SLOWED

05:04.871 --> 05:06.673
THE COGNITIVE DECLINE OF PEOPLE

05:06.673 --> 05:08.375
WITH THE DEBILITATING DISEASE.

05:08.375 --> 05:09.442
FOR MORE, WE ARE JOINED NOW BY

05:09.442 --> 05:10.644
DR. SAMUEL GANDY.

05:10.644 --> 05:11.811
HE IS A NEUROLOGIST AND

05:11.811 --> 05:12.746
ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF THE

05:12.746 --> 05:13.847
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE RESEARCH

05:13.847 --> 05:15.482
CENTER AT MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL

05:15.482 --> 05:16.416
HERE IN NEW YORK CITY.

05:16.416 --> 05:18.051
SO, I GUESS, FIRST, WHAT IS THE

05:18.051 --> 05:19.386
DRUG, AND WHAT DOES IT DO?

05:19.386 --> 05:22.789
>> SO, THE DRUG IS AIMED AT

05:22.789 --> 05:24.024
MATERIAL THAT BUILDS UP IN THE

05:24.024 --> 05:25.025
BRAIN DURING ALZHEIMER'S

05:25.025 --> 05:25.725
DISEASE.

05:25.725 --> 05:27.527
THIS IS A NORMAL PROTEIN, A

05:27.527 --> 05:30.030
NORMAL SUBSTANCE OF THE BRAIN

05:30.030 --> 05:31.331
WHICH CHANGES ITS SHAPE AND

05:31.331 --> 05:32.432
CLUMPS.

05:32.432 --> 05:34.935
AND THIS CLASS OF DISEASES

05:34.935 --> 05:36.770
CALLED AMYLOID DISEASES, OR

05:36.770 --> 05:39.839
AMYLOIDOSIS, ARE NOTORIOUSLY

05:39.839 --> 05:41.808
DIFFICULT TO TREAT.

05:41.808 --> 05:43.476
AND THE IDEA WITH THIS DRUG IS

05:43.476 --> 05:44.945
TO HELP THE BRAIN CLEAR THOSE

05:44.945 --> 05:47.547
CLUMPS AWAY, HELPS TO HARNESS

05:47.547 --> 05:49.416
THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO CLEAR THOSE

05:49.416 --> 05:50.784
CLUMPS AWAY.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.052
>> Sreenivasan: IS THIS JUST

05:52.052 --> 05:53.420
TARGETED AT ALZHEIMER'S, OR ARE

05:53.420 --> 05:55.088
THERE ANY FORMS OF DEMENTIA

05:55.088 --> 05:56.056
THAT COULD ALSO BENEFIT FROM A

05:56.056 --> 05:57.257
DRUG LIKE THIS?

05:57.257 --> 05:58.525
>> IN ANY DISEASE, IN ANY

05:58.525 --> 05:59.426
DEMENTIA IN WHICH THIS

05:59.426 --> 06:01.461
PARTICULAR PROTEIN BUILDS UP,

06:01.461 --> 06:03.597
THIS MEDICINE COULD BE

06:03.597 --> 06:04.531
EFFECTIVE.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.132
FOR EXAMPLE, THERE ARE NOT ONLY

06:06.132 --> 06:07.667
JUST ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, BUT

06:07.667 --> 06:09.869
WHAT WE CALL MIXED DEMENTIAS IN

06:09.869 --> 06:11.571
WHICH ALZHEIMER'S AND, SAY,

06:11.571 --> 06:14.641
DEMENTIA DUE TO MULTIPLE STROKES

06:14.641 --> 06:16.343
CAN COEXIST.

06:16.343 --> 06:18.078
IN THAT CASE, THE COMPONENT DUE

06:18.078 --> 06:19.546
TO ALZHEIMER'S WILL STILL BE

06:19.546 --> 06:21.681
RESPONSIVE TO THIS DRUG.

06:21.681 --> 06:22.882
>> Sreenivasan: SO, GIVEN THAT

06:22.882 --> 06:23.783
THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER ATTEMPTS

06:23.783 --> 06:24.918
AT THIS, HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS

06:24.918 --> 06:26.353
SORT OF ADVANCEMENT?

06:26.353 --> 06:30.190
>> WELL, THIS IS THE FIRST DRUG

06:30.190 --> 06:32.692
OF ANY CLASS AIMED AT AMYLOID

06:32.692 --> 06:33.994
THAT'S SHOWN ANY CONVINCING

06:33.994 --> 06:35.161
SIGNAL.

06:35.161 --> 06:36.129
SO, NOT ONLY HAVE THERE BEEN

06:36.129 --> 06:37.631
ANTIBODY TRIALS, BUT ALSO THERE

06:37.631 --> 06:39.866
ARE SMALL MOLECULES, PILLS, THAT

06:39.866 --> 06:41.101
ARE BEING TESTED THAT ARE AIMED

06:41.101 --> 06:42.802
AT THE ENZYMES THAT MAKE

06:42.802 --> 06:44.437
AMYLOID, FOR EXAMPLE.

06:44.437 --> 06:46.239
NONE OF THOSE HAVE SUCCEEDED SO

06:46.239 --> 06:47.140
FAR.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.942
SO, IN TERMS OF WHAT WE CALL THE

06:48.942 --> 06:50.210
AMYLOID HYPOTHESIS OF

06:50.210 --> 06:51.978
ALZHEIMER'S-- THAT AMYLOID IS

06:51.978 --> 06:54.681
KEY TO THE CAUSE OF THE

06:54.681 --> 06:57.817
DISEASE-- THIS IS REALLY

06:57.817 --> 06:59.119
IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF FOCUSING

06:59.119 --> 07:02.956
OR SORT OF CONFIRMING THAT THAT

07:02.956 --> 07:05.225
IS A VALID TARGET.

07:05.225 --> 07:06.126
>> Sreenivasan: SO, WHY IS THIS

07:06.126 --> 07:07.127
PARTICULAR DRUG OR THIS

07:07.127 --> 07:08.261
PARTICULAR TYPE OF THERAPY

07:08.261 --> 07:09.129
DIFFERENT?

07:09.129 --> 07:11.998
>> THIS IS A BIOLOGICAL.

07:11.998 --> 07:14.301
IT'S A PROTEIN, WHAT'S CALLED A

07:14.301 --> 07:16.436
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY, AND IT'S

07:16.436 --> 07:18.805
DIRECTED SPECIFICALLY AT THIS

07:18.805 --> 07:21.174
MOLECULE THAT BUILDS UP.

07:21.174 --> 07:22.776
AND WE'VE RARELY BEEN SUCCESSFUL

07:22.776 --> 07:24.377
IN THIS SORT OF MEDICATION, IN

07:24.377 --> 07:25.512
THIS SORT OF DISEASE.

07:25.512 --> 07:26.546
THERE'S ONE EXAMPLE OF ANOTHER

07:26.546 --> 07:28.248
AMYLOID THAT'S TREATABLE.

07:28.248 --> 07:29.916
THIS IS THE SECOND EXAMPLE WHERE

07:29.916 --> 07:31.551
WE SEEM TO HAVE A LEAD ON A

07:31.551 --> 07:32.986
STRATEGY THAT LOOKS TO BE

07:32.986 --> 07:33.753
SUCCESSFUL.

07:33.753 --> 07:34.521
>> Sreenivasan: SO, BIOGEN, THE

07:34.521 --> 07:35.588
COMPANY THAT MADE THIS, SAW A

07:35.588 --> 07:36.823
HUGE BUMP IN THEIR STOCK.

07:36.823 --> 07:38.258
OBVIOUSLY, INVESTORS SEEM VERY

07:38.258 --> 07:39.693
CONFIDENT, BUT THIS IS FAR OFF

07:39.693 --> 07:40.727
FROM ACTUALLY GETTING TO MARKET,

07:40.727 --> 07:41.294
RIGHT?

07:41.294 --> 07:42.662
>> IT IS.

07:42.662 --> 07:45.298
THIS IS A SMALL TRIAL.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.067
IF YOU DIVIDE IT UP BETWEEN...

07:47.067 --> 07:49.269
THERE'S ONLY ABOUT 150, 160

07:49.269 --> 07:50.870
SUBJECTS TOTAL.

07:50.870 --> 07:51.571
THEY WERE IN SIX DIFFERENT

07:51.571 --> 07:52.439
GROUPS.

07:52.439 --> 07:53.606
SO, IN EACH GROUP, THERE WERE

07:53.606 --> 07:55.375
ONLY ABOUT TWO DOZEN PATIENTS.

07:55.375 --> 07:57.844
SO, THE F.D.A. USUALLY REQUIRES

07:57.844 --> 08:00.980
AT LEAST TWO MUCH LARGER TRIALS,

08:00.980 --> 08:02.615
AND SO THOSE WOULD HAVE TO NOW

08:02.615 --> 08:04.284
BE... UNDER AT LEAST TYPICAL

08:04.284 --> 08:06.353
POLICY, THOSE WOULD BE REQUIRED

08:06.353 --> 08:07.687
BEFORE IT WOULD BE APPROVED.

08:07.687 --> 08:09.656
NOW, THE F.D.A. HAS GIVEN SOME

08:09.656 --> 08:10.757
SIGNALS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO

08:10.757 --> 08:12.559
FAST-TRACK THIS SORT OF THING,

08:12.559 --> 08:15.195
SO THEY COULD CHANGE THOSE

08:15.195 --> 08:15.829
RULES.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.430
BUT ONE WOULD GUESS THAT IF THEY

08:17.430 --> 08:19.933
RAN THE TWO TRIALS IN PARALLEL,

08:19.933 --> 08:20.667
PERHAPS IT WOULD BE READY IN

08:20.667 --> 08:22.435
THREE, FOUR YEARS.

08:22.435 --> 08:24.204
BUT IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE BEING

08:24.204 --> 08:25.538
ANY FASTER THAN THAT.

08:25.538 --> 08:26.339
>> Sreenivasan: AND, YOU KNOW,

08:26.339 --> 08:27.807
THERE'S ALWAYS SIDE EFFECTS TO

08:27.807 --> 08:28.208
DRUGS.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.509
I MEAN, ARE THERE ANY KNOWN SIDE

08:29.509 --> 08:30.610
EFFECTS SO FAR?

08:30.610 --> 08:32.812
>> THERE ARE.

08:32.812 --> 08:34.848
AND THIS PARTICULAR SIDE EFFECT

08:34.848 --> 08:36.449
IS ONE THAT OCCURS WITH A NUMBER

08:36.449 --> 08:37.550
OF THESE BIOLOGICALS.

08:37.550 --> 08:39.252
THERE ARE ANTIBODIES LIKE THIS

08:39.252 --> 08:40.387
YOU CAN USE FOR CANCER, FOR

08:40.387 --> 08:41.221
EXAMPLE.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.256
AND THIS IS A SWELLING OF THE

08:43.256 --> 08:44.891
BRAIN, OR AT LEAST A CHANGE IN

08:44.891 --> 08:46.726
THE WATER CONTENT OF THE BRAIN.

08:46.726 --> 08:49.629
IT'S OFTEN THOSE SYMPTOMS, AND

08:49.629 --> 08:52.065
USUALLY IF YOU SORT OF DECREASE

08:52.065 --> 08:54.067
THE DOSE OF THE DRUG OR SPACE

08:54.067 --> 08:56.569
OUT THE ADMINISTRATION, IT WILL

08:56.569 --> 08:58.271
RESOLVE SPONTANEOUSLY.

08:58.271 --> 08:59.372
BUT IT'S FAIRLY IMPORTANT TO

08:59.372 --> 09:01.741
BE... TO SURVEY FOR IT.

09:01.741 --> 09:03.243
IT'S READILY DETECTABLE ON

09:03.243 --> 09:05.645
M.R.I. BEFORE THERE ARE ANY

09:05.645 --> 09:07.347
SYMPTOMS, SO I THINK IT WOULD BE

09:07.347 --> 09:08.047
MANAGEABLE.

09:08.047 --> 09:08.782
>> Sreenivasan: SO, THIS IS A

09:08.782 --> 09:10.250
CATEGORY OF BIOLOGICAL DRUGS

09:10.250 --> 09:11.117
THAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT, BUT

09:11.117 --> 09:12.051
ARE THERE OTHER DRUGS?

09:12.051 --> 09:13.887
I MEAN, ALZHEIMER'S IS SO

09:13.887 --> 09:14.888
ENORMOUS IN THIS COUNTRY AND

09:14.888 --> 09:16.356
ELSEWHERE; ARE THERE OTHER DRUGS

09:16.356 --> 09:17.357
THAT ARE FOLLOWING THIS KIND OF

09:17.357 --> 09:18.725
LEAD OR EVEN IN THE CLINICAL

09:18.725 --> 09:20.260
TRIALS PROCESS?

09:20.260 --> 09:21.528
>> WELL, IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE?

09:21.528 --> 09:23.296
YES.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.365
SO, THIS PARTICULAR STRATEGY HAS

09:25.365 --> 09:27.667
BEEN ATTEMPTED BEFORE AND HAS

09:27.667 --> 09:29.068
FAILED.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.437
THERE WAS A DRUG BY PFIZER, A

09:30.437 --> 09:32.472
DRUG FROM LILLY WHICH IS STILL

09:32.472 --> 09:34.441
BEING EVALUATED, BUT THE PFIZER

09:34.441 --> 09:36.276
DRUG WAS ABANDONED.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.611
AND IT'S NOT QUITE CLEAR WHY THE

09:38.611 --> 09:40.914
BIOGEN TRIAL SUCCEEDED WHERE

09:40.914 --> 09:42.482
THESE OTHERS HAVE FAILED.

09:42.482 --> 09:43.183
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF

09:43.183 --> 09:44.050
POSSIBILITIES.

09:44.050 --> 09:45.118
THE FIRST IS THAT THESE

09:45.118 --> 09:47.320
BIOLOGICALS CAN BE DIFFERENT.

09:47.320 --> 09:51.291
ONE ANTIBODY MADE BY ONE COMPANY

09:51.291 --> 09:52.859
MAY BE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM

09:52.859 --> 09:53.960
ANOTHER IN WAYS THAT WE MAY

09:53.960 --> 09:55.295
NEVER EVEN KNOW.

09:55.295 --> 09:56.296
SO, IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE

09:56.296 --> 09:58.364
BIOGEN ANTIBODY IS JUST SUPERIOR

09:58.364 --> 09:59.065
TO THE OTHERS.

09:59.065 --> 10:01.100
IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THE BIOGEN

10:01.100 --> 10:02.635
TRIAL DESIGN WAS THE SECRET

10:02.635 --> 10:05.271
BECAUSE THEY SCREENED FOR PEOPLE

10:05.271 --> 10:07.040
WHO HAD... THEY USED AMYLOID

10:07.040 --> 10:08.741
BRAIN SCANS TO SELECT THE

10:08.741 --> 10:09.442
SUBJECTS.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.543
SO, THEY KNEW THAT THE PEOPLE

10:10.543 --> 10:11.978
GOING IN HAD AMYLOID IN THEIR

10:11.978 --> 10:12.879
BRAIN.

10:12.879 --> 10:14.380
IN PREVIOUS TRIALS, THOSE FOLKS

10:14.380 --> 10:16.316
WITH AMYLOID-NEGATIVE, OR WITH

10:16.316 --> 10:17.817
NEGATIVE AMYLOID SCANS, WERE

10:17.817 --> 10:18.585
INCLUDED.

10:18.585 --> 10:20.119
SO, IF THEY WERE NOT RESPONSIVE

10:20.119 --> 10:21.888
TO THE MEDICATION, THEY WOULD

10:21.888 --> 10:23.256
HAVE DILUTED OUT THE EFFECT.

10:23.256 --> 10:24.257
AND SO, IT'S POSSIBLE THAT IF

10:24.257 --> 10:25.558
THESE OTHER DRUGS ARE TESTED

10:25.558 --> 10:27.327
WITH THE SAME DESIGN, THEY MIGHT

10:27.327 --> 10:28.695
PROVE SUCCESSFUL.

10:28.695 --> 10:29.496
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

THIS HOUSE, AND WE LOVE THAT SHE

13:53.833 --> 13:55.068
STAYED HERE.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.302

13:56.302 --> 13:56.869
>> IT IS.

13:56.869 --> 13:58.571
HONESTLY, IT IS, IT IS.

13:58.571 --> 13:59.439
>> Reporter: BASA MUSAFAR WAS

13:59.439 --> 14:00.940
THE ONLY CHRISTIAN TO STAY AND

14:00.940 --> 14:03.543
SURVIVE IN ALQOSH WHEN ISIS TOOK

14:03.543 --> 14:04.711
THE TOWN.

14:04.711 --> 14:05.812
SHE HAS TRANSFORMED HER HOUSE

14:05.812 --> 14:06.979
INTO A CHRISTIAN SHRINE

14:06.979 --> 14:11.918
MEMORIALIZING THE FALLEN.

14:11.918 --> 14:13.086
JUST AS ST. GEORGE KILLED THE

14:13.086 --> 14:14.954
SERPENT, THE CHRISTIAN MILITIAS

14:14.954 --> 14:16.756
ARE DEPICTED CRUSHING THE ISIS

14:16.756 --> 14:17.790
SNAKE.

14:17.790 --> 14:18.758
DO YOU THINK THIS IS A RELIGIOUS

14:18.758 --> 14:19.692
WAR?

14:19.692 --> 14:20.560
>> I THINK IT'S BECOME A

14:20.560 --> 14:22.328
RELIGIOUS WAR, YES, BECAUSE THE

14:22.328 --> 14:23.463
ATROCITIES THEY ARE COMMITTING

14:23.463 --> 14:26.566
ARE BASED ON THEIR BELIEFS.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.968
AND THE FACT THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU

14:28.968 --> 14:30.570
CAN PUSH CHRISTIANS BACK SO FAR,

14:30.570 --> 14:32.338
BUT WHEN WE DO PICK UP THE

14:32.338 --> 14:35.575
SWORD, WE FIGHT BACK.

14:35.575 --> 14:36.776
AND WE'RE DOING SO FOR OUR

14:36.776 --> 14:37.977

14:37.977 --> 14:39.545

14:40.613 --> 14:41.948
AT LEAST, LIFE IN ALQOSH HAS

14:41.948 --> 14:43.316
RETURNED TO SOMETHING LIKE

14:43.316 --> 14:44.250
NORMAL.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.619
WHAT DOES THIS TOWN MEAN FOR

14:46.619 --> 14:47.720
YOU?

14:47.720 --> 14:49.155
>> THIS TOWN SIGNIFIES A

14:49.155 --> 14:50.089
VICTORY.

14:50.089 --> 14:52.125
I MEAN, AT ONE POINT, THIS TOWN

14:52.125 --> 14:54.827
WAS COMPLETELY ABANDONED EXCEPT

14:54.827 --> 14:59.632
FOR ONE PERSON, SOMETIMES TWO.

14:59.632 --> 15:02.001
BUT NOW, I MEAN, THE CHURCH

15:02.001 --> 15:05.104
BELLS RING AGAIN HERE; PEOPLE GO

15:05.104 --> 15:07.907
ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS; PEOPLE

15:07.907 --> 15:08.775
LIVE HERE.

15:08.775 --> 15:09.876
THAT'S THE BIGGEST THING.

15:09.876 --> 15:12.311
AS YOU CAN SEE, SHOPS ARE OPEN,

15:12.311 --> 15:14.113
BUSINESS IS BACK, PEOPLE ARE

15:14.113 --> 15:16.149
GOING TO SCHOOL.

15:16.149 --> 15:18.050
THIS SIGNIFIES ONE OF THE FEW

15:18.050 --> 15:19.652
VICTORIES THAT WE HAVE RIGHT

15:19.652 --> 15:20.653
NOW.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.021
I MEAN, WHAT'S TERRORISM?

15:22.021 --> 15:23.256
TERRORISM IS A DISRUPTION OF

15:23.256 --> 15:24.724
YOUR DAILY LIFE.

15:24.724 --> 15:26.359
AND I KNOW THESE PEOPLE ARE

15:26.359 --> 15:27.026
RESILIENT.

15:27.026 --> 15:28.127
THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO SAY, "HEY,

15:28.127 --> 15:29.328
LOOK, WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THE

15:29.328 --> 15:30.630
AREA, BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET

15:30.630 --> 15:32.098
YOU DESTROY OUR LIVES.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.733
YOU KNOW, WE WILL STAY HERE AND

15:33.733 --> 15:35.168
DIE FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE IN, BUT

15:35.168 --> 15:36.803
WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO GO

15:36.803 --> 15:39.272
ON AND OPERATE OUR DAILY LIFE."

HUGE SWINGS IN THE CURRENCY

MICHAEL REGAN OF BLOOMBERG NEWS.

18:56.402 --> 18:59.472

18:59.472 --> 19:01.240

19:01.240 --> 19:02.341
EVERYBODY KIND OF THINKS ABOUT

19:02.341 --> 19:03.542
INTEREST RATES, BUT SOMETHING

19:03.542 --> 19:04.577
JANET YELLEN SAID ABOUT THE

19:04.577 --> 19:05.911
PRICE OF THE DOLLAR SEEMED TO

19:05.911 --> 19:06.679
HAVE A HUGE IMPACT.

19:06.679 --> 19:07.346
WHY?

19:07.346 --> 19:08.647
>> RIGHT, WELL, IT'S SORT OF

19:08.647 --> 19:10.249
COUNTERINTUITIVE, BUT A STRONGER

19:10.249 --> 19:11.851
CURRENCY IS NOT NECESSARILY THE

19:11.851 --> 19:13.486
BEST THING FOR AN ECONOMY.

19:13.486 --> 19:14.587
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.

19:14.587 --> 19:15.755
IF YOU'RE AN AMERICAN COMPANY

19:15.755 --> 19:17.857
SELLING BIG MACS OR iPHONES OR

19:17.857 --> 19:20.259
WHATEVER IN EUROPE, UNLESS YOU

19:20.259 --> 19:22.862
RAISE YOUR PRICES IN EURO TERMS,

19:22.862 --> 19:23.863
YOU'LL COLLECT THE SAME AMOUNT

19:23.863 --> 19:25.197
OF EUROS, BUT WHEN YOU TRANSLATE

19:25.197 --> 19:26.699
IT BACK TO AMERICAN DOLLARS IT'S

19:26.699 --> 19:28.067
MUCH LESS ON THE AMERICAN DOLLAR

19:28.067 --> 19:28.401
SIDE.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.102
SO, THAT CREATES HEADWIND FOR A

19:30.102 --> 19:32.405
LOT OF COMPANIES THAT HAVE BIG

19:32.405 --> 19:34.707
OVERSEAS BUSINESSES, WHICH IS

19:34.707 --> 19:36.042
MANY AMERICAN COMPANIES.

19:36.042 --> 19:37.009
>> Sreenivasan: SO, A LOT OF

19:37.009 --> 19:37.877
THESE MULTINATIONAL

19:37.877 --> 19:38.778
CORPORATIONS, THAT MEANS THEY'RE

19:38.778 --> 19:40.146
NOT MAKING NEARLY AS MUCH PROFIT

19:40.146 --> 19:41.747
OVERSEAS, RIGHT?

19:41.747 --> 19:42.581
>> EXACTLY, EXACTLY.

19:42.581 --> 19:44.283
SOME ARE ACTUALLY DOING BETTER

19:44.283 --> 19:46.085
BECAUSE THE AMERICAN SPENDING

19:46.085 --> 19:48.120
POWER IS STRONGER, SO IT'S SORT

19:48.120 --> 19:48.954
OF A MIXED BAG.

19:48.954 --> 19:51.090
BUT ON THE WHOLE, IT OFTENTIMES

19:51.090 --> 19:52.158
TENDS TO BE A HEADWIND TO THE

19:52.158 --> 19:53.192
ECONOMY AND TO THE STOCK MARKET.

19:53.192 --> 19:53.959
>> Sreenivasan: OKAY, BESIDES

19:53.959 --> 19:55.227
THESE HUGE CORPORATIONS, HOW

19:55.227 --> 19:56.929
DOES IT IMPACT OUR BUYING POWER?

19:56.929 --> 19:58.464
I GUESS, ON THE ONE HAND MAYBE

19:58.464 --> 19:59.799
IT'S CHEAPER FOR ME TO TRAVEL IN

19:59.799 --> 20:01.167
EUROPE RIGHT NOW, BUT IF THAT'S

20:01.167 --> 20:02.401
NOT MY THING HOW AM I ACTUALLY

20:02.401 --> 20:03.836
FEELING THE IMPACT?

20:03.836 --> 20:05.438
>> WELL, FOR ONE THING, AS YOU

20:05.438 --> 20:07.273
SAID, THIS IS A KEY ISSUE FOR

20:07.273 --> 20:08.908
POLICY MAKERS TRYING TO DECIDE

20:08.908 --> 20:10.543
THE FATE OF MONETARY POLICY.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.478
SO, AT THE END OF LAST YEAR, THE

20:12.478 --> 20:14.947
FED... THEIR PROJECTIONS FOR

20:14.947 --> 20:16.148
WHERE THEIR INTEREST RATE, THE

20:16.148 --> 20:18.084
FEDERAL RESERVE'S RATE WAS GOING

20:18.084 --> 20:22.154
TO GO WAS ABOUT 1.1% BY THE END

20:22.154 --> 20:23.589
OF THIS YEAR.

20:23.589 --> 20:24.857
THEY'VE SINCE, IN THIS LAST

20:24.857 --> 20:26.158
MEETING, CUT THAT BACK DOWN TO

20:26.158 --> 20:27.693
0.6%.

20:27.693 --> 20:29.028
YOU THINK HALF A PERCENTAGE

20:29.028 --> 20:30.396
POINT, HOW BIG OF A DEAL IS

20:30.396 --> 20:30.963
THAT?

20:30.963 --> 20:32.398
ON WALL STREET, IT'S A HUGE

20:32.398 --> 20:33.599
DEAL, AND POTENTIALLY A BIG DEAL

20:33.599 --> 20:35.868
TO EVERYONE BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY,

20:35.868 --> 20:37.536
IF YOU... YOU KNOW, THOSE RATES

20:37.536 --> 20:38.704
INFLUENCE EVERYTHING--

20:38.704 --> 20:40.673
TREASURIES, AND TRICKLE ON DOWN

20:40.673 --> 20:41.774
TO MORTGAGES AND ALL SORTS OF

20:41.774 --> 20:42.675
COMMERCIAL LOANS.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.543
SO, IF INVESTORS BELIEVE I'M NOT

20:44.543 --> 20:46.679
GOING TO MAKE AS MUCH INVESTING

20:46.679 --> 20:47.713
IN THE DEBT MARKET GOING

20:47.713 --> 20:49.248
FORWARD, I MIGHT AS WELL TRY MY

20:49.248 --> 20:50.616
LUCK IN THE STOCK MARKET.

20:50.616 --> 20:52.118
THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY WE

20:52.118 --> 20:54.320
SAW THIS BIG JUMP ON WEDNESDAY

20:54.320 --> 20:55.488
AND FRIDAY IN THE STOCK MARKET

20:55.488 --> 20:56.956
IS BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THE RISK/

20:56.956 --> 20:58.724
RETURN LOOKS A LITTLE BIT BETTER

20:58.724 --> 20:59.925
IN THE STOCK MARKET COMPARED TO

20:59.925 --> 21:02.294
POTENTIAL LOWER INTEREST RATES

21:02.294 --> 21:03.362
IN THE DEBT MARKETS.

21:03.362 --> 21:04.096
>> Sreenivasan: AND THIS IS AT

21:04.096 --> 21:05.264
A TIME WHEN OUR CENTRAL BANK IS

21:05.264 --> 21:06.298
GOING ONE WAY ON THE DOLLAR

21:06.298 --> 21:07.800
VERSUS ALL THESE OTHER CENTRAL

21:07.800 --> 21:08.134
BANKS.

21:08.134 --> 21:08.968
THEY'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO

21:08.968 --> 21:09.602
SUPPRESS THEIR CURRENCY.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.203
SO, WE ALMOST CAN'T STOP THE

21:11.203 --> 21:12.872
POWER OF THE DOLLAR FROM GETTING

21:12.872 --> 21:13.339
BIGGER.

21:13.339 --> 21:14.507
>> RIGHT, AND IT'S REALLY SORT

21:14.507 --> 21:16.375
OF UNCHARTED TERRITORY.

21:16.375 --> 21:18.144
OBVIOUSLY, THE BOILERPLATE YOU

21:18.144 --> 21:19.178
READ EVERYWHERE ON WALL STREET

21:19.178 --> 21:21.313
IS "PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT

21:21.313 --> 21:22.481
GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS,"

21:22.481 --> 21:23.082
RIGHT?

21:23.082 --> 21:23.849
BUT WHAT DOES WALL STREET DO?

21:23.849 --> 21:25.351
THEY SPEND ALL THEIR TIME

21:25.351 --> 21:26.819
ANNUALIZING THE PAST TRYING TO

21:26.819 --> 21:27.987
FIGURE OUT WHAT IT'S GOING TO

21:27.987 --> 21:28.587
MEAN FOR THE FUTURE.

21:28.587 --> 21:30.322
IN THIS CASE, IT'S SO

21:30.322 --> 21:31.390
UNPRECEDENTED WHAT WE'VE

21:31.390 --> 21:33.192
SEEN, NOT ONLY THE FED LOWERING

21:33.192 --> 21:34.527
INTEREST RATES THE AS LOW AS

21:34.527 --> 21:36.162
THEY DID, BUYING TRILLIONS OF

21:36.162 --> 21:38.797
DOLLARS WORTH OF BONDS.

21:38.797 --> 21:39.865
AND NOW, THE OPPOSITE HAPPENING

21:39.865 --> 21:40.833
WHERE WE'RE SORT OF BACKING AWAY

21:40.833 --> 21:42.835
FROM THAT AND EUROPE IS DOING

21:42.835 --> 21:44.203
WHAT WE DID A FEW YEARS AGO;

21:44.203 --> 21:45.671
THEY'RE AGGRESSIVELY... THEY'RE

21:45.671 --> 21:46.739
GOING TO BUY MORE THAN $1

21:46.739 --> 21:47.673
TRILLION WORTH OF BONDS IN

21:47.673 --> 21:48.307
EUROPE.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.510
SO, IT'S TWO FORCES ACTING AT

21:51.510 --> 21:53.012
ONCE TO STRENGTHEN THE DOLLAR,

21:53.012 --> 21:54.647
AND IT'S VERY UNPRECEDENTED, AND

21:54.647 --> 21:55.848
IT'S... IT HAS A LOT OF

21:55.848 --> 21:57.616
PEOPLE... YOU KNOW, MAYBE NOT

21:57.616 --> 21:58.918
WORRIED BUT VERY SORT OF

21:58.918 --> 22:00.452
FLUMMOXED BECAUSE, AGAIN, THEY

22:00.452 --> 22:02.021
LOOK BACK TO THESE MODELS BASED

22:02.021 --> 22:04.023
ON THE PAST, AND THERE'S NO

22:04.023 --> 22:06.625
HISTORICAL RECORD TO BASE ANY

22:06.625 --> 22:07.893
PREDICTIONS ON.

22:07.893 --> 22:08.561
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

22:08.561 --> 22:09.328
MICHAEL REGAN OF BLOOMBERG NEWS,

22:09.328 --> 22:10.029
THANKS SO MUCH.

22:10.029 --> 22:10.963
>> THANK YOU.

22:13.232 --> 22:15.201
>>THIS IS PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND,

22:15.201 --> 22:16.769
SATURDAY.

22:22.241 --> 22:23.042
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW TO THE

22:23.042 --> 22:25.044
PASSING OF A REMARKABLE VETERAN.

22:25.044 --> 22:26.645
LUCY COFFEY DIED EARLIER THIS

22:26.645 --> 22:29.181
WEEK AT THE AGE OF 108.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.716
SHE HAD BEEN THE OLDEST LIVING

22:30.716 --> 22:32.284
FEMALE VETERAN.

22:32.284 --> 22:34.486
THE INDIANA NATIVE WAS 37 YEARS

22:34.486 --> 22:37.489
OLD WHEN, IN 1943, SHE ENLISTED

22:37.489 --> 22:39.191
IN THE WOMEN'S AUXILIARY ARMY

22:39.191 --> 22:40.826
CORPS, WHICH PERFORMED SUPPORT

22:40.826 --> 22:42.161
TASKS FOR THE ARMY.

22:42.161 --> 22:43.195
>> THESE WOMEN ARE TO TAKE OVER

22:43.195 --> 22:44.797
THE JOBS OF SOLDIERS BEHIND THE

22:44.797 --> 22:46.899
LINES AND HERE AT HOME.

22:46.899 --> 22:47.766
>> Sreenivasan: COFFEY SERVED IN

22:47.766 --> 22:49.068
THE PACIFIC THEATER, EARNING TWO

22:49.068 --> 22:50.436
BRONZE STARS AND RISING TO THE

22:50.436 --> 22:52.371
RANK OF SERGEANT BEFORE BEING

22:52.371 --> 22:54.740
DISCHARGED IN 1945.

22:54.740 --> 22:55.941
AFTER THE WAR, SHE DID CIVILIAN

22:55.941 --> 22:57.810
WORK IN THE ARMY IN JAPAN AND

22:57.810 --> 23:00.579
TEXAS FOR ANOTHER 26 YEARS.

23:00.579 --> 23:02.014
LAST JULY, COFFEY TRAVELED TO

23:02.014 --> 23:03.515
WASHINGTON, D.C., FROM HER HOME

23:03.515 --> 23:05.451
IN SAN ANTONIO AND MET WITH BOTH

23:05.451 --> 23:06.952
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN AND

23:06.952 --> 23:08.520
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

23:08.520 --> 23:12.725
>> IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU.

23:12.725 --> 23:13.325
>> THANK YOU.

23:13.325 --> 23:14.093
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

23:14.093 --> 23:14.793
(LAUGHTER)

23:14.793 --> 23:15.527
>> Sreenivasan: VICE PRESIDENT

23:15.527 --> 23:16.895
BIDEN JOKED ABOUT BEING UPSTAGED

23:16.895 --> 23:18.163
BY THE PRESIDENT.

23:18.163 --> 23:19.865
>> I'M VICE PRESIDENT; THE

23:19.865 --> 23:20.699
PRESIDENT COMES IN, AND

23:20.699 --> 23:22.001
EVERYBODY DROPS EVERYTHING.

23:22.001 --> 23:22.735
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

23:22.735 --> 23:23.769
>> (LAUGHS)

23:23.769 --> 23:24.536
>> Sreenivasan: COFFEY ALSO

23:24.536 --> 23:25.471
VISITED THE WOMEN'S MEMORIAL AT

23:25.471 --> 23:27.106
ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY AND

23:27.106 --> 23:28.374
THE NATIONAL WORLD WAR II

23:28.374 --> 23:29.742
MEMORIAL, WHERE SHE MET FELLOW

23:29.742 --> 23:31.410
VETERAN AND FORMER SENATOR BOB

23:31.410 --> 23:32.411
DOLE.

23:32.411 --> 23:35.547
COFFEY WAS ONE OF ABOUT 400,000

23:35.547 --> 23:36.782
WOMEN WHO SERVED IN UNIFORM

23:36.782 --> 23:38.617
DURING WORLD WAR II.

23:38.617 --> 23:39.985
THE JOBS THAT WOMEN HAVE BEEN

23:39.985 --> 23:40.919
ALLOWED TO DO HAVE DRAMATICALLY

23:40.919 --> 23:43.355
CHANGED SINCE THEN.

23:43.355 --> 23:45.124
IN JANUARY OF 2013, THEN-

23:45.124 --> 23:46.358
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE LEON

23:46.358 --> 23:48.160
PANETTA FORMALLY LIFTED RULES

23:48.160 --> 23:50.129
THAT EXCLUDED WOMEN FROM GROUND

23:50.129 --> 23:52.197
COMBAT, A CHANGE THAT RECOGNIZED

23:52.197 --> 23:53.732
THE DANGER THAT MANY WOMEN HAVE

23:53.732 --> 23:55.334
FACED IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ

23:55.334 --> 23:57.236
SINCE 2001.

23:57.236 --> 23:58.137
>> THEY'RE FIGHTING AND THEY'RE

23:58.137 --> 24:00.773
DYING TOGETHER.

24:00.773 --> 24:03.242
AND THE TIME HAS COME FOR OUR

24:03.242 --> 24:04.610
POLICIES TO RECOGNIZE THAT

24:04.610 --> 24:05.477
REALITY.

24:05.477 --> 24:06.278
>> Sreenivasan: TODAY, WOMEN

24:06.278 --> 24:08.414
REPRESENT ABOUT 9% OF LIVING

24:08.414 --> 24:09.248
VETERANS.

24:09.248 --> 24:10.482
BY THE MIDDLE OF THIS CENTURY,

24:10.482 --> 24:12.151
THAT NUMBER IS EXPECTED TO

24:12.151 --> 24:14.053
NEARLY DOUBLE.

24:22.261 --> 24:23.362
>> Sreenivasan: SOME MORE NEWS

24:23.362 --> 24:24.396
BEFORE WE LEAVE YOU TONIGHT.

24:24.396 --> 24:25.497
AUTHORITIES SAY THE MAN WHO

24:25.497 --> 24:27.366
ATTACKED SECURITY AGENTS AT NEW

24:27.366 --> 24:28.300
ORLEANS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

24:28.300 --> 24:30.602
LAST NIGHT WITH WASP SPRAY AND A

24:30.602 --> 24:32.671
MACHETE ALSO WAS CARRYING

24:32.671 --> 24:34.506
EXPLOSIVES, SIX MOLOTOV

24:34.506 --> 24:35.240
COCKTAILS.

24:35.240 --> 24:36.508
THE INCIDENT ENDED WHEN POLICE

24:36.508 --> 24:37.876
SHOT AND WOUNDED HIM.

24:37.876 --> 24:39.845
AND IF YOUR N.C.A.A. BASKETBALL

24:39.845 --> 24:41.246
BRACKET HAS BEEN BUSTED, YOU ARE

24:41.246 --> 24:41.880
NOT ALONE.

24:41.880 --> 24:42.781
YOU HAVE COMPANY.

24:42.781 --> 24:44.917
ESPN SAYS MORE THAN 11 MILLION

24:44.917 --> 24:46.185
SPORTS FANS SIGNED UP FOR ITS

24:46.185 --> 24:47.720
TOURNAMENT CHALLENGE, AND, GOING

24:47.720 --> 24:49.088
INTO DAY THREE OF PLAY TODAY,

24:49.088 --> 24:51.090
ONLY ONE PERSON WAS STILL

24:51.090 --> 24:52.658
PERFECT IN THEIR PREDICTIONS.

24:52.658 --> 24:53.425
THAT'S IT FOR THIS EDITION OF

24:53.425 --> 24:54.360
PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

24:54.360 --> 24:55.594
I'M HARI SREENIVASAN.

24:55.594 --> 24:57.129
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
