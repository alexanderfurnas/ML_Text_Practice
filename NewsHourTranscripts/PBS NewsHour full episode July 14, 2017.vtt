JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.833 --> 00:07.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.833 --> 00:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
new revelations about a former
Soviet counterintelligence

00:10.900 --> 00:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
officer joining the meeting
between Donald Trump Jr.
and a Russian lawyer.

00:17.833 --> 00:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, we continue our series
Inside Putin's Russia with a
look at the complex relationship

00:22.866 --> 00:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between the U.S. and Russia,
and what could change
under a Trump presidency.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it's Friday.

00:29.966 --> 00:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and David
Brooks are here to analyze
a full week of news.

00:36.066 --> 00:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plus, we head to Denmark, where
music lovers follow the sound
of improvisation to the world's

00:41.900 --> 00:43.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
largest jazz festival.

00:43.966 --> 00:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CURTIS STIGERS, Musician: We
are the red headed stepchild
of the music business.

00:47.933 --> 00:51.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We are a niche market.

00:51.400 --> 00:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the people that love jazz,
they're willing to pay, they're
willing to suffer a little

00:57.166 --> 00:58.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bit to hear this music.

00:58.666 --> 01:03.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:06.366 --> 01:09.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:09.133 --> 01:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The week is
ending the way it began,
with new disclosures
about the president's

01:18.766 --> 01:21.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
son and his meeting
with a Russian lawyer.

01:21.700 --> 01:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It turns out at least one
more person was at that
session than previously known.

01:26.666 --> 01:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage.

01:28.666 --> 01:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: President Trump
returned from his quick Paris
trip to face new questions about

01:35.866 --> 01:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether his campaign
sought damaging information
on Hillary Clinton from
the Russian government.

01:40.533 --> 01:42.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Among the uncertainties?

01:42.300 --> 01:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How many people were at the June
2016 meeting at Trump Tower?

01:46.333 --> 01:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, a new name emerged,
Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-born
Washington lobbyist and Soviet

01:53.100 --> 01:55.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
army veteran.

01:55.233 --> 01:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He met with Donald Trump Jr.,
Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner,
campaign chairman Paul Manafort,

02:01.166 --> 02:05.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Russian lawyer Natalia
Veselnitskaya, music
promoter Rob Goldstone,
an acquaintance of

02:05.966 --> 02:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the younger Trump who
helped set up the session,
and an interpreter.

02:10.533 --> 02:13.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump Jr. had not
disclosed the additional people.

02:13.366 --> 02:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN HANNITY, Host, "Hannity":
So, as far as you know, as far
as this incident is concerned,

02:15.666 --> 02:17.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this is all of it?

02:17.100 --> 02:17.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP JR., Son of Donald
Trump: This is everything.

02:17.900 --> 02:19.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is everything.

02:19.866 --> 02:23.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It's also not
clear just when President
Trump was told of the meeting.

02:25.666 --> 02:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This week, he told Reuters
that he had only learned of it
just two or three days before

02:28.266 --> 02:30.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

02:30.233 --> 02:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But aboard Air Force One on
his way to Paris, the told
reporters, in fact, maybe it was

02:34.066 --> 02:36.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
mentioned at some point.

02:36.033 --> 02:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kushner has revised his security
clearance disclosure form
at least three times to add

02:42.066 --> 02:45.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as many of 100 more
foreign contacts.

02:45.833 --> 02:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's drawing the ire
of Democrats like House
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.

02:49.433 --> 02:51.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:51.466 --> 02:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), House
Minority Leader: I also called
for the revoking of the security

02:53.733 --> 02:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
clearance of Jared Kushner.

02:56.733 --> 03:00.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's absolutely ridiculous that
he should have that clearance.

03:00.866 --> 03:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And Mr. Trump is
adding to his legal team.

03:05.600 --> 03:09.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Washington attorney Ty Cobb
becomes special counsel to
the president and will oversee

03:09.966 --> 03:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the legal and media response
to the Russia investigation.

03:14.333 --> 03:16.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm John Yang.

03:16.766 --> 03:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For more, we're
now joined by Julie Pace.

03:20.333 --> 03:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's the Washington bureau
chief for the Associated Press,
and she took part in a phone

03:25.100 --> 03:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conversation with Rinat
Akhmetshin earlier today.

03:28.933 --> 03:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Julie, thank you very
much for talking with us.

03:31.433 --> 03:34.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, Julie, what is known
about Rinat Akhmetshin?

03:34.666 --> 03:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIE PACE, Associated Press:
Well, Rinat is a person who
is actually fairly well-known

03:40.266 --> 03:42.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Washington.

03:42.366 --> 03:46.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a lobbyist who has worked
on issues with ties to Russia,
a bit of a character, a bit

03:49.400 --> 03:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a fixer on these
types of issues, not this
sort of backroom, shady
character who doesn't

03:55.200 --> 03:57.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have a profile.

03:57.366 --> 03:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you work in these circles
in Washington, he's probably
someone that you have run in

03:59.833 --> 04:01.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to.

04:01.033 --> 04:03.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's been on
Capitol Hill before.

04:03.033 --> 04:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, despite that, it is
certainly unique that he would
end up in a conference room

04:08.666 --> 04:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at Trump Tower in the middle
of a presidential campaign.

04:11.666 --> 04:16.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I heard the word
fixer associated with his name.

04:16.266 --> 04:19.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why is his name
surfacing only now?

04:19.000 --> 04:21.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We learned about this
meeting days ago.

04:21.066 --> 04:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIE PACE: That is the perfect
question on this, why now?

04:24.700 --> 04:29.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Why is it that we have
had so many different
explanations about the
purpose of this meeting

04:29.433 --> 04:32.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the participants
of this meeting?

04:32.300 --> 04:36.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's kind of baffling if
you're thinking about this
from a political strategy.

04:36.966 --> 04:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is sort of politics 101,
that if you are in a crisis, if
there is something controversial

04:41.700 --> 04:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's happened, it's best to
get all of the information out.

04:44.900 --> 04:49.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Take the hit in one lump, as
opposed to dripping that out,
in this case, over the course of

04:49.766 --> 04:52.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a week.

04:52.300 --> 04:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there has been no
explanation as to why
we're just finding out
that he was a participant,

04:55.100 --> 04:58.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other than the fact that he
was willing to get on the phone
with us today and disclose

04:58.700 --> 05:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this information and talk
to us at some length.

05:01.233 --> 05:05.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it
sounds like now he is
talking to the press.

05:05.700 --> 05:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there anything more to be
learned about this meeting
than what's already said?

05:08.933 --> 05:11.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIE PACE: I think there is.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The big thing that all of
the participants have said is
that in the end, nothing came

05:16.500 --> 05:18.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out of this meeting.

05:18.533 --> 05:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the things that Rinat
told us today, though, is that
the Russian lawyer who was

05:21.433 --> 05:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the meeting actually showed
up with some documents in hand,
and they were in a plastic

05:25.533 --> 05:27.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
folder.

05:27.066 --> 05:29.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He professed to not know the
content of those documents.

05:29.766 --> 05:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that that's one
question that we need to answer.

05:31.900 --> 05:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What were those documents, who
were they specifically given to,
who took them out of the room?

05:35.833 --> 05:40.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, more broadly, I
think that it's worth
pressing participants
in this meeting about

05:42.000 --> 05:44.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whether anything did
come out of this.

05:44.500 --> 05:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Given the fact that
the explanations have
changed so much, I really
don't think we should

05:47.433 --> 05:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be taking explanations on
face value at this point.

05:50.200 --> 05:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Julie,
there's also this question now
-- and we heard it mentioned

05:53.100 --> 05:58.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the report -- when
President Trump himself
learned about the meeting.

06:00.133 --> 06:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Initially, it was that he had
just learned about it a few
days ago, but then I guess

06:02.200 --> 06:05.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he said something different
in that conversation
with reporters.

06:05.766 --> 06:10.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIE PACE: I think this is --
again, timelines keep shifting
when it comes to this meeting.

06:12.700 --> 06:16.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What the president initially
said is that he only knew about
it two or three days before.

06:18.766 --> 06:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the reasons why there are
so many questions about this,
though, is that Jared Kushner

06:24.633 --> 06:28.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and his advisers said
that this is something
that they discovered
and put on a disclosure

06:28.766 --> 06:30.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
form a few weeks ago.

06:30.900 --> 06:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this was known to people
in the White House prior to
this past weekend, when the

06:34.700 --> 06:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reporting started to come out.

06:36.733 --> 06:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And given the closeness of the
president to his family, and
given the fact that the Russian

06:40.700 --> 06:45.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
investigations and every
little detail about
these investigations
is so critical right

06:47.666 --> 06:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now, it is hard to imagine that
this is something that would
be kept from the president for

06:51.366 --> 06:52.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
so long.

06:52.933 --> 06:54.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So,
finally, Julie, you
mentioned Jared Kushner.

06:54.900 --> 06:59.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There have been a number of
stories this week about turmoil,
ongoing turmoil inside the

07:01.133 --> 07:05.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
White House, fingers pointing
in different directions, and
some of the White House staffing

07:06.133 --> 07:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
being upset with Jared Kushner.

07:06.933 --> 07:08.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is that about?

07:08.966 --> 07:10.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIE PACE: Well, this has
become a bit of pattern
for this White House.

07:10.966 --> 07:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When something goes
wrong, you start having
people turn on each other.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The finger-pointing
gets pretty intense.

07:15.600 --> 07:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in this case, you have a
situation where you have someone
like Jared Kushner, who is

07:20.333 --> 07:24.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a senior adviser to the
president, but operates
in pretty rarefied
territory because he's

07:24.866 --> 07:26.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
also family.

07:26.866 --> 07:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is the one person whose
name has come up in relation to
the Russia investigations who

07:31.666 --> 07:34.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is currently sitting
in the West Wing.

07:34.566 --> 07:39.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for some of the folks who
are in there right now, the fact
that he is in that situation

07:39.533 --> 07:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and still remains a
protected adviser, it's
pretty irritating to them.

07:45.933 --> 07:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they worry about their
interactions with him.

07:48.300 --> 07:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whenever you have a special
counsel investigation
that revolves around
the White House, you

07:50.733 --> 07:55.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have staffers that have
to get lawyers, staffers
that are pretty --
staffers that are fairly

07:55.166 --> 07:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
well-paid having to get
pretty expensive lawyers.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

07:58.433 --> 08:00.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JULIE PACE: This is not
a comfortable situation
for anybody in there.

08:00.566 --> 08:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Jared Kushner, given his
relationship and his position
in the West Wing, is taking

08:05.500 --> 08:07.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a lot of the heat internally.

08:07.966 --> 08:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meantime,
we have seen some
Democrats on Capitol
Hill, some of them saying

08:10.333 --> 08:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he should step down, others
saying he should have his
security clearance taken away.

08:14.966 --> 08:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Julie Pace with the Associated
Press, we thank you.

08:17.433 --> 08:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIE PACE: Thank you, Judy.

of Islamist militants.

08:45.333 --> 08:50.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Five policemen were killed in
a shooting south of Cairo near
some of the country's famed

08:50.866 --> 08:52.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pyramids.

08:52.900 --> 08:56.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Later, two German tourists

08:59.066 --> 09:03.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Jerusalem, Arab attackers
struck at Israeli police today
in one of the holiest sites of

09:04.500 --> 09:06.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
both Islam and Judaism.

09:06.666 --> 09:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Three gunmen killed two
police officers before
being shot dead themselves.

09:11.133 --> 09:14.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret
Warner has the story.

09:14.400 --> 09:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: A security
camera captured the opening
of the assault, gunmen coming

09:19.133 --> 09:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from behind to attack
two Israeli officers,
then, a running gun
battle, seen on cell phone

09:25.333 --> 09:27.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
video.

09:27.333 --> 09:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police gave chase, and one
attacker jumped up and lunged
at an officer before being shot

09:31.533 --> 09:33.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
himself.

09:33.233 --> 09:35.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MAN: We can confirm that
there was a terrorist
attack that took place.

09:35.533 --> 09:40.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Three terrorists used an
automatic weapon and a knife
in and around in the area.

09:40.166 --> 09:45.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: All this at
the holiest site in Jerusalem,
the Temple Mount to Jews, the

09:46.033 --> 09:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Noble Sanctuary to Muslims.

09:48.033 --> 09:52.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The ancient complex includes
the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa
Mosque, and the Western Wall

09:53.666 --> 09:56.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
surrounding part of it.

09:56.100 --> 10:00.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
All three assailants
were identified as Arab
citizens of Israel.

10:00.500 --> 10:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Relatives say they
were devout Muslims who
frequented the area often.

10:07.533 --> 10:10.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Israel police quickly closed
the site, a move rarely taken
since the Six-Day War in 1967,

10:13.433 --> 10:18.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when the Israelis captured
East Jerusalem and its
Old City from Jordan.

10:19.766 --> 10:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Previous closures have provoked
rioting by Palestinians.

10:23.033 --> 10:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Muslims had to pray
outside the shrine after the
closure canceled noon prayers at

10:29.066 --> 10:31.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Al-Aqsa.

10:31.066 --> 10:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The grand mufti of Jerusalem
had called for Palestinians
to defy the closure.

10:34.800 --> 10:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We
have to enter the mosque to
attend the Friday prayers.

10:39.466 --> 10:44.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Al-Aqsa Mosque is our mosque,
so it is not allowed, under any
circumstances, to be prevented

10:45.366 --> 10:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from reaching the mosque.

10:47.066 --> 10:51.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Israeli
police detained the
Mufti for several hours.

10:51.066 --> 10:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Palestinian President Mahmoud
Abbas telephoned Israeli Prime
Minister Netanyahu to condemn

10:56.700 --> 10:57.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the attack.

10:57.966 --> 11:00.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But he also called for
reopening the holy site.

11:00.833 --> 11:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Seeking to ease tensions,
Netanyahu quickly issued a
statement that the status quo on

11:05.833 --> 11:09.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
access to the site
will be preserved.

11:09.200 --> 11:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the leader of the militant
Islamic Jihad movement in
Gaza City welcomed the attack.

11:16.066 --> 11:19.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
Jerusalem is an Arab and Islamic
land, so when the Zionist

11:21.200 --> 11:23.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
enemy seeks to turn it into
a Jewish temple, one of our
people will come out and stand

11:23.900 --> 11:27.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in the face of this
plan and confront it
as it happened today.

11:27.133 --> 11:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: In the end,
Israelis and Palestinians
were left to bury their dead

11:33.700 --> 11:37.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
amid fears that the
attack is a harbinger of
more violence to come.

11:37.600 --> 11:40.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Margaret Warner.

11:40.733 --> 11:45.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in
this country, the U.S.
Justice Department says
that it will appeal

11:45.133 --> 11:50.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
directly to the Supreme
Court, after a federal
judge dealt another blow
to President Trump's

11:50.766 --> 11:52.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
travel ban.

11:52.033 --> 11:54.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The judge in Hawaii
ruled last night.

11:54.100 --> 11:59.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said the list of bona
fide relationships that allow
entry to the U.S. must include

11:59.900 --> 12:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
grandparents, among others.

12:02.033 --> 12:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A federal appeals court ruled
today that county commissioners
in North Carolina violated the

12:07.933 --> 12:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Constitution by starting
meetings with Christian prayers.

12:10.933 --> 12:15.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Fourth Circuit case
is also likely headed
for the Supreme Court.

12:15.166 --> 12:19.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The ruling says prayers
at public meetings are not
inherently unconstitutional.

12:19.466 --> 12:24.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But, in this case,
no prayers from other
faiths were permitted.

12:26.933 --> 12:29.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump today
pushed Senate Republicans
today to approve a
revamped health care bill.

12:31.800 --> 12:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a tweet, he said -- quote --
"Republican senators must come
through as they have promised."

12:34.600 --> 12:39.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Already, Rand Paul and
Susan Collins have said
that they will vote no.

12:39.166 --> 12:43.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That means GOP leaders cannot
afford to lose another vote.

12:43.566 --> 12:48.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president spent much of
his day taking part in France's
celebration of independence.

12:50.633 --> 12:53.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%

Macron at a military
parade in Paris, complete

with a flyover.

13:03.600 --> 13:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Macron thanked the U.S. for
its role in what the French
commonly call the great war.

13:09.766 --> 13:13.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EMMANUEL MACRON, French
President (through

also found sure allies,

13:14.566 --> 13:16.166 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
friends who have
come to our aid.

13:16.166 --> 13:18.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The United States of
America is one of them.

13:18.633 --> 13:20.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That is why nothing
will ever separate us.

13:20.900 --> 13:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The presence today of the
American president by my side,
Mr. Donald Trump, and his wife

13:25.033 --> 13:27.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is a sign of friendship
which has endured time.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Macron
later traveled to Nice,
France, to mark one year
since a terror attack

there killed 86 people.

in Canada.

13:42.500 --> 13:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He became dehydrated yesterday
while working on a project
for Habitat for Humanity.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

Manitoba, smiling and
wearing work clothes.

13:52.733 --> 13:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mr. Carter is 92 years old.

13:56.133 --> 14:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

a new record.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 38 points.

the legacy of Liu Xiaobo, the

more.

14:46.100 --> 14:49.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now we continue our series
Inside Putin's Russia.

14:49.766 --> 14:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There may be no more
consequential relationship
for the United States
than with Russia.

14:56.866 --> 15:00.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Both nations possess
world-ending capacity,
and may be at the most
critical moment since

15:01.000 --> 15:03.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the end of the Cold War.

15:03.133 --> 15:07.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tonight, we explore the

NICK SCHIFRIN: On Russia's most
patriotic holiday, Russians
of all ages remember what

15:26.666 --> 15:28.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they consider their
finest moment.

15:28.766 --> 15:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

Kiriginov Naimovich's

KIRIGINOV NAIMOVICH, Russia

15:45.633 --> 15:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are waiting for you to

15:47.600 --> 15:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: For Russians,
it's the U.S. who's
unwilling to come halfway.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many here believe President
Trump wants to improve things,
but is being blocked by what

Dimitry Schyukin calls the
American establishment.

15:58.966 --> 16:03.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIMITRY SCHYUKIN, Russia

Trump wants to do
something, but he's forced

to follow the general
political line.

ALEXANDER DUGIN, TV Host: Donald

candidate of the Republican

Party.

16:13.466 --> 16:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Perhaps
nobody expressed more hope
in Trump than Alexander
Dugin, a right-wing

16:15.400 --> 16:18.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TV firebrand and philosopher
who's helped inspire
the Kremlin's ideology.

16:18.966 --> 16:22.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALEXANDER DUGIN: Really,
we supported Trumpism.

16:22.266 --> 16:24.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We supported agenda.

16:27.966 --> 16:30.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
meddle internationally.

16:30.133 --> 16:33.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALEXANDER DUGIN: We
supported this choice
of anti-establishment
conservative American

16:35.133 --> 16:37.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
revolution.

16:37.233 --> 16:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: That changed
when President Trump ordered a
missile strike on Russia ally

16:40.133 --> 16:43.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Syria, and said he
felt must respond to a
chemical weapons attack.

16:43.700 --> 16:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of
the United States: As long as
America stands for justice, then

16:49.866 --> 16:52.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
peace and harmony will
in the end prevail.

16:52.700 --> 16:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALEXANDER DUGIN: We trusted not
in Trump as pro-Russian figure.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We trusted in Trump realist.

17:00.133 --> 17:01.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we are disappointed.

17:01.933 --> 17:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The
disappointment and
tensions have been growing.

17:04.433 --> 17:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last month, over the Baltic
Sea, a Russian jet flew within
five feet of a U.S. Air Force

17:08.400 --> 17:10.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
reconnaissance plane.

17:10.466 --> 17:14.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That same week, a NATO
jet shadowed the Russian
defense minister's
plane and a Russian jet

17:14.033 --> 17:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
came up and rocked its wings
to demonstrate it was armed.

17:21.466 --> 17:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, the Obama
administration accused
Russia of hacking the
election, and then seized

17:22.700 --> 17:26.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russian properties and
increased sanctions.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
All of that has led to
Russian frustration.

17:28.633 --> 17:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maria Zakharova is the
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman.

17:30.633 --> 17:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIA ZAKHAROVA, Russian Foreign
Ministry Spokeswoman: We were
trying to establish normal

17:34.433 --> 17:35.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
relationship, normal.

17:35.666 --> 17:38.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do you know this word,
normal relationship?

17:38.500 --> 17:40.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is wrong with this?

17:40.500 --> 17:44.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: President Putin
and I have been discussing
various things, and I think it's

17:45.466 --> 17:47.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going very well.

17:47.433 --> 17:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Last
week, the U.S. took steps
toward normalization.

17:49.133 --> 17:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Presidents Trump and Putin
announced a deal on Syria.

17:52.133 --> 17:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both presidents called their
meeting the first step to
warming the relationship.

17:55.366 --> 17:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through translator):
If we develop our relations in

17:59.500 --> 18:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the same way, there is every
reason to believe that we would
be able to at least partially

18:05.866 --> 18:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
restore the level of
interaction that we need.

18:07.233 --> 18:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The
president echoed that hope.

18:09.433 --> 18:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Sunday, he tweeted he
wouldn't dwell on 2016 hacking,
and wrote, "Now was the time

18:13.666 --> 18:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to move forward in working
constructively with Russia."

18:18.033 --> 18:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is not the language other
Trump administration officials
use about Russia on Syria.

18:22.233 --> 18:26.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NIKKI HALEY, U.S. Ambassador
to the United Nations: How
many more children have to die

18:26.300 --> 18:27.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
before Russia cares?

18:27.500 --> 18:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: On Ukraine.

18:29.566 --> 18:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary
of State: We do call on Russia
to exercise influence over

18:33.033 --> 18:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the separatists in the
region, whom they do hold
complete control over.

18:37.733 --> 18:39.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And
on Putin personally.

18:39.766 --> 18:43.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE POMPEO, CIA Director:
This is a man for whom veracity
doesn't translate into English.

18:43.266 --> 18:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The one senior
administration official who's
declined to echo that criticism

18:47.433 --> 18:50.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is Donald Trump, as
candidate and president.

18:50.133 --> 18:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Wouldn't it
be a great thing if we could
actually get along with Russia?

18:52.866 --> 18:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Wouldn't that be a good thing?

18:53.866 --> 18:54.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

18:54.866 --> 18:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I respect Putin.

18:56.533 --> 18:58.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He is a strong leader,
I can tell you that,
unlike what we have.

18:58.800 --> 18:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have a pathetic leader.

18:59.833 --> 19:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION: Putin is a killer.

19:01.133 --> 19:03.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: There
are a lot of killers.

19:03.066 --> 19:04.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have a lot of killers.

19:04.300 --> 19:06.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What, you think our
country is so innocent?

19:06.833 --> 19:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And last
week in Warsaw, President
Trump once again questioned
the U.S. intelligence

19:13.433 --> 19:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
community's unanimous
assessment that Russia
hacked the 2016 election.

19:14.866 --> 19:17.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: I
think it was Russia.

19:17.266 --> 19:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think it was probably
other people and/or
countries, and I see
nothing wrong with that

19:23.633 --> 19:24.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
statement.

19:24.733 --> 19:25.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Nobody really knows.

19:25.733 --> 19:27.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

19:27.733 --> 19:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER (D), Virginia:
At the very least, giving the
president all the benefit of the

19:28.966 --> 19:31.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
doubt, this is very
bizarre behavior.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Democratic
Senator Mark Warner is
the vice chairman of
the Senate Intelligence

19:33.900 --> 19:34.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Committee.

19:34.900 --> 19:36.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

19:36.900 --> 19:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER: We are seeking
to determine if there is an
actual fire, but there's clearly

19:40.066 --> 19:42.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a lot of smoke.

19:42.100 --> 19:44.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Warner is helping
lead the Senate's investigation
into Russia's interference

19:44.433 --> 19:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the 2016 election and
whether President Trump or his
campaign colluded with Russia's

19:48.966 --> 19:50.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
attempts to sway the election.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We first interviewed
him three weeks ago.

19:52.200 --> 19:54.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

19:54.300 --> 19:58.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER: It is very strange
that any presidential candidate,
and in particular a Republican

19:59.733 --> 20:04.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
presidential candidate,
would parrot so much
of the Russian line.

20:04.500 --> 20:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Republican
Senator James Lankford is also
on the Intelligence Committee.

20:08.166 --> 20:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In some ways, has President
Trump aligned himself with the
ideals expressed by Russia?

20:12.833 --> 20:15.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:15.333 --> 20:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD (R),
Oklahoma: Yes, he's
pushing out some messages
that are consistent with

20:16.133 --> 20:18.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Kremlin policies.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would tell you, at every
opportunity that I have, I
try to articulate very clearly

20:20.200 --> 20:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there's no question that the
Russians were trying to hack
into our elections, and there's

20:22.666 --> 20:25.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no question that we should
have a strong NATO and that the
United States should be a part

20:25.766 --> 20:28.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of that NATO alliance.

20:28.333 --> 20:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Do you
believe that he's not
echoing that because the
Russians have compromising

20:30.666 --> 20:31.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
material on him?

20:31.666 --> 20:32.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:32.666 --> 20:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK WARNER: I don't know.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I hope not.

20:35.866 --> 20:40.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the goal of this
investigation is to not
only reconfirm Russian
intervention and explain

20:44.133 --> 20:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that to the American public,
but to also see if there were
any contacts between the Trump

20:48.300 --> 20:50.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
campaign and the Russians.

20:50.333 --> 20:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And just this
week, we learned that, last
June, Donald Trump Jr. met with

20:53.566 --> 20:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya
and lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin,
both believed to have ties

20:59.466 --> 21:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the Russian government.

21:00.700 --> 21:02.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I spoke to Senator
Warner again last night.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:04.033 --> 21:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER: This indication
that they were willing to accept
this information from Russians

21:06.933 --> 21:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and it was part of an overall
Russian government effort to
help Trump and to hurt Clinton,

21:13.900 --> 21:16.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think this is the first
time the American public has
seen that in black and white.

21:16.666 --> 21:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Much of this
town has been worried about
Trump and Russia since he became

21:20.700 --> 21:22.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

21:22.733 --> 21:25.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Current administration officials
tell "NewsHour" the White House
drafted an executive order

21:25.066 --> 21:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that would have lifted sanctions
imposed on Russia over Ukraine.

21:28.566 --> 21:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senior administration officials
and the intelligence community
successfully lobbied against it.

21:32.833 --> 21:36.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, this spring,
senators passed a bill
that would restrict the
president's ability to

21:36.533 --> 21:39.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lift those sanctions.

21:39.100 --> 21:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bill's not yet a law,
but it was designed to
be a nearly unanimous
message to the president

21:42.233 --> 21:43.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and to Putin.

21:43.233 --> 21:45.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:45.766 --> 21:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: We
believe strongly that
what Russia continues to
do to be able to threaten

21:47.700 --> 21:51.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ukraine, threaten its neighbors,
threaten NATO, to continue
to pry into not only our

21:51.366 --> 21:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
elections, but other
elections, is destabilizing,
and it demands a response.

21:55.166 --> 21:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have yet to have a
consequence to what they
did in the election time.

21:58.633 --> 22:00.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And they should.

22:00.233 --> 22:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In some ways, the
president has fallen in line.

22:02.333 --> 22:06.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On Sunday, he tweeted he
wouldn't lift sanctions
on Russia over Ukraine
until Ukrainian and

22:06.733 --> 22:08.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Syrian problems are solved.

22:08.700 --> 22:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And last week, he also
endorsed Article 5,
NATO's collective defense.

22:11.800 --> 22:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: The United States
has demonstrated not merely with
words, but with its actions,

22:18.700 --> 22:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we stand firmly
behind Article 5, the
mutual defense commitment.

22:25.233 --> 22:29.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: That convinces
many in Moscow that the U.S.
establishment is making sure

22:30.133 --> 22:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the U.S. remains anti-Russian.

22:32.400 --> 22:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dmitri Trenin is a former Soviet
army colonel who directs the
Carnegie Center in Moscow.

22:35.933 --> 22:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DMITRI TRENIN, Former Soviet
Army Colonel: The United States
has been, remains, and will

22:39.566 --> 22:44.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be the power that defines common
Western, i.e., U.S.-driven,
foreign, defense and security

22:48.300 --> 22:50.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
policy.

22:50.333 --> 22:52.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And given that,
Trenin says the U.S. remains
Russia's main adversary.

22:52.666 --> 22:55.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And Russia is simply
targeting the U.S. with
whatever tool it can.

22:55.733 --> 23:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DMITRI TRENIN: I'm sure that
the Russians have been looking
at things, have been hacking

23:00.500 --> 23:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things, have been using the
material that they have hacked.

23:04.233 --> 23:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why are you surprised
that you are being hacked?

23:09.033 --> 23:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a method of espionage.

23:11.100 --> 23:13.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is what you do.

23:13.100 --> 23:15.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
If you can do it, do it.

23:15.066 --> 23:18.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you can protect against
that, protect against
it, but don't whine.

23:18.500 --> 23:20.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But it
goes one step further.

23:20.733 --> 23:24.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Many in Russia look at
Washington's turbulence
and see a U.S. they'd
considered strong and

23:24.500 --> 23:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
unified suddenly weakened.

23:26.700 --> 23:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they're exploiting that
weakness in the U.S. foundation.

23:28.800 --> 23:31.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALEXANDER DUGIN: It
is not so coherent.

23:31.300 --> 23:32.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is not so stable.

23:32.766 --> 23:35.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it is vulnerable,
I would say.

23:35.800 --> 23:37.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we seen that.

23:37.700 --> 23:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have seen what we needed
to see, vulnerability
of American society.

23:43.700 --> 23:46.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Nick
now joins me in our studio.

23:46.100 --> 23:48.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, Nick, that sounds
pretty foreboding.

23:48.166 --> 23:51.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: I think it should
sound foreboding, because it is.

23:51.466 --> 23:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think usual Russians really do
see a vulnerability in the U.S.

23:55.733 --> 23:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They see a lack of unity.

23:57.800 --> 24:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when talking frankly to
people who actually know what
they're talking about in Russia,

24:03.900 --> 24:05.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's not so much denial
that they did it.

24:05.933 --> 24:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is that we did it in the
United States last year,
and we will keep doing it.

24:12.033 --> 24:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, from talking
to them, is there any doubt
that they are going to keep

24:13.733 --> 24:15.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on doing it?

24:15.766 --> 24:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: No, I don't think
so, mostly because they don't
feel like they paid a price.

24:18.533 --> 24:23.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Russian government doesn't
feel like the United States
government really penalized

24:23.266 --> 24:25.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
them for what
happened last year.

24:25.266 --> 24:30.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, frankly, a lot of
American officials here in
Washington agree with that.

24:32.233 --> 24:34.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They fault the Obama
administration and the
Trump administration
for simply not following

24:34.566 --> 24:38.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through on some of the things
that they feel like Russia
should have paid for what they

24:38.866 --> 24:40.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
did last year.

24:40.366 --> 24:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, you and I
talked a little bit about this.

24:43.233 --> 24:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You talked to so many experts.

24:44.733 --> 24:46.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is there hope?

24:46.466 --> 24:49.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Is there a glimmer of
a belief anywhere that
this can be repaired?

24:49.633 --> 24:54.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: There
are analysts in Moscow
who think the only thing
we can hope is that

24:55.633 --> 24:57.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we avoid war.

24:57.133 --> 24:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, there are some people
who are that dire right now.

24:59.166 --> 25:03.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the people who are
trying to make it better and
hope it can make it better are

25:03.766 --> 25:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doing what basically President
Trump and Putin did earlier in
that story we showed, trying

25:08.600 --> 25:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to find a lowest common
denominator, if you will, trying
to find a corner of Syria, for

25:15.633 --> 25:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
example, where they can work
together and use that very
small deal to expand perhaps

25:21.400 --> 25:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into greater Syria, to
expand into a kind of
warming of the relationship.

25:24.133 --> 25:29.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And certainly the people
who understand that
this relationship has
to get better, that's

25:30.000 --> 25:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what they're trying to do.

25:31.500 --> 25:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, looking for
places to make that happen.

25:34.300 --> 25:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Absolutely.

25:35.566 --> 25:36.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nick
Schifrin, thank you.

25:36.500 --> 25:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is a remarkable series.

25:37.300 --> 25:38.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

25:38.300 --> 25:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Thanks very much.

25:40.333 --> 25:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you call
watch all of Nick's reports from
this week's series on our Web

25:43.233 --> 25:47.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
site.

25:47.500 --> 25:52.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's PBS.org/NewsHour.

25:56.066 --> 26:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate
Liu Xiaobo died yesterday in
China of liver cancer after

26:02.866 --> 26:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years behind bars
for his efforts to
democratize his homeland.

26:06.800 --> 26:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Liu's work and his
plight brought him global
attention, work that enraged
the Chinese government.

26:13.200 --> 26:15.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
His death brought an
outpouring of tributes.

26:15.866 --> 26:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham has this look
at Liu Xiaobo's life and legacy.

26:20.466 --> 26:25.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: From Hong
Kong to Sydney and around the
world, there have been vigils

26:26.733 --> 26:29.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
overnight and today.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Kamm runs a human rights
organization based in San
Francisco that advocates for

26:33.133 --> 26:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
political prisoners in China.

26:34.733 --> 26:37.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN KAMM, The Dui
Hua Foundation: A
great loss for China.

26:37.933 --> 26:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Someone who was committed to
nonviolent change is gone.

26:44.666 --> 26:46.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it's a great
loss for the world.

26:46.733 --> 26:50.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: He'd been
released from prison on medical
leave only a few weeks earlier,

26:50.766 --> 26:53.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but supporters say he
was denied proper care.

26:53.200 --> 26:57.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WU'ER KAIXI, Exiled
Chinese dissident:
The Chinese government
brutally killed my teacher

26:57.966 --> 27:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and one of the most
genuine and conscientious
Chinese in the world.

27:02.266 --> 27:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would like to ask the world,
world leaders and people around
the world, which side are

27:08.733 --> 27:10.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you on?

27:10.633 --> 27:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: President
Trump praised Liu in a
statement yesterday, calling him

27:12.833 --> 27:16.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a poet, scholar, and
courageous advocate.

27:16.800 --> 27:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China's government flatly
denies Liu was mistreated,
and, today, a spokesman
condemned the international

27:22.400 --> 27:24.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
criticisms.

27:24.800 --> 27:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GENG SHUANG, Chinese Foreign
Ministry Spokesperson
(through translator):
Those statements are

27:26.500 --> 27:30.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
interference to China's
judicial sovereignty
and domestic affairs.

27:30.433 --> 27:34.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Liu Xiaobo is a criminal who was
put on trial by China's laws.

27:34.266 --> 27:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For decades,
Liu was one of the Chinese
government's most outspoken

27:38.533 --> 27:40.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
critics.

27:40.566 --> 27:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He rose to prominence during the
1989 Tiananmen Square protests,
returning from the U.S. to

27:45.700 --> 27:47.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
support the original
student demonstrators.

27:47.900 --> 27:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After troops opened fire killing
hundreds, perhaps thousands,
Liu helped negotiate safe

27:53.766 --> 27:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
passage for the survivors.

27:56.300 --> 28:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He remained in China
despite detention and
constant surveillance and
continued his political

28:00.933 --> 28:03.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
advocacy.

28:03.466 --> 28:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2008, he helped author
Charter 08, a manifesto
demanding political
and civil reform, and

28:08.266 --> 28:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he was sentenced to 11 years
in prison for subversion.

28:10.833 --> 28:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN KAMM: Ten thousand
people signed that petition.

28:14.666 --> 28:19.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is the only one to have
been sentenced to prison.

28:19.266 --> 28:21.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, I think he
sacrificed there, too.

28:21.900 --> 28:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But the
case gained international
attention, and, in 2010,
over China's vehement

28:28.100 --> 28:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
objections, Liu was awarded
the Nobel Peace Prize.

28:31.400 --> 28:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Stuck in prison, Liu was unable
to attend the Nobel ceremony,
so a chair was left empty

28:36.400 --> 28:38.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in Oslo.

28:38.466 --> 28:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a statement he had
written for his trial was
used as his Nobel lecture.

28:41.533 --> 28:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Hatred can rot a person's
wisdom and conscience," it said.

28:45.566 --> 28:50.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still, Beijing's hard line on
Liu makes clear that the reforms
he sought for decades appear

28:51.433 --> 28:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
increasingly out of reach.

28:53.366 --> 28:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN KAMM: There's a
major party meeting
coming up in a few months.

28:57.100 --> 29:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The government and its president
and Chairman Xi Jinping will
be inclined to be very, very

29:04.166 --> 29:06.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tough.

29:06.133 --> 29:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In terms of changing
China's political system,
I don't see it, I'm afraid.

29:11.966 --> 29:14.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
focus turns now to
Liu's wife, Liu Xia.

29:14.900 --> 29:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She remains under house arrest.

29:17.400 --> 29:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And calls for her release,
including from the
secretary of state, have
so far gone unheeded.

29:22.733 --> 29:27.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm William Brangham.

29:28.433 --> 29:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

29:38.800 --> 29:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
we travel to one of the
world's largest jazz festivals

29:42.866 --> 29:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Denmark; and a view on how
school choice has evolved from
the pressures of parenting.

29:50.700 --> 29:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But first to the analysis
of Shields and Brooks.

29:53.100 --> 29:56.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist
Mark Shields and New York
Times columnist David Brooks.

29:56.866 --> 29:57.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, gentlemen.

29:57.866 --> 29:59.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, Mark, welcome back.

29:59.233 --> 30:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you, Judy.

30:00.433 --> 30:02.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We
missed you last week.

30:02.833 --> 30:04.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Donald Trump Jr. story.

30:04.866 --> 30:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have now learned that he
had a meeting a year ago,
Trump Tower, with a lawyer who

30:10.400 --> 30:12.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
had some connection to
the Russian government.

30:12.733 --> 30:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How does this change our
understanding of the Russia
collusion allegation?

30:17.233 --> 30:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I think
it's fair to say, Judy, that
the White House lost any benefit

30:21.233 --> 30:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the doubt that it
could claim on this story.

30:23.633 --> 30:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The shoes continue to drop,
like it's a Zappos warehouse
or Imelda Marcos' closet.

30:31.066 --> 30:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it just -- each time,
they're amending their story,
they're appending or extending

30:37.100 --> 30:39.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their story.

30:39.133 --> 30:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I just think the fact
that there were such denials
and accusations of a Democratic

30:46.033 --> 30:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plot, all of those are gone,
and they stand naked and
they stand exposed as shams.

30:51.933 --> 30:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, they were actively
engaged, at least welcoming
Russian involvement in the 2016

30:59.566 --> 31:03.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
election, in behalf of Donald
Trump against Hillary Clinton.

31:03.166 --> 31:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, does
this change your assessment of
what may have been going on?

31:07.233 --> 31:09.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

31:09.333 --> 31:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My colleague Ross Douthat wrote
that any time you give Donald
Trump the benefit of the doubt,

31:12.400 --> 31:13.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he always lets you down.

31:13.633 --> 31:14.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

31:14.633 --> 31:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And that's true.

31:16.700 --> 31:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's true for his business
clients and it's true for those
of us who thought, they couldn't

31:19.833 --> 31:24.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been some stupid, to
walk right into collusion
with the Russian meetings.

31:24.666 --> 31:28.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And yet they were not only that
stupid, but I think what is
striking to me is the complete

31:28.866 --> 31:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
amorality of it, that Donald
Trump Jr. gets an e-mail saying
the Russian government is

31:35.066 --> 31:37.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
offering you this, and
he says, "I love it."

31:37.100 --> 31:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it reminded me so much
of some of the e-mails that
came out of the Jack Abramoff

31:40.200 --> 31:44.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
scandal, that came out of the
financial crisis scandal, where
they're just -- they're like

31:44.200 --> 31:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
frat boys who are gleefully
going against the law and are
going against all morality.

31:50.566 --> 31:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they're not even overcoming
any scruples to do this.

31:53.633 --> 31:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're just having fun with it.

31:55.766 --> 32:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, in the days since,
we have had on - - Donald Jr.
on Sean Hannity's show, again,

32:02.266 --> 32:05.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I did nothing wrong, just
incapable of seeing that there
might have been something wrong

32:05.066 --> 32:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about colluding with a foreign
power who is hostile with you.

32:07.866 --> 32:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then Donald Trump himself
saying, he's a wonderful guy,
again, not seeing anything

32:12.533 --> 32:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wrong, and then even last day
lying about how many people were
in the meeting, a completely

32:16.633 --> 32:18.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
inconsequential lie.

32:18.700 --> 32:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we're trapped in the
zone just beyond any ethical
scruple, where it's all about

32:23.866 --> 32:25.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
winning.

32:25.866 --> 32:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Beyond any
ethical scruple, Mark,
is that where we are?

32:28.466 --> 32:32.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, I think
it's fair to say that
Donald Trump was born
without the embarrassment

32:33.566 --> 32:35.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gene or the moral
reservation gene.

32:35.600 --> 32:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He just -- he doesn't --
when he says that most people
would take that meeting, Judy,

32:39.933 --> 32:44.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, this is not -- I have
been around for a while, and
been to the Dallas Fair twice,

32:46.433 --> 32:47.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and all the rest of it.

32:47.933 --> 32:50.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People wouldn't do that.

32:50.366 --> 32:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2000, Al Gore's campaign
got ahold of, was delivered
George Bush's briefing book.

32:57.400 --> 32:59.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They turned it over to the FBI.

32:59.366 --> 33:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's what you do when
you're honorable in politics.

33:02.666 --> 33:04.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This isn't a meeting
with a foreign power.

33:04.233 --> 33:07.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This isn't Canada or the
Swiss Family Robinson.

33:07.433 --> 33:09.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
This is Russia.

33:09.433 --> 33:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a country that has
supported, propped up the worst
of anti-democratic regimes in

33:13.666 --> 33:18.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Middle East, that has
practiced -- mistreated
its own press, mistreated
its own civil society,

33:21.166 --> 33:26.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and economic intimidation
of its neighbors, including
invasion of its neighbors.

33:28.100 --> 33:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, this is the one country
on the face of the earth with
the capacity to obliterate

33:32.400 --> 33:33.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the United States.

33:33.933 --> 33:36.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is serious stuff.

33:36.033 --> 33:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to do it so casually and,
as David said, without moral
reservation, is -- I guess it

33:43.900 --> 33:46.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
should be stunning,
but, sadly, it isn't.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But some of the
Trump team, David, in their
response to this are sounding

33:49.433 --> 33:53.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
almost offended that people
would even think that they
were doing something wrong.

33:53.300 --> 33:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, well, they
just don't -- they don't get it.

33:56.200 --> 34:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My pal Mike Gerson had a good
line in his column today.

34:00.133 --> 34:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you make losing a sin, you
make cheating a sacrament.

34:03.533 --> 34:05.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that is true.

34:05.600 --> 34:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it's all win-loss, then
you do whatever you can to win
and to make money and to beat

34:09.033 --> 34:11.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the deal.

34:11.066 --> 34:13.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I do think you have
entered the zone where they
don't quite see what they have

34:13.366 --> 34:15.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
done wrong.

34:15.400 --> 34:19.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But cheating with a foreign
company -- country is -- as Mark
keeps saying, is a grave sin.

34:21.766 --> 34:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then there's just the
scandal management of it, of
letting it drip out, letting it

34:27.933 --> 34:30.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
drip out today and
today and today.

34:30.433 --> 34:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then there is almost just
a cluelessness like a color
blindness about how the rest

34:36.600 --> 34:38.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the world is going
to go react to this.

34:38.133 --> 34:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this has been a leitmotif
for the Trump administration.

34:40.133 --> 34:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It is the case,
Mark, that there was one version
we heard over the weekend,

34:43.533 --> 34:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then, on Monday, there was
a little bit more, and then
Tuesday, Wednesday, then today

34:47.900 --> 34:48.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
still another.

34:48.900 --> 34:49.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Mm-hmm.

34:49.900 --> 34:50.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No, it is, Judy.

34:50.900 --> 34:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I don't know what to think.

34:52.466 --> 34:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, drip, drip, drip,
comes a downpour at some point.

34:55.400 --> 35:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How about the disparaging of
the United States intelligence
agencies and professionals by

35:02.433 --> 35:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump, candidate Trump
and now President Trump, whether
Russia -- you know, I can't

35:06.900 --> 35:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be sure Russia was involved.

35:08.133 --> 35:10.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Yes, probably, but not for sure.

35:10.166 --> 35:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, here they are, the Trump
Tower with the people, their
names approved on the visitors

35:16.966 --> 35:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
list for the meeting in the
Trump Tower, and pretending
they didn't know it.

35:23.100 --> 35:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, no, it's -- David is right.

35:25.533 --> 35:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In a management sense, it's
just been incredible, Judy.

35:32.633 --> 35:35.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Apparently, it's hit the
president or someone has
gotten to the president,
because his statement

35:35.733 --> 35:40.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
about his son was so
sort of homogenized,
he's a quality person.

35:42.866 --> 35:44.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He
said he's a good boy.

35:44.966 --> 35:48.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Good boy,
and praised him for
his transparency, which
is a little bit like,

35:48.000 --> 35:53.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as I'm about to be indicted
for tax evasion, say, well, I
want to make something clear.

35:53.866 --> 35:56.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I failed to pay my taxes.

35:56.500 --> 35:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: It does open
up a bunch of questions,
like what were the -- this
-- as the intelligence

35:58.433 --> 36:02.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
experts keep saying, this looked
like a Russian feeler operation.

36:02.466 --> 36:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They just wanted to see
what kind of reaction they
could get from Donald Jr.

36:05.333 --> 36:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And if they -- how do they
respond to the signal?

36:08.433 --> 36:09.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so what else did they do?

36:09.666 --> 36:11.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There must have been
other things they did.

36:11.166 --> 36:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The second, was it connected?

36:13.233 --> 36:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump, as others have
cited, gave a speech in which
he said, we're about to have

36:15.833 --> 36:18.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a big set of revelations
about Hillary Clinton.

36:18.266 --> 36:20.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Did that flow out
of this meeting?

36:20.033 --> 36:22.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And what was the timing of that?

36:22.166 --> 36:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Who else was in this meeting?

36:23.400 --> 36:25.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What actually was
said in the meeting?

36:25.466 --> 36:29.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We still really -- we have some
testimonies, but what documents
were brought to the meeting?

36:29.266 --> 36:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It means there's another
several weeks of questions.

36:32.533 --> 36:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it gives Bob Mueller a
new channel to walk down.

36:35.466 --> 36:36.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's just expanding.

36:36.700 --> 36:37.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The
special counsel.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I would just say
one thing about Mr. Mueller.

36:41.100 --> 36:44.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has an advantage and a
power that nobody else, that
none of us in the press has.

36:46.766 --> 36:48.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He has the power of subpoena.

36:48.866 --> 36:51.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And he has the power
of a grand jury.

36:51.066 --> 36:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he has the alternative
of indictment for perjury.

36:57.266 --> 36:59.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, you just can't keep
changing these stories.

36:59.200 --> 37:03.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, Jared Kushner now
has amended, as John Yang
pointed out at the beginning of

37:03.233 --> 37:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the show, point, his number
of contacts with foreign
individuals and interests, 100.

37:09.433 --> 37:10.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Three times, he's
now had to do so.

37:10.733 --> 37:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Added names.

37:12.800 --> 37:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And it raises
the question, who leaked these
e-mails on Donald Trump -- I

37:15.666 --> 37:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
mean, on Donald Trump Jr.?

37:17.500 --> 37:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Did they -- is there mistrust?

37:19.800 --> 37:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is distrust, I know, in
the White House whether it was
Kushner or Kushner's people,

37:24.300 --> 37:26.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
saying that we had
to get this out.

37:26.266 --> 37:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, meantime,
one thing, David, the president
is saying that he wants

37:29.833 --> 37:32.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Senate to get done
is health care reform.

37:32.266 --> 37:37.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we now -- a few days ago,
we saw this newest, newer
version of health care reform

37:39.333 --> 37:43.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Leader McConnell is saying
that he really, really wants his
troops to come together behind.

37:46.200 --> 37:47.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But they still aren't there.

37:47.466 --> 37:49.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What does it look like?

37:49.466 --> 37:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, it's
interesting when you see the
reaction to this latest bill.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Some people say, oh, it
shifted to the right.

37:53.600 --> 37:55.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Some people say, oh, no,
it shifted to the left.

37:55.700 --> 37:58.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In reality, it short
of shifted both ways.

37:58.333 --> 38:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It keeps some of the taxes
on the rich, which some
of the moderates want.

38:01.533 --> 38:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It includes some deregulation
of the insurance markets, which
Ted Cruz and Mike Lee and some

38:05.333 --> 38:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the conservatives want.

38:06.566 --> 38:08.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, it sort of moves
in both direction.

38:08.566 --> 38:09.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I give Mitch
McConnell credit.

38:09.733 --> 38:12.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is an incredibly
unpopular bill.

38:12.266 --> 38:15.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it probably couldn't
survive a set of public
hearings and scrutiny.

38:15.066 --> 38:18.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And yet he's got to the
point where he's kind
of close to getting it.

38:18.833 --> 38:19.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't know if
we will get there.

38:19.833 --> 38:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I sort of would bet against it.

38:21.866 --> 38:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, as an act of legislative
craftsmanship, if your only
goal is to pass something, then

38:28.100 --> 38:30.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would say Mitch McConnell
has done about as well as you
can do by pushing a lot of

38:30.166 --> 38:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
different buttons and bringing
people at least within the
ballpark, especially given how

38:33.566 --> 38:35.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
unpopular this is.

38:35.666 --> 38:39.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I still think it's a bad
bill because it does so
much to punish Medicaid
among a population

38:40.833 --> 38:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that can afford it least.

38:42.833 --> 38:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But just as a set of legislative
craftsmanship, I would say
McConnell is like turning all

38:46.266 --> 38:49.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the knobs and getting
people sort of close.

38:49.200 --> 38:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would say maybe 40 percent
chance that he actually
passes something this summer.

38:52.900 --> 38:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you think
it will go over the top?

38:54.766 --> 38:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I don't, Judy.

38:56.800 --> 39:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I would just point out
Affordable Care Act was being
fought for 18 months in the

39:01.433 --> 39:02.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Congress.

39:02.933 --> 39:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was always a public
case you could make for it.

39:05.200 --> 39:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was much criticism of it,
but the public case included
that women wouldn't be charged

39:12.133 --> 39:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more than men, that nobody
could be denied coverage, that
the preexisting condition,

39:19.000 --> 39:21.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
people would be
guaranteed insurance and
access to health care.

39:21.933 --> 39:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is -- and the inside
part was done by Harry Reid
in the Senate and Nancy Pelosi

39:28.966 --> 39:30.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the House.

39:30.666 --> 39:32.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is all inside.

39:32.733 --> 39:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is no public argument.

39:34.600 --> 39:36.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
Behind closed doors.

39:36.700 --> 39:39.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: There is no
public case that can --
Mitch McConnell can make.

39:39.200 --> 39:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's no public case
addressing the -- you have
two minutes to address
the American people,

39:42.300 --> 39:43.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
why is this better?

39:43.733 --> 39:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why will this Republican
plan be better for Americans?

39:46.966 --> 39:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why will it be better for those
who don't have health care?

39:49.433 --> 39:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why will it be better for the
elderly, for the poor, for
the quality of health care in

39:55.033 --> 39:55.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the country?

39:55.966 --> 39:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is no case to be made.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's all inside baseball.

39:58.633 --> 40:02.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Can you get Dean Heller
by leaning on Governor
Sandoval in Nevada?

40:02.766 --> 40:05.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, that is what
it has come down to.

40:05.300 --> 40:09.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, to me, that is
a terrible failing.

40:09.600 --> 40:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If somehow they do wrangle
vote, what have they got?

40:12.300 --> 40:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have got an incredibly
unpopular piece of legislation.

40:15.500 --> 40:18.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is
anybody, David, making a
positive case for this?

40:18.400 --> 40:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Not really.

40:20.466 --> 40:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say the insurance markets
are failing, the Obamacare
markets are failing, which is

40:22.833 --> 40:24.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
somewhat true.

40:24.900 --> 40:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They want -- they say we have
to have a more market-driven
system to shove down costs,

40:28.666 --> 40:30.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
which is somewhat true.

40:30.133 --> 40:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so I think there is a
public case that could be made.

40:32.500 --> 40:35.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think they're
particularly making it, which
is why it's so unpopular.

40:35.766 --> 40:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if we had public
scrutiny -- say the insurance
markets -- this thing
called the Cruz amendments

40:42.766 --> 40:44.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gives the insurance companies
a chance to charge less for
some people if they give a

40:44.066 --> 40:46.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fuller benefit for another.

40:46.066 --> 40:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what that will do is,
let's put the insurance markets
into two different systems.

40:49.100 --> 40:50.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Exactly.

40:50.100 --> 40:52.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

40:52.166 --> 40:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And so the
people who are healthy
will be paying a low fee.

40:53.666 --> 40:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then the people who are
sick would be paying much more.

40:55.800 --> 40:59.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so whether you agree or
not with the principle, these
things actually have to work.

40:59.366 --> 41:03.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I'm not sure that
the way this is written,
this will actually even
just work as functioning

41:03.500 --> 41:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way to run a market, as the
health insurance companies
have been strongly saying, like

41:07.600 --> 41:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Blue Cross and Blue Shield.

41:09.733 --> 41:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: We're waiting
to find out now whether it's
going to be 19 million or 24

41:12.466 --> 41:14.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
million people who
are going to...

41:14.300 --> 41:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Knocked off.

41:15.566 --> 41:17.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Knocked
off health insurance.

41:17.566 --> 41:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, what everyone says
about the Affordable Care Act,
20 million Americans who didn't

41:19.966 --> 41:22.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have it then did have
health care coverage.

41:22.866 --> 41:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, Judy, let's be very blunt;
12 million of them came through
the extension of Medicaid.

41:29.900 --> 41:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is the starvation of
Medicaid, seven years, 2024,
and the federal support on the

41:34.600 --> 41:36.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
extension of
Medicaid disappears.

41:36.633 --> 41:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so they can talk about
money and everything else, but
implicit in the Republican bill

41:43.133 --> 41:44.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is there's a difference in
those who are on Medicaid.

41:44.666 --> 41:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Somehow, they are takers.

41:45.933 --> 41:47.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Somehow, they are freeloaders.

41:47.466 --> 41:50.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're not our fellow Americans
who are struggling to get by.

41:50.266 --> 41:55.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We are
going to have to leave
it there on that note.

42:09.266 --> 42:11.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mark Shields, David
Brooks, thank you both.

42:11.300 --> 42:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Copenhagen
Jazz Festival ends this
weekend in Denmark's capital.

42:13.433 --> 42:18.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The organizers claim it's the
world's biggest such event,
and that Denmark has now become

42:19.300 --> 42:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the epicenter of global jazz.

42:21.400 --> 42:26.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some of the American musicians
there express envy that this
quintessential American music

42:27.633 --> 42:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now thrives abroad, thanks to
Danish government investment.

42:31.433 --> 42:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant is based in Copenhagen
and he brings us all that Danish

42:36.900 --> 42:38.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
jazz.

42:38.966 --> 42:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The streets
and squares are alive to the
sound of improvisation, as the

42:44.466 --> 42:48.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
city stages 1,400 concerts
in 10 days, leading to claims
that Copenhagen is now the jazz

42:49.933 --> 42:51.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
capital of the world.

42:51.900 --> 42:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JORGEN FJELSTRUP, Drummer:
It's a kind of music
you can make swing.

42:56.300 --> 43:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We like the swing feeling,,
so that's how we perform it.

43:00.833 --> 43:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Drummer Jorgen
Fjelstrup fears that, like
Viennese waltzes, traditional

43:05.333 --> 43:07.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
jazz will soon be
consigned to history.

43:07.766 --> 43:10.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JORGEN FJELSTRUP:
Everything has its time.

43:10.500 --> 43:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think 5 percent of the people
knows or likes this kind of
jazz, mainly my age I think,

43:18.233 --> 43:21.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
so it will die with us.

43:21.300 --> 43:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But in
Copenhagen's meat-packing
district, the boundaries
of jazz are being

43:25.800 --> 43:30.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
expanded in a way
that's attracting
international attention.

43:30.066 --> 43:33.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Drummer Emil De Waal.

43:33.633 --> 43:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EMIL DE WAAL, Drummer: To me,
jazz is a very open genre.

43:40.800 --> 43:44.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
To me, jazz is a
very alive genre.

43:44.633 --> 43:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what we're trying to do
here is to make jazz work
together with electronic music.

43:51.000 --> 43:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I can't see a world without
improvisational music.

43:54.833 --> 43:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I'm really optimistic.

44:01.966 --> 44:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Grammy-winning
drummer Victor Jones has joined
a distinguished list of American

44:09.866 --> 44:13.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
musicians who've moved
to Denmark because of
its rich jazz culture.

44:13.033 --> 44:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VICTOR JONES, Drummer: They have
an audience that understands
the music, which in America,

44:20.033 --> 44:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's pretty difficult to
find an audience like that.

44:27.733 --> 44:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's good about here is that
they also teach it in school.

44:31.866 --> 44:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In America, they just don't
have it in school and they just
don't have it on TV, so here

44:36.333 --> 44:38.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I am.

44:38.933 --> 44:40.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

44:40.900 --> 44:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Six times'
Grammy-winning saxophonist
David Sanborn laments a lack of

44:46.800 --> 44:49.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
investment in a culture
that America invented.

44:49.133 --> 44:52.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SANBORN, Saxophonist:
You have a different
dynamic over here.

44:52.566 --> 44:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in Europe in general,
the arts are funded
by the governments,
which you don't get in

44:57.200 --> 44:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
America and even less so now.

44:59.800 --> 45:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think that there's
a certain institutional
respect for what this
music means to the world.

45:06.200 --> 45:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Consequently, it fosters
great Danish jazz musicians.

45:10.333 --> 45:15.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Such as
pianist Niels Lan Doky.

45:17.366 --> 45:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He learned his craft among
legends in New York, and now
runs a successful jazz club

45:20.200 --> 45:22.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Copenhagen.

45:22.266 --> 45:26.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NIELS LAN DOKY, Pianist: In New
York and America in general,
it's difficult to experiment and

45:28.833 --> 45:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
develop new products,
because the pressure to
be profitable is so high,
so bottom-line-oriented,

45:35.200 --> 45:40.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they need to play it safe,
established names, and you don't
see the kind of experimentation

45:42.133 --> 45:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and diversity that we have here.

45:46.533 --> 45:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: In
Denmark, the jazz gene
pool is being revitalized.

45:56.200 --> 46:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lan Doky's protege, 19-year-old
Amanda Thomsen, has chosen
jazz over other genres.

AMANDA THOMSEN, Musician: Jazz
surprises because, yes, you can
do what you want in jazz and

46:14.466 --> 46:15.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
improvise.

46:15.933 --> 46:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can create all the time,
so every song is new every day.

46:22.933 --> 46:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Jazz
may be thriving here,
but the common perception
that jazz is incapable

46:25.500 --> 46:29.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of standing on its own two feet
financially also applies here.

46:29.666 --> 46:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Festival organizers say that
subsidies from central and local
government, as well as private

46:34.466 --> 46:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
foundations, are essential,
because, without them, this
festival wouldn't be on such a

46:40.066 --> 46:42.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
grand scale.

46:42.066 --> 46:46.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Curtis Stigers says that jazz
will always struggle because
its art takes precedence

46:47.766 --> 46:50.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
over commerce.

46:50.300 --> 46:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CURTIS STIGERS, Musician:
I'm very, very, very lucky.

46:58.566 --> 47:00.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I make a living
playing jazz music.

47:00.300 --> 47:05.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have to come to
Europe to do it.

47:06.566 --> 47:08.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are the red headed stepchild
of the music business.

47:08.700 --> 47:10.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We are a niche market.

47:10.700 --> 47:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the people that love jazz,
they're willing to pay, they're
willing to suffer a little

47:16.733 --> 47:18.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bit to hear this music
and to support it.

47:18.966 --> 47:23.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I'm grateful for that.

47:23.466 --> 47:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Charlie Parker played pop songs.

47:25.200 --> 47:27.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He just turned them
into jazz tunes.

47:27.233 --> 47:31.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's what we have to do,
as opposed to just listening
to Miles Davis and saying,

47:31.600 --> 47:33.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that's jazz.

47:33.100 --> 47:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Here's another
dimension, liturgical jazz.

47:41.433 --> 47:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Anders Gadegaard is the dean
of Copenhagen Cathedral.

47:50.933 --> 47:55.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANDERS GADEGAARD, Dean,
Copenhagen Cathedral:
When you add this jazz
tone, it becomes much

47:55.233 --> 48:00.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
more vital for people,
and it becomes easier
for us to proclaim the
gospel, so to speak.

48:03.233 --> 48:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The jazz mass
was written by bassist Chris
Minh Doky, brother of the

48:09.533 --> 48:11.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pianist.

48:11.600 --> 48:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS MINH DOKY, Bassist: If
you take an old song from the
Danish song tradition that's

48:13.633 --> 48:18.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
300 years old, there's a reason
why it lasted 300 years, because
the melody is really good.

48:20.400 --> 48:24.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you just take the melody
and set it free and don't
constrain it in any boxed-in way

48:26.100 --> 48:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and just present it as is, with
a contemporary harmonization
and presentation, you will hear

48:32.933 --> 48:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that this melody is universal.

48:35.066 --> 48:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's basically the same as
hearing a pop song from the '50s
that turns into a jazz standard.

48:42.000 --> 48:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The claim that
Denmark is the epicenter of
global jazz may be disputed,

48:48.266 --> 48:50.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
but this congregation
proves beyond doubt that
the spirit is strong.

48:50.500 --> 48:52.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant in Copenhagen.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Author Gayle
Tzemach Lemmon usually reports
for us from the other side

49:14.000 --> 49:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the world, covering
stories such as the refugee
crisis and child marriage.

49:18.800 --> 49:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, she shares her Humble
Opinion about something closer
to home and much more personal.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON,
Author: School choice.

49:27.633 --> 49:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those two words spark a whole
host of emotions from people
across the political spectrum.

49:32.133 --> 49:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As a kid, I never heard the
words school choice uttered.

49:36.066 --> 49:38.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But they did indeed
shape my childhood.

49:38.500 --> 49:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You see, my mom was a single
mom, a union Democrat who worked
at the phone company during

49:42.866 --> 49:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the day and sold tupperware at
night, at least on the nights
when she wasn't studying for

49:47.433 --> 49:49.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her college degree.

49:49.400 --> 49:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She frequented yard sales,
grocery-shopped with double
coupons, and knew her way around

49:53.533 --> 49:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Marshalls layaway window.

49:56.433 --> 50:01.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she lied about our address,
so that I could attend what
she judged to be the best

50:01.166 --> 50:04.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
public elementary
school in our area.

50:04.100 --> 50:06.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In a number of states,
that is seen as a felony.

50:06.166 --> 50:11.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, parents across the
country regularly face jail
time and huge fines for what my

50:12.800 --> 50:15.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mom did, really.

50:15.800 --> 50:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parents are facing
prison to give their
children possibilities,
possibilities that area given

50:22.733 --> 50:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for upper-middle-class and
wealthy families, families that
can exercise their own school

50:26.233 --> 50:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
choice because they have
the means to choose what and
where is best for their kids.

50:30.933 --> 50:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As a kid, it didn't occur to
me that using a baby-sitter's
address or an address where

50:35.800 --> 50:40.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
my dad used to live
before the bank took his
property back was wrong.

50:40.466 --> 50:45.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was what was required,
do-it-yourself school choice to
make more choices down the road

50:46.333 --> 50:48.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
possible.

50:48.033 --> 50:50.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it worked.

50:50.166 --> 50:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The good school my mom got me
into, gave me a great start
for the rest of my education.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I went to a good college.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From there, I had the privilege
of becoming a Fulbright
Scholar, and that helped lead

51:00.433 --> 51:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
me to Harvard Business School.

51:02.900 --> 51:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But along the way, I
saw just how narrow the
funnel that leads to the
nation's elite institutions

51:08.000 --> 51:10.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
truly is.

51:10.033 --> 51:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The thing that strikes me
now is that all that I have
had the privilege of learning

51:13.200 --> 51:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and doing and undertaking since
then is because I had a mom
who understood that education

51:20.633 --> 51:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was the best anti-poverty
vaccination she could
give me and the best
shot at class mobility

51:24.800 --> 51:26.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
she had to offer.

51:26.866 --> 51:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For many moms and dads,
school choice is not an
issue, it's not partisan.

51:30.833 --> 51:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is about possibilities
and a chance to give kids the
springboard they need to vault

51:37.266 --> 51:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over class barriers and toward
the best future they can build.

51:41.166 --> 51:45.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that future is
something in which every
one of us has a stake.

51:45.300 --> 51:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Gayle Tzemach
Lemmon, we thank you.

worried should we be about Lyme
disease and Lyme-carrying ticks?

51:56.300 --> 51:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our science team spoke with the
director of the John Hopkins
Lyme Disease Clinical Research

51:59.866 --> 52:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

Robert Costa is preparing
for "Washington Week,"
which airs later tonight.

52:11.600 --> 52:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Robert, what do you have?

52:13.700 --> 52:16.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT COSTA: Tonight:
The Russia scandal hits
close to home for the
Trump family, pushing

52:16.733 --> 52:18.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the White House
into crisis mode.

52:18.933 --> 52:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We talk with the investigative
reporters who broke the story
and about new reports that

52:23.100 --> 52:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a former Russian spy may have
been at that Trump Tower meeting
-- tonight on "Washington

52:27.933 --> 52:29.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Week," Judy.

52:29.166 --> 52:30.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
we will be watching.

52:30.200 --> 52:32.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Thanks.

52:32.300 --> 52:36.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Coming up tomorrow on
"PBS NewsHour Weekend":
the final installment
of our six-part series

52:38.600 --> 52:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Inside Putin's Russia,
an in-depth look at
rising opposition to
President Vladimir Putin,

52:43.333 --> 52:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
led by Alexei Navalny, who is
inspiring young Russians to
speak out against corruption.

52:49.800 --> 52:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The 41-year-old
lawyer is the country's most
prominent opposition politician

52:53.766 --> 52:56.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on a crusade against corruption.

52:56.366 --> 53:00.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
His rallies are unusual
in a country where
retail campaigning
is almost unheard of.

53:00.566 --> 53:02.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The crowds are young,
and he talks like them.

53:02.600 --> 53:04.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALEXEI NAVALNY, Russian
Opposition Leader
(through translator):
They think we have no

53:04.633 --> 53:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right to ask questions, that
we have to shut up and listen.

53:07.533 --> 53:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, no, we have gathered here
to say we're going to ask these
questions and we will obtain

53:11.633 --> 53:13.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the answers.

53:13.133 --> 53:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: His anti-corruption
message resonates with me.

53:16.600 --> 53:20.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that he's a
very charismatic politician.

53:20.000 --> 53:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's tomorrow
on "PBS NewsHour Weekend."

53:24.233 --> 53:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will be back right here
on Monday, when the health
care reform battle will heat

53:28.100 --> 53:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up, as the Congressional Budget
Office is expected to release
its analysis of the latest

53:33.066 --> 53:34.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Senate bill.

53:34.733 --> 53:36.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's the "NewsHour"
for tonight.

53:36.066 --> 53:37.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:37.066 --> 53:38.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Have a great weekend.

53:38.133 --> 53:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you, and good night.
