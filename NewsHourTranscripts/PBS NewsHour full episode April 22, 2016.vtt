JUDY WOODRUFF: Good
evening. I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.641 --> 00:13.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: U.S.
suicide rates climb to a 30-year
high, especially among

00:13.146 --> 00:17.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
young girls. We examine
this disturbing trend.

00:17.918 --> 00:22.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also ahead, extending the right
to vote in Virginia. An
executive order restores voting

00:22.256 --> 00:25.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rights to convicted felons.

00:25.392 --> 00:31.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, on this Earth Day: efforts
by famed biologist and father of
biodiversity E.O.

00:31.598 --> 00:35.102 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Wilson to save
Alabama's river delta.

00:35.102 --> 00:41.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
E.O. WILSON, Biologist: We have
only discovered, much less
studied, about 20 percent of all

00:41.708 --> 00:48.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the species. So, here is a world
that is waiting for exploration,
and that's just the beginning.

00:48.615 --> 00:52.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.
Mark Shields and David Brooks
are here to analyze the week's

00:52.152 --> 00:53.987 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
news.

00:53.987 --> 00:59.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:59.993 --> 01:04.398 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:04.398 --> 01:15.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It took all day,
but more than 170 countries
signed the landmark Paris accord

01:15.709 --> 01:21.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on climate change today. The
ceremony took place at the
United Nations in New York.
Secretary

01:21.281 --> 01:26.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of State John Kerry signed for
the United States, with his
granddaughter joining him.

01:26.186 --> 01:30.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Beforehand, he acknowledged the
deal falls short of its stated
goal.

01:30.557 --> 01:36.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: The power of this
agreement is not that it, in and
of

01:36.830 --> 01:41.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
itself, guarantees that we will
actually hold the increase of
temperature to the target

01:41.668 --> 01:48.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of 1.5 degrees or 2 degrees
Centigrade. In fact, it doesn't.
And we know that. We acknowledge

01:48.709 --> 01:54.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it. The power of this agreement
is the opportunity that it
creates.

01:54.681 --> 02:00.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Each nation will
set nonbinding targets for
cutting emissions of carbon
dioxide

02:00.587 --> 02:09.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and other gases by 2025. The
U.S. target is up to 28 percent
below 2005 levels.

02:09.329 --> 02:15.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A new earthquake hit off the
coast of Ecuador last night,
followed by a smaller
aftershock,

02:15.135 --> 02:19.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but there were no reports of new
damage. Still, the official
death toll from last Saturday's

02:19.740 --> 02:27.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
quake rose again to 587.
Survivors are now lining up
daily for food and fresh water,

02:27.614 --> 02:32.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as aid workers warn of delays in
distributing the supplies. And a
new risk has emerged,

02:32.853 --> 02:37.290 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the threat of
mosquito-borne illness.

02:37.290 --> 02:42.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. presidential candidates
are heading into another big
weekend, the last before

02:42.129 --> 02:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the next batch of primaries. For
Republican front-runner Donald
Trump today, that meant

02:46.733 --> 02:50.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hunting for votes and trying
to win over party big-wigs.

02:50.303 --> 02:53.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang has our report.

02:53.507 --> 02:59.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Donald Trump's
campaign proceeded on two
fronts. The candidate stumped in
Delaware.

02:59.679 --> 03:02.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: My family asked me,
dad, why are you doing

03:02.315 --> 03:07.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this? I would rather not do it.
I wish we had somebody that was
so good. I don't care

03:07.054 --> 03:10.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if it's a Republican or a
Democrat. I couldn't care less.

03:10.490 --> 03:16.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In Florida, a top
campaign official tried to ease
the concerns of members of the

03:16.263 --> 03:20.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican National Committee.
Senior adviser Paul Manafort
described the candidate almost

03:20.634 --> 03:23.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as an actor playing a role.

03:23.737 --> 03:26.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The New York Times obtained
a recording of his remarks.

03:26.773 --> 03:29.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL MANAFORT, Trump Convention
Manager: And that's what's
important, from our standpoint,

03:29.476 --> 03:34.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for you to understand that he
gets it, and that the part he's
been playing is evolving

03:34.181 --> 03:36.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into the part that now that you
have been expecting that he
wasn't ready for, because

03:36.316 --> 03:40.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he had first to complete the
first phase. The negatives will
come down. The image is

03:40.420 --> 03:43.623 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going to change.

03:43.623 --> 03:48.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Ted Cruz pounced on
those comments. Campaigning in
Williamsport, Pennsylvania,

03:48.528 --> 03:52.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
today, he branded Trump
and his team as liars.

03:52.632 --> 03:56.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
Yesterday, they were down in
Florida meeting

03:56.803 --> 04:01.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with party leaders, and they
were saying -- these are their
words -- that all of this is
just

04:01.441 --> 04:07.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a show, that he doesn't believe
anything he's saying. He's just
trying to fool gullible

04:07.714 --> 04:10.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voters, and he's not going to do
any of it, he's not going to
build a wall, he's not going

04:10.650 --> 04:15.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to deport anyone. He is
telling us he's lying to us.

04:15.989 --> 04:20.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In the Democratic
race, Bernie Sanders is
celebrating praise from Vice
President

04:20.961 --> 04:24.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joe Biden. While not making an
endorsement, Mr. Biden told The
New York Times he preferred

04:24.865 --> 04:27.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Sanders' approach.

04:27.467 --> 04:32.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said: "I like the idea of
saying, we can do much more,
because we can."

04:32.305 --> 04:35.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, Sanders held a town hall
in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

04:35.642 --> 04:39.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate: My hope
is there will be a
record-breaking

04:39.012 --> 04:40.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
turnout on Tuesday.

04:40.981 --> 04:44.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

04:44.551 --> 04:49.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Clinton also
campaigned in Pennsylvania,
focusing on pay equity, citing
the decision

04:49.222 --> 04:51.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to put a woman on the $20 bill.

04:51.791 --> 04:56.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: I'm very
excited about Harriet Tubman and

04:56.396 --> 05:01.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the other women who are going to
be included on our money. But I
also want to make sure

05:01.401 --> 05:04.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that women are making the money.

05:04.504 --> 05:09.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Pennsylvania is the
biggest prize among the five
states that vote on Tuesday.

05:09.476 --> 05:12.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm John Yang.

05:12.712 --> 05:17.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In London today,
President Obama called for
overturning North Carolina's

05:17.651 --> 05:22.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
new law on public bathrooms. It
limits transgender people to the
facility that corresponds to

05:22.355 --> 05:25.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their sex at birth.

05:25.759 --> 05:31.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Obama said the law is wrong,
but he emphasized that Britons
are welcome to visit. The
British

05:31.198 --> 05:38.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government has issued a travel
advisory warning of possible
discrimination in some U.S.
states.

05:38.138 --> 05:42.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president also weighed in
one Britain's upcoming vote on
whether to leave the European

05:42.609 --> 05:48.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Union. He penned an op-ed
article in The Daily Telegraph,
writing -- quote -- "The U.S.
and

05:48.348 --> 05:53.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the world need your outsized
influence to continue, including
within Europe."

05:53.620 --> 05:59.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Later, he followed up on his
appeal at a news conference with
Prime Minister David Cameron.

05:59.459 --> 06:05.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: Part of our
special relationship, part of

06:05.632 --> 06:12.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being friends it is to be honest
and to let you know what I
think.

06:12.906 --> 06:18.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, speaking honestly, the
outcome of that decision is a
matter of deep interest to the

06:18.645 --> 06:25.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
United States, because it
affects our prospects as well.
The United States wants a strong

06:25.085 --> 06:29.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
United Kingdom as a partner, and
the United Kingdom is at its
best when it's helping to

06:29.356 --> 06:32.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lead a strong Europe.

06:32.092 --> 06:35.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president
also warned that the U.S. would
be in no hurry to write a free

06:35.662 --> 06:40.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
trade deal with Britain
if it does exit the E.U.

06:40.467 --> 06:44.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But the candor wasn't
appreciated by some, including
London Mayor Boris Johnson, who

06:44.471 --> 06:47.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
heads the Leave campaign.

06:47.040 --> 06:52.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BORIS JOHNSON, Mayor of London:
It's something to which the
Americans would never submit

06:52.812 --> 07:00.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their own democracy. America is
a proud democracy, built on
principles of liberty, the idea
of

07:00.487 --> 07:05.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the sanctity of representation
and no taxation without
representation. It is very odd.
It

07:05.425 --> 07:08.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is perverse. It is hypocritical.

07:08.228 --> 07:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Johnson also
blasted the president's decision
to move a bust of Winston
Churchill

07:13.500 --> 07:17.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the Oval Office. He called
it -- quote -- "a symbol of the
part-Kenyan president's

07:17.737 --> 07:22.342 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ancestral dislike of
the British empire."

07:22.342 --> 07:26.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama didn't respond
directly to the jibe, but he did
say that he moved the

07:26.179 --> 07:30.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Churchill bust to his private
study after he had a bust of
Martin Luther King Jr. placed

07:30.583 --> 07:33.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the Oval Office.

07:33.753 --> 07:38.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The United States announced
today that it's buying roughly
35 tons of so-called heavy

07:38.825 --> 07:45.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
water from Iran. The liquid is
used to make weapons-grade
plutonium, and last year's
nuclear

07:45.031 --> 07:50.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deal calls for Iran to sell its
excess stockpile. Republican
leaders in Congress today
criticized

07:50.303 --> 07:54.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the purchase as a
dangerous precedent.

07:54.174 --> 07:59.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The number of migrants arriving
in Greece is rising again. The
International Organization

07:59.079 --> 08:05.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for Migration says more than 150
people reached the Greek islands
from Turkey on each of the

08:05.552 --> 08:09.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last three days. Initially, a
European Union deal with Turkey
had cut arrivals to near

08:09.989 --> 08:13.193 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
zero.

08:13.193 --> 08:18.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, medical
officials completed an autopsy
on Prince, but said it could
take

08:18.064 --> 08:22.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weeks to fix the cause of death.
The pop music great was found
dead yesterday at his home

08:22.635 --> 08:25.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in suburban Minneapolis.

08:25.672 --> 08:30.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, as an impromptu memorial
swelled with balloons and
flowers, investigators said some

08:30.944 --> 08:34.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
points are already clear.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM OLSON, Carver County,
Minnesota, Sheriff: There were
no obvious signs of trauma on
the

08:35.615 --> 08:37.984 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
body at all.

08:37.984 --> 08:43.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have no reason to believe at
this point that this was a
suicide, but, again, this

08:43.923 --> 08:49.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
early on in this investigation
and it's continuing to -- we
will continue to investigate.

08:49.028 --> 08:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The sheriff and
the medical examiner's office
wouldn't confirm or deny

08:53.600 --> 08:59.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reports that Prince might have
overdosed on painkillers last
week.

08:59.239 --> 09:03.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wall Street ended the week with
a lackluster day. The Dow Jones
industrial average gained

09:03.810 --> 09:12.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
21 points to close at 18003. But
the Nasdaq fell 39, and the S&amp;P
500 added just a fraction.

09:12.485 --> 09:19.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the week, the Dow and the
Nasdaq gained half-a-percent.
The S&amp;P lost more than
half-a-percent.

09:19.225 --> 09:24.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And thousands of people have
gathered in Boston this weekend
for PAX East, one of the world's

09:24.297 --> 09:30.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leading gaming festivals.
Organizers say it's like
Woodstock for gamers, where
serious players

09:30.270 --> 09:36.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can compete and preview what's
new. The buzz this year is all
about virtual reality games

09:36.209 --> 09:42.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that use headsets to transport
users to alternate worlds.

09:42.282 --> 09:48.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
an alarming rise in suicide
rates, including among teenage

09:48.087 --> 09:54.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

10:10.944 --> 10:19.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The government
released new statistics about
suicide in the U.S., and

10:19.219 --> 10:24.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the results were sobering and
stunning. The nation's suicide
rate is at its highest point

10:24.924 --> 10:31.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since 1986. Nearly 43,000 people
ended their own lives in 2014,
which is the most recent

10:31.397 --> 10:34.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
year with full data.

10:34.234 --> 10:38.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has more on
this story from our New York
studios.

10:38.071 --> 10:43.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The rise in
rates were particularly alarming
among some age groups. While the

10:43.343 --> 10:48.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
numbers are still smaller among
children, the suicide rate was
up sharply among
10-to-14-year-old

10:48.414 --> 10:52.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
girls, tripling in
the past 15 years.

10:52.919 --> 10:57.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It also rose steeply among
middle-aged Americans, 63
percent higher for middle-aged
women, 43

10:57.924 --> 11:00.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
percent higher for
middle-aged men.

11:00.860 --> 11:04.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For some perspective on these
trends and some of the potential
reasons behind it, I'm joined

11:04.931 --> 11:07.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by Katherine Hempstead, who
studies this for the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation.

11:07.867 --> 11:11.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the record, the foundation
is a funder of the "NewsHour."

11:11.838 --> 11:15.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, which of these sets of
numbers, and we just went over a
couple of them, but stood

11:15.041 --> 11:17.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out to you when you saw this?

11:17.577 --> 11:19.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHERINE HEMPSTEAD, Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation: Well, I
think there has been concern
about

11:19.279 --> 11:22.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the middle-aged group
for a while now.

11:22.482 --> 11:26.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And people have been noticing
increased rates for both males
and females. And with these

11:26.286 --> 11:31.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
latest results, we see really,
really large increases for women
in particular and a closing

11:31.658 --> 11:36.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of that gender gap, as the
female rates starts to be closer
to the male rate.

11:36.896 --> 11:39.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That women try
more, but men succeed more? Is
that one of the...

11:39.499 --> 11:40.767 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

11:40.767 --> 11:43.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHERINE HEMPSTEAD: Well, I
think that's something that is
true.

11:43.202 --> 11:49.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is much more of a nonfatal
to fatal ratio for females.
There are many more attempted

11:49.108 --> 11:53.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
self-harms that don't result in
fatal incidents. But now we see
-- with this new trend, we

11:53.947 --> 11:57.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see the rates getting closer,
and we also see a change in the
method, so that we see

11:57.450 --> 12:01.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this increasing adoption of
suffocation or hanging as a
suicide method by both males

12:01.354 --> 12:04.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and females, and that is
a highly lethal method.

12:04.657 --> 12:07.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And compare
that to guns, which is probably
still the number one...

12:07.226 --> 12:08.294 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

12:08.294 --> 12:12.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KATHERINE HEMPSTEAD: Guns is the
most lethal means of suicide.

12:12.832 --> 12:17.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And guns is the most important
method for males. But we saw for
both males and females

12:17.303 --> 12:21.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an increase in suffocation
as a share of suicides.

12:21.074 --> 12:25.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the
things to keep in mind that, are
suicides unreported, because

12:25.178 --> 12:28.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it looks like these CDC numbers
would have to come with the
coroner's said suicide on

12:28.081 --> 12:30.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the death certificate?

12:30.383 --> 12:36.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHERINE HEMPSTEAD: There is
probably some underreporting of
suicides, but I think that,

12:36.155 --> 12:40.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over this time period, I don't
believe this is any kind of a
data artifact.

12:40.493 --> 12:44.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I don't think that
underreporting has been a huge
part of the problem or that's
changed

12:44.097 --> 12:48.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot over the last 15 years, so
I think this is a real trend in
suicide.

12:48.267 --> 12:51.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And is there
any way to capture, well,
unsuccessful suicides, attempts

12:51.404 --> 12:52.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or hospitalizations?

12:52.639 --> 12:55.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KATHERINE HEMPSTEAD: Oh, yes.

12:55.975 --> 13:00.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When people attempt suicide,
many times, it results in an
emergency room admission, so

13:00.380 --> 13:04.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we do have a lot of data on
nonfatal attempts. A lot of
those attempts are done with
poisoning.

13:04.550 --> 13:08.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's probably the most common
method for nonfatal attempts.

13:08.021 --> 13:12.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we do find that females vs.
males, as we already mentioned,
have a higher ratio

13:12.992 --> 13:17.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of non-fatal to fatal attempts,
because they tend to use less
lethal methods. And we also

13:17.463 --> 13:21.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see, for certain age groups,
like younger groups in
particular, there's more
nonfatal

13:21.534 --> 13:23.169 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
attempts.

13:23.169 --> 13:25.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is that
because younger people are doing
this more impulsively than

13:25.872 --> 13:27.907 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
older people?

13:27.907 --> 13:32.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHERINE HEMPSTEAD: Well, there
is -- yes, there is a lot of
evidence that, among younger

13:32.445 --> 13:36.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people, suicidal behavior,
whether it's fatal or nonfatal,
has a more impulsive
origination.

13:36.816 --> 13:41.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it could be a response --
and this is I think something
that is true especially

13:41.187 --> 13:45.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for young males -- response to
some kind of adverse event,
maybe a relationship problem,

13:45.992 --> 13:51.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a fight with an authority
figure, problem with parents,
maybe a minor legal infraction.

13:51.998 --> 13:57.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we see a lot of suicides --
suicide attempts and completed
suicides for younger people

13:57.470 --> 14:01.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that -- especially males, that
are the result of sort of recent
crises that sort of precipitate

14:01.274 --> 14:03.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
impulsive self-injury.

14:03.810 --> 14:08.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Are there
large-scale patterns that you
can say are maybe attributed to
the

14:08.414 --> 14:13.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
economy or the great recession
that we just went through, or
when people are down in the

14:13.186 --> 14:15.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dumps, they have lost their
fortunes, they have lost
everything? Are these the times

14:15.354 --> 14:18.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
where we see suicides pick up?

14:18.191 --> 14:21.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHERINE HEMPSTEAD: Well,
that's really the thing that we
focused on when we looked at

14:21.127 --> 14:26.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the middle-aged. And we did look
to see, could we associate any
particular kind of circumstances

14:26.899 --> 14:29.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to this rising rate of suicide
among the middle-aged?

14:29.836 --> 14:36.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And sure enough we did see an
increasing reference to things
like job problems, personal
finance

14:36.375 --> 14:41.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
issues, foreclosures,
bankruptcies, things that really
accelerated during this time of

14:41.414 --> 14:45.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the recession, but we see that
those trends are kind of
persisting even when a lot of

14:45.118 --> 14:48.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people feel like the economy's
recovered quite a bit, but maybe
those improvements aren't

14:48.054 --> 14:51.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
being felt by everybody.

14:51.624 --> 14:55.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the middle-aged, I think,
are particularly vulnerable to
those kinds of pressures,
because

14:55.862 --> 14:59.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they are breadwinners, they have
dependents, their own retirement
might not be secure,

14:59.999 --> 15:04.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they might have children to put
through college. So I think they
can be particularly affected

15:04.170 --> 15:07.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by those kinds of
economic problems.

15:07.206 --> 15:10.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Are there
reasons that explain what is
happening with younger people,
teenagers?

15:10.343 --> 15:14.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know there are small cohorts
from 13 to 18 and so forth, the
way that the CDC breaks

15:14.881 --> 15:17.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out the numbers, but when you
look at overall number, it's
increasing.

15:17.984 --> 15:22.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHERINE HEMPSTEAD: Well,
that's particularly troubling,
because it's a little bit harder

15:22.688 --> 15:29.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to pin those kinds of increases
to the broader kinds of
economic, you know, pocketbook
issues

15:29.028 --> 15:31.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that are more -- you would think
have more of an impact on older
people that had those

15:31.998 --> 15:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
kinds of responsibilities.

15:34.300 --> 15:37.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think that is something
that people are very concerned
about and want to understand

15:37.436 --> 15:39.639 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
better, what are
those motivations?

15:39.639 --> 15:43.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And is
there a contagion effect?

15:43.309 --> 15:48.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHERINE HEMPSTEAD: You know,
some people have talked about
that.

15:48.347 --> 15:54.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, I think that is
extremely difficult to have
really rigorous evidence to
either

15:54.253 --> 15:58.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
support or refute the idea of
some kind of contagion,
particularly to say that that
would

15:58.658 --> 16:04.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
account for a large share of
suicide, but I do think that
there are sort of waxes and

16:04.230 --> 16:08.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wanes and times in which suicide
may come to seem more sort of
culturally acceptable

16:08.734 --> 16:12.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or a more popular way to talk
about a response to problems.

16:12.905 --> 16:19.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this can sort of kind of
rise and fall over time and go
in and out of favor with

16:19.011 --> 16:22.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
certain groups. And I think
adolescents can be susceptible
to that kind of language and

16:22.415 --> 16:24.450 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
imagery.

16:24.450 --> 16:25.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Katherine Hempstead from the
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation,
thanks

16:25.518 --> 16:27.019 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
so much.

16:27.019 --> 16:35.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHERINE HEMPSTEAD: Sure. It's
a pleasure. Thanks for having me
on.

16:35.561 --> 16:46.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Virginia Governor
Terry McAuliffe signed a
sweeping order today to restore
voting

16:46.439 --> 16:52.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rights to more than 200,000
convicted felons after their
release from prison.

16:52.478 --> 16:56.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans in the commonwealth
quickly accused the governor of
abusing his executive power

16:56.482 --> 17:00.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to help Democrat Hillary Clinton
win a battleground state.

17:00.152 --> 17:02.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Governor McAuliffe joins
me now from Richmond.

17:02.255 --> 17:05.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Governor, welcome.

17:05.091 --> 17:08.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why the decision to overturn
something that's been in place
in your state since the Civil

17:08.527 --> 17:10.196 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
War?

17:10.196 --> 17:12.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GOV. TERRY MCAULIFFE (D),
Virginia: Well, let's be honest.
We have had a bad history

17:12.798 --> 17:18.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
here on voting rights in
Virginia. 1901, 1902, they put
in the poll tax. They put in
literacy

17:18.771 --> 17:22.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tests. And they had a horrible
disenfranchisement for felons.

17:22.642 --> 17:30.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what I did today was to
erase 114, 115 years of a
really, really repressive tactic

17:30.316 --> 17:33.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
used to deprive people
their right to vote.

17:33.486 --> 17:38.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You included
convicted felons who were
accused of violent crimes,
murder,

17:38.791 --> 17:41.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rape. You didn't make any
exceptions. Why not?

17:41.594 --> 17:44.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GOV. TERRY MCAULIFFE:
No. Why should I?

17:44.363 --> 17:49.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Once you have served your time,
once you have paid your debt to
society, the judge, jury

17:49.802 --> 17:53.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have determined what your
sentence would be, once you
complete that, why should you
not

17:53.272 --> 17:55.741 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be back in?

17:55.741 --> 17:59.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When these people, even if they
have committed heinous crimes,
but once they have finished

17:59.745 --> 18:05.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
serving their sentence, they go
back to their communities, they
get jobs, they have family

18:05.418 --> 18:09.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
members. You want them, Judy --
I want everybody back getting a
job. I want them paying taxes.

18:09.221 --> 18:11.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I want them feeling
good about themselves.

18:11.123 --> 18:13.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have paid your
debt to society.

18:13.659 --> 18:18.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As you just
heard, the Republican Party in
your state is questioning why
you

18:18.998 --> 18:27.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did this blanket change in the
law, in what was the law for so
long, and they're saying

18:27.406 --> 18:30.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's an example of political
opportunism, that you have got
this election coming up,

18:30.743 --> 18:32.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and that explains
the timing of it.

18:32.912 --> 18:36.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GOV. TERRY MCAULIFFE: Well,
Judy, let me be very clear.

18:36.048 --> 18:40.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If I were to do it for political
purposes, I would have done it
last year, before my

18:40.453 --> 18:46.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
entire 140-member of the General
Assembly. As you know, you
follow the news, I worked

18:46.425 --> 18:50.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very hard to win one Senate seat
to get control of the Senate. If
I were to do this for political

18:50.429 --> 18:53.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
purposes, I would have
done it last year.

18:53.566 --> 18:56.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First of all, let me be very
clear. Hillary Clinton doesn't
need this. She is going to

18:56.736 --> 19:00.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
win Virginia. She is going to
beat Donald Trump. So, put the
politics aside. And it's

19:00.873 --> 19:06.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
really unfortunate these
Republicans always default to
partisan politics.

19:06.312 --> 19:12.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was, morally, the right
thing to do. This was about
letting people who have already

19:12.284 --> 19:16.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
served their sentence, they are
done with probation, back in as
full citizens of our

19:16.756 --> 19:19.592 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
society. That's
what we should do.

19:19.592 --> 19:23.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Governor --
Governor, let me ask you about
another argument that's made,

19:23.396 --> 19:26.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and this is a conservative
argument. The gentleman we
spoke, his name Roger Clegg, he
heads the

19:26.732 --> 19:29.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Center for Equal Opportunity.

19:29.869 --> 19:35.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said re-enfranchisement,
letting people vote again, it
makes sense on a case-by-case

19:35.674 --> 19:41.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
basis, once a person can show
that they have actually turned
over a new leaf, changed their

19:41.047 --> 19:46.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
behavior. But he said, when you
grant this sort of right to vote
to everybody, you are

19:46.452 --> 19:51.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
not allowing the -- each
individual to show whether they
have respect for the law.

19:51.390 --> 19:55.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he makes the point. He says,
you can't demand the right --
what basically you're

19:55.661 --> 20:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doing is giving the right to
vote to people who would be then
determining other people's

20:01.333 --> 20:03.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
votes, other people's laws,
which is what you do when you
vote.

20:03.936 --> 20:07.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GOV. TERRY MCAULIFFE:
Oh, Judy, that's silly.

20:07.873 --> 20:14.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First of all, let me be clear.
I'm restoring voting rights. I'm
not giving people back

20:14.046 --> 20:20.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gun rights. I'm not commuting
anyone's sentence. I am giving
people who are now -- have
served

20:20.453 --> 20:24.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- they have paid their debt to
society. That debt was
determined by a judge and a
jury.

20:24.590 --> 20:27.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they said, this is
the debt to pay back.

20:27.460 --> 20:32.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Once you have done that, I'm
saying you can come back and be
part of society. You can

20:32.164 --> 20:35.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go back, and you can have a job,
you can buy a home, you can do
everything else. I want

20:35.568 --> 20:38.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you feeling good about
yourself and voting.

20:38.537 --> 20:43.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we have a difference of
opinion. I was proud to do this
today. It was morally the

20:43.375 --> 20:48.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right thing to do. I have the
full legal authority under the
Constitution to do it, the legal

20:48.214 --> 20:51.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
authority. I have the moral
authority. And I did it.

20:51.417 --> 20:54.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just finally,
Governor, you have said today, I
believe, that you want

20:54.487 --> 20:59.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to encourage these individuals
to register and vote. How are
you going to do that?

20:59.091 --> 21:02.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GOV. TERRY MCAULIFFE: Well, I
think by coming on your show,
and I think we're going to see

21:02.161 --> 21:05.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an awful lot of press
that came off it today.

21:05.397 --> 21:08.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Judy, if you could have been
with me -- and we didn't tell
anybody what we were doing

21:08.501 --> 21:12.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today. We invited a lot of folks
from restoration of rights
community, because I have done a

21:12.471 --> 21:16.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lot of these events. They didn't
know. When I announced what I
was doing today, the folks

21:16.976 --> 21:21.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who came up to me and said,
Governor, I haven't voted in 20
years or 30 -- there were
mothers

21:21.547 --> 21:25.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crying. There were fathers
crying. There were sons and
daughters crying.

21:25.918 --> 21:30.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a great feeling. I
restored the rights a couple
months ago of Bobby Blevins. He
had

21:30.489 --> 21:36.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not voted for 60 years. He made
a mistake when he was 19 years
old. He is now 79. And

21:36.195 --> 21:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to see this grown man standing
next to me weeping in tears when
I signed the order,

21:40.933 --> 21:45.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and he got to vote -- and then
he called me after he got to
vote in the last election.

21:45.638 --> 21:52.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know what? That's what
leadership is all about. As
governor, my job is to grow an
economy.

21:52.178 --> 21:57.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My job is to make sure that
everybody can enjoy a great
life. What I did today was
morally

21:57.616 --> 22:01.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the right thing to do. I gave
people back their voting rights,
plain and simple.

22:01.987 --> 22:06.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You served your time, come on
in, be part of the Virginia
economy. Be part of our family.

22:06.225 --> 22:09.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you can't do it if you treat
people like second-class
citizens.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Governor Terry
McAuliffe of the Commonwealth of
Virginia, we thank you

22:12.531 --> 22:14.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very much.

22:14.700 --> 22:22.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOV. TERRY MCAULIFFE: Thank you.

22:22.107 --> 22:29.281 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

22:29.281 --> 22:32.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now to the analysis of
Shields and Brooks. That's
syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and

22:32.451 --> 22:34.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
New York Times columnist
David Brooks.

22:34.553 --> 22:37.156 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to you, gentlemen.

22:37.156 --> 22:43.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we just heard, David, from
Governor McAuliffe of Virginia.
He has decided, as we just
heard,

22:43.395 --> 22:50.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to allow 200 -- in effect,
200,000 ex-felons, people who
served their time for a felony

22:50.569 --> 22:53.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
crime, to vote. What
do you make of it?

22:53.239 --> 22:57.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I would love
to see the ideological breakdown
of ex-felons.

22:57.076 --> 23:00.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think it's the right thing
to do. I have never quite
understood. You know, you're

23:00.546 --> 23:07.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
assigned a cost you have to pay
for committing a crime or even a
felony. You do your time,

23:07.586 --> 23:10.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you do your parole, you do your
probation, you should be able to
rejoin society in full

23:10.089 --> 23:12.691 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
measure.

23:12.691 --> 23:15.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the weird things in our
whole criminal just system is,
we have got people who are

23:15.961 --> 23:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
50, and 60, well past what they
call criminal menopause, and
they're perfectly upstanding

23:21.066 --> 23:23.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
citizens, and they're not the
person they were at 19, and yet
we continue to punish

23:23.969 --> 23:25.904 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And whether they're in jail, we
should be more lenient on them.
If they're out, we should

23:27.606 --> 23:28.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
make them full citizens.

23:28.440 --> 23:29.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark?

23:29.541 --> 23:31.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: I agree.

23:31.877 --> 23:37.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I thought Terry McAuliffe,
who is accused of being a super
salesman, a huckster, whatever,

23:37.650 --> 23:42.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I thought he was quite
persuasive in his case that,
especially in Virginia's long
history

23:42.855 --> 23:48.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of denying the vote to people
persistently, as part of
governmental policy, given the

23:48.260 --> 23:50.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
historical record.

23:50.863 --> 23:56.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And once a person has paid his
or her debt to society and is
off parole, I mean, why

23:56.969 --> 24:02.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not? And don't we want them to
become part of society again and
the community?

24:02.107 --> 24:05.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I mean,
apparently, there are more and
more states that are doing this.

24:05.311 --> 24:05.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And a lot of the questions...

24:05.978 --> 24:07.613 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

24:07.613 --> 24:11.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, and a lot of
red states, too, so, you know,
the whole political question.

24:11.583 --> 24:15.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So let's move too
the presidential contest and
surprise -- David, I want to ask

24:15.587 --> 24:18.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you about Donald Trump.

24:18.190 --> 24:23.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Republicans are meeting in
Florida, the RNC, the Republican
National Committee. Yesterday

24:23.662 --> 24:30.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- or I guess last night,
Trump's campaign manager, Paul
Manafort, in a closed-door
session,

24:30.235 --> 24:35.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said -- and we -- some of this
was recorded, so we know that he
said it -- that, in effect,

24:35.507 --> 24:39.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that what Donald Trump has been
doing has been acting,
play-acting, and he's going to

24:39.845 --> 24:42.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be changing his tune, and you're
going to see a different Donald
Trump, and he's going

24:42.948 --> 24:44.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to raise money for Republicans.

24:44.616 --> 24:47.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you make of this?

24:47.086 --> 24:49.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, first, the
RNC gathering, from what one can
tell, it's like the gathering

24:49.588 --> 24:50.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the Russian royal
family in 1916.

24:50.656 --> 24:52.458 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

24:52.458 --> 24:56.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: They seem to have
no spine, no argument. All they
want is, they don't

24:56.362 --> 25:00.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want the show in Cleveland to be
bad. And so as long as the show
is good, we can have

25:00.199 --> 25:03.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a disastrous royal candidate
who will destroy the party.

25:03.402 --> 25:08.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so they're fine as long as
there is no bad drama. And so
they're laying down. And

25:08.207 --> 25:10.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reince Priebus will go down as
one of the worst RNC heads for
what he -- how he's behaved

25:10.309 --> 25:12.444 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this year.

25:12.444 --> 25:17.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Second, as for Donald Trump and
what Paul Manafort said, A, it's
not credible. Donald

25:17.950 --> 25:21.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump has been Donald Trump for
a long, long time. He is not
going to stop being himself.

25:21.854 --> 25:28.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that a voluble, large, loud,
and sometimes obnoxious and
sometimes appalling campaigner.

25:28.994 --> 25:32.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's not going to turn
presidential, because he lacks
the gravitas, he lacks the
knowledge

25:32.664 --> 25:37.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
base and he lacks the core. And
yet now he has hired this guy
Paul Manafort who's saying,

25:37.770 --> 25:41.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
oh, don't worry, he's not some
kind of blowhard, he just a rank
opportunist who's been putting

25:41.373 --> 25:44.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on a show all this time.

25:44.176 --> 25:46.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I don't -- I don't -- A,
don't think it's going to work,
and I don't think it's
particularly

25:46.278 --> 25:47.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
attractive either.

25:47.446 --> 25:49.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark, what
do you think? Is it...

25:49.114 --> 25:51.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think it's
quite attractive. I really do.

25:51.750 --> 25:53.485 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

25:53.485 --> 25:57.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy, I think the
Republican Party chair's
responsibility, any party chair,

25:57.923 --> 26:01.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is not to give the party a
candidate. It's to give the
candidate a party.

26:01.894 --> 26:08.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And if the voters choose
otherwise, it's really not the
chairman's credit or fault, the
voters'

26:08.367 --> 26:12.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decision. The voters have made
their decision. And I think
that's what we're seeing both

26:12.738 --> 26:16.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Florida and in the Republican
Party generally. There is a
sense of inevitability.

26:16.508 --> 26:22.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was such a crushing victory
that Trump won on Tuesday in New
York. And when Ted Cruz,

26:22.881 --> 26:28.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the would-be alternative,
finishes a distant third, so far
out of the race, he's no longer

26:28.887 --> 26:33.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a plausible candidate himself.
He's just a vehicle to stop
Trump.

26:33.459 --> 26:38.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it looks like Indiana is the
last shot. I mean, Donald -- let
Trump be Trump. Donald

26:38.363 --> 26:45.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump has been this unbridled
person who has been -- totally
contradicted himself. His

26:45.237 --> 26:49.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
positions on issues, Judy, are
like the footprints at the
seashore's edge. They change
with the

26:49.174 --> 26:51.143 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tide.

26:51.143 --> 26:56.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're there today. They're
gone tomorrow. And it obviously
hasn't bothered them. It's

26:56.682 --> 27:02.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a personal choice on voters'
parts. And now he's going to
make a serious policy decision

27:02.688 --> 27:09.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- speech, rather, on gender and
foreign policy. And, you know, I
think we will just continue

27:09.661 --> 27:12.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to see new Trumps
from here forward.

27:12.631 --> 27:16.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you
mentioned a changing position.
He was -- one of the things that

27:16.935 --> 27:20.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he said in the -- I guess it was
on "The Today Show" yesterday,
David, was -- he was asked

27:20.906 --> 27:25.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about this North Carolina LGBT
law, the public -- using public
bathrooms.

27:25.511 --> 27:30.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he basically said the
Republican governor shouldn't
have changed the law, that he
should

27:30.182 --> 27:34.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have left way it was. And now
conservatives, Ted Cruz and
others, are coming back to say,

27:34.820 --> 27:35.921 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
this is not the
Republican position.

27:35.921 --> 27:37.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

27:37.623 --> 27:39.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, that law is so bad, now I
have to praise Donald Trump.

27:39.258 --> 27:39.858 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

27:39.858 --> 27:42.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And so he's right.

27:42.661 --> 27:46.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, he made the obvious
point. Is this really a problem
here? Like, are there a lot

27:46.398 --> 27:49.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of bathrooms at North Carolina
where people are scared to go
in? I don't think this is

27:49.701 --> 27:56.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a problem. This is -- this is
1980s socially conservative
culture war politics. Pick some

27:56.074 --> 27:59.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issue that seems like something
changing in the sexual
revolution and try to mobilize

27:59.745 --> 28:03.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the conservative base on the
basis of it. That's what it is.

28:03.916 --> 28:07.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Donald Trump, to his credit,
doesn't play that game. He has
moved on, as the Republican

28:07.753 --> 28:11.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Party should have moved on.
He's playing a different game.

28:11.123 --> 28:15.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, to his credit, he's not
playing that game. Now, it
should be said, people are
saying,

28:15.727 --> 28:19.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
oh, he's socially moderate. He's
socially moderate, but not in
the way liberal Republicans

28:19.531 --> 28:22.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are socially moderate or
moderate Republicans are.

28:22.935 --> 28:26.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's socially moderate in a
populist way, which is a
different sort of moderation,
but

28:26.271 --> 28:31.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he does end up moderate on a lot
of social issues. And to his
credit, he's just not stuck

28:31.543 --> 28:34.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the culture war. He is not
stuck in Jerry Falwell lands.

28:34.680 --> 28:38.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, we should
note, President Obama over in
London today in a news
conference,

28:38.350 --> 28:43.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mark, no surprise, criticized
the North Carolina law.

28:43.488 --> 28:47.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what -- you said a minute
ago that Trump -- or I thought
you said Trump is inevitable

28:47.025 --> 28:47.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
now. Is that really...

28:47.526 --> 28:49.027 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

28:49.027 --> 28:53.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think there is a
growing sense of inevitability.
I mean, he's going to sweep

28:53.865 --> 29:01.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Northeast. So, now you're
left with John Kasich, who's won
one state and has had two

29:01.006 --> 29:08.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
semi-weak seconds in New
Hampshire and New York, and a
lot of wonderful editorials, and

29:08.814 --> 29:13.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fawning praise from many in the
press. But there isn't anybody
standing between him and

29:13.518 --> 29:17.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the nomination, except
him, which he is.

29:17.489 --> 29:23.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the North Carolina thing,
Judy, it reminds me of the furor
-- remember Phyllis Schlafly

29:23.895 --> 29:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leading the charge about unisex
bathrooms, how they were a
threat to Western civilization.

29:28.300 --> 29:29.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She had obviously never
been in an airplane.

29:29.534 --> 29:31.003 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

29:31.003 --> 29:35.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Or, if she did,
she must have been uncomfortable
on long flights.

29:35.207 --> 29:43.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is a solution without a
problem. And, politically, where
Trump shows a certain

29:43.181 --> 29:48.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shrewdness is, he's come down on
the smart -- not only the right
side, the enlightened

29:48.220 --> 29:51.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
side, the smart side
politically. The business
community has moved as one
against this sort

29:51.690 --> 29:54.092 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of thing.

29:54.092 --> 29:59.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Governor Pat McCrory, the
Republican incumbent in North
Carolina, is now trailing in the

29:59.331 --> 30:05.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
latest Elon college poll Roy
Cooper, the Democratic attorney
general, and his job rating has
fallen

30:05.504 --> 30:08.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to its lowest point, as a
consequence in large part,
according to the pollsters, of
this

30:08.407 --> 30:09.908 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
whole brouhaha.

30:09.908 --> 30:11.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Could I just pick
up on the Trump evitability?

30:11.710 --> 30:13.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sure, yes.

30:13.311 --> 30:14.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I think he's
evitable, not inevitable.

30:14.513 --> 30:15.280 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

30:15.280 --> 30:16.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Because
it's likely...

30:16.615 --> 30:17.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We like it
when you make up words.

30:17.582 --> 30:18.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, I
just chopped them up.

30:18.750 --> 30:20.118 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

30:20.118 --> 30:23.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: He's likely
to get the nomination.

30:23.422 --> 30:28.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you should go back to these
delegate numbers. He still --
people have factored in the New

30:28.660 --> 30:32.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
York victory. He is going to do
well in Pennsylvania, Maryland,
Connecticut, all these states.
Indiana,

30:32.330 --> 30:35.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're not sure. There's a poll
that shows him up, but the
polling is bad in Indiana.

30:35.634 --> 30:38.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's hard to reach people
because of state law.

30:38.970 --> 30:43.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But say Cruz does well in
Indiana, and then say Cruz does
well in California, which is

30:43.575 --> 30:48.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
possible. And Trump would really
need a pretty significant
percentage of the delegates to

30:48.280 --> 30:52.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get over the top. And if you
look at the smartest analysis of
people who are breaking down --
there's

30:52.050 --> 30:55.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a guy named Sean Trende at
RealClearPolitics who is
breaking it down like
congressional

30:55.053 --> 30:58.056 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
district by
congressional district.

30:58.056 --> 31:03.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has him coming close, but,
and best-case scenario, getting
a majority of the delegates,

31:03.762 --> 31:08.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but easily not getting, easily
coming up short, and that --
maybe he can buy enough
delegates

31:08.667 --> 31:12.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get over the top but there is
still a significant, even a
50/50 chance he doesn't quite
get the

31:12.637 --> 31:15.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
delegates there. And
then he has to scramble.

31:15.540 --> 31:20.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I just want to
say, I defer to Sean Trende on
his knowledge of congressional

31:20.245 --> 31:22.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
districts and the politics.

31:22.514 --> 31:26.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What I said was, there was a
growing sense of inevitability.
I think the wind is going

31:26.585 --> 31:28.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to out of the sails of the
anybody-but-Trump movement.

31:28.620 --> 31:30.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Right.

31:30.422 --> 31:35.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Two quick other
things I have to ask you. Is
Bernie Sanders -- he didn't

31:35.026 --> 31:39.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do well in the state he was born
in, Mark, in New York. Hillary
Clinton won by 16 points.

31:39.798 --> 31:43.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What does Bernie Sanders want
right now, and can he get it?

31:43.001 --> 31:46.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Hillary Clinton
won a smashing victory in New
York. And I think she has a

31:46.238 --> 31:49.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
clear path to the nomination.

31:49.941 --> 31:56.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bernie Sanders has made history.
He will leave this campaign,
when he does, as the major

31:56.481 --> 32:02.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leader of a national movement.
He has changed the whole ethos
of the Democratic Party. The

32:02.287 --> 32:04.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democratic Party had argued, we
have to take big money, because,
otherwise, we're unilaterally

32:04.756 --> 32:07.526 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
disarmed.

32:07.526 --> 32:12.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a man who, with seven
million individual
contributions, has outraised
Hillary Clinton

32:12.164 --> 32:18.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with $182 million, and running
on issues of economic justice,
of inequality, of controlling

32:18.637 --> 32:24.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the banks. So, saying that the
message of representing the
small people, the message

32:24.509 --> 32:28.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Franklin Roosevelt, Teddy
Roosevelt, the malefactors of
great wealth driving the money

32:28.680 --> 32:33.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
changers out of the temples of
civilization, is all of a sudden
current and vital and relevant,

32:33.118 --> 32:34.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's an amazing achievement.

32:34.586 --> 32:37.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're saying the
Democratic Party has changed?

32:37.389 --> 32:43.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think Bernie
Sanders has given every Democrat
-- has robbed them of the excuse

32:43.228 --> 32:48.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we have to take big money,
we have to sort of mute our
social economic values message

32:48.767 --> 32:52.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just in order to mollify those
guys who write the big checks,
that there's an alternative

32:52.070 --> 32:53.772 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
move.

32:53.772 --> 32:55.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think he's changed that
dialogue and the terms of the
debate.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is that
enough for him, David?

32:57.943 --> 33:00.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I agree with Mark.
He has done that. It's not
enough for him. He's not going

33:00.912 --> 33:04.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to win the nomination. He just
doesn't have the delegates.

33:04.249 --> 33:08.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do think, if he continues to
fight -- and I don't think it's
likely -- the way he fought

33:08.286 --> 33:13.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in New York, he will end up
hurting his own movement. It
will end up seeing, oh, it
wasn't

33:13.091 --> 33:17.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the causes, it was about
Bernie, because, A, the highly
confrontational style he took

33:17.195 --> 33:20.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in New York didn't work.

33:20.465 --> 33:25.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, B, it will really begin to
do damage to their nominee.
Hillary Clinton is now having

33:25.170 --> 33:29.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to spend a lot of money in
places like New York and
Pennsylvania and California that

33:29.040 --> 33:31.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she will not need to spend money
in the fall, but she's having to
do that because he's pressing

33:31.877 --> 33:34.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her in those places.

33:34.646 --> 33:37.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he will begin to -- if he
keeps fighting, it will really
begin to drain her and it will

33:37.782 --> 33:39.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sour the mood around
him, I think.

33:39.684 --> 33:42.654 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
MARK SHIELDS: I
disagree. I really do.

33:42.654 --> 33:46.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think she's a better candidate
when she's in a competitive
situation. I think the New

33:46.992 --> 33:51.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
York campaign was New York
values. That's the kind of thing
New York races that we're

33:51.730 --> 33:56.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
used to. Whether it was for --
it didn't bring out him at his
best. He made the mistake of

33:56.401 --> 33:59.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thinking he was going to win and
saying he was going to win.

33:59.304 --> 34:04.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He should have played it as the
underdog. But I think he has not
made this a personal

34:04.509 --> 34:09.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign. He's never brought up
Bill Clinton's $500,000
speeches, 11 of them given to
foreign

34:09.681 --> 34:13.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
audiences while she was
secretary of state. He hasn't
charged her of being part of the

34:13.318 --> 34:16.488 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
1 percent and
living in a bubble.

34:16.488 --> 34:22.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He hasn't -- really has been on
the issues of economic loyalty
and on economic concentration.

34:22.427 --> 34:26.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We have about 10
seconds left, no time to ask you
about the new currency.

34:26.631 --> 34:28.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think you both probably think
it's too soon to put a woman on
our new bills, right, the

34:28.967 --> 34:30.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
$20, the $10, and the $5.

34:30.268 --> 34:31.169 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

34:31.169 --> 34:32.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: They're not
serious about this, are they?

34:32.604 --> 34:32.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will
talk about it next week.

34:32.804 --> 34:33.538 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

34:33.538 --> 34:34.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Thanks
for that, Judy.

34:34.706 --> 34:35.573 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

34:35.573 --> 34:48.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David
Brooks, Mark Shields.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.256 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Stay with us.

34:51.256 --> 34:56.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
what it will take to save
Alabama's largest river delta;

34:56.027 --> 34:59.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and paying tribute to the
music legend Prince.

34:59.998 --> 35:07.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: The U.S. is stepping
up its campaign in Somalia
against the terror group
Al-Shabaab,

35:07.372 --> 35:11.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but that fight will not be won
unless U.S. allies like Kenya
and others intensify their

35:11.476 --> 35:13.511 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
efforts.

35:13.511 --> 35:18.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In January, there was a big
setback to the mission, when
more than 100 Kenyan troops

35:18.550 --> 35:25.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
died on their base in Somalia, a
result of Al-Shabaab's deadliest
attack ever.

35:25.156 --> 35:29.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last week, the group released a
video of the operation. Now,
with the help of the Pulitzer

35:29.861 --> 35:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Center on Crisis Reporting,
special correspondent Nick
Schifrin looks at how Al-Shabaab
is winning

35:34.833 --> 35:38.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
both on the ground and
over the airwaves.

35:38.069 --> 35:43.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A warning: Some viewers may find
images in this story disturbing.

35:43.441 --> 35:53.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: It is 48 minutes
of violence, video game
graphics, and visions of
victory.

35:53.451 --> 35:57.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The video is pure propaganda,
full of fancy editing and
half-truths. But it's effective

35:57.722 --> 36:03.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at portraying Shabaab as
strong and Kenya as weak.

36:03.294 --> 36:05.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What do you see when
you watch this video?

36:05.530 --> 36:07.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CLINT WATTS, Former FBI
Investigator: The first thing
that you notice is, number one,

36:07.999 --> 36:11.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how many people they have moving
against this defensive position.

36:11.436 --> 36:14.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Clint Watts is a
former U.S. soldier and FBI
investigator. He's now a Shabaab

36:14.172 --> 36:16.141 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
expert.

36:16.141 --> 36:21.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINT WATTS: So, Kenyan forces
just getting annihilated here by
what is a seemingly ragtag

36:21.479 --> 36:24.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
group that was put
together on short notice.

36:24.482 --> 36:28.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you were with a competent
force, just like you see here in
this video with this vehicle

36:28.286 --> 36:31.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
running away, they should be
able to stand right there and
eliminate that entire force

36:31.222 --> 36:33.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
moving through the open.

36:33.792 --> 36:38.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: It was the
deadliest day in Kenyan military
history.

36:38.730 --> 36:41.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were vulnerable, not only
because of poor defenses, but
also because they haven't

36:41.132 --> 36:43.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
been on the offense.

36:43.234 --> 36:47.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINT WATTS: Any troops that are
out there just parked as sort of
a occupy and hope that

36:47.572 --> 36:50.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
peace will come are always
going to be vulnerable.

36:50.842 --> 36:54.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: African Union
troops pushed Shabaab out of its
strongholds five years

36:54.813 --> 37:00.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ago. Since then, the troops have
mostly remained in their bases.

37:00.051 --> 37:03.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's allowed Shabaab to launch
daily attacks and resurge.

37:03.221 --> 37:06.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LT. COL. EMMANUEL CHIRCHIR,
Kenyan Army: That particular
pause gave Al-Shabaab to regain

37:06.224 --> 37:09.461 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
its balance.

37:09.461 --> 37:13.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Kenyan Lieutenant
Colonel Emmanuel Chirchir was
the chief spokesman against
Shabaab.

37:13.631 --> 37:16.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In the El Adde attack,
he lost his brother Dan.

37:16.734 --> 37:24.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LT. COL. EMMANUEL CHIRCHIR: I
hear some people believe that,
when they die, they will meet

37:24.242 --> 37:27.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
virgins. That's what Al-Shabaab
believe. When Dan died, he met
God.

37:27.512 --> 37:32.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Dan Chirchir died
instantly. His funeral was held
with military honors.

37:32.250 --> 37:37.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Shabaab has attacked bases
before, but never with a car
bomb that exploded inside a base

37:37.088 --> 37:39.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for African Union troops,
known as AMISOM.

37:39.924 --> 37:43.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. COL. EMMANUEL CHIRCHIR: It's
a new experience, a new
challenge that AMISOM forces are
facing

37:43.261 --> 37:46.264 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as a whole.

37:46.264 --> 37:50.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In response to
Shabaab's resurgence, the U.S.
military has dramatically's
escalated

37:50.902 --> 37:55.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its own attacks. In just the
last seven weeks, U.S.
airstrikes and U.S.-backed
ground assaults

37:55.740 --> 37:59.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
have killed at least 190
Al-Shabaab fighters, more than
the total killed in the previous

37:59.110 --> 38:01.412 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nine years.

38:01.412 --> 38:04.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINT WATTS: The Kenyans have
taken a huge hit. You have got
to somehow back them up

38:04.883 --> 38:07.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and give them some reason to
believe that they're going to be
OK.

38:07.552 --> 38:10.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The U.S. now
calls these attacks
self-defense, because they
target Shabaab

38:10.989 --> 38:15.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fighters massing and presumably
preparing for an attack.

38:15.193 --> 38:18.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
General David Rodriguez is the
U.S.' top soldier in Africa.

38:18.763 --> 38:20.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEN. DAVID RODRIGUEZ, U.S.
Africa Command: They disperse
and attack and focus all that

38:20.665 --> 38:24.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
energy on one of the
forward operation bases.

38:24.669 --> 38:29.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But the previous
decade's worth of American
strikes couldn't prevent this

38:29.541 --> 38:33.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
horror. In fact, the Al-Shabaab
brigade that carried out the
attack is named after a Kenyan

38:33.778 --> 38:39.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Al-Shabaab commander killed
by a U.S. drone in 2009.

38:39.083 --> 38:43.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In Somalia, were you winning
most of the battles?

38:43.087 --> 38:48.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This man, whom we granted
anonymity, is a former member of
the same unit. He says
Al-Shabaab

38:48.159 --> 38:51.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would be losing if African
forces were more aggressive.

38:51.696 --> 38:56.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Most
of the time, we would look at
the enemy's strength and

38:56.467 --> 38:59.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leave. If a town was taken from
us, it was tough to retake it,
since they had aerial

38:59.204 --> 39:01.506 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
support.

39:01.506 --> 39:06.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Which is why the
U.S. is pushing and training
African troops to attack more.

39:06.811 --> 39:10.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LT. COL. EMMANUEL CHIRCHIR: So,
it becomes a kind of competition
in ensuring that you

39:10.748 --> 39:15.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are ahead of the enemy. And if
you are ahead of the enemy, you
will reduce this kind of

39:15.420 --> 39:17.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
-- any kind of threat.

39:17.922 --> 39:25.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But the video's
threat is also as a recruitment
tool to lure susceptible

39:25.230 --> 39:27.532 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
young men.

39:27.532 --> 39:32.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINT WATTS: You can watch this
as a potential recruit and be
like, I am going to be this

39:32.003 --> 39:36.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
guy on the battlefield. This is
something that excites me. And
I'm with my brothers

39:36.107 --> 39:40.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out here. And it's violent and
they're successful. So I want to
be part of a winning effort.

39:40.645 --> 39:43.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Did you like the
feeling of fighting with
al-Shabaab against the African

39:43.781 --> 39:45.650 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forces?

39:45.650 --> 39:49.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): It was
good. We were like brothers. In
the beginning, my morale

39:49.120 --> 39:51.789 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was high.

39:51.789 --> 39:55.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Shabaab
reinforces that by forcing
Kenyan soldiers to portray
themselves

39:55.460 --> 39:57.595 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as the losers.

39:57.595 --> 40:01.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We
were attacked and overrun by the
Muslims. They have defeated

40:01.366 --> 40:03.868 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

40:03.868 --> 40:07.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In response, the
African Union released its own
video showing the El Adde

40:07.739 --> 40:10.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
village recaptured.

40:10.008 --> 40:14.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NAKIBUS LAKARA, AMISOM: AMISOM
is not a peacekeeping mission.
AMISOM is a war-fighting
mission.

40:14.679 --> 40:18.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, from deployment, you
know you have come to fight.

40:18.483 --> 40:23.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But Shabaab uses
that same video to mock Kenya's
public relations attempts.

40:23.154 --> 40:25.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NAKIBUS LAKARA: So, from
deployment, you know you have
come to fight.

40:25.957 --> 40:30.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: We will fight them
deep in their hideouts.

40:30.862 --> 40:37.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Pointing out
Kenya's refusal, even to this
day, to release a death toll.

40:37.735 --> 40:40.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even Kenyans who support the
troops make the same exact
critique.

40:40.938 --> 40:43.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BONIFACE MWANGI, Anti-Corruption
Campaigner: Right now, what we
have now is propaganda

40:43.207 --> 40:47.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from Al-Shabaab. What we need is
the truth from the government.

40:47.145 --> 40:51.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Boniface Mwangi
is an anti-corruption
campaigner. He held a vigil for
the El Adde

40:51.115 --> 40:54.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
victims, but criticized the
government for withholding
details about how they died.

40:54.852 --> 40:57.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BONIFACE MWANGI: We are
celebrating the people who died,
and asking the generals and the

40:57.722 --> 41:01.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
commander in chief, what really
happened in Somalia? Tell us the
truth.

41:01.859 --> 41:05.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: As long as Kenya
declines to tell its side of the
story, Al-Shabaab wins

41:05.430 --> 41:08.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the battle and the
propaganda war.

41:08.299 --> 41:15.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Nick Schifrin in Nairobi.

41:15.640 --> 41:27.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This was an Earth
Day that got more attention than
many past, due in

41:27.318 --> 41:31.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
part to today's signing of
the global climate accord.

41:31.823 --> 41:36.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But for all of the celebrations
surrounding that, there's still
major concerns about what's

41:36.060 --> 41:40.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happening to the environment
and the impact of development.

41:40.231 --> 41:46.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That tension is playing out here
in Alabama, with one of the
country's preeminent naturalists

41:46.037 --> 41:50.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
calling for the creation of a
new protected area to cover a
critical waterway.

41:50.775 --> 41:53.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our report.

41:53.511 --> 42:00.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The Mobile-Tensaw
Delta, where five rivers meet in
Southern Alabama to drain

42:00.017 --> 42:07.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into the Gulf of Mexico, more
than 200,000 acres of bog,
marsh, swampland and floodplain,

42:07.658 --> 42:12.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
it's one of the most
biologically diverse places in
North America, home to scores of

42:12.029 --> 42:17.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
species of flowers, birds,
fish, turtles, and more.

42:17.001 --> 42:22.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
E.O. WILSON, Biologist: And
there are a tremendous variety
of plants and animals in it.

42:22.106 --> 42:27.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's also the
childhood playground of Edward
O. Wilson, where he searched out

42:27.578 --> 42:33.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
snakes and insects, and worked
as a 14-year-old counselor at
nearby Camp Pushmataha.

42:33.151 --> 42:39.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
E.O. WILSON: It was wartime. And
they didn't have any older,
smarter kids to be nature

42:39.157 --> 42:45.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
counselor. So, I just simply led
the boys through the whole
summer on expeditions searching

42:45.830 --> 42:52.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and capturing snakes. We built
up a fantastic collection of
different species of snakes.

42:52.437 --> 42:56.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And thus was born the
naturalist, and thus was born
the professor.

42:56.841 --> 43:01.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One of the
world's best-known professors, a
leading biologist and
naturalist,

43:01.312 --> 43:05.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and a two-time Pulitzer
Prize-winning author.

43:05.082 --> 43:11.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now 86, Wilson's quest is to
preserve the diversity of life
on the Earth, including

43:11.155 --> 43:14.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here in the delta, where he and
others have been lobbying for
the creation of a new national

43:14.459 --> 43:16.260 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
park.

43:16.260 --> 43:18.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BILL FINCH, Botanist: This is
golden club. It's just one of
the beautiful flowers. It's

43:18.963 --> 43:21.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
really a peculiar
flower, isn't it?

43:21.732 --> 43:25.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Working with
Wilson on the park effort, and
joining us in the Hurricane

43:25.069 --> 43:28.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bayou recently, was writer
and botanist Bill Finch.

43:28.840 --> 43:32.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BILL FINCH: It's a beautiful
spring day here on the Gulf
Coast.

43:32.243 --> 43:36.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Among his many
roles, Finch hosts a Sunday
morning call-in radio show

43:36.247 --> 43:40.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Mobile to talk nature,
gardening and the delta.

43:40.751 --> 43:43.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BILL FINCH: We will talk about,
what is the future of this
delta? What is the future of

43:43.754 --> 43:48.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mobile Bay? Will it still be
here in a few years for us?

43:48.793 --> 43:54.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Working in the
delta's favor, Finch says, is
its sheer size and power. The

43:54.165 --> 43:59.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
water is simply too wild to do
any major building here.
Moreover, the state government
has already

43:59.937 --> 44:05.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
protected tens of thousands of
acres through its Forever Wild
Land Trust, which uses taxes

44:05.276 --> 44:08.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on oil drilling to purchase
conservation lands.

44:08.546 --> 44:11.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BILL FINCH: We have done great
work protecting this floodplain.

44:11.148 --> 44:11.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: In
where we are now?

44:11.983 --> 44:14.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BILL FINCH: Where we are now.

44:14.051 --> 44:18.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The land wasn't expensive. It
wasn't hard to purchase. But not
everything lives in the

44:18.222 --> 44:22.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
floodplain. And even the turtles
who live here require the dry
land. What we have done

44:22.994 --> 44:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a terrible job of is preserving
the areas where people can
develop, the areas that are

44:29.333 --> 44:31.869 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
dryer than this.

44:31.869 --> 44:35.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Finch and Wilson
took us to an area that has been
protected, Splinter

44:35.206 --> 44:36.707 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hill Bog.

44:36.707 --> 44:40.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BILL FINCH: This is a leaf that
is meant to look like a flower.

44:40.578 --> 44:43.881 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Home to
carnivorous flowers like these
pitcher plants, which use decoy

44:43.881 --> 44:46.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
flowers to trap their prey.

44:46.317 --> 44:49.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BILL FINCH: And the insects
crawl in and can't get back out.

44:49.921 --> 44:54.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The bog also
contains a longleaf pine forest,
which Finch says is vital
habitat

44:54.559 --> 44:57.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for bears and other species.

44:57.929 --> 45:04.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this is a relatively small
area, and Finch's real concern
is development, which, among

45:04.402 --> 45:11.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other things, replaces soil,
plants and natural water ecology
with concrete and asphalt,
sending

45:11.409 --> 45:17.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mud and debris rushing into the
delta, clouding the water and
killing plant and animal life.

45:17.048 --> 45:19.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So what do you want to see?
What kind of federal...

45:19.383 --> 45:23.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BILL FINCH: You know,
there's lots of ways.

45:23.254 --> 45:27.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have tried to do it alone as
a state. We have tried to get
some federal money. But

45:27.825 --> 45:32.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there's lots of opportunities
for getting more federal support
for what we're doing,

45:32.663 --> 45:37.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and for getting federal
attention for one of the most
diverse areas in North America.

45:37.702 --> 45:41.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, you know, the National
Park Service provides some
opportunities for that.

45:41.939 --> 45:46.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In 2013, the
Mobile County Commission
endorsed a plan to study the
impact

45:46.844 --> 45:51.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of a national park. But even
that has drawn opposition.

45:51.449 --> 45:55.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: If we give the federal
government the power to protect
the delta, they are subject

45:55.419 --> 45:57.455 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to abusing it.

45:57.455 --> 46:00.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MERCERIA LUDGOOD, Mobile County
Commissioner: Didn't grow up
fishing or in boats. And -- but

46:00.891 --> 46:03.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when I became a commissioner,
this was part of my district.

46:03.828 --> 46:08.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Merceria Ludgood
is a Mobile county commissioner
who favors the study,

46:08.165 --> 46:12.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but knows that many of her
constituents will be wary of
going further.

46:12.303 --> 46:16.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MERCERIA LUDGOOD: You will have
the people on the one side who
don't know anything about

46:16.707 --> 46:21.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the delta, its environmental
implications for quality of life
here. All they see is,

46:21.746 --> 46:22.680 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we need a job.

46:22.680 --> 46:24.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

46:24.448 --> 46:29.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MERCERIA LUDGOOD: And so the
conversation then gets
fractured, and you have the
people

46:29.120 --> 46:32.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who want development, who want
the jobs on one side, and the
environmentalists on the

46:32.423 --> 46:37.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other side. And what we have got
to find is a way to marry that.

46:37.528 --> 46:42.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Opposition in
this deeply conservative state
also comes from suspicions of
any federal

46:42.466 --> 46:46.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intervention, especially one
that could limit hunting and
fishing, sports popular in the

46:46.437 --> 46:48.139 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
delta.

46:48.139 --> 46:49.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS ELLIOTT, Baldwin County
Commissioner: The short answer
for why not a national park

46:49.774 --> 46:52.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
here is, it's not necessary.

46:52.376 --> 46:57.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Chris Elliott is
a commissioner in Baldwin
County, across from Mobile and

46:57.114 --> 47:00.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
home to many new housing and
commercial developments.

47:00.251 --> 47:05.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS ELLIOTT: The people of
South Alabama have traditionally
opposed increased federal

47:05.356 --> 47:10.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government oversight over our
areas. And we just don't think
it's necessary here in South

47:10.127 --> 47:14.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Alabama. We're doing a fine job
protecting this natural resource
on our own.

47:14.131 --> 47:19.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He points to
efforts like the state's Forever
Wild Land Trust, as well as

47:19.437 --> 47:25.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to local agencies like the
Mobile Bay Estuaries Program,
which in this large subdivision
has

47:25.643 --> 47:30.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been working to mitigate storm
water drainage problems caused
by poor planning in the 1970s.

47:30.881 --> 47:33.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERTA SWANN, Director, Mobile
Bay National Estuary Program:
You can't just go in and

47:33.117 --> 47:37.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
restore a stream. You have to
strengthen its ability to handle
those larger quantities

47:37.722 --> 47:39.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of storm water runoff.

47:39.623 --> 47:43.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Roberta Swann is
director of the estuaries
effort.

47:43.461 --> 47:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERTA SWANN: This is not a
natural stream restoration. This
is an enhanced stream
restoration.

47:48.466 --> 47:55.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are rocks in here that are
not native. And the reason why
it's not a true stream

47:55.072 --> 47:58.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
restoration is because we have
to accommodate the impacts of
humans on the environment.

47:58.542 --> 47:59.610 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
If we...

47:59.610 --> 48:01.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Because
that's inevitable.

48:01.445 --> 48:05.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERTA SWANN: It's inevitable.
And if we were to turn the delta
into a national park,

48:05.950 --> 48:10.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we would lose the ability to
mitigate the human impacts on
that ecosystem.

48:10.488 --> 48:14.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Agreement on the
need to protect a precious
natural resource, but vast
differences

48:14.658 --> 48:17.261 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on how to do it.

48:17.261 --> 48:20.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
E.O. WILSON: That was part of
the story of how many species
you can get packed into a

48:20.164 --> 48:20.765 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
small area.

48:20.765 --> 48:22.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BILL FINCH: Get packed in there.

48:22.299 --> 48:26.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Bill Finch and
Edward Wilson want to limit some
development, but see a

48:26.570 --> 48:32.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
potential compromise with
hunters and fishers in a
National Wildlife Refuge
designation

48:32.409 --> 48:35.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that would still allow
those sports to continue.

48:35.412 --> 48:39.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BILL FINCH: There are a lot of
options out there that we can
explore that allow us to

48:39.850 --> 48:46.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have it all in many ways, to do
the things we're doing now, to
have the kind of careful

48:46.090 --> 48:51.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
human use of the delta that we
have got now, but still preserve
our biodiversity.

48:51.162 --> 48:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And for Ed
Wilson, finding a way to protect
the delta of his youth is

48:56.066 --> 49:01.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
part of a much larger goal of
setting aside half the Earth for
habitat, one which begins

49:01.272 --> 49:04.108 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with a lesson in humility.

49:04.108 --> 49:11.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
E.O. WILSON: There are about two
million species known worldwide
of all kinds of organisms.

49:11.982 --> 49:17.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the total number of species
is probably close to 10 million
worldwide, meaning we

49:17.087 --> 49:26.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have only discovered, much less
studied, about 20 percent of all
the species. So, here is

49:26.363 --> 49:31.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a world that is waiting for
exploration, and that's just the
beginning.

49:31.569 --> 49:41.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm Jeffrey Brown in
the Mobile-Tensaw River Delta.

49:41.378 --> 49:53.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Remembrances
continued to pour in today for
singer and songwriter Prince,

49:53.390 --> 49:57.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who died yesterday at
his home in Minnesota.

49:57.461 --> 50:00.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even President Obama paused to
reflect on the superstar's
legacy during his news
conference

50:00.898 --> 50:02.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in London.

50:02.633 --> 50:05.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: He put out great
music and he was a great

50:05.035 --> 50:07.238 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
performer.

50:07.238 --> 50:12.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a remarkable loss. And I'm
staying at Winfield House, the
U.S. ambassador's residence.

50:12.176 --> 50:19.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It so happens our ambassador has
a turntable, and so this
morning, we played "Purple Rain"

50:19.149 --> 50:23.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and "Delirious" just to get
warmed up before we left the
house for important bilateral

50:23.387 --> 50:24.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
meetings like this.

50:24.255 --> 50:26.223 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

50:26.223 --> 50:30.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Obama's
tribute was one of many from
friends and fans alike.

50:30.427 --> 50:34.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's a collection.

50:34.698 --> 50:41.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From the New Orleans Superdome,
to San Francisco's City Hall,
landmarks across the country lit

50:41.171 --> 50:47.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up in Prince's signature color
purple last night to honor the
iconic musician. But, for

50:47.945 --> 50:54.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many, remembering the superstar
meant celebrating the songs that
were his life's work.

50:54.451 --> 51:03.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Minnesota, thousands flooded
into downtown Minneapolis to
dance the night away outside

51:03.727 --> 51:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the nightclub where his movie
"Purple Rain" was filmed, while,
in New York, hundreds turned

51:10.000 --> 51:16.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out for a street party hosted by
filmmaker and Prince friend
Spike Lee.

51:16.707 --> 51:24.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
