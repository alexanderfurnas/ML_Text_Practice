GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill. Judy Woodruff is

00:06.139 --> 00:11.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
away. On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Brussels in lockdown. Belgian

00:11.545 --> 00:15.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
authorities remain on high alert
after a terrorist threat similar

00:15.515 --> 00:19.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Paris. We look at what the
U.S. and others can and should

00:19.353 --> 00:24.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be doing to stop ISIS. Also
ahead, it's Politics Monday. We

00:24.291 --> 00:27.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
look at how the politics of fear
is shaping the presidential

00:27.661 --> 00:32.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaign. And could tobacco
plants be key to finding a

00:32.332 --> 00:35.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
treatment for Ebola? KEVIN
WHALEY, Developed ZMapp: In a

00:35.969 --> 00:39.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vaccine, you give a person a
protein that stimulates your own

00:39.740 --> 00:43.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
body to make antibodies. In this
case, we're giving antibodies

00:43.977 --> 00:46.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
directly to you, so your body
doesn't have to make them. GWEN

00:46.780 --> 00:49.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:49.850 --> 00:54.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
(BREAK) GWEN IFILL: Police in
Belgium charged a fourth suspect

01:05.666 --> 01:09.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the Paris attacks today. The
suspect was swept up in a

01:09.202 --> 01:13.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
24-hour dragnet, but was the
only person charged. Fifteen

01:13.273 --> 01:16.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
others were released. The prime
minister decided to keep

01:16.476 --> 01:19.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Brussels on its highest state of
alert through at least next

01:19.713 --> 01:23.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
week. We have a report from Emma
Murphy of Independent Television

01:23.450 --> 01:27.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
News in Brussels. EMMA MURPHY: A
European capital city, rush hour

01:27.821 --> 01:31.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Monday morning, whatever the
threat is, the government

01:31.124 --> 01:34.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
believed it is so serious that
much of normal life has given

01:34.962 --> 01:41.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way to abnormality. Armored
vehicles patrol empty and closed

01:41.535 --> 01:44.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shopping streets. There are
soldiers on most junctions, and

01:45.005 --> 01:48.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in such a climate all places
where lots of people can gather,

01:48.842 --> 01:53.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like universities, schools and
nurseries, are shut. This isn't

01:53.146 --> 01:57.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a city in fear, but it is a city
in flux. MAN: It's necessary.

01:57.284 --> 02:02.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's necessary to have this
security because the people, I

02:02.222 --> 02:05.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think, feel safer with this kind
of security. WOMAN: I feel if

02:06.026 --> 02:10.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the policeman -- but if I do
feel safe -- I will be glad when

02:10.764 --> 02:14.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm home. EMMA MURPHY: It is
affecting everyone's life,

02:14.267 --> 02:18.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mainly the small everyday things
like nursery for Nathaniel, fine

02:18.305 --> 02:20.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for one day, but challenging if
it goes on. CHARLOTTE MCDONALD

02:20.974 --> 02:23.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GIBSON, Belgium: We just can't
do the simple day-to-day things

02:23.710 --> 02:26.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that you usually do. And there's
police everywhere, even in my

02:26.313 --> 02:29.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
neighborhood, which is quite
suburban, quite leafy. It's not

02:29.883 --> 02:32.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the sort of center of town,
but there's police on the

02:32.419 --> 02:34.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
streets. There's police cars
occasionally closing off the

02:34.621 --> 02:37.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
roads around here. So it's very
unusual. EMMA MURPHY: How long

02:37.257 --> 02:41.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it goes on depends in part on
this man, Salah Abdeslam. He

02:41.495 --> 02:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
still evades capture. He is part
of this terror threat, but the

02:46.066 --> 02:48.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
action of the government here
suggests there is something for

02:49.002 --> 02:52.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than him for them to contend
with. GWEN IFILL: Because of

02:52.506 --> 02:55.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ongoing terrorist attacks around
the world, the State Department

02:55.642 --> 02:59.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
issued a worldwide travel alert
for U.S. citizens this evening,

02:59.379 --> 03:02.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
citing increased threats. It
directed Americans to -- quote

03:02.949 --> 03:06.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- "exercise vigilance in public
places or when using public

03:06.920 --> 03:10.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
transportation." It also
suggested avoiding large crowds,

03:10.257 --> 03:13.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
particularly during the holiday
season. The alert is set to

03:14.027 --> 03:17.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
expire in three months.
Meanwhile, in a southern suburb

03:17.531 --> 03:21.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Paris, police said a street
cleaner found an explosive belt

03:21.435 --> 03:25.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a pile of rubble, but without
its detonator. French President

03:25.038 --> 03:28.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Francois Hollande and British
Prime Minister David Cameron

03:28.241 --> 03:31.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
each laid a single flower
outside the Bataclan concert

03:31.745 --> 03:35.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hall, where 89 people were
killed. Later, Cameron urged the

03:35.749 --> 03:39.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
British Parliament to join
France in the fight against the

03:39.319 --> 03:41.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Islamic State. DAVID CAMERON,
British Prime Minister: Later

03:41.321 --> 03:43.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this week, I will set out in
Parliament our comprehensive

03:43.857 --> 03:48.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
strategy for tackling ISIL. I
firmly support the action that

03:48.462 --> 03:52.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Hollande has taken to
strike ISIL in Syria and it's my

03:52.699 --> 03:56.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
firm conviction that Britain
should do so too. GWEN IFILL:

03:56.136 --> 03:59.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The French Defense Ministry said
it has launched its first

03:59.039 --> 04:02.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
airstrikes from the aircraft
carrier Charles de Gaulle,

04:02.175 --> 04:06.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bombing Islamic State targets in
Ramadi and Mosul, Iraq. France

04:06.680 --> 04:11.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has already carried out strikes
against ISIS targets in Syria.

04:11.284 --> 04:14.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Syria was at the top of the
agenda for a meeting between

04:14.521 --> 04:17.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russian President Vladimir Putin
and Iran's supreme leader,

04:17.991 --> 04:21.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The two
leaders met in Iran. Both have

04:22.028 --> 04:25.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been staunch supporters of
Syrian President Bashar

04:25.265 --> 04:30.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
al-Assad, and today Khamenei
criticized U.S. efforts to begin

04:30.170 --> 04:35.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
peace talks. Migrants stuck in
limbo along the Greek-Macedonian

04:35.275 --> 04:38.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
border stepped up their protests
today, staging hunger strikes

04:38.812 --> 04:42.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and blocking trains. They're
mostly economic refugees who

04:42.048 --> 04:45.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have been denied entry by Balkan
countries because they're not

04:45.652 --> 04:49.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fleeing war. Hundreds gathered
behind gates and barbed-wire

04:49.556 --> 04:53.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fences, shouting at police.
Others taped or even sewed their

04:53.760 --> 04:57.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mouths shut in a sign of
protest. Flags flew at

04:57.631 --> 05:01.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
half-staff in the West African
nation of Mali today to begin

05:01.434 --> 05:04.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
three days of mourning for the
victims of Friday's attack on a

05:04.871 --> 05:08.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
luxury hotel there. State
television aired photos of the

05:08.141 --> 05:11.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
corpses of two of the suspected
gunmen, appealing for

05:11.178 --> 05:14.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
information on their identities.
Three separate groups have

05:14.748 --> 05:17.851 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
claimed responsibility for the
deadly siege that left 20

05:17.884 --> 05:22.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people, plus the two attackers,
dead. In Nigeria and Cameroon,

05:22.689 --> 05:26.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
five suicide bombers, all girls,
killed 12 people over the

05:26.927 --> 05:30.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weekend. The attacks happened at
an entry to Nigeria's

05:30.163 --> 05:33.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
northeastern city of Maiduguri,
and just across the border in

05:33.900 --> 05:37.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cameroon. Police blamed Boko
Haram, the Islamic extremist

05:38.004 --> 05:42.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
group whose six-year campaign of
violence has killed 20,000

05:42.242 --> 05:46.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people. Voters in Argentina have
ushered in a new era, electing

05:46.580 --> 05:50.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their first conservative
president in 12 years. Last

05:50.450 --> 05:54.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
night, Mauricio Macri danced on
stage with his family at his

05:54.087 --> 05:57.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Buenos Aires headquarters. The
right-wing mayor of Buenos Aires

05:57.424 --> 06:01.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
beat the ruling party's nominee
in a runoff, after promising to

06:01.127 --> 06:03.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
boost the economy and fight
corruption. MAURICIO MACRI,

06:03.530 --> 06:05.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President-Elect of Argentina
(through translator): The

06:05.532 --> 06:07.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
quality that we have, us
Argentineans, we have to finally

06:07.934 --> 06:12.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
put it to work for our future. I
want to say to you today as well

06:12.339 --> 06:15.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as to our brothers of Latin
America and to our brothers of

06:15.642 --> 06:18.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the world that we want to have
good relationships with all the

06:18.378 --> 06:21.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

all of you. GWEN IFILL: Macri

06:21.615 --> 06:24.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

inherits a country with 30

06:24.818 --> 06:28.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
percent inflation and stagnant
economic growth. Back in this

06:28.922 --> 06:31.825 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country, police in New Orleans
are trying to find out what

06:31.858 --> 06:34.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sparked a gun battle in a
crowded city park last night.

06:34.861 --> 06:38.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hundreds had gathered for an
evening block party at a local

06:38.131 --> 06:42.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
playground when gunfire rang
out. At least 17 people were

06:42.102 --> 06:45.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wounded in the crossfire. Today,
New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu

06:45.739 --> 06:48.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
called on witnesses to come
forward. MITCH LANDRIEU (D),

06:48.241 --> 06:50.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana:
Here's the message to the guys

06:50.243 --> 06:53.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

You can't run, you can't hide.

06:53.046 --> 06:55.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to find you. We're

06:57.584 --> 07:04.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
behind bars for our safety and
yours. But, in order to do this,

07:04.557 --> 07:08.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we need the community. There is
only so much the police can do.

We need the community to help us

11:20.547 --> 11:25.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the debate over how the United
States and other nations should

respond to a global terror
organization that's expanding

yesterday, President Obama
pledged to take the fight to the

15:16.916 --> 15:21.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Islamic State. The terror
attacks in Paris, which led to a

15:21.921 --> 15:26.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wider European alert, follow 16
months of airstrikes against

15:26.793 --> 15:32.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria.
The assault slowed the group's

15:32.532 --> 15:36.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
territorial expansion, but the
president insists U.S.

15:36.302 --> 15:41.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
involvement will not include
direct ground combat. BARACK

OBAMA: Destroying ISIL is not
only a realistic goal. We're

16:20.112 --> 16:25.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to get it done, and we're
going to pursue it with every

17:04.323 --> 17:09.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
aspect of American power. The
United States will continue to

17:38.357 --> 17:43.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lead this global coalition. We
are intensifying our strategy on

18:12.358 --> 18:17.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all fronts with local partners
on the ground. GWEN IFILL: The

18:27.907 --> 18:32.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S. role in battling ISIS has
evolved in recent months. There

18:40.920 --> 18:45.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are more than 3,000 American
troops in Iraq providing

18:51.564 --> 18:56.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
logistical training and combat

19:01.040 --> 19:06.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
commandos stormed an ISIS prison
in Iraq last month, rescuing

19:12.885 --> 19:17.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dozens of men. And, earlier this
month, the president announced

19:24.730 --> 19:29.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that 50 U.S. special operations
troops would be heading to

19:36.575 --> 19:41.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Syria. But the U.S. policy of
incremental involvement has been

19:48.421 --> 19:53.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
questioned by the president's
political opponents and even by

some of his former appointees.
Two former defense secretaries

amount of force. LEON PANETTA,

Former U.S. Secretary of
Defense: The U.S. has to lead in

20:48.781 --> 20:53.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this effort, because what we
have learned a long time ago is,

21:02.995 --> 21:09.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if the United States doesn't
lead, nobody else will. We are

21:09.435 --> 21:11.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to have to commit
additional resources to this

21:11.437 --> 21:13.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
effort. We're hitting some
targets, but airstrikes alone

21:13.539 --> 21:19.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are not going to win here. CHUCK

pretty clear that ISIS

21:30.756 --> 21:36.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
represents the real threat to

GWEN IFILL: Jim Jeffrey, let's

23:02.881 --> 23:05.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
break this up into two parts,
the military and diplomatic

23:05.317 --> 23:08.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
options. We hear a lot about
boots on the ground, commitment

23:08.754 --> 23:12.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of U.S. forces. Is that the only
thing we should be thinking

23:12.291 --> 23:14.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about? Is that where the debate
is right now? JAMES JEFFREY: In

23:14.660 --> 23:20.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
terms of taking down ISIS as a
state and as an army, we have to

23:20.232 --> 23:23.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
go on the offensive. That
requires ground troops. We have

23:23.636 --> 23:28.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tried for 15 months to create a
set of ground troops from the

23:28.274 --> 23:30.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
units and entities and forces on
the ground that we have. It

23:30.276 --> 23:32.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
isn't working all that well. We
don't have the time to keep

23:32.278 --> 23:34.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
trying to do this. Some
insertion of U.S. forces, both

23:34.280 --> 23:36.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as advisers, special forces and
some ground maneuver units are

23:36.282 --> 23:38.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
absolutely necessary to move
this forward. GWEN IFILL:

Quantify what you mean by some.

Jack Keane in congressional

23:46.692 --> 23:53.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about two brigades to be
deployed, and that would be

23:53.399 --> 23:58.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about 10,000 combat troops to
stand by to move forward if

24:01.073 --> 24:05.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
needed as we try this expanded
incremental approach that the

24:05.577 --> 24:08.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president is suggesting. GWEN
IFILL: John Mearsheimer, this is

24:08.247 --> 24:11.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
called having skin in the game,
theoretically. What are the

24:11.483 --> 24:13.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opportunities for that and what
are the risks? JOHN MEARSHEIMER,

24:13.852 --> 24:16.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
University of Chicago: Well, I
think there is virtually no

24:16.188 --> 24:19.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
chance that we're going to put
large-scale ground forces in

24:19.325 --> 24:23.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Syria, and President Obama has
made it clear that he's not

24:23.162 --> 24:25.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to do that. And the
principal reason is you would

24:25.764 --> 24:29.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have to put a lot of ground
troops in to defeat ISIS. And

24:29.468 --> 24:33.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there is no question that if you
put 100,000, 150,000 troops in

24:34.006 --> 24:35.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there, you could defeat ISIS,
but then you run into the

24:36.008 --> 24:38.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what-next question. What are we
going to do, stay in there and

24:38.911 --> 24:41.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
occupy the place? And the end
result will be dealing with

24:41.580 --> 24:44.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
insurgents, won't know how to
get out and will just make a bad

24:44.883 --> 24:48.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
situation worse. So it's quite
clear to me that there is no way

24:48.520 --> 24:52.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we can defeat ISIS from the air
or with ground forces. And,

24:52.758 --> 24:55.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
therefore, we have to find some
sort of diplomatic solution.

24:55.494 --> 24:58.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, before we get
to the diplomatic, what are the

24:58.263 --> 25:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
options here? Are we talking
about occupation? Is that

25:01.333 --> 25:05.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inevitable? JOHN MEARSHEIMER:
No, occupation is not

25:05.104 --> 25:09.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inevitable. And I don't believe
we will end up occupying Syria,

25:09.808 --> 25:13.445 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because we have tried this
before, in both Afghanistan and

25:13.479 --> 25:16.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Iraq, and it didn't turn out
very well. And we would be

25:16.815 --> 25:20.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
remarkably foolish to try to
duplicate that task. And there

25:20.853 --> 25:23.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is no way we can win this one
with airpower alone. The only

25:23.956 --> 25:29.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hope is that Assad's forces can
be rebuilt, to the point where

25:29.428 --> 25:32.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they can deal with ISIS, and
then we can get out of the

25:32.464 --> 25:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
region militarily. GWEN IFILL:
Let me ask you both this

25:34.933 --> 25:38.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
question. You know that Francois
Hollande is coming to Washington

25:38.103 --> 25:40.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tomorrow, going to meet with the
president. What should he be

25:40.105 --> 25:42.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
asking for? JAMES JEFFREY: What
he will be asking for is a far

25:42.875 --> 25:46.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
more aggressive American
campaign against ISIS, because,

25:46.578 --> 25:50.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if he doesn't get a yes, an
affirmative answer to that, he's

25:50.282 --> 25:53.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to in any case go off to
Moscow and ask the same thing of

25:53.318 --> 25:57.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Putin. Putin has perhaps
one-tenth of our military

25:57.289 --> 26:00.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
capabilities, but Putin will
give him an affirmative on a

26:00.759 --> 26:03.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very aggressive campaign against
ISIS. So, we're going to have

26:03.328 --> 26:05.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that one way or the other. GWEN
IFILL: John Mearsheimer, what do

26:05.364 --> 26:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you think that Hollande should
be or will be asking for? JOHN

26:08.033 --> 26:10.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MEARSHEIMER: Well, first of all,
I think that what he should ask

26:10.903 --> 26:15.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for is a coalition that includes
the United States, the Russians,

26:15.707 --> 26:19.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Iran and a number of other
actors in the region to work for

26:19.545 --> 26:23.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the purposes of propping up the
Assad government. The only hope

26:23.315 --> 26:27.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we have here is to prop up Assad
and make him powerful enough

26:27.920 --> 26:30.889 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that he can deal with ISIS. That
way, we don't have to put in

26:30.923 --> 26:33.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ground forces. And the Russians
of course are not going to put

26:33.492 --> 26:38.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in ground forces themselves. So
the only hope is Assad. But the

26:38.363 --> 26:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
principal problem we face is
that the United States is

26:41.099 --> 26:44.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
incapable of working with the
Russians. We still continue to

26:44.536 --> 26:47.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pursue this policy where we're
trying to topple Assad and the

26:48.006 --> 26:51.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russians are trying to support
Assad. This is crazy, because

26:51.343 --> 26:54.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we're working at cross-purposes
and, if anything, we're just

26:54.279 --> 26:57.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to make the war worse and
that is going to play to ISIS'

26:57.116 --> 27:00.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
advantage. I think Hollande
understands this. GWEN IFILL:

27:00.486 --> 27:02.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let me stay with you, Mr.
Mearsheimer, for a moment,

27:02.488 --> 27:04.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because you brought up the
question of diplomatic

27:04.490 --> 27:07.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
solutions. Do we have time to
pursue that? We're right in the

27:07.559 --> 27:10.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
middle of this now. JOHN
MEARSHEIMER: Well, we really

27:10.729 --> 27:13.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have no choice. There is no
simple military solution. There

27:13.665 --> 27:16.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is nothing the Americans or the
Russians can do militarily to

27:16.702 --> 27:19.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
win this, because we're not
willing to commit ground forces,

27:19.171 --> 27:22.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for good reasons. So, what we
have to do is, we have to work

27:22.941 --> 27:27.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with Assad and we have to create
a situation where he's powerful

27:27.179 --> 27:31.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
enough to push back ISIS and
then work to get some sort of

27:31.650 --> 27:35.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
peace settlement in the region.
It's going to be remarkably

27:35.621 --> 27:38.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
difficult to do, in large part
because, as I said, the

27:38.790 --> 27:42.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Americans are incapable of
working with the Russians. GWEN

27:42.060 --> 27:46.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IFILL: Ambassador Jeffrey, let's
talk about this Assad question.

27:46.832 --> 27:48.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's clear that we're not on the
same side of the discussion with

27:48.834 --> 27:50.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russia on Assad. And you just
heard what Mr. Mearsheimer said

27:50.836 --> 27:54.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about, hey, listen, let's forget
about this idea of ousting Assad

27:54.573 --> 27:57.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for now. What do you think?
JAMES JEFFREY: Gwen, in this

27:57.142 --> 28:00.245 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
business, we can never be
totally sure, but I'm about as

28:00.279 --> 28:03.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sure as I ever can be that, if
we tried to throw our weight

28:03.415 --> 28:07.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
behind this unholy coalition of
Assad, the Russians and the

28:07.519 --> 28:11.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Iranians, we would ensure that
ISIS will not only survive, but

28:11.523 --> 28:15.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prosper, because the entire Arab
Sunni world and Turkey will

28:15.561 --> 28:19.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
throw their weight against us on
this. This is a double-barreled

28:19.765 --> 28:23.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
problem we have, the Assad
regime, which helped create ISIS

28:23.802 --> 28:28.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and is now supported by Russia
and Iran, and ISIS itself. The

28:28.106 --> 28:31.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way to do this is to keep Assad
out of the battle and take the

28:31.610 --> 28:36.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fight to ISIS. ISIS has 30,000
troops. We have about 200,000 or

28:38.650 --> 28:41.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
300,000 of our allied troops,
but they don't have the

28:41.887 --> 28:43.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
capability to take the offensive
without America leading. GWEN

28:43.989 --> 28:46.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IFILL: Let me ask you. And I
want to ask this also to Mr.

28:46.592 --> 28:50.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mearsheimer. What is our
long-term or even our short-term

28:50.395 --> 28:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
strategic objective in Syria?
Why should we be more involved?

28:55.067 --> 28:57.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES JEFFREY: First of all...
JOHN MEARSHEIMER: Well, I

28:57.369 --> 28:59.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think... JAMES JEFFREY: ... it's
in the center of the Middle

28:59.371 --> 29:01.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
East. Secondly, we have allies
to the north in Turkey, to the

29:01.373 --> 29:04.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
south in Israel and Jordan, and
we have extraordinary interests

29:04.643 --> 29:07.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that President Obama has
emphasized time and time again.

29:07.646 --> 29:10.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He acknowledges that we are
fighting a war against ISIS. His

29:10.849 --> 29:13.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
goal is to destroy it. He said
that again yesterday. The

29:13.619 --> 29:17.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
question is how to do that. And
our long-term goals are to try

29:17.589 --> 29:21.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to bring some kind of
resurrection of the state system

29:21.727 --> 29:24.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in these very, very fragile
countries, because they can't

29:24.262 --> 29:26.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stand up against these movements
otherwise. GWEN IFILL: John

29:26.965 --> 29:29.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mearsheimer? JOHN MEARSHEIMER:
First of all, I don't believe

29:29.201 --> 29:32.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the United States has any
strategic interest in Syria. I

29:32.671 --> 29:36.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think, from a strategic point of
view, Syria is an insignificant

29:36.341 --> 29:39.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country. It's not like Iraq or
Iran that have lots of oil.

29:39.845 --> 29:44.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Second, I think the principal
two reasons that we should want

29:44.616 --> 29:48.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to shut down this conflict as
soon as possible is, number one,

29:48.453 --> 29:51.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for humanitarian reasons -- this
is a human rights disaster --

29:51.523 --> 29:55.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and, secondly, because if we
don't stem the flow of refugees

29:55.260 --> 29:58.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into Europe, it's going to cause
all sorts of problems in Europe.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You can already see that
happening. So we have a

30:00.799 --> 30:03.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deep-seated interest, I think
not for strategic reasons, but

30:03.535 --> 30:06.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for human rights reasons and
because of Europe, to do what we

30:06.538 --> 30:09.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can to end this one as quickly
as possible. But I don't think

30:09.808 --> 30:13.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's going to happen, because
I think the ambassador's view of

30:13.078 --> 30:17.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dealing with the Russians is
correct in the minds of most

30:17.282 --> 30:20.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Americans. And most people
disagree with what I say. And,

30:20.519 --> 30:24.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
therefore, we won't work with
the Russians and we won't solve

30:24.089 --> 30:27.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this problem. It will only get
worse. More Syrians will die and

30:28.026 --> 30:30.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more refugees will go into
Europe. GWEN IFILL: Interesting

30:30.929 --> 30:33.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
listening to you argue against
your own point of view there.

University of Chicago, thank you

30:54.586 --> 30:57.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the U.S. should play in the
fight against ISIS has also

30:57.589 --> 31:01.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

growing. They're in Afghanistan.
ISIS is now on the ground in

like Marco Rubio today in Iowa,

31:25.650 --> 31:29.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are pouncing on fears about ISIS
to flex ideological and

31:29.788 --> 31:33.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
political muscle. Republicans in
particular have strong

31:33.358 --> 31:37.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
motivation. In a new
ABC/"Washington Post" poll, when

31:37.162 --> 31:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
asked for their top issue, just
18 percent of voters who lean

31:41.500 --> 31:45.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democratic named terrorism. The
number was more than twice as

31:45.470 --> 31:49.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
high, 42 percent, for those
leaning Republican. Both volume

31:49.941 --> 31:53.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and controversy are increasing.
Speaking in Alabama over the

31:53.545 --> 31:56.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

31:59.451 --> 32:03.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
watched when the World Trade
Center came tumbling down. And I

32:03.755 --> 32:07.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
watched in Jersey City, New
Jersey, where thousands and

32:07.993 --> 32:12.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
thousands of people were
cheering as that building was

32:12.898 --> 32:15.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
coming down. LISA DESJARDINS:

know, the police say that didn't

32:19.971 --> 32:21.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happen. And all those rumors
have been on the Internet for

32:21.973 --> 32:25.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some time. So did you misspeak
yesterday? DONALD TRUMP: It did

32:25.377 --> 32:27.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happen. I saw it. It was on
television. I saw it. GEORGE

remember Muslims celebrating

32:33.385 --> 32:38.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

mistrust and concern. But it is

32:38.456 --> 32:43.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also complicated. In a new CBS
poll of Iowa Republicans, 74

32:43.962 --> 32:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
percent supported sending ground
troops to fight ISIS, but less

32:47.866 --> 32:51.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than half said the Paris attacks
have any influence on their

32:51.469 --> 32:54.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vote. Meanwhile, Democrats like
Hillary Clinton are using

32:54.973 --> 32:59.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
foreign policy and Republican's
rhetoric on refugees as their

32:59.077 --> 33:02.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
own foil. She tweeted out over
the weekend: "Our values are

33:02.681 --> 33:06.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stronger than fear. Slamming the
door on refugees isn't who we

33:06.618 --> 33:10.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are." The war against ISIS is
hitting familiar lines in the

For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa

Desjardins. GWEN IFILL: So, it's
Politics Monday. Amy Walter of

33:17.829 --> 33:20.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Cook Political Report and
Tamara Keith of NPR are here to

33:20.632 --> 33:23.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
talk about it all. Let's start
with where Hillary Clinton left

33:23.635 --> 33:26.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
off, talking about basically the
politics of fear. How much of

33:26.738 --> 33:30.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that is a major feature now of
this campaign, Amy? AMY WALTER,

33:30.675 --> 33:34.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Cook Political Report: Well,
I think we're definitely hearing

33:34.145 --> 33:36.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a lot more about it because it's
in the news right now. And yet,

33:36.715 --> 33:40.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at the same time, what we know
about this campaign is that what

33:40.051 --> 33:45.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans are talking about
and what's really important to

33:45.390 --> 33:47.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them in their primary is very
different from what Democrats

33:47.392 --> 33:49.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say is really important to them.
The issue of terrorism and

33:49.394 --> 33:51.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
security has always been an
important issue for Republicans,

33:51.396 --> 33:53.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
even before these attacks in
Paris. It's now, of course,

33:53.398 --> 33:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
taking more import. Among
Democrats, the economy, health

33:55.834 --> 33:58.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
care always a more important
issue. I think terrorism will

33:58.336 --> 34:01.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
move up there now, but not to
the extent it is with

34:01.406 --> 34:05.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans. And on the issue of
Syrian refugees, you ask

34:05.110 --> 34:08.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans how they feel about
it, 80 percent say, we don't

34:08.513 --> 34:11.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
want them here at all; 65
percent of Democrats say, we

34:11.716 --> 34:14.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
should bring them in, so just
two entirely different worlds.

34:14.653 --> 34:17.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: There is definitely
an us vs. them theme emerging

34:17.555 --> 34:21.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that is in this campaign, at
least right this moment. Who's

34:21.326 --> 34:24.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
playing it best or the most, I
should say? TAMARA KEITH,

34:24.696 --> 34:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
National Public Radio: Well,
certainly, people like Donald

34:27.699 --> 34:30.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump is -- is playing it up big
time. Ben Carson is also playing

34:30.802 --> 34:35.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into that. But even Marco Rubio
came out with an ad where he

34:35.307 --> 34:39.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very clearly said this is a
fight of civilizations, this is

34:39.044 --> 34:43.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
between the left and our ideals
and Islamic extremism on the

34:43.782 --> 34:46.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other side, of course, using the
term Islamic extremism and also

34:46.985 --> 34:50.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at the end of that ad saying
they want to attack us because

34:50.121 --> 34:52.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we want girls to go to school.
GWEN IFILL: But we just saw what

34:52.824 --> 34:56.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Amy said about the numbers; 83
percent of people in the CBS

34:56.294 --> 35:00.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
poll, I guess -- CBS poll --
fear an imminent attack. So

35:00.432 --> 35:04.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
maybe they're speaking in a real
way to voters' fears in a way

35:04.569 --> 35:07.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that counts. AMY WALTER: Well,
what they're speaking to right

35:07.672 --> 35:09.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now definitely -- and this is
especially true among

35:09.975 --> 35:14.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans -- is to a base that
feels like this president has

35:14.446 --> 35:18.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not done the job necessary to
deal with terrorism, to deal

35:18.550 --> 35:21.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with security in any way, and
the frustration that they're

35:21.586 --> 35:24.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
feeling that this has been sort
of this wishy-washy foreign

35:24.556 --> 35:28.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
policy, there is no resolution,
it's all nebulous. That's why

35:28.126 --> 35:30.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when you hear Donald Trump
coming out with the -- this is

35:31.029 --> 35:32.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what we're going to do, we're
going to bomb the you-know-what

35:33.031 --> 35:35.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out of ISIS, we just need to
bomb the oil fields, it is going

35:35.600 --> 35:39.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be easy, we just need to be
strong, it speaks to a

35:39.671 --> 35:43.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republican electorate that feels
as if the president has sort of

35:43.608 --> 35:45.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
squandered away American power.
TAMARA KEITH: And this at the

35:45.910 --> 35:48.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
same time that President Obama
is saying, well, we just have to

35:48.113 --> 35:50.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stay the course, we can
intensify, but the strategy

35:50.815 --> 35:55.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
needs to remain the strategy.
And that is not very satisfying.

35:55.086 --> 35:59.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you are afraid, if you saw
the beheading videos before and

35:59.824 --> 36:04.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you are seeing this violence in
France, and you want something,

36:04.896 --> 36:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then bomb the expletive deleted
out of them is a lot more

36:08.633 --> 36:11.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
satisfying than, well, the
strategy that many don't agree

36:11.803 --> 36:14.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with, we're going to stick with
it, but maybe intensify a

36:14.105 --> 36:17.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
little. GWEN IFILL: And,
tonight, the State Department

36:17.509 --> 36:19.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
puts out a worldwide travel
alert. Now we -- how does that

36:19.511 --> 36:21.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
work, however, for Hillary
Clinton, because she's a former

36:21.513 --> 36:24.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
State Department -- secretary of
state, worked in the Obama

36:24.783 --> 36:28.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
administration? Yet polls say
two things. One is that they

36:28.219 --> 36:32.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think that she is strong. The
other is that they don't trust

36:32.157 --> 36:34.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
her. TAMARA KEITH: And those --
she's had a trust issue for a

36:34.993 --> 36:38.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
long time in her polling. She, I
think, feels like -- for

36:38.763 --> 36:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whatever reason, feels like she
is strongest when she is talking

36:41.966 --> 36:45.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about economic issues, talking
about empathizing with the

36:45.503 --> 36:49.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
concerns of families. She gave a
big speech late last week about

36:49.474 --> 36:54.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
her plan for ISIS. She came out
strong. She came out asking for

36:54.546 --> 36:57.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than President Obama
wanted. She talked about no-fly

36:57.215 --> 37:02.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
zones in Syria. She talked about
needing more special operations

37:03.021 --> 37:07.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ground forces to maybe even call
in airstrikes. So she went a

37:07.525 --> 37:10.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
little bit further than the
president, but I think she would

37:10.395 --> 37:13.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be perfectly happy, for whatever
reason, mostly talking about

37:13.865 --> 37:16.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
domestic issues, in part because
that's where the Democratic

37:16.968 --> 37:19.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
electorate is. AMY WALTER: And,
in part -- I think's that's

37:19.137 --> 37:21.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
exactly right -- and in part
because there is not a good

37:21.139 --> 37:23.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
answer. GWEN IFILL: Yes. AMY
WALTER: And we saw it in the

37:23.308 --> 37:26.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
debate, the last debate we had
for the Democrats. When asked

37:26.744 --> 37:29.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about ISIS, there wasn't a
really good answer out of

37:29.848 --> 37:33.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary Clinton. When asked
about her role in Libya, there

37:33.184 --> 37:37.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wasn't a really good answer from
Hillary Clinton. GWEN IFILL: But

37:37.789 --> 37:39.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think about the conversation
we're actually having,

37:39.791 --> 37:41.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
especially on the Republican
side, admittedly. We should

37:41.793 --> 37:43.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bloom the bleep out of them, we
should surveil mosques, we

37:43.795 --> 37:47.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
should track refugees. Compare
that to what George W. Bush said

37:47.932 --> 37:52.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the following week after 9/11,
2001. We have a little bit of

37:52.504 --> 37:55.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it. GEORGE W. BUSH, Former
President of the United States:

37:55.840 --> 38:00.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These acts of violence against
innocents violate the

38:00.078 --> 38:04.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fundamental tenets of the
Islamic faith. And it's

38:04.883 --> 38:08.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
important for my fellow
Americans to understand that.

38:10.388 --> 38:17.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The face of terror is not the
true faith of Islam. That's not

38:17.262 --> 38:22.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what Islam is all about. Islam
is peace. These terrorists don't

38:25.803 --> 38:31.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
represent peace. They represent
evil and war. GWEN IFILL: Now

38:31.075 --> 38:34.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
how things have changed,
especially for a party which

38:34.045 --> 38:38.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
identified itself after its last
election as its goal for the

38:38.516 --> 38:41.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
next election being more open
and tolerant. AMY WALTER: Right.

38:41.719 --> 38:44.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, to be fair, a lot of this
energy right now is coming from

38:44.589 --> 38:48.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one person, and that's Donald
Trump talking about mosques and

38:48.193 --> 38:51.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
talking about celebration in the
streets of New Jersey when the

38:51.796 --> 38:54.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
towers came down. That didn't
really happen. (CROSSTALK) GWEN

38:54.732 --> 38:56.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IFILL: Yes. AMY WALTER: But --
so a lot of that is coming

38:56.734 --> 38:59.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
specifically from him. But I
think, to a broader point, where

38:59.404 --> 39:03.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you are hearing about a clash of
civilizations, radical Islam, it

39:03.508 --> 39:07.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is -- I think it goes back at
President Obama, and this real

39:07.946 --> 39:11.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deep disdain, frustration,
whatever you want to call it,

39:11.216 --> 39:15.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
probably deeper, stronger word
than that, about the president's

39:15.420 --> 39:18.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
handling of this issue, how he's
handled the Middle East, how

39:18.323 --> 39:22.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's handled foreign policy. And
I think that's a lot of why the

39:22.627 --> 39:25.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rhetoric that you heard from
President Bush sounds very

39:25.430 --> 39:27.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
different from the rhetoric of
the Republicans. And, remember,

39:27.498 --> 39:31.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Republican Party, hard to
think, that was 2001, how much

39:31.402 --> 39:34.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
further to the right Republicans
have moved and how much further

39:34.505 --> 39:36.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the left the Democrats have
moved just in those 15 years.

39:37.008 --> 39:39.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And there is also
this element, though, that

39:39.477 --> 39:41.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
George W. Bush was the
president. He was the leader of

39:42.013 --> 39:44.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Republican Party. These
people are running for

39:44.082 --> 39:47.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president. Those are very
different motives. There's very

39:47.352 --> 39:50.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
different things driving a
presidential candidate and a

39:50.722 --> 39:53.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president of the United States.
GWEN IFILL: Is it also part --

39:53.358 --> 39:56.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
partly in the interest of some
of these candidates to wind this

39:56.961 --> 40:00.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into the immigration debate,
something which has really

40:00.698 --> 40:03.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
worked for candidates like
Donald Trump, but not only

40:03.568 --> 40:06.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump, also worked for
Ted Cruz, also worked for Marco

40:06.938 --> 40:10.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rubio? AMY WALTER: Yes, there is
definitely a message that is

40:10.275 --> 40:14.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
being sent that there are unsafe
people out there, and if you put

40:14.746 --> 40:18.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats in charge, they are
not going to keep you safe.

40:18.416 --> 40:21.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Right? That's the number one job
that government is there to do.

40:21.686 --> 40:24.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's the one thing that
Republicans can agree on, that

40:24.922 --> 40:27.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the role of government is to
keep people safe. They disagree

40:27.692 --> 40:30.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with a lot of the other roles of
government, but that one,

40:30.862 --> 40:34.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
absolutely. And so what you're
going to see and the question I

40:34.299 --> 40:37.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think that you were raising
before is, how do you transition

40:37.268 --> 40:41.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from this kind of rhetoric in a
primary to going to a general

40:41.306 --> 40:45.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
election, where you do have to
look presidential and unify the

40:45.376 --> 40:47.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country? We hear over and over
-- I'm sure you do, too -- from

40:47.845 --> 40:50.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
voters the frustration they have
with the dysfunction in

40:50.381 --> 40:52.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Washington, the frustration they
have that we have a country

40:52.950 --> 40:55.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's pulling apart. Who's
going to be the unifier?

40:55.620 --> 40:58.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
(CROSSTALK) GWEN IFILL: OK.
Well, we didn't even get to talk

40:58.323 --> 41:00.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about the Louisiana governor's
race, but we will get back to

41:00.892 --> 41:05.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that at another time. Amy Walter
and Tamara Keith, thank you both

41:05.496 --> 41:10.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very much. AMY WALTER: Thank
you. TAMARA KEITH: You're

41:13.304 --> 41:20.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
welcome. GWEN IFILL: Stay with
us. Coming up on the "NewsHour":

41:20.144 --> 41:23.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
story time as a method for
learning English; and from the

41:23.781 --> 41:28.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bookshelf, "Black Flags," how
the rise of ISIS came to be.

41:28.820 --> 41:31.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, first, we turn to the
search for a treatment for

41:31.155 --> 41:34.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ebola. West Africa is still
dealing with the aftermath of

41:34.692 --> 41:37.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the worst outbreak of the
disease in recorded history.

41:37.929 --> 41:41.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Last week, Liberia reported a
handful of new cases, just

41:41.933 --> 41:44.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
months after the World Health
Organization said the country

41:44.702 --> 41:48.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was free of the disease. And
this weekend, not one, but two

41:48.339 --> 41:52.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
panels said the WHO needs to
substantially reform and change

41:52.844 --> 41:55.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the way it deals with
international health crises.

41:55.780 --> 41:59.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Special correspondent Mary Jo
Brooks has a report on the hunt

41:59.484 --> 42:04.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to finally stop the virus. MARY
JO BROOKS: It looks like an

42:04.956 --> 42:08.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ordinary greenhouse filled with
plants basking under light, but

42:08.292 --> 42:12.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at this facility just outside
Owensboro, Kentucky, the plants

42:12.830 --> 42:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
themselves have become a labor
force, working around the clock

42:16.334 --> 42:19.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to manufacture a cure for Ebola.
HUGH HAYDON, CEO, Kentucky

42:19.804 --> 42:22.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bioprocessing: These plants are
27 days old. MARY JO BROOKS:

42:22.840 --> 42:25.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Three days earlier, these plants
were injected with a genetic

42:25.843 --> 42:28.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
blueprint for one of three
antibodies used in the

42:28.646 --> 42:33.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
experimental drug ZMapp. Hugh
Haydon of Kentucky Bioprocessing

42:33.184 --> 42:36.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
explains how it works. HUGH
HAYDON: The plant recognizes

42:36.621 --> 42:40.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that gene and its machinery
turns on and it starts to

42:40.725 --> 42:44.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
manufacture that protein for us.
And it's really that simple. It

42:44.996 --> 42:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
becomes a little bitty factory.
MARY JO BROOKS: ZMapp was still

42:49.233 --> 42:53.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the developmental stage when
Ebola first broke out in West

42:53.504 --> 42:57.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Africa in March of 2014. The
disease has since claimed more

42:57.141 --> 43:00.445 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than 10,000 victims. But a
handful of people were

43:00.478 --> 43:04.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
successfully tweeted with ZMapp,
including Dr. Kent Brantly. DR.

43:04.382 --> 43:08.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KENT BRANTLY, Ebola Survivor:
Today is a miraculous day. I am

43:08.419 --> 43:13.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thrilled to be alive, to be well
and to be reunited with my

43:13.291 --> 43:15.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
family. MARY JO BROOKS: Since
then, the drug has being

43:15.960 --> 43:19.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
undergoing clinical trials in
West Africa and the FDA has

43:19.263 --> 43:23.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
granted it fast-track approval
status. Larry Zeitlin and Kevin

43:23.434 --> 43:26.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Whaley are the scientists from
San Diego who developed the

43:26.137 --> 43:29.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ZMapp antibodies, which were
designed to quickly attack the

43:29.574 --> 43:32.376 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ebola virus. KEVIN WHALEY,
Developed ZMapp: In a vaccine,

43:32.410 --> 43:36.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you give a person a protein that
stimulates your own body to make

43:36.614 --> 43:41.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
antibodies. In this case, we're
giving antibodies directly to

43:41.219 --> 43:43.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you, so your body doesn't have
to make them. LARRY ZEITLIN,

43:43.321 --> 43:45.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Developed ZMapp: And unlike the
vaccine, where it takes you

43:45.723 --> 43:48.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weeks to months to build up
protective immunity, as soon as

43:48.559 --> 43:51.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the antibodies are provided to
the patients, they're protected

43:51.996 --> 43:56.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against that disease. MARY JO
BROOKS: Speed is the name of the

43:56.534 --> 44:00.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
game in fighting infectious
disease. And it is the reason

44:00.304 --> 44:04.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that Whaley and Zeitlin decided
to manufacture their drug using

44:04.075 --> 44:06.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
plants, rather than the
traditional animal protein

44:06.711 --> 44:10.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
method. They chose an Australian
relative the American tobacco

44:10.114 --> 44:14.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
plant in a process that is quick
and relatively simple. Just

44:14.452 --> 44:17.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
three weeks after the seeds go
into the soil, the plants are

44:17.722 --> 44:21.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mature enough to be dipped into
a liquid which contains proteins

44:21.058 --> 44:25.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be replicated. The plants
grow those proteins for another

44:25.096 --> 44:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
week, and then are harvested and
chopped up. The resulting green

44:28.799 --> 44:32.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
liquid is filtered and tested
and, by day 40, it's ready to be

44:32.403 --> 44:35.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shipped out. HUGH HAYDON: It's a
very fast system. And if it's

44:35.540 --> 44:38.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
faster, it costs a little bit
less on the front end

44:38.709 --> 44:41.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
particularly. It gives you a lot
of flexibility in terms of

44:41.879 --> 44:45.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
developing a product. You get
your protein. You look at your

44:45.049 --> 44:48.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
protein. Is it what you wanted?
If it doesn't have the exact

44:48.486 --> 44:51.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
characteristics that you want,
you do it again. You reengineer

44:51.355 --> 44:55.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it and do it again until you get
exactly where you want to be.

44:55.393 --> 44:58.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARY JO BROOKS: The system of
biofarming could be useful for a

44:58.729 --> 45:02.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
number of drug therapies that
must ramp up production quickly.

45:02.233 --> 45:07.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Canadian company Medicago
uses tobacco plants to

45:07.271 --> 45:10.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
manufacture flu vaccine, which
needs to change seasonally. At

45:10.975 --> 45:15.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
its large greenhouse in
Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina,

45:15.613 --> 45:18.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
workers and robots tend to the
growing plants. DR. MICHAEL

45:18.816 --> 45:20.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SCHUNK, Vice President of
Operations, Medicago: They

45:20.818 --> 45:22.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
produce the vaccine over about a
week. MARY JO BROOKS: So it's a

45:22.820 --> 45:25.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very quick, efficient process.
DR. MICHAEL SCHUNK: It's very

45:25.323 --> 45:27.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quick, very efficient, very
adaptable. MARY JO BROOKS:

45:27.325 --> 45:29.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Michael Schunk is the vice
president of operations. DR.

45:29.327 --> 45:31.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL SCHUNK: This plant
technology can respond in about

45:31.696 --> 45:36.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
half the time of the traditional
flu manufacturing technologies,

45:36.834 --> 45:40.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so that's what started us into
the flu, and we have just

45:40.671 --> 45:45.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
continued to grow with that.
MARY JO BROOKS: Medicago is in

45:45.209 --> 45:48.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the final stage of clinical
trials to receive FDA approval

45:48.679 --> 45:52.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for its flu vaccine. Once
granted, the company says it

45:52.483 --> 45:56.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will be able to make 30 million
doses a year. It has also begun

45:56.287 --> 46:01.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
producing an Ebola drug similar
to ZMapp. Both Medicago and

46:01.359 --> 46:04.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kentucky Bioprocessing received
Defense Department money to

46:04.729 --> 46:08.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
develop their pharmaceuticals.
The hope is that the technology

46:08.599 --> 46:12.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could be used to quickly counter
a pandemic or bioterrorism

46:12.103 --> 46:15.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attack. DR. MICHAEL SCHUNK: This
facility is about 27,000 square

46:15.640 --> 46:19.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
feet. MARY JO BROOKS: But
Michael Schunk says the

46:19.110 --> 46:21.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
technology holds promise for all
kinds of drugs. He's especially

46:21.112 --> 46:24.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
optimistic that developing
nations will use this method to

46:24.115 --> 46:27.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
manufacture vaccines on their
own soil, since the cost of

46:27.518 --> 46:30.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
building the facilities is much
less than traditional drug

46:30.454 --> 46:34.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
factories. DR. MICHAEL SCHUNK:
This is not a very complicated

46:34.458 --> 46:38.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
technology. It's certainly
transportable. Every country has

46:38.929 --> 46:44.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
greenhouses, so every country
has the potential to have a

46:44.902 --> 46:49.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
facility that can be used to
produce vaccines that maybe are

46:49.807 --> 46:53.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
more a concern to that
particular country. MARY JO

46:53.844 --> 46:56.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BROOKS: Schunk and other
biofarming proponents predict

46:56.647 --> 47:01.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that soon drugs to treat herpes,
HIV, MRSA, and other infectious

47:01.252 --> 47:05.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
diseases will routinely be grown
in plants. Of course, the irony

47:05.956 --> 47:09.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of using a version of tobacco to
save lives is not lost on

47:09.994 --> 47:13.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anyone, including Hugh Haydon.
HUGH HAYDON: There is some

47:13.297 --> 47:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
irony. There is no question
about that. But what our

47:16.133 --> 47:20.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
business is about and what we
have -- what we have always been

47:20.838 --> 47:25.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about is using the plant to
create things and to do positive

47:25.176 --> 47:28.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things. Our focus has been
biopharmaceuticals and using the

47:28.412 --> 47:32.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
plant to yield those kind of
proteins. And it works really

47:32.383 --> 47:37.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
well for that. MARY JO BROOKS:
Biopharmaceuticals, plants that

47:37.221 --> 47:41.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one day could be used routinely
to wipe out infectious diseases.

47:41.726 --> 47:45.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Mary
Jo Brooks in Owensboro,

47:45.496 --> 47:50.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kentucky. GWEN IFILL: Last week,
we took you to a middle school

48:01.112 --> 48:04.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Houston that's trying to
bridge the education gap for

48:04.482 --> 48:08.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
refugee children newly arrived
in the U.S. Tonight, we return

48:08.352 --> 48:11.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Texas to examine another
program that's helping some of

48:11.555 --> 48:15.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the state's youngest newcomers
learn English. April Brown has

48:15.793 --> 48:19.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our American Graduate report, a
public media initiative funded

48:19.897 --> 48:24.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting. MARY JO BROOKS:

48:24.802 --> 48:29.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Charlie Lewong (ph) may be short
on English skills right now, but

48:35.746 --> 48:40.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's giving it his best shot.
Charlie, whose family speaks

48:42.887 --> 48:46.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Vietnamese at home, has just
created his own medieval world

48:46.423 --> 48:49.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inside this classroom at the
Gabriela Mistral Center for

48:49.794 --> 48:53.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Early Childhood in Houston. At 4
years old, Charlie is already

48:53.831 --> 48:56.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
working on his second language.
And that's even before he has

48:56.767 --> 49:00.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mastered his first. It's
something he has in common with

49:00.171 --> 49:02.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nearly all of the kids he goes
to school with. LORI ESPINOZA,

49:02.940 --> 49:05.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gabriela Mistral Center for
Early Childhood: What is he

49:05.643 --> 49:08.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doing? STUDENT: He's getting the
keys. MARY JO BROOKS: This

49:08.612 --> 49:12.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
classroom is where Lori Espinoza
brings stories to life, as her

49:12.316 --> 49:15.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pre-K students are eager to go
along for the ride. Espinoza

49:16.020 --> 49:22.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
teaches at the school's OWL Lab,
the Oral and Written Language

49:22.726 --> 49:25.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Laboratory, which uses
storytelling and dramatic play

49:25.830 --> 49:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to get kids talking. It builds
on research that shows a

49:29.266 --> 49:32.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
storytelling curriculum can
significantly improve vocabulary

49:32.937 --> 49:36.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and literacy. That's especially
important for students whose

49:36.273 --> 49:39.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
families don't speak language at
home, where language skills

49:39.310 --> 49:44.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first develop. LORI ESPINOZA: We
have like over 20 languages

49:44.215 --> 49:47.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
represented in our school.
Children here speak English,

49:47.651 --> 49:51.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Spanish, Italian, Arabic. MARY
JO BROOKS: Because these

49:51.956 --> 49:55.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
youngsters are new to school and
many new to the country, the

49:55.326 --> 49:58.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
classroom is designed so kids
feel safe and comfortable. LORI

49:58.329 --> 50:01.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ESPINOZA: The classroom looks
super homey. That's intentional.

50:01.332 --> 50:04.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have wicker baskets. We have
nice carpets that are a warm

50:04.835 --> 50:07.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
feeling, because we want
children to come in and feel

50:07.471 --> 50:10.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like this could be their living
room, so the children feel more

50:10.241 --> 50:13.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at ease and more like they're
just hanging out with family.

50:13.077 --> 50:18.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEBBIE PAZ, Rice University: We
know that oral language is the

50:21.285 --> 50:24.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
foundation for everything that
will happen later on. It's what

50:24.488 --> 50:26.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they will need for reading and
writing later on. MARY JO

50:26.924 --> 50:29.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROOKS: Debbie Paz is the
associate director of early

50:29.159 --> 50:32.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
literacy and bilingual programs
at Houston's Rice University,

50:32.863 --> 50:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which worked with the school to
create the OWL Lab five years

50:36.000 --> 50:38.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ago. DEBBIE PAZ: So, if we fill
the room with things that get

50:38.068 --> 50:41.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them excited that they want talk
to us about, there's more of a

50:41.205 --> 50:43.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
chance that we're going to
develop those language skills.

50:43.807 --> 50:45.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Different stations
around the room allow children

50:45.910 --> 50:49.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to make choices about what to do
and many encourage them to

50:49.313 --> 50:52.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
explore different ways to tell a
story. Goldilocks and the Three

50:52.983 --> 50:56.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bears, for example, can be acted
out with costumes and props in

50:56.253 --> 50:59.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one area. WOMAN: Mama bear made
some hot porridge. APRIL BROWN:

50:59.757 --> 51:02.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Or with little dolls in a
somewhat miniature home. LORI

51:02.559 --> 51:06.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ESPINOZA: A huge component of
this room is giving children

51:06.130 --> 51:10.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
enough freedom, enough things
that they want to do, so that

51:10.367 --> 51:12.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they can build that
self-regulation. And so I think

51:12.937 --> 51:17.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that independence is huge. Their
self-esteem gets higher and

51:17.508 --> 51:23.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their motivation to learn goes
up. APRIL BROWN: One station in

51:23.180 --> 51:26.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
particular builds on the first
word many children learn through

51:26.450 --> 51:29.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what's called environmental
print, like the names of

51:29.420 --> 51:31.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
restaurants or stores. LORI
ESPINOZA: That's the print

51:31.622 --> 51:37.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's all over the place, that
is just plastered on walls,

51:37.127 --> 51:39.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
science room buildings,
everywhere. That may not be

51:39.863 --> 51:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
intentionally placed there for
children to read, but it's

51:42.666 --> 51:45.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there. APRIL BROWN: On their
regular visitation days, the

51:45.703 --> 51:48.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
school shares lessons with
parents on how to use those

51:48.472 --> 51:52.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
words to get kids talking.
Debbie Paz says parents are also

51:52.509 --> 51:55.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
encouraged to share their own
stories about the culture in

51:55.079 --> 51:58.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their homeland or how they made
the journey to America, whether

51:58.582 --> 52:00.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or not they speak English.
DEBBIE PAZ: They're not

52:00.851 --> 52:03.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
necessarily readers and writers,
but they want -- they have a

52:03.420 --> 52:05.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
story to tell. And they want you
to hear that story, because it's

52:05.990 --> 52:07.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something that they're proud of.
APRIL BROWN: And you hope their

52:07.992 --> 52:10.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
children tell the stories too.
DEBBIE PAZ: Exactly. Exactly.

52:10.694 --> 52:13.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Four-year-old Sujon
(ph) is Gursharam Salh's second

52:13.731 --> 52:17.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
daughter to spend time in this
classroom. Salh says after

52:17.167 --> 52:21.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
visiting the OWL Lab, Sujon now
has much higher expectations for

52:21.171 --> 52:23.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
story time at home. GURSHARAM
SALH, Parent: Making your voice

52:23.874 --> 52:26.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
high or low, that is not good
enough. They want you to like go

52:26.977 --> 52:31.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
around the room and do walks
around and actions. APRIL BROWN:

52:31.782 --> 52:35.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The OWL Lab was never intended
to benefit only students at this

52:35.452 --> 52:38.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
school. Because it's a
laboratory, many teachers from

52:38.589 --> 52:41.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all over the Houston Independent
School District come here to

52:41.625 --> 52:45.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
learn these techniques. Some
come in for short professional

52:45.162 --> 52:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
development sessions and others,
like Carin Malmer, visit

52:49.066 --> 52:52.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
regularly as part of Rice
University's Early Literacy

52:52.403 --> 52:56.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Leadership Academy. On this day,
Malmer came in to learn new ways

52:56.874 --> 53:00.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to get parents involved and
excited about their children's

53:00.244 --> 53:02.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
education. CARIN MALMER,
Teacher: Parents have a really

53:02.246 --> 53:06.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
important role in the child's
education. And so, with this

53:06.216 --> 53:09.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
program and with things that I'm
learning with the early literacy

53:09.420 --> 53:14.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
program, I want to bring them
and make them feel important as

53:14.725 --> 53:19.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
well as feel comfortable to
volunteer. APRIL BROWN: Of

53:19.196 --> 53:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
course, the W. in OWL Lab stands
for writing. And children write

53:23.734 --> 53:27.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their stories, with adults
taking dictation. LORI ESPINOZA:

53:27.571 --> 53:32.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You just see children just so
willing to take risk, so excited

53:32.676 --> 53:36.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to learn language, so excited to
share stories in their home

53:36.713 --> 53:39.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
language and even attempt it in
English for those

53:40.017 --> 53:42.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
English-language learners. APRIL
BROWN: English-language learners

53:42.619 --> 53:46.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like Charlie, who Espinoza says
couldn't speak a record of it

53:46.056 --> 53:51.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when he came to school. For the
"PBS NewsHour," I'm April Brown

53:58.502 --> 54:03.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Houston. GWEN IFILL: Finally
tonight, we return to the

54:06.610 --> 54:10.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
challenge of ISIS, but this time
to a look at its beginnings. The

54:10.614 --> 54:14.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
story is told in a new book,
"Black Flags: The Rise of ISIS."

54:14.718 --> 54:18.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Author Joby Warrick has covered
national security and the Middle

54:18.355 --> 54:21.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
East for The Washington Post. He
talked with Jeffrey Brown at

54:21.725 --> 54:26.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this weekend's Miami Book Fair.
JEFFREY BROWN: Welcome to you.

54:26.630 --> 54:29.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOBY WARRICK, Author, "Black
Flags: The Rise of ISIS": Thank

54:29.199 --> 54:31.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you, Jeffrey. JEFFREY BROWN:
Could not be more current, of

54:31.201 --> 54:33.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
course. We will get to current
events, but you are, in this

54:33.203 --> 54:35.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
book, looking at the backstory
of what led to today. JOBY

54:35.205 --> 54:37.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARRICK: Yes. I think a lot of
people -- to a lot of people,

54:37.207 --> 54:39.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that ISIS seemed to come out of
nowhere last year. And the truth

54:39.776 --> 54:42.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is, there is a very long and
complicated story behind this

54:42.412 --> 54:44.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
organization. It's quite
different from al-Qaida. It's

54:44.414 --> 54:47.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
always been a different stripe,
but its story goes back into

54:47.851 --> 54:51.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prisons in Jordan in the 1990s
and with individuals who became

54:51.788 --> 54:55.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
radicalized and became very
different from this message of

54:55.292 --> 54:57.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
al-Qaida about sort of driving
out their Western powers from

54:57.895 --> 55:00.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Middle East. But they wanted
to create a caliphate, this

55:00.531 --> 55:02.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
powerful idea. (CROSSTALK)
JEFFREY BROWN: From the

55:02.533 --> 55:04.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
beginning? JOBY WARRICK: From
the beginning. It was kind of

55:04.902 --> 55:07.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something that morphed as they
went along, but the idea was to

55:07.571 --> 55:10.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do something here and now, not
worry about far enemies, not

55:10.541 --> 55:13.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
worry about the Western powers,
but try to create this holy

55:13.310 --> 55:16.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
state, this holy empire. JEFFREY
BROWN: As with al-Qaida, it

55:16.213 --> 55:20.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
began, though, in jails, in
prisons, right, with a small

55:20.417 --> 55:22.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
core? JOBY WARRICK: Yes. That is
interesting, because a lot of

55:22.653 --> 55:25.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the founders of al-Qaida, as you
say, Zawahri and others, came

55:25.856 --> 55:28.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out of Egyptian prisons. JEFFREY
BROWN: Egyptian prisons, right?

55:28.392 --> 55:30.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOBY WARRICK: Yes. JEFFREY
BROWN: Yes, also Jordan. JOBY

55:30.561 --> 55:33.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARRICK: The same pedigree and
some of the same sort of beliefs

55:33.463 --> 55:35.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and sort of radicalization
process was fairly similar.

55:35.465 --> 55:38.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: A lot of
confusion and uncertainty about

55:38.068 --> 55:41.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
its history. A lot of confusion
about what just it is. How do

55:41.638 --> 55:44.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you define ISIS? JOBY WARRICK:
Well, ISIS, you know, it's

55:44.942 --> 55:48.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interesting, in that it's a
group that sort of latches on to

55:48.378 --> 55:52.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a few central themes that
identify it. One is this idea of

55:52.482 --> 55:55.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
creating the caliphate as sort
of the immediate and also

55:55.519 --> 55:58.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
long-term goal. This is
something they want to do. And

55:58.188 --> 56:02.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there is also this embracing of
violence for its own sake. This

56:02.526 --> 56:06.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is not strategic violence
sometimes, but it's just to

56:06.063 --> 56:10.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shock and awe or to horrify. And
they use violence and they use

56:10.767 --> 56:13.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
media very deliberately to
intimidate to enemies and also

56:13.103 --> 56:16.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to excite their base to get
other radicals to join their

56:16.673 --> 56:21.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
movement and to help them.
JEFFREY BROWN: So when we see

56:21.044 --> 56:24.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the beheadings, of course, we
see the destroying ancient

56:24.648 --> 56:27.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sites, those are for effect?
JOBY WARRICK: Yes, there is a

56:27.718 --> 56:30.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
message there. They're not
trying to win hearts and minds

56:30.821 --> 56:33.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of people around the world and
not even the Muslim community.

56:33.523 --> 56:35.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're looking at provoking.
And that's what they're very

56:35.525 --> 56:37.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
good at doing. JEFFREY BROWN:
How did they get from -- the

56:37.527 --> 56:42.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
story you're telling is how they
got from Jordan prisons to an

56:42.132 --> 56:45.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
international organization. JOBY
WARRICK: Yes. JEFFREY BROWN: Was

56:45.068 --> 56:48.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there a key moment along the way
when -- that you can now look

56:48.238 --> 56:51.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back and say, OK, now this is
the real beginning of this

56:51.208 --> 56:53.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
group? JOBY WARRICK: There's a
key individual. And there's a

56:53.610 --> 56:56.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
terrorist whose name was Abu
Musab al Zarqawi, who was a

56:56.580 --> 57:01.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jordanian terrorist, a fairly
minor figure, but he ends up

57:01.685 --> 57:06.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
becoming important for two
reasons. One was because the

57:06.223 --> 57:08.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
United States, the Bush
administration in particular,

57:08.225 --> 57:11.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
decided to make him kind of a
poster child for this connection

57:11.495 --> 57:14.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
between al-Qaida and Saddam
Hussein. They picked on some

57:14.965 --> 57:17.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very flimsy evidence that
suggested a connection. And they

57:17.601 --> 57:19.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
actually put his picture in
front of the United Nations in

57:19.736 --> 57:23.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
2003 arguing for invasion of
Iraq. Turns out the evidence was

57:23.573 --> 57:25.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wrong, he had nothing to do with
Saddam Hussein. He had nothing

57:25.575 --> 57:28.245 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to do really with al-Qaida, but
it was -- it made him famous. It

57:28.278 --> 57:30.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gave him a platform. Suddenly,
he became an international hero

57:30.914 --> 57:33.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the jihadist community. And
then immediately after that, the

57:33.884 --> 57:36.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
invasion takes place. Zarqawi
moves into Iraq and starts this

57:37.020 --> 57:41.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
insurgency, which really becomes
the force that almost drove the

57:41.058 --> 57:44.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S. to defeat in Iraq. JEFFREY
BROWN: This is part of -- a big

57:44.461 --> 57:47.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
part of the stories, the actions
or misactions of the U.S. and

57:47.931 --> 57:51.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other Western governments. Were
those -- that kind of thing an

57:51.101 --> 57:54.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
act of omission or commission,
or how do you see it? JOBY

57:54.371 --> 57:56.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARRICK: Yes. There's multiple
acts of commission I think in

57:56.807 --> 57:59.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the early days, and it was not
just the invasion itself, which

57:59.543 --> 58:03.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gives people like Zarqawi a
platform and a reason to call

58:03.246 --> 58:06.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
others like him around the world
to help out. But also there was

58:06.616 --> 58:10.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a security vacuum that emerged
in Iraq in the early days, where

58:10.320 --> 58:13.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Baathists are disbanded, the
army is sent home. And so

58:13.423 --> 58:17.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Zarqawi, this fanatic, has sort
of a willing army of Iraqis

58:17.828 --> 58:20.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ready to help him. And,
together, they sort of blend the

58:20.797 --> 58:24.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fanaticism and the military and
bureaucrat professionals ends up

58:24.368 --> 58:27.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
becoming this force called
al-Qaida in Iraq, and that is

58:27.404 --> 58:29.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the core of what is now ISIS.
It's the same group today.

58:29.773 --> 58:32.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And then stir in
the Syrian civil war. JOBY

58:32.809 --> 58:35.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WARRICK: Absolutely. So,
actually, toward the late 2000s,

58:35.412 --> 58:41.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Zarqawi's movement was on its
heels. Zarqawi himself was

58:41.051 --> 58:44.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
killed. They were kind of driven
underground. There was no real

58:44.521 --> 58:48.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sense that they had any future.
Then Arab spring happens. Then

58:48.725 --> 58:51.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Syrian civil war takes
place. And suddenly there's a

58:51.561 --> 58:54.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whole new opportunity. They
essentially get their rebirth in

58:54.598 --> 58:58.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the ashes of the Syrian state.
JEFFREY BROWN: One of the key

58:58.502 --> 59:02.906 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
questions now, of course, is how
organized is ISIS? Who is -- is

59:02.939 --> 59:06.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it centrally run or are these
cells out there? JOBY WARRICK:

59:06.676 --> 59:09.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, they do have this powerful
central organization. It's

59:09.746 --> 59:13.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
remarkable to me to see how good
they are at things like

59:13.850 --> 59:17.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
logistics, how good they are at
getting supplies and moving

59:17.254 --> 59:20.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recruits to various places,
getting suicide bombers to take

59:20.323 --> 59:23.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on these incredible missions.
But, also, they are very good at

59:23.960 --> 59:26.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inspiring people in other parts
of the world to kind of take up

59:26.696 --> 59:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the same mantle. And we don't
always know how well-connected

59:29.900 --> 59:33.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some of the local groups are to
ISIS central. There is clearly

59:33.637 --> 59:36.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at least some messaging through
propaganda and some actual

59:36.406 --> 59:38.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
coordination as well. JEFFREY
BROWN: Messaging through

59:38.442 --> 59:40.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
propaganda? JOBY WARRICK: Yes.
So, ISIS -- for example, this

59:40.844 --> 59:45.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recent Paris attack, so this
individual Abdelhamid Abaaoud in

59:45.081 --> 59:47.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Paris, who is the ringleader of
the attack, he gets sort of

59:47.684 --> 59:51.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
chided publicly by ISIS'
propaganda ministers in Syria,

59:51.822 --> 59:55.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saying, do something in Paris,
these Westerners have to pay for

59:55.258 --> 59:57.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the things they're doing do us.
And so that becomes, we think,

59:57.694 --> 01:00:01.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
part of what drove him to commit
this crime. JEFFREY BROWN: You

01:00:01.064 --> 01:00:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
used the word chided. That's an
interesting... JOBY WARRICK:

01:00:03.066 --> 01:00:05.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes. There was this... JEFFREY
BROWN: It's not order. It's not

01:00:05.068 --> 01:00:08.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like could you -- why don't you
-- chiding? JOBY WARRICK: Yes.

01:00:08.338 --> 01:00:10.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There may be some of that too.
But it feels like there is

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:13.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
almost some shaming that goes
on, and you see this repeatedly

01:00:13.343 --> 01:00:16.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by ISIS central in their
propaganda messages. They used

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:20.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their videos which they put out
publicly to call upon jihadis in

01:00:20.851 --> 01:00:24.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Paris, do something. You know,
do anything. And they make the

01:00:24.921 --> 01:00:28.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
same message for like-minded
people in America and Russia and

01:00:28.892 --> 01:00:31.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other places like that, kind of
egging or goading local

01:00:31.928 --> 01:00:33.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
affiliates to take action.
JEFFREY BROWN: Did anything

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:36.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about Paris surprise you? JOBY
WARRICK: You know what? We

01:00:36.066 --> 01:00:39.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weren't totally surprised that
they would lash out outside the

01:00:39.836 --> 01:00:43.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
region. Their focus has mostly
been Syria and Iraq, because

01:00:43.173 --> 01:00:45.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they have their hands full right
now. They're being attacked from

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:47.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
multiple sides. Everybody is
bombing them. You have the

01:00:47.677 --> 01:00:50.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Syrians and the Kurds -- Syrian
Arabs and Kurds coming after

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them on the ground. JEFFREY
BROWN: All right, the book is

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:55.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Black Flags: The Rise of ISIS."
Joby Warrick, thanks so much.

01:00:55.552 --> 01:00:57.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOBY WARRICK: Thank you, Jeff.
GWEN IFILL: That conversation

01:00:57.921 --> 01:01:00.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was recorded this weekend at the
Miami Book Fair. You can find

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:09.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interviews, at bookviewnow.org.
A professor from Upstate New

01:01:19.743 --> 01:01:24.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
York is using technology to
transform the world, especially

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:27.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for young people in need of
limbs. He shares his experience

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:32.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in his own words as part of this
trip down innovation trail, a

by WXXI in Rochester. JON

SCHULL, Rochester Institute of
Technology: I'm Jon Schull. I'm

01:01:47.404 --> 01:01:50.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a research scientist here at the
Rochester Institute of

01:01:50.407 --> 01:01:55.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Technology, where I'm in the
Center for Magic. RIT is a

01:01:55.312 --> 01:01:58.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
center for media, arts, games,
interaction and creativity,

01:01:58.615 --> 01:02:04.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where I run a lab on access and
collaboration technology, which

01:02:04.421 --> 01:02:09.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is how I got started founding an
organization called e-NABLE --

01:02:09.492 --> 01:02:15.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
e-NABLE. And what we do is, we
make mechanical hands for

01:02:15.098 --> 01:02:18.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
children who are missing fingers
using 3-D printers, and we give

01:02:18.969 --> 01:02:23.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them away for free. Just like
printing a document, you press

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:27.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
print and the 3-D printer starts
building this object that you

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:31.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
designed on the screen by
putting down tiny thin layers of

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:35.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
plastic like a glue gun, layer
by layer by layer, building it

01:02:35.151 --> 01:02:41.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
up to make the thing. A
prosthetic arm these days costs

01:02:41.057 --> 01:02:47.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about $40,000. One in 2,000 kids
are born with some kind of an

01:02:47.797 --> 01:02:51.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
arm or hand abnormality. They
don't get prosthetics because it

01:02:51.868 --> 01:02:55.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
makes no sense to spend $40,000
on something they're going to

01:02:55.572 --> 01:03:00.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
outgrow in a year. With a 3-D
printer, we can start making

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:04.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these things almost for nothing.
Instead of $40,000, you can do

01:03:04.648 --> 01:03:08.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it with about $10 or $20 worth
of plastic. And it's not as

01:03:08.818 --> 01:03:13.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sturdy as a $40,000 titanium
artificial arm. On the other

01:03:14.024 --> 01:03:18.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hand, if you outgrow it or break
it, you can make another. One of

01:03:18.695 --> 01:03:21.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the interesting things about
this project is that the kids

01:03:21.431 --> 01:03:24.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that we're making these hands
for are becoming inventors and

01:03:24.768 --> 01:03:28.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
designers in their own right. I
was working with Derek a few

01:03:28.672 --> 01:03:31.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
months ago. And I was showing
him this artificial arm that we

01:03:31.307 --> 01:03:34.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are working on and explaining
that we needed kids to work with

01:03:34.344 --> 01:03:37.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
us as test pilots and as
collaborators. And while I'm

01:03:38.014 --> 01:03:41.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
talking to him, he put two of
these models together and he

01:03:41.685 --> 01:03:45.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said, "I would like my arm to be
this long." So, Derek now has an

01:03:45.855 --> 01:03:49.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
arm which is extra long. He can
pick things up off the floor

01:03:49.192 --> 01:03:52.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
without bending over and he can
reach to the highest shelf,

01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:54.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
higher than his classmates,
because he has got an extra long

01:03:54.931 --> 01:03:59.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
arm, the so-called Derek Arm,
which just goes to show that

01:03:59.869 --> 01:04:03.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
7-year-olds and 9-year-olds can
play a really important role

01:04:03.106 --> 01:04:06.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
helping us invent the solutions
for other kids and other

01:04:06.776 --> 01:04:09.779 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
grownups in the future. You
know, disability is a funny

01:04:09.813 --> 01:04:13.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
word. Disability means you can't
do something. It's not a

01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:18.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
disease, and it's not even a
property of a person. A person

01:04:18.555 --> 01:04:21.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doesn't have a disability. A
person has a disability if he's

01:04:21.991 --> 01:04:25.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a world where he can't do
something. If I didn't have

01:04:25.495 --> 01:04:29.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
glasses in a world in which
there's lot of fine print, I

01:04:29.566 --> 01:04:35.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would be disabled. As it is, I'm
just a guy who wears glasses.

01:04:35.238 --> 01:04:39.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The technology of eyeglasses
turned nearsightedness and

01:04:39.309 --> 01:04:43.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
farsightedness into a nuisance,
when it used to be a disability.

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:47.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
New technology is going to turn
things like you're missing a

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:53.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hand or you can't move your body
or you have brain damage into a

01:04:53.623 --> 01:04:58.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
nuisance, rather than a
disability. GWEN IFILL: On the

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:10.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"NewsHour" online, this week,
we're celebrating the 100th

01:05:10.173 --> 01:05:15.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anniversary of Albert Einstein's
theory of general relativity. We

01:05:15.078 --> 01:05:18.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
asked three physicists to
explain how Einstein's seminal

01:05:18.715 --> 01:05:22.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
work has influenced today's
scientists. You can find that on

our home page, PBS.org/NewsHour.
And finally tonight, we want to

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:26.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
note a correction. Due to an
editing error, a sequence in a

01:05:26.322 --> 01:05:28.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
report last Thursday about
funding for ISIS included

01:05:28.324 --> 01:05:30.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
footage of Russian airstrikes on
ISIS oil resources, instead of

01:05:30.326 --> 01:05:32.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the U.S. airstrikes referenced
in the script. Keen observers in

01:05:32.328 --> 01:05:34.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our "NewsHour" audience picked
up on the mistake and alerted us
