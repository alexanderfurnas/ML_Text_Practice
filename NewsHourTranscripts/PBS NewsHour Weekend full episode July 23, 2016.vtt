04:16.656 --> 04:19.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAINE THAT VERY FEW OF US KNEW--

04:19.893 --> 04:21.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY GOOD ON HIS FEET, VERY

04:21.528 --> 04:23.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WARM, VERY MOVING, VERY FUNNY,

04:23.296 --> 04:24.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPEAKING WITHOUT NOTES FOR A

04:24.397 --> 04:25.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREAT LENGTH OF TIME.

04:25.665 --> 04:27.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK AFTER HE APPEARED,

04:27.367 --> 04:28.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WERE MORE PEOPLE WHO SAID,

04:28.668 --> 04:30.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"OH, I SEE WHY SHE PICKED HIM."

04:30.871 --> 04:31.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: AND THERE WAS

04:31.872 --> 04:33.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A DIFFERENT VIBE IN THAT

04:33.640 --> 04:34.908 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROLL-OUT SPEECH AS WELL.

04:34.908 --> 04:35.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP GOT A LOT OF

04:35.842 --> 04:37.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRITICISM FOR THE FACT THAT HE

04:37.144 --> 04:39.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIDN'T EVEN STAY ON STAGE VERY

04:39.079 --> 04:39.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONG WITH MIKE PENCE.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YEAH, I THINK-- I THINK PART

04:41.948 --> 04:43.383 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF WHAT THEY WERE TRYING TO

04:43.383 --> 04:45.185 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMUNICATE WAS, THIS IS A

04:45.185 --> 04:45.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMFORTABLE TWO-SOME.

04:45.952 --> 04:48.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE'S NOT UPSTAGING HIM.

04:48.522 --> 04:49.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE'S PERFECTLY HAPPY TO SIT

04:49.756 --> 04:51.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE AND LET HIM TALK AT GREAT

04:51.158 --> 04:54.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LENGTH, TO LET HIM INTRODUCE

04:54.461 --> 04:55.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIMSELF TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT I ALSO THINK THE WAY TIM

04:57.364 --> 04:58.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAINE TOLD ALL THOSE STORIES--

04:58.698 --> 05:00.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW THAT HE SENT HIS

05:00.867 --> 05:02.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KIDS TO THE SAME INTEGRATED

05:02.102 --> 05:03.870 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCHOOL THAT HIS WIFE'S FATHER,

05:03.870 --> 05:05.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR, HAD

05:05.238 --> 05:05.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTEGRATED.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.073 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT IT MEANT TO BE IN

05:07.073 --> 05:07.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HONDURAS.

05:07.574 --> 05:08.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT IT MEANT TO BE THE GOVERNOR

05:08.875 --> 05:10.510 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DURING THE VIRGINIA TECH

05:10.510 --> 05:11.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MURDERS.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.046 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEAH, I THINK SHE WAS SAYING TO

05:13.046 --> 05:14.881 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COUNTRY, "I REALLY AM

05:14.881 --> 05:15.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMFORTABLE WITH WHO I PICKED,

05:15.882 --> 05:17.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE

05:17.551 --> 05:19.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMFORTABLE AFTERWARDS."

05:19.119 --> 05:21.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I ALSO THINK A NUMBER OF

05:21.188 --> 05:22.889 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO SEE A MORE

05:22.889 --> 05:25.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIBERAL OR PROGRESSIVE CANDIDATE

05:25.258 --> 05:26.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAY HAVE HAD SECOND THOUGHTS

05:26.526 --> 05:28.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFTER HEARING KAINE, THINKING I

05:28.395 --> 05:29.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GET THIS PICK.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: THIS WASN'T

05:30.430 --> 05:32.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMEONE BERNIE SANDERS' FOLKS

05:32.365 --> 05:35.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAD SUPPORTED BEFORE OR AFTER

05:35.168 --> 05:35.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SPEECH.

05:35.702 --> 05:36.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

05:36.469 --> 05:37.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT I THINK THERE IS A

05:37.470 --> 05:38.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMFORTABLE LEVEL THEY MAY HAVE

05:38.405 --> 05:39.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REACHED BECAUSE A LOT OF WHAT

05:39.906 --> 05:43.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIM KAINE WAS COMMUNICATING WERE

05:43.176 --> 05:43.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROGRESSIVE VALUES.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.345 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THE

05:45.345 --> 05:46.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTONS ARE GRUDGE HOLDERS.

05:46.913 --> 05:48.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN 2008, AT A CRITICAL POINT IN

05:48.515 --> 05:50.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PRIMARY, TIM KAINE ENDORSED

05:50.550 --> 05:52.152 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, AND THIS AT LEAST

05:52.152 --> 05:53.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOWS THAT, YOU KNOW, HILLARY

05:53.720 --> 05:55.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON DOES NOT WALK AROUND FOR

05:55.055 --> 05:56.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EIGHT YEARS THINKING, WELL HE

05:56.856 --> 05:57.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIDN'T BACK ME.

05:57.591 --> 05:58.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY SHOULD I PICK HIM?

05:58.792 --> 05:59.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: YOU KNOW, HE

05:59.459 --> 06:00.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS AN EARLY SUPPORTER OF

06:00.827 --> 06:02.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HILLARY CLINTON BEFORE SHE EVEN

06:02.162 --> 06:02.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECLARED.

06:02.662 --> 06:06.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK IT WAS IN 2014 WHEN HE

06:06.399 --> 06:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STARTED OUT.

06:06.933 --> 06:08.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FACT HE WAS SPEAKING SPANISH

06:08.435 --> 06:09.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN AND OUT OF THIS CONVERSATION,

06:09.569 --> 06:10.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FACT THAT THEY CHOSE TO DO

06:10.971 --> 06:12.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IN FLORIDA, A KEY

06:12.706 --> 06:13.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BATTLEGROUND STATE, IMPORTANT?

06:13.707 --> 06:16.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YEAH, I WOULD SAY THAT DOES

06:16.076 --> 06:19.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT COME UNDER THE HEADING OF

06:19.913 --> 06:20.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"COINCIDENCE."

06:20.413 --> 06:22.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'VE SEEN OF ONE OF TRUMP'S

06:22.616 --> 06:24.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPPORTERS COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS--

06:24.050 --> 06:26.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY ARE YOU SPEAKING SPANISH

06:26.019 --> 06:27.887 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING FOR VICE

06:27.887 --> 06:28.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES?

06:28.655 --> 06:30.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR,

06:30.290 --> 06:32.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GIVEN HOW THIS CAMPAIGN IS GOING

06:32.192 --> 06:33.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO SHAPE UP, THE CLEAR DRIVE ON

06:33.760 --> 06:34.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PART OF THE CLINTON PEOPLE

06:34.995 --> 06:36.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO MAKE DEMOGRAPHICS WORK FOR

06:36.730 --> 06:38.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEM AND TRY TO GET A HISPANIC

06:38.231 --> 06:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTE OUT.

06:39.866 --> 06:40.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HISPANICS REPRESENT AN

06:40.867 --> 06:42.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCREASING PART OF THE

06:42.168 --> 06:42.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POPULATION BUT TRADITIONALLY

06:42.969 --> 06:44.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY HAVE NOT VOTED IN ANYTHING

06:44.971 --> 06:46.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE THEIR NUMBERS OF CITIZENS.

06:46.973 --> 06:48.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK HIM CAMPAIGNING IN

06:48.275 --> 06:50.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FLORIDA, SPEAKING VERY

06:50.043 --> 06:51.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMFORTABLY IN SPANISH, I HAVE A

06:51.311 --> 06:52.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FEELING YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A

06:52.612 --> 06:54.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOT MORE OF THAT AS THE CAMPAIGN

06:54.748 --> 06:57.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOES ON IN ARIZONA, COLORADO,

06:57.183 --> 06:58.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEW MEXICO IS A SAFE DEMOCRATIC

06:58.618 --> 06:59.152 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATE NOW.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT, YEAH, THAT'S CLEARLY AN

07:00.754 --> 07:01.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASSET THAT THEY SEE THEY'RE

07:01.821 --> 07:02.455 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO PLAY.

07:02.455 --> 07:03.223 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: HOW ABOUT THE

07:03.223 --> 07:05.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPORTANCE OF THE ELECTORAL MAP?

07:05.258 --> 07:08.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE'S THE VIRGINIAN, AND HE IS

07:08.628 --> 07:10.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A-- YOU KNOW, HE'S SOMEBODY WHO

07:10.263 --> 07:11.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS WORKED ACROSS PARTY LINES IN

07:11.998 --> 07:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIRGINIA, AND HOPEFULLY, I

07:13.400 --> 07:15.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMAGINE THAT HILLARY CLINTON

07:15.502 --> 07:16.870 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAMPAIGN THINKS HE CAN DELIVER

07:16.870 --> 07:17.270 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT STATE.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT'S POSSIBLE.

07:18.004 --> 07:20.106 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH OF THAT IN

07:20.106 --> 07:21.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RECENT YEARS.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES

07:22.442 --> 07:23.843 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PICKED BECAUSE OF GEOGRAPHY.

07:23.843 --> 07:26.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THERE'S SOME ACADEMIC

07:26.012 --> 07:27.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SKEPTICISM ABOUT HOW MUCH THAT

07:27.047 --> 07:27.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVER WORKS.

07:27.647 --> 07:29.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT SURELY, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

07:29.316 --> 07:31.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A MAN ELECTED TO STATEWIDE

07:31.451 --> 07:32.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFFICE THERE THREE TIMES IN A

07:32.585 --> 07:33.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATE THAT USED TO BE ONE OF THE

07:33.820 --> 07:34.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOST REPUBLICANS, GONE

07:34.921 --> 07:36.156 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRATIC THE LAST TWO

07:36.156 --> 07:35.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTIONS.

07:35.088 --> 07:38.024 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IF CLINTON CAN KEEP VIRGINIA

07:38.024 --> 07:39.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN HER COLUMN, THAT MAKES THE

07:39.392 --> 07:40.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PATH FOR DONALD TRUMP JUST THAT

07:40.593 --> 07:41.594 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUCH MORE HARDER.

07:41.594 --> 07:42.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

07:42.228 --> 07:43.129 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFF GREENFIELD JOINING US FROM

07:43.129 --> 07:43.830 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PHILADELPHIA.

07:43.830 --> 07:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THANKS SO MUCH.

07:44.898 --> 07:56.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THANK YOU.

07:56.543 --> 07:57.410 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: HILLARY CLINTON

07:57.410 --> 07:59.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS SPENT ROUGHLY HALF OF HER

07:59.045 --> 08:01.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEARLY 69 YEARS IN PUBLIC LIFE,

08:01.648 --> 08:03.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS FIRST LADY OF ARKANSAS, AND

08:03.416 --> 08:05.118 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE UNITED STATES.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS A U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW YORK,

08:06.753 --> 08:09.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND AS SECRETARY OF STATE.

EIGHT YEARS.

11:46.906 --> 11:49.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

12:06.826 --> 12:07.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THERE IS NO BIG LEGISLATION THAT

12:13.132 --> 12:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEARS HER NAME, AND THAT'S TRUE

12:14.500 --> 12:16.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF A LOT OF SENATORS.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.237 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SHE REALLY TRANSFORMED

12:18.237 --> 12:19.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERSELF INTO A NATIONAL SECURITY

12:19.072 --> 12:23.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPERT.

12:23.977 --> 12:25.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, SHE DECIDED TO JOIN

12:25.144 --> 12:26.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES

12:26.112 --> 12:27.280 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMITTEE, AND SHE BECAME A REAL

12:27.280 --> 12:28.848 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITARY WONK.

12:28.848 --> 12:30.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE WAS FAMOUS FOR GOING TO

12:30.516 --> 12:32.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERY SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING AND

12:32.952 --> 12:34.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
METHODICALLY QUESTIONING EVERY

12:34.654 --> 12:36.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIEUTENANT COLONEL FROM THE

12:36.289 --> 12:37.657 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PENTAGON ABOUT DEFENSE

12:37.657 --> 12:39.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROCUREMENT OR SELECTIVE SERVICE

12:39.158 --> 12:40.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BENEFITS.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THAT'S WHERE SHE REALLY BEGAN

12:42.829 --> 12:45.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO CARVE OUT AND HONE THIS

12:45.098 --> 12:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUTATION AS A HAWK, THAT I

12:46.666 --> 12:51.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK HAS FOLLOWED HER THROUGH

12:51.070 --> 12:52.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SECRETARY OF STATE YEARS AND

12:52.171 --> 12:53.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEN INTO THE PRESIDENTIAL

12:53.206 --> 12:53.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAMPAIGN.

12:53.973 --> 12:54.974 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WE'D BE REMISS NOT TO NOTE,

12:54.974 --> 12:55.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF COURSE, HER IRAQ WAR VOTE.

12:55.675 --> 12:56.909 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> OF COURSE.

12:56.909 --> 12:58.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WHICH SHE CAST, PROBABLY

12:58.478 --> 12:59.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE SHE HAD HER EYE ON THE

12:59.646 --> 13:02.749 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENCY.

13:02.749 --> 13:03.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO THAT ONE HAS HUNG AROUND

13:03.850 --> 13:05.284 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HER NECK AND NOT STOOD THE TEST

13:05.284 --> 13:06.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF TIME.

13:06.919 --> 13:07.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: MORE FOR

13:07.787 --> 13:09.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICAL CALCULATION THAN FOR

13:09.055 --> 13:10.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHETHER OR NOT SHE FELT LIKE

13:10.089 --> 13:11.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TROOPS SHOULD BE THERE?

13:11.691 --> 13:13.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, HER DEFENSE HAS ALWAYS

13:13.793 --> 13:15.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN THAT SHE VOTED FOR

13:15.161 --> 13:17.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AUTHORIZATION AS A WAY TO

13:17.363 --> 13:18.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESSURE SADDAM HUSSEIN TO COME

13:18.998 --> 13:24.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLEAN ON THE WEAPONS OF MASS

13:24.337 --> 13:25.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DESTRUCTION, BUT THAT TURNED OUT

13:25.338 --> 13:26.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT TO HAVE EXISTED.

13:26.205 --> 13:27.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT A

13:27.273 --> 13:28.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COINCIDENCE THAT SHE AND JOHN

13:28.307 --> 13:29.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KERRY AND JOHN EDWARDS, ALL

13:29.175 --> 13:30.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THREE WHO WERE LOOKING AT THE

13:30.276 --> 13:31.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENCY, VOTED FOR THAT WAR.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.578 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> AND IF YOU THEN GO THROUGH

13:32.578 --> 13:33.579 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HER RECORD AS SECRETARY OF

13:33.579 --> 13:34.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATE, WHETHER IT WAS THE TROOP

13:34.781 --> 13:35.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SURGE IN AFGHANISTAN, THE

13:35.948 --> 13:37.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITARY INTERVENTION IN LIBYA,

13:37.483 --> 13:39.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DEBATE OVER ARMING THE

13:39.952 --> 13:42.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REBELS IN SYRIA, SHE FAIRLY

13:42.155 --> 13:43.589 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GENERALLY CAME DOWN ON THE

13:43.589 --> 13:45.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAWKISH END OF THE SPECTRUM.

13:45.058 --> 13:46.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW THERE'S BEEN A CONTINUING

13:46.893 --> 13:48.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEBATE OVER WHETHER SHE DOES

13:48.961 --> 13:50.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT BECAUSE IT'S BORNE OF

13:50.596 --> 13:52.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRINCIPLE OR WHETHER SHE DOES

13:52.098 --> 13:53.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT FOR POLITICAL CALCULATION,

13:53.700 --> 13:55.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK AS WITH EVERYTHING

13:55.134 --> 13:56.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH HILLARY CLINTON, IT'S

13:56.536 --> 13:57.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBABLY SOME COMPLICATED

13:57.770 --> 13:59.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIXTURE OF THE TWO.

13:59.072 --> 14:00.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S NO

14:00.606 --> 14:02.341 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION THAT SHE HAS GENERALLY

14:02.341 --> 14:04.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN MORE COMFORTABLE WITH

14:04.310 --> 14:06.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXERCISING MILITARY POWER TO

14:06.412 --> 14:08.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADVANCE AMERICAN INTERESTS,

14:08.047 --> 14:09.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CERTAINLY THAN THE PRESIDENT SHE

14:09.315 --> 14:10.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SERVED AS SECRETARY OF STATE.

14:10.917 --> 14:12.185 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: SHE WAS ALSO

14:12.185 --> 14:14.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRETTY INSTRUMENTAL IN DRIVING

14:14.654 --> 14:17.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION INTO

14:17.724 --> 14:19.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COALITION IN LIBYA.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HILLARY

14:21.427 --> 14:22.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON ARE GETTING AN EARFUL OF

14:22.228 --> 14:23.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BLAME.

14:23.062 --> 14:24.163 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WAS ALMOST AN ENTIRE NIGHT

14:24.163 --> 14:25.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEVOTED TO HER, AND CHRIS

14:25.965 --> 14:27.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTIE EVEN ESSENTIALLY

14:27.834 --> 14:29.068 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROSECUTED HER, FICTITIOUSLY, ON

14:29.068 --> 14:32.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STAGE.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW MUCH OF THE DECISIONS OF THE

14:34.774 --> 14:37.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION CAN BE ATTRIBUTED

14:37.176 --> 14:38.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO THE IMPACT THAT HILLARY

14:38.845 --> 14:40.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON HAD ON BARACK OBAMA?

14:40.947 --> 14:42.982 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK THE LIBYA DECISION,

14:42.982 --> 14:44.851 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE WAS AN IMPORTANT VOICE,

14:44.851 --> 14:47.153 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERHAPS THE IMPORTANT VOICE IN

14:47.153 --> 14:48.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TURNING AROUND THE PRESIDENT.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WAS EXTREMELY SKEPTICAL ABOUT

14:50.456 --> 14:52.291 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING INTO LIBYA, AS HONESTLY

14:52.291 --> 14:54.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS SHE AT THE VERY BEGINNING.

14:54.127 --> 14:56.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE, THROUGH HER DIPLOMATIC

14:56.195 --> 14:57.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRAVELS, WAS PERSUADED THAT IT

14:57.597 --> 14:58.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD BE DONE WITH A BROAD

14:58.631 --> 14:59.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COALITION, AND THAT IT WAS WORTH

14:59.599 --> 15:01.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOING.

15:01.167 --> 15:03.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER ONES

15:03.369 --> 15:05.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOUGH, FOR EXAMPLE SYRIA, SHE

15:05.505 --> 15:06.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND GENERAL PETRAEUS, WHO WAS

15:06.939 --> 15:08.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEN HEAD OF THE C.I.A., ARGUED

15:08.674 --> 15:10.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FAIRLY FERVENTLY FOR ARMING THE

15:10.076 --> 15:12.278 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REBELS.

15:12.278 --> 15:12.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY WERE TURNED DOWN WHEN

15:12.979 --> 15:14.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY MADE THEIR PITCH.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PRESIDENT LATER CAME AROUND

15:16.182 --> 15:18.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO THE IDEA IN SORT OF A HALF-

15:18.117 --> 15:19.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEARTED WAY AND ENDED UP SENDING

15:19.318 --> 15:20.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A SMALL NUMBER OF WEAPONS TO THE

15:20.253 --> 15:22.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REBELS.

15:22.188 --> 15:23.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, MANY OF THE THINGS WERE

15:23.089 --> 15:24.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUN VERY HEAVILY OUT OF THE

15:24.157 --> 15:24.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHITE HOUSE.

15:24.957 --> 15:25.658 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RELATIONSHIP WITH

15:25.658 --> 15:30.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIA, THE IRAN NUCLEAR

15:30.463 --> 15:31.464 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEGOTIATION-- THESE ARE AREAS

15:31.464 --> 15:32.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE PRESIDENT OBAMA PLAYED A

15:32.698 --> 15:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY STRONG ROLE HIMSELF, AND

15:34.033 --> 15:35.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HER BATTLE WAS LESS TO WIN THE

15:35.234 --> 15:36.402 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEBATE THAN TO CARVE OUT SOME

15:36.402 --> 15:37.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERRITORY IN THOSE ISSUES FOR

15:37.603 --> 15:38.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERSELF.

15:38.704 --> 15:40.106 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: IN THE CONTEXT

15:40.106 --> 15:41.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF LIBYA, BENGHAZI IS THE WORD

15:41.574 --> 15:43.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE CLUNG

15:43.242 --> 15:44.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONTO FOR REALLY THE PAST COUPLE

15:44.377 --> 15:45.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF YEARS, HUNG IT AROUND HER

15:45.478 --> 15:46.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NECK AND SAID THAT SHE IS SOLELY

15:46.846 --> 15:48.347 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESPONSIBLE.

15:48.347 --> 15:50.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LITERALLY, WE'VE SEEN THE MOTHER

15:50.082 --> 15:53.286 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF ONE OF THE SOLDIERS THAT WERE

15:53.286 --> 15:54.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KILLED THERE, SPEAKING AT THE

15:54.320 --> 15:57.890 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION.

15:57.890 --> 15:58.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SORT OF TWO QUESTIONS--

15:58.891 --> 16:00.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY ARE REPUBLICANS STILL

16:00.026 --> 16:01.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TALKING ABOUT IT, AND TWO, WHAT

16:01.160 --> 16:02.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS SHE RESPONSIBLE FOR?

16:02.094 --> 16:03.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I'M SURE ON SOME LEVEL, MANY

16:03.229 --> 16:04.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS ARE GENERALLY AGHAST

16:04.831 --> 16:06.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THE LOSS OF LIFE THERE, BUT

16:06.165 --> 16:07.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE'S GENUINELY AGHAST AT THAT

16:07.366 --> 16:08.901 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOSS OF LIFE TOO.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE WAS A FRIEND OF CHRIS

16:10.169 --> 16:11.304 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEVENS, A GOOD FRIEND OF CHRIS

16:11.304 --> 16:14.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEVENS.

16:14.941 --> 16:16.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK THEY'RE DOING IT

16:16.309 --> 16:17.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

POLITICALLY.

16:19.278 --> 16:21.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS

16:21.447 --> 16:22.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INVESTIGATIONS OF IT, NONE OF

16:22.815 --> 16:24.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH HAS EVER PLACED ANY

16:24.183 --> 16:25.184 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTICULAR CULPABILITY RIGHT AT

HER DOOR.

16:26.118 --> 16:29.021 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK THE BIGGER ISSUE FOR

16:29.021 --> 16:30.356 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HER, FRANKLY, IS TO TALK ABOUT

16:30.356 --> 16:32.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIBYA MORE BROADLY.

16:32.258 --> 16:34.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT DID GO WRONG IN LIBYA, WHAT

16:34.093 --> 16:35.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REAL LESSON SHOULD WE LEARN FROM

16:35.895 --> 16:37.763 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WAS, BY ALL ACCOUNTS, A

16:37.763 --> 16:39.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MISBEGOTTEN INTERVENTION, AND IF

16:39.765 --> 16:41.601 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE WERE PRESIDENT AND FACED A

16:41.601 --> 16:43.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIMILAR DECISION, HOW WOULD SHE

16:43.035 --> 16:44.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK OF IT DIFFERENTLY, HOW

16:44.537 --> 16:46.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD SHE ACT DIFFERENTLY, HOW

16:46.172 --> 16:48.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN AMERICANS SOLVE THIS WHOLE

16:48.975 --> 16:50.209 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION OF INTERVENTION?

16:50.209 --> 16:54.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE EITHER SEEM TO INTERVENE IN

16:54.180 --> 16:55.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOO GIGANTIC A WAY, AS WE DID IN

16:55.181 --> 16:56.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IRAQ, OR WE DON'T INTERVENE

16:56.215 --> 16:57.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADEQUATELY ENOUGH, AND ALLOW A

16:57.316 --> 16:58.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SITUATION TO FALL INTO A MAYHEM

16:58.818 --> 17:00.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS WE DID IN LIBYA.

17:00.253 --> 17:02.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK THOSE ARE THE

17:02.121 --> 17:03.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES THAT I THINK

17:03.789 --> 17:05.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE'LL HAVE TO CONTEND WITH, IN

17:05.091 --> 17:09.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE GENERAL ELECTION DEBATE.

17:09.929 --> 17:10.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHERE DOES SHE

17:10.930 --> 17:12.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALK LOCKSTEP WITH THE

17:12.131 --> 17:13.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT, AND WHERE HAS SHE

17:13.065 --> 17:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BROKEN WITH HIM?

17:13.933 --> 17:15.101 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THERE ARE CERTAIN POSITIONS

17:15.101 --> 17:16.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT SHE HAS HAD TO TAKE THAT

17:16.135 --> 17:18.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE HAS NOT TAKEN IN THAT PAST

17:18.004 --> 17:19.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT ARE OPPOSITE OF OBAMA OR

17:19.672 --> 17:20.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAINST OBAMA, BECAUSE OF THIS

17:20.873 --> 17:22.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOVEMENT OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

17:22.575 --> 17:24.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO A POPULIST LEFT ECONOMIC

17:24.844 --> 17:25.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POSTURE THAT BERNIE SANDERS

17:25.611 --> 17:26.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPRESENTS.

17:26.812 --> 17:28.281 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE MOST OBVIOUS THING I'M

17:28.281 --> 17:29.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TALKING ABOUT HERE IS TRADE AND

17:29.949 --> 17:31.851 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP,

17:31.851 --> 17:34.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH SHE NOW OPPOSES, AND WHICH

17:34.520 --> 17:36.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBAMA IS STILL FOR, AND I THINK

17:36.055 --> 17:37.356 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR, AND

17:37.356 --> 17:39.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL PROBABLY TRY TO GET A VOTE

17:39.058 --> 17:39.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN A LAME DUCK SESSION OF

17:39.892 --> 17:41.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONGRESS.

17:41.093 --> 17:42.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT WOULD

17:42.261 --> 17:43.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HILLARY CLINTON'S FOREIGN POLICY

17:43.362 --> 17:43.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE?

17:43.963 --> 17:45.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF THERE WAS A DOCTRINE, WOULD

17:45.398 --> 17:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT BE "STRENGTH WITH CAUTION?"

17:47.366 --> 17:49.402 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE IS A

17:49.402 --> 17:50.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SORT OF A VERY PRAGMATIC

17:50.436 --> 17:51.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APPROACH.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE WAY I LIKE TO THINK OF

17:53.472 --> 17:54.907 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT IS, THAT I THINK PRESIDENT

17:54.907 --> 17:56.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBAMA CAME INTO OFFICE WITH A

17:56.876 --> 17:58.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY STRONG IDEA THAT HE'D BEEN

17:58.344 --> 18:00.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTED TO WEAN THIS COUNTRY

18:00.112 --> 18:01.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AWAY FROM THE MILITARY EXCESSES

18:01.948 --> 18:03.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE GEORGE W. BUSH YEARS.

18:03.883 --> 18:05.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I DON'T THINK SHE NECESSARILY

18:05.718 --> 18:07.053 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMES INTO OFFICE WITH ANOTHER

18:07.053 --> 18:08.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIG IDEA.

18:08.654 --> 18:10.389 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK REALLY WHAT SHE WOULD

18:10.389 --> 18:12.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO IS WEIGH EACH PROBLEM AS IT

18:12.391 --> 18:13.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAME UP, PIECEMEAL, LOOK FOR A

18:13.659 --> 18:15.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRAGMATIC SOLUTION.

18:15.194 --> 18:16.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE'D EMPHASIZE DIPLOMACY FIRST,

18:16.996 --> 18:18.864 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IF DIPLOMACY FAILED, I THINK

18:18.864 --> 18:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE'D BE MORE WILLING TO

18:20.633 --> 18:22.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSIDER MILITARY FORCE AS SORT

18:22.168 --> 18:23.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF A LAST RESORT.

18:23.536 --> 18:24.437 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

18:27.106 --> 18:28.207 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY LIKED ABOUT HIM WAS HIS

CLINTON?

18:32.078 --> 18:33.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> OH, SURE.

18:33.379 --> 18:35.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED, I

18:35.214 --> 18:37.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES, FROM

CONTINUING INTO HER TIME AT

STATE.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

PERSON WHO WASN'T QUITE AS TOUGH

LIFE.

18:54.066 --> 18:55.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE HAD EVERY REASON TO THINK IN

1999, "FORGET THIS, I'M GOING TO

GO OFF AND RUN A HUGE FOUNDATION
