01:35.233 --> 01:36.067

01:55.167 --> 01:56.500
MALL ATTACK THAT LEFT MORE THAN

01:56.500 --> 01:58.533
60 PEOPLE DEAD.

01:58.533 --> 02:00.167
THE ISLAMIC MILITANT GROUP

02:00.167 --> 02:01.600
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT ATTACK, AL-

02:01.600 --> 02:04.767
SHABAAB, CARRIED OUT A CAR

INITIATIVE.

02:19.300 --> 02:20.933
WE ARE GOING TO STAND SHOULDER

02:20.933 --> 02:22.167
TO SHOULDER WITH YOU IN THIS

02:22.167 --> 02:22.967
FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM FOR AS

02:22.967 --> 02:24.700
LONG AS IT TAKES.

02:24.700 --> 02:25.833
>> Sreenivasan: WE'LL HAVE MORE

02:25.833 --> 02:26.733
ON THE PRESIDENT'S AFRICA TRIP

02:26.733 --> 02:27.733
IN A MOMENT.

02:27.733 --> 02:29.133
IN SYRIA, PRESIDENT BASHAR AL-

02:29.133 --> 02:30.433
ASSAD IS VOWING TO WIN HIS

02:30.433 --> 02:32.233
COUNTRY'S DEVASTATING CIVIL WAR.

02:32.233 --> 02:33.933
IN HIS FIRST PUBLIC SPEECH IN A

02:33.933 --> 02:35.267
YEAR, ASSAD ACKNOWLEDGED HIS

02:35.267 --> 02:36.700
GOVERNMENT TROOPS HAVE

02:36.700 --> 02:37.900
SURRENDERED CONTROL OF SOME

02:37.900 --> 02:39.267
TOWNS AND CITIES TO REBEL

02:39.267 --> 02:40.367
GROUPS, HE SAID, IN ORDER TO

02:40.367 --> 02:46.100
DEFEND OTHER TERRITORY.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.000
>> (translated): WE MUST

02:47.000 --> 02:47.900
DEFINE THE IMPORTANT REGIONS

02:47.900 --> 02:48.767
THAT THE ARMED FORCES HOLD ON TO

02:48.767 --> 02:49.567
SO IT DOESN'T ALLOW THE COLLAPSE

02:49.567 --> 02:50.367
OF THE REST OF THE AREAS.

02:50.367 --> 02:51.700
>> Sreenivasan: AFTER FOUR YEARS

02:51.700 --> 02:52.567
OF FIGHTING, ASSAD-ALLIED FORCES

02:52.567 --> 02:53.400
ARE THOUGHT TO CONTROL LESS THAN

02:53.400 --> 02:55.133
HALF OF THE COUNTRY.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.967
ONE OF ASSAD'S STRONGEST ALLIES,

02:56.967 --> 02:58.267
IRAN, IS HOPING TO CONVINCE ITS

02:58.267 --> 02:59.600
PERSIAN GULF NEIGHBORS TO

02:59.600 --> 03:01.000
SUPPORT THE NUCLEAR DEAL

03:01.000 --> 03:01.867
APPROVED LAST WEEK BY THE U.N.

03:01.867 --> 03:03.467
SECURITY COUNCIL.

03:03.467 --> 03:04.833
IN KUWAIT, IRANIAN FOREIGN

03:04.833 --> 03:06.200
MINISTER MOHAMMAD ZARIF CALLED

03:06.200 --> 03:07.500
FOR ARAB UNITY AND SAID NO

03:07.500 --> 03:08.367
COUNTRY CAN SOLVE REGIONAL

03:08.367 --> 03:09.167
PROBLEMS WITHOUT THE HELP OF

03:09.167 --> 03:10.100
OTHERS.

03:10.100 --> 03:11.100
ZARIF IS ALSO VISITING QATAR AND

03:11.100 --> 03:12.467
IRAQ.

03:12.467 --> 03:14.000
SOME GULF STATES WORRY LIFTING

03:14.000 --> 03:15.367
ECONOMIC SANCTIONS ON IRAN WILL

03:15.367 --> 03:17.200
FREE UP MONEY FOR IRAN TO FUND

03:17.200 --> 03:18.667
MILITANT GROUPS THAT POSE A

03:18.667 --> 03:20.800
THREAT TO THE REGION.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.133
THE BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA ARE

03:22.133 --> 03:23.767
EXPECTED TO LIFT A BAN ON OPENLY

03:23.767 --> 03:24.933
GAY ADULT LEADERS TOMORROW, BUT

03:24.933 --> 03:26.400
NOT COMPLETELY.

03:26.400 --> 03:27.833
THE SCOUTS' NATIONAL EXECUTIVE

03:27.833 --> 03:29.600
BOARD SAYS IT PLANS TO RATIFY A

03:29.600 --> 03:31.300
NEW POLICY ALLOWING LOCAL UNITS

03:31.300 --> 03:32.933
TO SELECT ADULT LEADERS WITHOUT

03:32.933 --> 03:35.567
REGARD TO SEXUAL ORIENTATION.

03:35.567 --> 03:37.700
A BIG EXCEPTION: CHURCHES THAT

03:37.700 --> 03:39.733
SPONSOR SCOUT UNITS MAY STILL

03:39.733 --> 03:41.300
REJECT GAY ADULT LEADERS AND

03:41.300 --> 03:43.000
VOLUNTEERS.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.433
MORE THAN 70% OF SCOUT UNITS ARE

03:44.433 --> 03:47.000
SPONSORED BY CHURCHES.

03:56.900 --> 03:58.467
>> Sreenivasan: PRESIDENT

03:58.467 --> 04:00.100
OBAMA IS IN ETHIOPIA TONIGHT,

04:00.100 --> 04:01.467
THE FIRST SITTING U.S. PRESIDENT

04:01.467 --> 04:02.767
TO VISIT THAT COUNTRY.

04:02.767 --> 04:04.033
HIS STOP COMES AFTER A THREE-DAY

04:04.033 --> 04:05.400
VISIT TO KENYA.

04:05.400 --> 04:06.900
ONE GOAL OF THE TRIP:

04:06.900 --> 04:08.867
STRENGTHENING TRADE BETWEEN SUB-

04:08.867 --> 04:10.367
SAHARAN AFRICA AND THE U-S.

04:10.367 --> 04:12.067
ANOTHER: FIGHTING TERRORISM.

04:12.067 --> 04:13.267
TO DISCUSS THOSE AND OTHER

04:13.267 --> 04:14.633
ISSUES, I'M JOINED BY FORMER

04:14.633 --> 04:16.000
U.S. AMBASSADOR TO NIGERIA, JOHN

04:16.000 --> 04:17.267
CAMPBELL, NOW THE RALPH BUNCHE

04:17.267 --> 04:18.533
SENIOR FELLOW FOR AFRICA POLICY

04:18.533 --> 04:19.533
STUDIES AT THE COUNCIL ON

04:19.533 --> 04:22.733
FOREIGN RELATIONS.

04:22.733 --> 04:23.833
SO LET'S START WITH THE TERROR

04:23.833 --> 04:24.800
ONE.

04:24.800 --> 04:27.033
HOW IS FIGHTING TERROR IN AFRICA

04:27.033 --> 04:29.433
IN I GUESS THE U.S. INTERESTS

04:29.433 --> 04:30.600
TODAY?

04:30.600 --> 04:34.467
>> TERRORISM IN AFRICA IS A

04:34.467 --> 04:36.533
DIRECT THREAT, NOT TO U.S.

04:36.533 --> 04:40.767
SECURITY, BUT TO U.S. INTERESTS.

04:40.767 --> 04:46.100
A FUNDAMENTAL U.S. INTEREST IN

04:46.100 --> 04:48.033
AFRICA IS THERE BE CONTINUED

04:48.033 --> 04:50.333
PROGRESS TOWARDS DEMOCRACY,

04:50.333 --> 04:54.600
TOWARDS DEVELOPMENT TOWARDS

04:54.600 --> 04:56.700
STABILITY.

04:56.700 --> 05:00.433
TERRORISM IS ACTIVE IN THE

05:00.433 --> 05:01.767
SAHEL, THESE ARE ALT AREAS WHERE

05:01.767 --> 05:03.033
THE U.S. HAS BEEN WORKING FOR A

05:03.033 --> 05:03.967
LONG TIME.

05:03.967 --> 05:07.867
>> LET'S LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC

05:07.867 --> 05:08.967
IMPACT AS WELL.

05:08.967 --> 05:10.767
THERE SEEMS TO BE ALMOST A RACE

05:10.767 --> 05:14.133
HERE TO PERHAPS COUNTER THE

05:14.133 --> 05:15.600
INFLUENCE THAT CHINA HAS ALREADY

05:15.600 --> 05:18.567
IN AFRICA AS A TRADING PARTNER

05:18.567 --> 05:22.533
AS A COUNTRY THAT IS MAKING

05:22.533 --> 05:23.400
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS THERE.

05:23.400 --> 05:28.000
>> MY VIEW THAT THAT CAN BE

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
OVEREMPHASIZED.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.700
CHINA HAS ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN

05:32.700 --> 05:33.500
AFRICA.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.300
THE REAL INTEREST IS THAT

05:35.300 --> 05:37.033
CHINESE ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN

05:37.033 --> 05:38.500
AFRICA BE RESPONSIBLE.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.200
AND THAT PARTICULAR IN PEACE AND

05:40.200 --> 05:41.567
SECURITY QUESTIONS, THAT CHINA

05:41.567 --> 05:44.700
PLAY A ROLE, COMMENSURATE WITH

05:44.700 --> 05:46.833
ITS ECONOMIC POSITION IN

05:46.833 --> 05:48.767
PARTICULARLY EAST AFRICA.

05:48.767 --> 05:50.300
>> AND SO WHEN THE PRESIDENT

05:50.300 --> 05:59.733
LAYS OUT THIS SORT OF

05:59.733 --> 06:00.633
ENTREPRENEURIAL FORUMS, HOW

06:00.633 --> 06:01.567
POSSIBLE IS THAT?

06:01.567 --> 06:03.900
>> WELL, IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME

06:03.900 --> 06:06.900
OBVIOUSLY BUT THE POPULATION OF

06:06.900 --> 06:12.033
SUBSAHARAN AFRICA IS APPROACHING

06:12.033 --> 06:13.000
1 BILLION.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.767
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF HURDLES

06:16.767 --> 06:19.767
TO OVERCOME.

06:19.767 --> 06:22.433
SUBSAHARAN HE AFRICA, IS VERY

06:22.433 --> 06:25.267
LITTLE INTRAAFRICAN TRADE.

06:25.267 --> 06:27.267
SO THERE IS A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT

06:27.267 --> 06:31.900
TO BE DONE.

06:31.900 --> 06:38.267
>> CLINTON AND BUSH AS WELL,

06:38.267 --> 06:40.167
PEPFAR, EMERGENCY AIDS RELIEF.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.200
THERE WERE ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR A

06:42.200 --> 06:44.567
NEW INITIATIVE FOCUSING ON

06:44.567 --> 06:45.400
ADOLESCENT GIRLS TOO.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.433
>> THERE WAS INDEED.

06:47.433 --> 06:50.900
ALSO VERY IMPORTANT U.S.

06:50.900 --> 06:54.233
INITIATIVE THAT'S BEEN

06:54.233 --> 07:00.667
OVERLOOKED IS MALARIA.

07:00.667 --> 07:02.100
SIMPLE PROGRAMS SUCH AS

07:02.100 --> 07:03.600
PROVIDING BED NETS FOR PEOPLE,

07:03.600 --> 07:10.833
CAN GREATLY REDUCE THE MORTALITY

07:10.833 --> 07:12.533
RATES ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.300
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA LEAVING

07:14.300 --> 07:19.833
BEHIND A DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF

07:19.833 --> 07:21.100
HIS BACKGROUND?

07:21.100 --> 07:23.633
>> REALLY IN TWO BROAD AREAS FOR

07:23.633 --> 07:25.067
ONE THING BECAUSE OF HIS

07:25.067 --> 07:28.300
BACKGROUND, I THINK AFRICA HAS

07:28.300 --> 07:30.433
WILLY-NILLY BEEN INTRODUCED TO

07:30.433 --> 07:31.967
SOME AMERICANS WHO OTHERWISE

07:31.967 --> 07:34.467
NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT

07:34.467 --> 07:35.267
IT.

07:35.267 --> 07:36.267
SIMILARLY, THE FACT THAT THE

07:36.267 --> 07:38.133
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

07:38.133 --> 07:44.533
IS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN, THAT IS

07:44.533 --> 07:45.967
OF PARTICULAR INTEREST AND

07:45.967 --> 07:47.700
INDEED EVEN PRIDE STRAIGHT

07:47.700 --> 07:49.933
ACROSS THE AFRICAN CONTINENT.

07:49.933 --> 07:51.433
SO YES, BOTH IN THE UNITED

07:51.433 --> 07:53.067
STATES BUT ALSO IN AFRICA.

07:53.067 --> 07:55.467
>> ALL RIGHT JOHN CAMPBELL,

07:55.467 --> 07:57.300
THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.

07:57.300 --> 07:59.367
>> THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR

07:59.367 --> 08:05.033
HAVING ME.

08:05.033 --> 08:05.900
>> Sreenivasan: READ MORE ABOUT

08:05.900 --> 08:06.733
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TRIP TO

08:06.733 --> 08:07.533

08:14.167 --> 08:15.033
SEGMENT TONIGHT LOOKS AT THE

08:15.033 --> 08:16.133
CRISIS OF MIGRANTS FROM AFRICA

08:16.133 --> 08:17.300
AND THE MIDDLE EAST RISKING

08:17.300 --> 08:18.500
THEIR LIVES ON THE MEDITERRANEAN

08:18.500 --> 08:19.767
SEA IN SEARCH OF A BETTER LIFE.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.300
FOR MANY, THEY TAKE TO THE WATER

08:21.300 --> 08:22.767
FROM LIBYA, WHERE THE

08:22.767 --> 08:24.100
LAWLESSNESS OF CIVIL WAR ALLOWS

08:24.100 --> 08:25.600
SMUGGLERS TO EASILY LAUNCH

08:25.600 --> 08:26.533
DESPERATE REFUGEES HOPING TO

08:26.533 --> 08:28.500
LAND IN EUROPE.

ITALY, SOME 300 MILES AWAY.

08:36.467 --> 08:38.200
BUT WHEN THE CURRENTS ARE ROUGH,

08:38.200 --> 08:39.733

HE WAS ONBOARD A PLASTIC RAFT,

13:51.767 --> 13:53.333
CRAMMED WITH 90 OTHER PEOPLE,

13:53.333 --> 13:55.233
HEADING TO ITALY.

13:55.233 --> 13:56.767
EVENTUALLY, THE BOAT SPRUNG A

13:56.767 --> 13:57.867
LEAK AND SLOWLY BEGAN TO FILL

13:57.867 --> 14:06.367
WITH WATER.

14:06.367 --> 14:07.600
>> THE WATER IS ENTERING INSIDE,

14:07.600 --> 14:08.433

14:08.433 --> 14:09.267
THE WATER IS COMING UP.

14:09.267 --> 14:10.133
SO THE WATER IS COMING DIFFERENT

14:10.133 --> 14:10.967
DIRECTIONS.

14:10.967 --> 14:11.833
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE EXACTLY

14:11.833 --> 14:12.833
WATER IS ENTERING THE BOAT.

14:12.833 --> 14:13.767
SO IT'S A TERRIBLE SITUATION.

14:13.767 --> 14:15.033
SOME PEOPLE ARE VOMITING, SOME

14:15.033 --> 14:16.900
PEOPLE ARE CRYING, SOME PEOPLE

14:16.900 --> 14:18.767
ARE FIGHTING BECAUSE YOU BECOME

CRAZY ON THE SEA.

14:21.300 --> 14:23.800
YOU BECOME DIFFERENT MAN.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.200
SO I WAS JUST THINKING TWO

14:25.200 --> 14:26.300
THINGS, THAT I WILL SURVIVE, OR

14:26.300 --> 14:27.967
I WILL DIE.

14:27.967 --> 14:30.567
THIS IS IT.

14:30.567 --> 14:32.467
>> Reporter: LIKE MOST MIGRANTS,

14:32.467 --> 14:34.033
OUSMAN HAD PUT HIS FATE IN THE

14:34.033 --> 14:35.500
HANDS OF HUMAN SMUGGLERS WHO

14:35.500 --> 14:36.767
TYPICALLY LEAVE THE MIGRANTS TO

14:36.767 --> 14:38.700
DRIVE THE BOATS THEMSELVES.

14:38.700 --> 14:40.767
THE JOURNEY CAN TAKE MORE THAN

14:40.767 --> 14:42.467
24 HOURS, THEY HAVE FEW TOOLS TO

14:42.467 --> 14:44.133
NAVIGATE, SOMETIMES RELYING ON

14:44.133 --> 14:45.067
JUST A COMPASS TO FIND THEIR WAY

14:45.067 --> 14:47.300
TO EUROPE.

14:47.300 --> 14:49.133
IN ZARZIS IT IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE

14:49.133 --> 14:50.733
THAT ONE OF THE WAYS THAT

14:50.733 --> 14:52.467
SMUGGLERS LURE MIGRANTS IS BY

14:52.467 --> 14:54.767
ADVERTISING ON SOCIAL MEDIA WITH

14:54.767 --> 14:56.500
POSTS LIKE THESE: FEATURING

14:56.500 --> 14:58.333

14:58.333 --> 15:00.133

15:02.033 --> 15:04.200
THIS POST, WHICH WAS RECENTLY

15:04.200 --> 15:06.767
TAKEN DOWN, LISTS THE PRICE PER

15:06.767 --> 15:08.200
ADULT: $1,000 TO BE FERRIED FROM

15:08.200 --> 15:11.433
LIBYA TO ITALY.

15:11.433 --> 15:13.100
OUSMAN IS ONE OF THOUSANDS OF

15:13.100 --> 15:14.667
MIGRANTS WHO HAVE FLOCKED TO THE

15:14.667 --> 15:16.433
WAR TORN COUNTRY BASED ON THE

15:16.433 --> 15:18.633
PROMISE OF MAKING IT TO EUROPE.

15:18.633 --> 15:20.267
BUT ONCE THEY ARRIVE IN LIBYA,

15:20.267 --> 15:21.867
THEY ARE CAUGHT IN VIOLENCE AND

15:21.867 --> 15:23.400
LAWLESSNESS, AND NO CHOICE BUT

15:23.400 --> 15:24.333
TO RISK THEIR LIVES ON THE

15:24.333 --> 15:26.867
MEDITERRANEAN.

15:26.867 --> 15:28.833
>> YOU CANNOT LIVE IN LIBYA.

15:28.833 --> 15:30.200
PEOPLE IN LIBYA, THEY JUST KEEP

15:30.200 --> 15:31.700
ON HARASSING BLACK PEOPLE, KEEP

15:31.700 --> 15:32.533
ON BEATING THEM, KEEP ON LOCK

15:32.533 --> 15:33.567
THEM.

15:33.567 --> 15:34.600
SOME OF THEM KIDNAP YOU IN YOUR

15:36.100 --> 15:39.033
YOU HAVE TO PAY MONEY FOR THEM

15:39.033 --> 15:40.300
OTHERWISE THEY'LL KILL.

15:40.300 --> 15:41.267
SO THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE TO

15:41.267 --> 15:42.133
GO, YOU HAVE TO CROSS TO ITALY.

15:42.133 --> 15:42.933
THIS IS A PROBLEM.

15:42.933 --> 15:44.167
LIBYAN SITUATION IS WORSE,

15:44.167 --> 15:45.033
BECAUSE THERE IS NO GOVERNMENT,

NOBODY IS CONTROL.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.500
HAVE ANY SHELTER HERE TO THIS

PEOPLE.

16:11.967 --> 16:13.000
WHEN THEY ARRIVE, WE HAVE A BIG

16:13.000 --> 16:24.333
PROBLEM TO RESOLVE THE SHELTER.

16:24.333 --> 16:25.433

16:25.433 --> 16:26.233
MAKE A BETTER LIFE THAN THEY

HAVE IN THERE COUNTRY.

16:30.667 --> 16:31.933
THEIR COUNTRY, THEY WANT TO

16:31.933 --> 16:33.367
SUPPORT THEIR FAMILY.

16:33.367 --> 16:34.733
BUT I THINK THAT THEY CANNOT GET

16:34.733 --> 16:37.433
IT.

16:37.433 --> 16:38.567

>> (translated): IT IS RISKY

16:45.833 --> 16:46.700
FOR US, BECAUSE THERE'S

16:46.700 --> 16:47.567
BACTERIA, DISEASE.

16:47.567 --> 16:48.700
AND PEOPLE ARE AFRAID.

16:48.700 --> 16:49.700
BUT IT IS A HUMANITARIAN DUTY,

16:49.700 --> 16:58.200
AND WE DO IT WILLINGLY.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.867
>> THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE, THEY

17:00.867 --> 17:01.933
LOVE THE SEA, SO THEY CAN'T JUST

17:01.933 --> 17:03.267
SEE PEOPLE DIE AND LEAVE THEM

17:03.267 --> 17:06.600
LIKE THAT.

17:06.600 --> 17:08.767
THEY SAVE MANY LIVES IN THE SEA.

17:08.767 --> 17:11.100
NOT ONLY US, BUT MANY PEOPLE.

17:11.100 --> 17:11.933

IT.

A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF HOW WE

17:27.700 --> 17:29.333
DOCUMENT CURRENT EVENTS.

17:52.300 --> 17:53.833
THEM.

17:53.833 --> 17:55.533
USING A FILTER, AFTER THE SNAP,

17:55.533 --> 17:57.033
TO MAKE A REGULAR PHOTO LOOK

17:57.033 --> 17:57.833
VINTAGE, IS AS EASY AS A MOUSE

17:57.833 --> 17:59.400
CLICK.

17:59.400 --> 18:01.100
SO IS REMOVING A LIGHT POST THAT

18:01.100 --> 18:02.600
SEEMS TO BE SHOOTING OUT OF

18:02.600 --> 18:03.400
SOMEONE'S HEAD BY USING

18:03.400 --> 18:04.600
PHOTOSHOP.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.100
BUT IN THE WORLD OF

18:07.133 --> 18:07.967
ALTERATIONS ARE THE SUBJECT OF

18:07.967 --> 18:09.767
INTENSE DEBATE.

18:09.767 --> 18:10.833
AND USING PHOTOSHOP CAN LAND YOU

18:10.833 --> 18:12.800
IN HOT WATER.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.767
LIKE IT DID FOR "THE ECONOMIST"

ESPECIALLY IN THE DIGITAL AGE.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.033
IT WAS ACTUALLY HARD TO BRING IT

DIRECTING SUBJECTS LIKE THE BOY

19:02.600 --> 19:04.167
IN THIS IMAGE.

19:04.167 --> 19:05.867
OR MISLEADING CAPTIONS: THIS MAN

19:16.500 --> 19:18.600
CONTROVERSIAL DIGITAL PHOTO

19:18.600 --> 19:19.667
MANIPULATION OCCURRED IN 1982

19:19.667 --> 19:20.533
WITH THE GREAT PYRAMIDS OF

19:20.533 --> 19:22.067
EGYPT.

19:22.067 --> 19:23.600
>> NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC TOOK A

19:23.600 --> 19:24.967
HORIZONTAL PHOTO AND WANTED TO

19:24.967 --> 19:26.533
PUT IT ON A VERTICAL COVER.

19:26.533 --> 19:27.600
AND THEY MOVED THE PYRAMIDS

19:27.600 --> 19:28.867
CLOSER TOGETHER.

19:28.867 --> 19:29.700
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT REALLY

19:29.700 --> 19:31.833
GOT PEOPLE'S ATTENTION.

19:31.833 --> 19:33.700
ANOTHER REALLY EGREGIOUS EXAMPLE

19:33.700 --> 19:36.767
OF MANIPULATION IS THE LOS

19:36.767 --> 19:38.700
ANGELES TIMES PHOTO FROM 2003,

19:38.700 --> 19:39.533
WHERE A PHOTOGRAPHER TOOK TWO

19:39.533 --> 19:41.533
PHOTOS.

19:41.533 --> 19:43.533
THEY WERE BOTH QUITE DRAMATIC.

19:43.533 --> 19:45.567
THERE WAS A BRITISH SOLDIER IN

19:45.567 --> 19:46.367
THE PHOTO AND THERE WAS AN IRAQI

19:46.367 --> 19:49.233
CIVILIAN.

19:49.233 --> 19:50.167
IN ONE PHOTO HE LIKED THE WAY

19:50.167 --> 19:51.333
THE SOLDIER LOOKED.

19:51.333 --> 19:52.533
AND IN THE OTHER PHOTO HE LIKED

19:52.533 --> 19:54.033
THE WAY THE CIVILIAN LOOKED.

19:54.033 --> 19:55.500
SO HE DECIDED TO JUST COMBINE

19:55.500 --> 19:57.333
THE TWO PHOTOS IN PHOTOSHOP.

19:57.333 --> 19:58.233
AND IT WAS ACTUALLY PRINTED ALL

19:58.233 --> 19:59.333
OVER THE WORLD.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.267
INCONSISTENCIES WERE NOTICED,

20:02.267 --> 20:05.000

20:05.000 --> 20:06.200

FROM DIFFERENT TIMES AND

20:20.100 --> 20:21.967
LOCATIONS.

20:21.967 --> 20:23.400
EVEN BEFORE PHOTOGRAPHY WENT

20:23.400 --> 20:24.233
DIGITAL, THE MEDIA ALTERED

20:41.433 --> 20:42.900
DARKER AND BLACKER THAN HE

20:42.900 --> 20:43.900
REALLY WAS.

20:43.900 --> 20:46.200
NEWSWEEK DIDN'T.

20:55.467 --> 20:56.367
THE SMOKE TO MAKE THE DAMAGE

20:56.367 --> 20:57.800
LOOK WORSE.

20:57.800 --> 20:59.933
TWO YEARS AGO, THE ASSOCIATED

20:59.933 --> 21:01.800

21:14.433 --> 21:16.767
INSIDE THE FRAME.

21:16.767 --> 21:17.667

22:39.300 --> 22:41.600
>> IT'S PRETTY BAD BECAUSE

22:41.600 --> 22:42.967
ENERGY COMPANIES WERE EXPECTING

22:42.967 --> 22:44.567
A REBOUND IN THE OIL PRICE.

22:44.567 --> 22:48.533
THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD GO FROM 60

TO 70 OR $80 DURING THE SECOND

22:50.867 --> 22:53.700

22:53.700 --> 22:55.333
DROPPED BELOW $50 A BARREL.

22:55.333 --> 22:56.600
SO COMPANIES ARE HAVING TO

22:56.600 --> 22:58.167
FIGURE OUT WHAT DO THEY HAVE TO

DO TO WEATHER THIS, NOT JUST

THIS YEAR BUT ALL OF NEXT YEAR

23:01.300 --> 23:02.200
TOO.

23:11.800 --> 23:13.633
THEY'VE BECOME MORE EFFICIENT,

23:13.633 --> 23:15.233
PUMPING MORE OIL AND GAS OUT OF

23:15.233 --> 23:16.933
THE GROUND EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE

DRILLING LESS AND IT'S NOT JUST

23:18.200 --> 23:19.067
IN THE U.S.

23:19.067 --> 23:20.867
THERE ARE A LOT OF REALLY BIG

23:20.867 --> 23:22.100
OIL PRODUCERS IN THE WORLD THAT
