I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.240 --> 00:07.908 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:07.941 --> 00:10.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"

As Hillary Clinton heads back to

in a key Republican
county about the election.

00:16.583 --> 00:20.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAIL CARPENTER, Trump Supporter:
We need a
bull in a China shop to break
things up.

00:20.220 --> 00:21.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not working.

00:21.321 --> 00:23.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The economy's bad.

00:23.123 --> 00:25.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm very worried about Iran and
North Korea.

00:25.425 --> 00:28.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I feel like he will do what he
needs to do
to keep us safe.

00:28.729 --> 00:33.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead this
Thursday, the
age of hacking -- why
information feels less

00:33.700 --> 00:37.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
safe than ever, and how it could
affect this
year's election.

00:37.404 --> 00:42.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the second
part of our
forced marriage series takes on
the frightening

00:42.476 --> 00:47.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reality of American women and
girls being
offered as brides in another
country.

00:47.648 --> 00:49.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JADA, New Jersey Teen: I was a
kid.

00:49.483 --> 00:53.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I really hadn't grown that
much, so I
was really scared.

00:53.787 --> 00:56.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:56.890 --> 01:01.228 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:01.261 --> 01:12.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For Hillary Clinton,

The Democratic presidential
nominee returned
to campaigning today after
recuperating from

01:17.444 --> 01:19.413 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
illness.

01:19.446 --> 01:24.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She appeared rested, recovered,
as ready to
return to the campaign trail as
she boarded

01:24.651 --> 01:26.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
her flight to North Carolina.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Welcome back to stronger

01:28.422 --> 01:29.389 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: How are you doing?

01:29.423 --> 01:30.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How are you feeling?

01:30.424 --> 01:31.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I am
doing great.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you so much.

01:33.193 --> 01:38.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Clinton was last
seen Sunday in
New York, nearly collapsing from
pneumonia

01:38.665 --> 01:41.568 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
while leaving a 9/11 memorial.

01:41.601 --> 01:45.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, she flew to her first
event of the
week in Greensboro, North
Carolina.

01:45.405 --> 01:50.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I'm not
great at taking
it easy even under ordinary
circumstances,

01:50.911 --> 02:00.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but with just two months to go
until Election
Day, sitting at home was pretty
much the last

02:00.654 --> 02:02.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
place I wanted to be.

02:02.255 --> 02:06.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Clinton's aides
released a letter
from her doctor on Wednesday.

02:06.159 --> 02:11.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It rated the 68-year-old
candidate healthy
and fit to serve as president.

02:11.932 --> 02:17.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, she said her time away
helped her reconnect
to why she is running.

02:17.304 --> 02:19.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She explained later to
reporters.

02:19.139 --> 02:22.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I'm
going to close
my campaign focused on
opportunities for kids

02:22.876 --> 02:26.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and fairness for families that's
been the
cause of my life.

02:26.413 --> 02:29.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It will be the passion of my
presidency.

02:29.383 --> 02:31.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're offering ideas, not
insults.

02:31.785 --> 02:36.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Republican Donald
Trump, who is
70 years old, released a letter
today from

02:36.857 --> 02:38.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his longtime doctor.

02:38.959 --> 02:44.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It also declared Trump healthy,
noting that
he takes cholesterol medication
and a low

02:44.664 --> 02:46.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
dose of aspirin.

02:46.466 --> 02:50.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump discussed his medical
status in an interview
airing today on "The Dr. Oz
Show."

02:50.170 --> 02:51.938 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

02:51.972 --> 02:54.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEHMET OZ, "The Dr. Oz Show": If
elected at
age 70, you will be the oldest
person to ever

02:54.641 --> 02:56.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
enter the Oval Office.

02:56.476 --> 03:02.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Just about the
same age as Ronald
Reagan, and Hillary is a year
behind me.

03:02.449 --> 03:07.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would say, just based on my
life, I actually
-- and I don't know if this
makes sense -- I

03:07.988 --> 03:10.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
feel as good today as I did when
I was 30.

03:10.490 --> 03:15.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The GOP nominee also
talked policy
today at the Economic Club of
New York.

03:15.796 --> 03:20.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Over the next 10
years, our
economic team estimates that,
under our plan,

03:20.934 --> 03:29.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the economy will average 3.5
percent growth
and created a total of 25
million new jobs.

03:29.676 --> 03:31.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You can visit our Web site.

03:31.778 --> 03:32.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Just look at the math.

03:33.013 --> 03:34.915 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It works.

03:34.948 --> 03:38.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Meanwhile, more
evidence the race
is tightening, with a CBS
News-New York Times

03:38.852 --> 03:42.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
poll giving Clinton just a
two-point lead.

03:42.055 --> 03:48.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It also suggests an enthusiasm
gap; 51 percent
of Trump supporters say they're
very enthusiastic

03:48.495 --> 03:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about voting, while only 43
percent of Clinton
supporters say the same.

03:53.467 --> 03:57.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Health, stamina and enthusiasm
matter.

03:57.070 --> 04:03.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The candidates have 54 days left
until Election
Day, and just 11 days until
their first scheduled

04:03.176 --> 04:04.945 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
debate.

04:04.978 --> 04:08.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We will look at how the
presidential race
is shaping up in the critical
state of Ohio

04:08.615 --> 04:10.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
later in the program.

JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: The
United Nations blamed Syria's
President Bashar

04:14.588 --> 04:20.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
al-Assad for delays in getting
humanitarian
aid into the country, despite
the new cease-

04:20.360 --> 04:22.262 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fire.

04:22.295 --> 04:27.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.N. officials want to send
convoys into Aleppo
from Turkey, but they say Syria
isn't providing

04:27.767 --> 04:29.536 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
permits.

04:29.569 --> 04:34.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Geneva today, U.N. special
envoy Staffan
De Mistura complained that
valuable time is

04:34.641 --> 04:36.443 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
being wasted.

04:36.476 --> 04:38.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STAFFAN DE MISTURA, Special
United Nations
Envoy for Syria: These are days
which we should

04:38.245 --> 04:46.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have used for convoys to move
with the permit
to go because there is no
fighting.

04:46.686 --> 04:51.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Russian Federation is
agreeing with us
about this.

04:51.124 --> 04:54.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is something that requires
to take place
immediately.

04:54.594 --> 05:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, in
Syria, amateur
video purported to show
government airstrikes

05:00.367 --> 05:05.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on rebel groups in Homs and
Idlib, in violation
of the cease-fire.

05:05.872 --> 05:11.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syria's main ally, Russia,
reported 45 rebel
violations in the last 24 hours.

05:11.311 --> 05:17.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A self-described hit
man in the
Philippines now says President
Rodrigo Duterte

05:17.384 --> 05:19.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
personally ordered killings by
death squads.

05:19.753 --> 05:25.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Edgar Matobato says it happened
when Duterte
was mayor of the southern city
of Davao.

05:25.292 --> 05:28.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He testified today at a senate
investigation.

05:28.161 --> 05:32.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's looking into killings of
3,000 drug suspects
since Duterte became president.

05:32.933 --> 05:38.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, President
Obama today created the first
national sanctuary

05:38.471 --> 05:40.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the Atlantic Ocean.

05:40.340 --> 05:46.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Marine Monument encompasses
5,000 square
miles off New England and
includes underwater

05:46.613 --> 05:48.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
canyons and mountains.

05:48.615 --> 05:52.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The designation means a ban on
commercial
fishing, mining and drilling.

05:52.953 --> 05:58.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The head of the IRS
will avoid
a congressional impeachment vote
for now.

05:58.325 --> 06:03.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, John Koskinen has
agreed to testify
at a House hearing next week.

06:03.196 --> 06:07.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican conservatives accused
him of impeding
an investigation into tax
treatment of Tea

06:07.834 --> 06:09.002 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Party groups.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Koskinen has denied it.

06:10.737 --> 06:15.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Wall Street
headed back
up, with tech companies leading
the way.

06:15.175 --> 06:20.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 177
points today to close at 18212.

06:20.547 --> 06:26.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose nearly 76
points, and the
S&amp;P 500 added 21.

06:26.186 --> 06:31.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Still to come on the
"NewsHour":
the rise in computer hacks
against political

06:31.591 --> 06:38.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
players; a GOP stronghold in
Ohio up for grabs;
the changing economy, where big
businesses

06:38.198 --> 06:45.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
employ far fewer people; and
much more.

06:45.238 --> 06:58.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This year's
political campaign
has a new and different wrinkle.

06:58.585 --> 07:03.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cyber-hacking has led to regular
public releases
of documents and private e-mails
involving

07:03.923 --> 07:06.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the political parties and key
players.

07:06.593 --> 07:09.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Democrats are the most
frequent targets.

07:09.162 --> 07:12.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But it's not only them.

07:12.265 --> 07:16.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The list of election season
cyber-attacks
is growing.

07:16.102 --> 07:19.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The latest target, former
Secretary of State
Colin Powell.

07:19.906 --> 07:26.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A trove of his e-mails appeared
online this
week after his personal account
was hacked.

07:26.279 --> 07:31.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In one referring to GOP nominee
Donald Trump
and black voters, Powell wrote,
"He takes

07:32.018 --> 07:33.920 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
us for idiots."

07:33.953 --> 07:38.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Another referred to Democrat
Hillary Clinton
as greedy, not transformational.

07:38.992 --> 07:45.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The messages were posted on a
site that's
reportedly an outlet for hackers
tied to Russia.

07:45.198 --> 07:47.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Clinton today did blame the
Russians.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The White House wasn't saying.

07:49.369 --> 07:51.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
We don't necessarily want to
reveal sources

07:51.471 --> 07:56.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and methods that the FBI uses to
conduct these
kinds of investigations.

07:56.509 --> 08:01.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All of this
follows the July
release of thousands of
Democratic National

08:01.314 --> 08:02.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Committee e-mails.

08:03.016 --> 08:08.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were published on WikiLeaks
just before
the Democratic Convention.

08:08.054 --> 08:12.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Tuesday, WikiLeaks
tweeted a link to
more DNC files.

08:12.759 --> 08:18.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Web site's founder, Julian
Assange, claimed
in an interview with the
"NewsHour" last month

08:18.198 --> 08:19.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that it's done in the public
interest.

08:20.033 --> 08:24.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JULIAN ASSANGE, Founder,
WikiLeaks: And that
performs an ongoing role leading
to great

08:24.070 --> 08:30.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
works in investigative
journalism, successful
court cases, civil litigation,
criminal process,

08:30.910 --> 08:35.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, of course, also contributes
to public
understanding.

08:35.048 --> 08:39.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile,
Politico reports
hackers are also targeting state
Democratic

08:39.886 --> 08:41.755 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
officials.

08:41.788 --> 08:46.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And congressman Michael McCaul,
chair of the
House Homeland Security
Committee, says Republican

08:46.626 --> 08:48.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
operatives have been hacked as
well.

08:48.862 --> 08:55.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, in Washington yesterday,
the president's
homeland security adviser, Lisa
Monaco, played

08:55.435 --> 08:59.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down any threat to the integrity
of the election,
but added:

08:59.038 --> 09:03.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA MONACO, Chief White House
Counterterrorism
Adviser: The efforts of
malicious actors to

09:03.109 --> 09:09.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
intrude upon voter registration
databases
and other elements of our
critical infrastructure,

09:09.416 --> 09:12.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
as well as our voting
infrastructure, is of
concern.

09:12.352 --> 09:16.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The White House
says if there
is a response to the hacking, it
may not be

09:16.689 --> 09:21.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
announced in advance, or ever.

09:21.127 --> 09:27.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For a deeper look at the actors
and the politics
behind the hacks, we turn to
Dmitri Alperovitch.

09:27.200 --> 09:31.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's co-founder and chief
technology officer
at CrowdStrike.

09:31.571 --> 09:37.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the cyber-security firm
that investigated
online breaches of the
Democratic Party over

09:37.143 --> 09:38.545 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the summer.

09:38.578 --> 09:43.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And David Sanger, chief
Washington correspondent
for The New York Times.

09:43.349 --> 09:45.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

09:45.618 --> 09:47.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Dmitri, let me start with you.

09:47.487 --> 09:52.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How does this cyber-hacking of
the Democrats
and others this year compare to
what we have

09:52.926 --> 09:54.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
seen in previous elections?

09:54.928 --> 09:57.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH, Co-Founder
and CEO, CrowdStrike:
Well, it's really fascinating
right now, not

09:57.897 --> 10:01.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the sense that election
officials are getting
hacked or political figures are
getting hacked.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have seen that in other
countries.

10:03.369 --> 10:06.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have certainly seen in
the course of
the last couple of years in
Ukraine in particular,

10:06.773 --> 10:10.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where the Russians have been
very aggressive
in trying to disrupt the
presidential election

10:10.543 --> 10:12.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the parliamentary elections
in Ukraine.

10:12.745 --> 10:15.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what's impressing me about
this activity
right now is that it's happening
against the

10:15.982 --> 10:16.950 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
United States.

10:16.983 --> 10:18.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That, we have never seen before.

10:18.852 --> 10:24.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it speaks frankly to the
boldness of these
adversaries that are doing this
to all types

10:24.457 --> 10:26.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of figures across our political
spectrum.

10:26.259 --> 10:30.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we know the
administration
is not naming the Russians, so
how strong

10:30.230 --> 10:32.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is the evidence that that is
that who is it,
the Russians?

10:32.265 --> 10:35.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: Well, at
CrowdStrike,
we were the ones who were
brought in to investigate

10:35.768 --> 10:42.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the DNC and then the DCCC, the
Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee
hacks, and

10:42.509 --> 10:45.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're protecting actually a
number of organizations
across the political spectrum
now.

10:45.812 --> 10:50.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can tell you that, based on
our investigation,
we're very confident that
Russian intelligence

10:50.850 --> 10:53.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
operatives were behind those
intrusions.

10:53.219 --> 10:57.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Sanger,
what is known
about the motive of the
Russians?

10:57.323 --> 11:02.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SANGER, The New York
Times: It's not
entirely clear, Judy, what their
motives are

11:02.195 --> 11:03.463 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
may be.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This could have started as a
generalist espionage
operation.

11:05.865 --> 11:10.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And of, course, it's worth
remembering that
political organizations are
considered fair

11:10.837 --> 11:19.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
game for espionage by foreign
intelligence
groups, including by the NSA and
the CIA.

11:19.646 --> 11:24.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We do this in our efforts to
understand, the
United States, that is, in our
efforts to

11:24.050 --> 11:27.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
understanding what is happening
in Russia,
China and other places.

11:28.021 --> 11:32.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what is different, as Dmitri
said, is
taking that information and, in
the lingo

11:32.926 --> 11:37.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the industry, weaponizing it,
in other
words, releasing this in public.

11:37.931 --> 11:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is something we haven't
seen much
against American officials.

11:40.633 --> 11:49.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We got a first taste of it when
phone conversations
between Victoria Nuland, a
senior State Department

11:49.676 --> 11:54.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
official, and an the American
ambassador in
Ukraine were broadcast.

11:54.314 --> 12:02.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then we got more of that when
the DNC material
was stolen, probably as long ago
as up to

12:02.221 --> 12:07.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a year ago, but perhaps earlier
this year,
and then released this summer
just before,

12:07.393 --> 12:09.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as you said, the Democratic
National Convention.

12:10.029 --> 12:16.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the timing seemed released
-- seemed designed
to disturb the election.

12:16.603 --> 12:20.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The big fear, of course -- and
we wrote about
this in The Times this morning
-- is that

12:20.907 --> 12:25.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're only at the beginning end
of this and
the next step might be the
election vote itself.

12:25.311 --> 12:27.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

12:27.213 --> 12:31.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much damage -- before we
talk about what's
ahead, Dmitri, how much damage
has been done?

12:31.084 --> 12:33.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is it possible to quantity?

12:33.086 --> 12:35.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have every reason to
expect it's going
to keep coming.

12:35.355 --> 12:40.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: Well,
certainly, reputations
right now are being impacted of
various official,

12:40.259 --> 12:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not just at the presidential
level, but at
the sort of local and state
levels whose private

12:47.266 --> 12:50.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dossiers and other campaign
information is
being released.

12:50.470 --> 12:54.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's, I think, hard to tell
whether it's
going to impact any races
specifically.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there's no question that
it's impacting
this race.

12:57.176 --> 13:02.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have already seen some
resignations
of senior Democratic Party
officials as a

13:02.148 --> 13:03.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
result of these leaks.

13:03.149 --> 13:05.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And back to you,
David.

13:05.218 --> 13:11.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We heard Julian Assange in that
conversation
-- we didn't report just now
this -- but I

13:11.290 --> 13:17.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think there's no question that
he carries
a serious strong, hard feelings
against Hillary

13:17.530 --> 13:23.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton, because she was very
critical of
him during that huge dump of
State Department

13:23.469 --> 13:26.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cables back in 2010.

13:26.272 --> 13:31.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do we believe that it is between
the Russians
and Julian Assange and anybody
else involved,

13:31.778 --> 13:37.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WikiLeaks, that the Democrats
are going to
continue to be the main target
here?

13:37.283 --> 13:43.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SANGER: Well, they could
well be, although
the leaks from Secretary
Powell's e-mails

13:43.423 --> 13:47.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were obviously highly critical
of Donald Trump
as well.

13:47.293 --> 13:50.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So that doesn't quite fit the
narrative.

13:50.129 --> 13:56.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Julian Assange has made no
secret of his
distaste for Hillary Clinton,
and neither

13:56.402 --> 13:58.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has Vladimir Putin.

13:58.204 --> 14:03.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's important to
remember, Judy,
that in Putin's mind, the United
States and

14:03.209 --> 14:10.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary Clinton personally
intervened in
the 2011 Russian parliamentary
election, which

14:10.283 --> 14:15.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mrs. Clinton denounced as a
rigged election.

14:15.888 --> 14:20.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Putin believes that
encouraged street
protests against him and his
party.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So he protested that at the
time.

14:23.996 --> 14:28.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in his mind, this may simply
be returning
a favor.

14:28.067 --> 14:30.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I want to
ask both of
you about something.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, David, you wrote about this
today.

14:33.139 --> 14:34.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You just raised it.

14:34.607 --> 14:38.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dmitri, how vulnerable are U.S.
election systems?

14:38.945 --> 14:46.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How possible is it, how likely
is it that
outside actors could interfere
with the voting,

14:46.919 --> 14:48.688 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the election in November?

14:48.721 --> 14:51.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: Well,
there's certainly
no question that there are
vulnerabilities

14:51.457 --> 14:53.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in our election systems.

14:53.359 --> 14:57.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have electronic voting
machines in certain
counties that don't produce a
paper ballot.

14:57.563 --> 15:01.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So if they're hacked, there's
actually no
way to tell what the original
vote intention

15:01.934 --> 15:03.636 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
would have been.

15:03.669 --> 15:06.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If there's a backup paper ballot
that's printed
out, then you can always go back
and sort

15:06.372 --> 15:07.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of recount the vote manually.

15:07.807 --> 15:10.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, in those cases, they would
certainly be
safe against hacking.

15:10.510 --> 15:13.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it all depends on how
close the election's
going to be.

15:13.079 --> 15:16.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it's going to come down like
in 2000 to
a few hundred votes and it may
be a couple

15:16.816 --> 15:21.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of counties, then there's
certainly significant
potential for manipulation that
could occur.

15:21.988 --> 15:25.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it's not even close, if it's
a landslide,
then it's not going to have any
effect.

15:25.291 --> 15:29.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what I worry about even more
than the
actual manipulation of the vote
is the shadow

15:29.962 --> 15:33.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that can be cast on the
integrity of the process.

15:33.232 --> 15:38.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even if there is proclamations
by these hackers
that they hacked the election or
they have

15:38.871 --> 15:42.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
manipulated the vote, whether
they had actually
done it or not, that's going to
convince some

15:42.809 --> 15:48.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters if their candidate had
lost that the
vote was actually rigged and the
person that

15:48.981 --> 15:50.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they were voting for should have
won..

15:50.383 --> 15:52.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, you did a
great deal
of reporting on this.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What did you find?

15:54.620 --> 15:58.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SANGER: Well, the first
thing we found,
Judy, is that the voting
machines themselves

15:58.958 --> 16:04.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are pretty hard to hack because
they are largely
offline, though, as Dmitri
points out, in

16:04.130 --> 16:10.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
five states, there's basically
no paper trail,
and I think that's pretty
dangerous.

16:10.503 --> 16:17.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secondly, while they may not be
able to manipulate
the vote itself, it could cause
a lot of disruption

16:17.443 --> 16:26.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that could make the experience
in 2000, the
hanging chads in Florida, look
like a comparatively

16:26.285 --> 16:28.187 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
small problem.

16:28.221 --> 16:34.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They could, for example, alter
data on voter
registration rolls, so people
can show up

16:34.393 --> 16:36.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to vote and their names would be
missing.

16:36.863 --> 16:41.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They would probably do a
provisional ballot,
but it would take a while to
sort that out.

16:41.868 --> 16:47.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's question about the
safety of the systems
in which the votes once tallied
on election

16:47.607 --> 16:51.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
eve are then transmitted within
the states,
whether that's encrypted or not.

16:51.577 --> 16:53.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Of course, every state does it
differently.

16:54.013 --> 16:58.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact they do it differently
is probably
also a source of a little bit of
protection.

16:58.351 --> 17:04.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, finally, Judy, there's the
system that
we all use to report the
election results.

17:04.857 --> 17:10.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, you know, when the
"NewsHour" and others
report results on election
night, you will

17:10.162 --> 17:13.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be getting early tallies from
the AP.

17:13.099 --> 17:19.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If somebody got into that
reporting system
and you had false numbers or
slightly altered

17:19.138 --> 17:25.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
numbers, then there would be a
discrepancy
between what we heard on TV at
night and the

17:25.244 --> 17:30.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
numbers as they came in for the
actual vote
count.

17:30.116 --> 17:35.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that would also, as Dmitri
points out,
create some doubts about the
system, even

17:35.221 --> 17:37.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if it's only the real vote count
that matters.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Disturbing.

17:39.191 --> 17:43.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know it merits further --
there will
be more reporting on this.

17:43.629 --> 17:47.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dmitri Alperovitch, David
Sanger, thank you
both.

17:47.199 --> 17:51.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID SANGER: Thank you.

17:51.170 --> 17:55.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: Thank you.

17:55.141 --> 18:02.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In Ohio, Donald
Trump and Hillary
Clinton appear to be in a dead
heat.

18:02.882 --> 18:04.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the stakes are higher for
Trump.

18:04.884 --> 18:10.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Buckeye State has voted for
the winning
candidate in every election
since 1964, and

18:10.456 --> 18:13.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no Republican has ever won the
White House
without it.

18:13.492 --> 18:17.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, we begin a two-part
look at two counties
that tell the tale.

18:17.563 --> 18:21.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Yang starts our reporting
in a suburb
outside Columbus.

18:21.734 --> 18:28.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: September in
Delaware, Ohio, means
the annual All-Horse Parade, the
biggest event

18:28.741 --> 18:30.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of its kind east of the
Mississippi.

18:30.776 --> 18:35.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And among those gathered along
the parade
route, we found enthusiastic
supporters on

18:35.548 --> 18:38.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
both sides in the presidential
horse race.

18:38.684 --> 18:41.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Retired educator Gail Carpenter
is voting
for Donald Trump.

18:41.354 --> 18:44.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAIL CARPENTER, Trump Supporter:
We need a
bull in a China shop to break
things up.

18:44.323 --> 18:45.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not working.

18:45.424 --> 18:47.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The economy's bad.

18:47.226 --> 18:49.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm very worried about Iran and
North Korea.

18:49.528 --> 18:53.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I feel like he will do what he
needs to do
to keep us safe.

18:53.099 --> 18:57.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Jen Villanueva
Henkle, who works
with children, backs Hillary
Clinton.

18:57.069 --> 18:59.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEN VILLANUEVA HENKLE, Clinton
Supporter:
She's done a lot for women and
children and

18:59.872 --> 19:02.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people living in poverty for the
entire history
of her career.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We support her and we're excited
to see her
be our next president.

19:05.511 --> 19:08.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But there were also
folks like
Julie Lamb.

19:08.614 --> 19:12.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIE LAMB, Ohio: It's been a
crazy ride for
the last year.

19:12.585 --> 19:17.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm Republican, so that's
probably the
way I'm going to go, but not
that necessarily

19:17.590 --> 19:19.692 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that crazy about that candidate.

19:19.725 --> 19:25.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And here in the most
Republican
county in Ohio, that could spell
trouble for

19:26.032 --> 19:27.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

19:27.500 --> 19:32.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Polls in the state show him
locked in a tight
contest with Clinton.

19:32.638 --> 19:38.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No Republican has won the White
House without
winning this state.

19:38.310 --> 19:43.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both campaigns have opened field
offices in
Delaware County within the past
week.

19:43.182 --> 19:47.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is Ohio's wealthiest and
fastest-growing
county.

19:47.420 --> 19:53.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Farmland is quickly giving way
to manicured
lawns and big houses.

19:53.325 --> 19:57.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Republican presidential
candidates have won
this county in every election
since before

19:57.963 --> 19:59.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this diner opened in 1932.

19:59.799 --> 20:05.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KYLE KONDIK, University of
Virginia: You would
expect a Republican to run 10 to
15 points

20:05.704 --> 20:07.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
better in a place like Delaware
than they
do statewide.

20:07.807 --> 20:12.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And that's where we
met Kyle Kondik
of the University of Virginia
Center for Politics.

20:12.778 --> 20:16.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's written a book on Ohio's
role in picking
presidents, "The Bellwether."

20:16.549 --> 20:22.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KYLE KONDIK: What a Republican
needs to do
is run up the score in Ohio in
the conservative

20:22.354 --> 20:28.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rural counties and also the
high-income, highly
educated suburban counties that
again are

20:28.194 --> 20:29.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
typically very Republican.

20:29.695 --> 20:30.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Like Delaware County.

20:30.696 --> 20:32.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KYLE KONDIK: Like Delaware
County.

20:32.431 --> 20:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's the path to victory.

20:34.066 --> 20:37.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think we saw that with
George W. Bush
in 2000 and 2004.

20:38.003 --> 20:42.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Trump isn't doing quite as
well as Republicans
typically do in some of those
places, that

20:42.308 --> 20:44.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
might be a problem for him and
he will have
to make up the votes elsewhere.

20:44.877 --> 20:50.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Which is why voters
like John Stark,
who owns a construction company,
are a threat

20:50.549 --> 20:52.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to Trump's chances.

20:52.318 --> 20:55.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Your first election,
presidential election
was what year?

20:55.955 --> 20:57.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN STARK, Ohio: 1984.

20:57.123 --> 20:58.090 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: You voted for?

20:58.124 --> 20:59.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN STARK: For Reagan.

20:59.592 --> 21:03.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And which party's
candidate have
you voted for ever since?

21:03.062 --> 21:04.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN STARK: The Republicans.

21:04.497 --> 21:05.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Until now?

21:05.998 --> 21:09.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN STARK: Yes, I think this
will be the
first time not to, honestly.

21:09.101 --> 21:13.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Was that a difficult
decision for
you, as someone who has voted
for the Republican

21:13.038 --> 21:15.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
candidate every time since 1984?

21:15.508 --> 21:16.642 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JOHN STARK: No.

21:16.675 --> 21:19.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I first saw Trump, I knew I
couldn't
vote for him.

21:19.411 --> 21:20.746 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

21:20.779 --> 21:23.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Nothing Trump has
said or done
since has swayed him.

21:23.315 --> 21:27.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN STARK: The Republican Party
to me is
a party of small government, low
regulations,

21:27.953 --> 21:29.388 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
low taxes.

21:29.421 --> 21:32.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And here we're not really sure
what he stands
for, except himself.

21:32.591 --> 21:34.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He likes to talk about himself a
lot.

21:34.660 --> 21:39.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Trump's economic
message doesn't
resonate with voters in this
prosperous county

21:39.198 --> 21:40.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like Stark.

21:40.399 --> 21:42.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He says business is good.

21:42.401 --> 21:47.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his son got a job as an
audio engineer
a within a week of graduating
college.

21:47.973 --> 21:50.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Voting for Clinton was never an
option.

21:50.442 --> 21:51.877 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
His candidate?

21:51.911 --> 21:53.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Libertarian Gary Johnson.

21:53.946 --> 21:57.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you worry that voting for
Johnson could
help Clinton?

21:57.750 --> 22:00.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN STARK: I guess I don't
care.

22:00.352 --> 22:02.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, I got -- you got to
have principles,
right?

22:02.988 --> 22:08.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But it's not as if
Clinton's having
an easy ride here.

22:08.894 --> 22:15.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Cathy Okunlola was an
enthusiastic Barack
Obama supporter in 2008 and
2012.

22:15.267 --> 22:19.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This time, she's backing
Clinton, but without
that same excitement.

22:19.205 --> 22:23.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CATHY OKUNLOLA, Clinton
Supporter: She's not
going to get up and have those
huge inspiring

22:23.909 --> 22:25.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rallies that Obama did, you
know?

22:25.811 --> 22:30.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not like a big party when
you walk in
the room for Hillary, but she
gets the job

22:30.482 --> 22:31.450 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
done.

22:31.483 --> 22:33.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she really wants to help
people, I think.

22:33.786 --> 22:35.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, she's doing it for the
right reasons,
I think.

22:35.988 --> 22:40.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: A stay-at-home mother
of two young
daughters, Okunlola said her
main goal on

22:40.826 --> 22:42.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Election Day is to beat Trump.

22:42.661 --> 22:44.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CATHY OKUNLOLA: I really dislike
Trump.

22:44.964 --> 22:49.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I never really believed he would
be the nominee,
but, hey, here we are.

22:49.168 --> 22:51.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, yes, so I'm voting for
Hillary.

22:51.103 --> 22:54.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: She struggled to put
her feelings
about Clinton into words.

22:54.873 --> 22:59.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CATHY OKUNLOLA: There's that kid
in your class
that just plugs away at
everything, you know?

22:59.411 --> 23:05.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're not exactly the popular
kid, and they're
not exactly super talented at
music or anything,

23:05.451 --> 23:10.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but they just -- they study
hard, and they
show up, and they're always the
talk of the

23:10.055 --> 23:11.490 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
class.

23:11.523 --> 23:14.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama would have been the prom
king and everybody
would've loved him.

23:14.727 --> 23:18.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And everybody went to school
with somebody
like that, you know, that
everybody wanted

23:18.264 --> 23:20.032 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be around.

23:20.065 --> 23:23.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she's not that person, but
she is somebody
where, if you were in trouble,
that's who

23:23.269 --> 23:25.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you wanted, you know?

23:25.204 --> 23:31.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Voters like Stark and
Okunlola
could well decide who wins Ohio
and perhaps,

23:31.243 --> 23:32.344 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the presidency.

23:32.378 --> 23:34.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Analyst Kyle Kondik:

23:34.513 --> 23:39.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KYLE KONDIK: I would suspect the
margin between
Trump and Clinton in Delaware
County will

23:39.051 --> 23:44.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be smaller than the typical
margin between
a Republican and Democrat in
this county,

23:44.189 --> 23:48.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that could be very helpful
to Clinton,
but Trump may have opportunities
to make that

23:48.661 --> 23:52.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up in some more traditionally
Democratic places
that might be a little bit more
Republican

23:52.865 --> 23:54.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this time.

23:54.767 --> 24:00.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: As voters face very
unpopular choices
and try to pick a winner in the
presidential

24:00.339 --> 24:01.707 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
horse race.

24:01.740 --> 24:05.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang in Delaware
County, Ohio.

24:05.978 --> 24:11.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tomorrow, John
crosses the state
to report from a traditional
Democratic stronghold

24:11.817 --> 24:14.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where Donald Trump is hoping to
make inroads.

24:14.053 --> 24:19.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But first: Big
companies today
are not creating nearly as many
middle-income

24:19.925 --> 24:25.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
jobs as they once did, and
that's been one
of the concerns in this
campaign.

24:25.531 --> 24:30.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Economics correspondent Paul
Solman went to
Detroit, where ideas for
spurring a new era

24:30.869 --> 24:33.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of local manufacturing are
taking shape.

24:33.839 --> 24:36.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of his weekly series,
Making Sense.

24:36.875 --> 24:43.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: A must-see stop on
the grand
tour of decaying Detroit, the
plant that,

24:43.282 --> 24:46.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for decades, clanked out auto
chassis for
GM.

24:46.585 --> 24:50.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JERRY DAVIS, University of
Michigan: General
Motors at its height had 900,000
employees,

24:50.923 --> 24:52.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
career ladders galore.

24:52.391 --> 24:56.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were providing a lot of
benefits, creating
good middle-class jobs.

24:56.128 --> 24:59.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GM today has about 220,000
employees around
the world.

24:59.965 --> 25:02.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's about as many as it had in
1928.

25:02.301 --> 25:09.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But sociologist
Jerry Davis says
the GMs of yesteryear, though
models of productivity

25:09.274 --> 25:12.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and even of economic equality,
are history.

25:12.077 --> 25:15.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JERRY DAVIS: What happened to
General Motors
didn't just happen to General
Motors.

25:15.781 --> 25:20.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are about half as many
public corporations
today as they were 20 years ago.

25:20.152 --> 25:25.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, instead of
General Motors,
U.S. Steel, Eastman Kodak, and I
could go

25:25.424 --> 25:26.925 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on and on, what have we got?

25:26.959 --> 25:30.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JERRY DAVIS: The big
corporations today don't
really have that many employees.

25:30.295 --> 25:31.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're not providing career
ladders.

25:32.030 --> 25:34.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're not creating
middle-class jobs.

25:34.266 --> 25:39.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Blockbuster had 80,000 employees
and 9,000
stores across the country.

25:39.204 --> 25:42.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Netflix does the same thing with
fewer than
4,000 people.

25:42.741 --> 25:46.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If anybody tells you they work
at Facebook,
probably they mean they are a
contractor,

25:46.945 --> 25:50.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because only about 12,000 people
actually
work at Facebook.

25:50.382 --> 25:54.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are worth $300 billion, but
very few
people actually work there.

25:54.787 --> 26:00.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In a new book,
Davis calls it
the vanishing American
corporation and poses

26:00.292 --> 26:04.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a pivotal question: What will
rise from the
wreckage?

26:04.930 --> 26:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mega-firms that hire relatively
few workers?

26:08.634 --> 26:10.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Made-anywhere product peddlers
like Nike?

26:10.869 --> 26:14.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JERRY DAVIS: They're the biggest
sneaker and
sporting goods company in the
world, but they

26:14.973 --> 26:18.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't actually make most of the
stuff with
their name brand on it.

26:18.410 --> 26:22.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They design it, they market it
from Oregon,
but the production is done by
contractors

26:22.614 --> 26:23.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all around the world.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.617 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that model is spread widely.

26:25.651 --> 26:28.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not just sneakers, it's not
just garments.

26:28.187 --> 26:32.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Electronics, pharmaceuticals,
pet food, you
name the product, and you can
find somebody

26:32.624 --> 26:35.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to manufacture it and put your
name on it.

26:35.093 --> 26:40.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Nikefication, Davis
has dubbed
it, exemplified by another
multinational with

26:40.199 --> 26:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a Detroit foothold, Ikea.

26:42.134 --> 26:46.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JERRY DAVIS: The Ikea model is
you manufacture
it somewhere, you ship it out
around the world,

26:46.905 --> 26:48.674 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
flat pack.

26:48.707 --> 26:51.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So this model might be a very
good model for
customers because it's very
inexpensive.

26:51.877 --> 26:54.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not the world's best
furniture, but you
can live with it.

26:54.913 --> 27:00.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And you do have to
assemble it
yourself or hire someone to do
it for you.

27:00.385 --> 27:04.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Indeed, these days, a world of
temps is only
a moment away.

27:04.890 --> 27:09.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JERRY DAVIS: A business like
Upwork allows
you to find contractors to do
programming

27:09.495 --> 27:12.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and other tasks available around
the world.

27:12.197 --> 27:13.398 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Czech Republic.

27:13.432 --> 27:17.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Czech Republic,
U.S., Croatia,
Philippines.

27:17.603 --> 27:22.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the technology that allows
for such wonders,
and the wage exploitation of a
global race

27:22.841 --> 27:28.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the bottom, also suggests a
more appealing
future for work in America.

27:28.080 --> 27:32.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JERRY DAVIS: You can go to this
Web site and
see these great designs for
beds, chairs,

27:32.584 --> 27:35.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tables and so on, the kind of
thing that you
might buy at Ikea.

27:35.454 --> 27:39.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But these are designs that you
can download
and create locally.

27:39.224 --> 27:44.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Instead of
assembling Ikea furniture
themselves, that is, why can't
Americans also

27:44.730 --> 27:46.932 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
make it to their own
specifications?

27:46.965 --> 27:53.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JERRY DAVIS: So, this is
basically an Ikea-like
chair that's made out of metal,
but you could

27:53.705 --> 27:56.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
make it out of plastic or wood.

27:56.241 --> 27:58.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: These are just
prototypes or
models.

27:58.277 --> 27:59.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JERRY DAVIS: Yes.

27:59.411 --> 28:01.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are the designs online
shrunk to a tiny
version.

28:01.980 --> 28:04.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you could make a full-sized
version of
this, this afternoon.

28:04.616 --> 28:09.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So Davis took us to
TechShop
Detroit, where Vasile Vincent
(ph) was using

28:09.621 --> 28:15.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a computer-controlled cutting
machine to carve
a table leg based on an online
design.

28:15.527 --> 28:22.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For a monthly fee, members of
TechShop, a
nationwide chain, access all
manner of gadgetry.

28:22.734 --> 28:24.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Faith Olsen (ph) was working the
water jet
cutter.

28:24.803 --> 28:26.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FAITH OLSEN, TechShop Detroit:
It's using
sand.

28:27.005 --> 28:28.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's using water pressure.

28:28.273 --> 28:30.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's basically using erosion to
cut through.

28:30.475 --> 28:33.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have got eighth-inch aluminum
on there
right now.

28:33.312 --> 28:34.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Wow.

28:34.313 --> 28:36.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So that's cutting through
aluminum now.

28:36.148 --> 28:37.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FAITH OLSEN: Yes.

28:37.149 --> 28:38.951 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's just cutting right through
it.

28:38.984 --> 28:43.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: TechShop is for
polished pros
and rank amateurs alike.

28:43.221 --> 28:45.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The manager of this Detroit site
is Will Brick.

28:45.924 --> 28:46.892 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, who is this?

28:46.925 --> 28:47.893 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
The Red Baron?

28:47.926 --> 28:49.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILL BRICK, TechShop: Yes,
right.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I like to imagine that's me in
the cockpit
there.

28:50.495 --> 28:53.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Brick cooked up
this model airplane
for a summer camp.

28:53.298 --> 28:57.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILL BRICK: One of the things we
taught kids
to do was to build an airframe
and then add

28:57.035 --> 29:00.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a radio control mechanism to
actually be able
to remotely pilot it.

29:00.572 --> 29:05.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, future makers
learn how to
do it themselves, while
entrepreneurs hatch

29:05.444 --> 29:07.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the products of tomorrow.

29:07.779 --> 29:10.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Rope Runner was the
brainchild of Kevin
Bingham.

29:10.415 --> 29:13.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILL BRICK: He came up with this
thing that
allows you to scale a tree, go
up and down

29:13.986 --> 29:17.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
without changing kit, and be as
nimble as
like a spider monkey, right?

29:17.155 --> 29:22.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He came into TechShop, drew up
some prototypes,
made some wooden mockups, and
cut out the

29:22.160 --> 29:27.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
finished aluminum pieces,
assembled all that,
and then engraved his logo and
the phrase

29:27.232 --> 29:31.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Made in Detroit," which I love,
into the
powder coating on the sides of
the apparatus.

29:31.503 --> 29:36.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: What Davis sees
budding in Detroit
is an alternative to a world run
by Nike and

29:36.975 --> 29:43.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ikea, manufacturing brought back
to America,
made possible by ever-cheaper
technology,

29:44.016 --> 29:48.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and repurposing the industrial
infrastructure
of the past.

29:48.620 --> 29:54.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Consider the Green Garage, a
socially conscious
business incubator housed in a
former Model-T

29:54.159 --> 29:55.861 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
showroom.

29:55.894 --> 29:59.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEVITA DAVISON, FoodLab Detroit:
We are a
diverse community of about 211
locally-owned

29:59.231 --> 30:00.999 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
food businesses.

30:01.033 --> 30:05.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Devita Davison of
FoodLab deploys
local kitchens, so that
entrepreneurs can

30:05.437 --> 30:07.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bake and then sell cakes, for
instance.

30:07.472 --> 30:12.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEVITA DAVISON: Taking advantage
of underutilized
community kitchen space in
churches, day care

30:12.544 --> 30:14.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
centers and Head Start.

30:14.179 --> 30:19.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Amany Killawi
co-founded LaunchGood,
a crowdfunding site for Muslims.

30:19.117 --> 30:22.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMANY KILLAWI, LaunchGood: So,
it can be anything
from someone creating their
first children's

30:22.854 --> 30:25.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
story, to an app, to starting
their own business.

30:25.791 --> 30:31.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then you also have specific
personal causes,
like helping the first
Australian hijabi ballerina.

30:31.329 --> 30:36.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think many times Muslims are a
seen as a
source of problems in the world,
and we're

30:36.468 --> 30:38.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
here to show them there's a
source of solutions.

30:38.236 --> 30:43.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The businesses here
represent
Jerry Davis' dream of a work
force that makes

30:43.108 --> 30:44.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
locally, but thinks globally.

30:44.643 --> 30:48.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JERRY DAVIS: These are
businesses that are
meant to last a long time.

30:48.246 --> 30:53.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But really they are part of a
broader ecosystem,
and their goal is really, what
can we do to

30:53.351 --> 30:55.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
make Detroit, as a community,
stronger?

30:55.353 --> 30:59.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a very different model
than, how do we
create the most shareholder
value, how do

30:59.858 --> 31:02.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I retire before I have reached
drinking age?

31:02.494 --> 31:09.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: A visit to the Red
Panda space,
a whole office, gave Davis a
chance to relive

31:09.601 --> 31:14.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his days in the college rock
band Ivan Pavlov's
Salivation Army.

31:14.940 --> 31:20.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, professional groups like
Wilco and
the Red Hot Chili Peppers use
Red Panda guitar

31:20.312 --> 31:25.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
effects to create new sounds.

31:25.083 --> 31:30.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Owner Curt Malouin designs the
pedals himself
and has them made within fairly
easy reach.

31:30.489 --> 31:34.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CURT MALOUIN, Owner, Red Panda:
And that allows
us to have better control over
the quality

31:34.059 --> 31:38.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and more flexibility, so that we
can experiment
with new products and be on the
leading edge

31:38.497 --> 31:44.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the market, but we can also
then ramp up
production really easily when we
get a hit

31:44.402 --> 31:46.238 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
product.

31:46.271 --> 31:49.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Turns out Malouin
assembled the
very first pedal back at
TechShop, where plenty

31:49.841 --> 31:54.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of other do-it-your-selfers are
inventing
things on shared equipment.

31:54.713 --> 31:57.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Osborne dreamed up a
box-making machine.

31:57.215 --> 32:00.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN OSBORNE, Inventor: It only
takes about
15 seconds to change from one
box to a completely

32:00.685 --> 32:04.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
different box, so it's the only
machine of
its kind in the world.

32:04.222 --> 32:08.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And with so many a
folks turning
out small runs of bespoke
products, you need

32:08.927 --> 32:11.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all kinds of boxes.

32:11.062 --> 32:13.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it's now technically
feasible, says Jerry
Davis.

32:13.565 --> 32:18.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JERRY DAVIS: This is a place
where capital
equipment is so cheap and so
easy to use that

32:18.837 --> 32:23.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children can learn to use it in
two hours,
and if it's that accessible, why
do we need

32:23.809 --> 32:25.744 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
corporations?

32:25.777 --> 32:31.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But if everybody
can make everything
by themselves, there are no more
manufacturing

32:31.082 --> 32:32.050 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
jobs.

32:32.083 --> 32:33.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JERRY DAVIS: Why do we need to
have jobs?

32:33.885 --> 32:37.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If there are other ways to
provide those same
results, then maybe we could
organize our

32:37.322 --> 32:39.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
time differently.

32:39.157 --> 32:43.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe we could be a maker on
Tuesday morning
and a farmer on Tuesday
afternoon and a mash-up

32:43.962 --> 32:45.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
deejay on Tuesday evening.

32:45.463 --> 32:49.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we could all have more
rewarding lives
with more control over our time.

32:49.334 --> 32:54.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Hey, maybe you
could all make
TV stories like this one.

32:54.206 --> 32:59.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, until then, this is Paul
Solman, economics
correspondent every day of the
week, reporting

32:59.978 --> 33:03.782 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from Detroit.

33:03.815 --> 33:14.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Last night we
brought you stories
of American women forced into
marriage in

33:14.359 --> 33:16.194 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this country.

33:16.228 --> 33:21.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, in part two of her
exclusive report,
special correspondent Gayle
Tzemach Lemmon

33:21.166 --> 33:26.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tells us of Americans taken
overseas for the
same reason, both women and
girls, who often

33:26.271 --> 33:29.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
find themselves beyond the
assistance of their
own government.

33:29.174 --> 33:31.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JADA, New Jersey Teen: I was a
kid.

33:31.209 --> 33:35.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I hadn't really grown that much,
so I was
really scared.

33:35.146 --> 33:40.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Jada was
just 12 years
old when her father took her
from the United

33:40.185 --> 33:42.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
States to live in Saudi Arabia.

33:43.021 --> 33:46.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And her future was about to
change dramatically.

33:46.524 --> 33:49.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How did you first find out what
your father
had planned for you?

33:49.227 --> 33:51.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JADA: Well, one day, we were
walking.

33:51.463 --> 33:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We were walking to a store.

33:55.100 --> 34:01.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he told me to stay on his
right side,
because they do that there, so
that other

34:01.973 --> 34:05.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
men know that the woman that
they have on
their right side is for sale.

34:05.777 --> 34:10.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Jada,
whose last name
we are withholding at the
request of her lawyer,

34:10.215 --> 34:15.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hadn't even started high school
when her father,
a convert to Islam, moved them
both to Jeddah

34:15.620 --> 34:17.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and began trying to marry her
off.

34:17.722 --> 34:22.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHIRLEY, Aunt: She's thousands
of miles away,
and there's nothing we can do.

34:22.694 --> 34:27.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Jada's
family back in
New Jersey was terrified when
they heard what

34:27.165 --> 34:29.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her dad had planned.

34:29.267 --> 34:34.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jada's mother had died suddenly
a few years
earlier, but her aunt Shirley
says her sister

34:34.172 --> 34:36.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mecca rose up to fill the role.

34:36.574 --> 34:39.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MECCA, Sister: I was at work.

34:39.177 --> 34:41.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I got a text that said, help
me.

34:41.479 --> 34:43.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I was like, gee, what are
you talking
about, help me?

34:43.848 --> 34:45.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And she's like, no, help me.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My dad's trying to sell me.

34:47.552 --> 34:51.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Over the
next few months,
Mecca tried to support her
little sister,

34:51.790 --> 34:54.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to plot her return and to save
her from marriage.

34:54.926 --> 34:57.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MECCA: Other than texting, I
never got to
physically hear her voice.

34:58.029 --> 35:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I didn't know if she was
crying at the
moment or if she was scared.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm just looking at text
messages.

35:03.268 --> 35:06.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: And the
messages grew
increasingly desperate.

35:06.404 --> 35:11.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MECCA: I was literally losing
sleep, like
every day depressed, going to
work depressed,

35:11.676 --> 35:13.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because I really didn't know
what to do.

35:13.712 --> 35:18.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Mecca
contacted everyone
she could think of, including
the United States

35:18.383 --> 35:20.151 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government.

35:20.185 --> 35:26.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MECCA: Even though the embassy
was meant to
help Americans, it was -- they
had to still

35:26.391 --> 35:29.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go through -- they had to still
use Saudi
Arabia laws.

35:29.394 --> 35:34.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: In the
end, it was up
to the family to protect Jada.

35:34.132 --> 35:40.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHIRLEY: I started to feel like
we were exhausting
everything, because it seemed
like everybody

35:40.171 --> 35:43.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was saying, well, you know, you
know, there's
really nothing we can do.

35:43.942 --> 35:48.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MECCA: So, my aunt started
saving money to
get Jada home.

35:48.213 --> 35:50.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I started just contacting
everybody.

35:50.515 --> 35:53.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's when I came in
contact with Casey.

35:53.618 --> 35:59.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Casey is
Casey Swegman,
a counselor at the Tahirih
Justice Center,

35:59.758 --> 36:05.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an organization in Northern
Virginia devoted
to protecting immigrant women
and girls.

36:05.163 --> 36:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mecca reached her via a human
trafficking
hot line.

36:08.666 --> 36:14.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over three months, Swegman
gathered information
about Jada's case, working with
Mecca on strategies

36:14.172 --> 36:15.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to get her sister back.

36:15.974 --> 36:20.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CASEY SWEGMAN, Tahirih Justice
Center: I think,
as an advocate, if Jada hadn't
had Mecca,

36:20.412 --> 36:23.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it would've been a profoundly
different experience.

36:23.048 --> 36:27.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Together,
they succeeded
in bring Jada home before any
marriage could

36:27.619 --> 36:29.387 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
take place.

36:29.421 --> 36:35.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, she is a star student
about to enter
high school and dreaming of
college at UCLA.

36:35.660 --> 36:38.163 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But not everyone is so lucky.

36:38.196 --> 36:43.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to the Tahirih Justice
Center, thousands
of American women are forced
into marriages

36:43.234 --> 36:44.702 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
every year.

36:44.736 --> 36:49.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tahirih runs one of the only
forced marriage
programs in the country.

36:49.340 --> 36:54.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have worked with nearly
400 girls
and women to help them either
avoid or escape

36:54.813 --> 36:56.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a forced marriage.

36:56.081 --> 36:57.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LINA ALAHRI, Forced Into
Marriage: I remember
the engagement.

36:57.115 --> 37:00.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm in this crazy dress.

37:00.085 --> 37:05.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: American
citizen Lina
Alahri was 21 when her father
took her to

37:05.056 --> 37:07.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his native Yemen, amid the
ongoing war...

37:07.058 --> 37:08.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LINA ALAHRI: This is me.

37:08.493 --> 37:11.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: .. veiled
as a visit
to her ailing grandmother.

37:11.996 --> 37:18.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Once there, the former
California high school
Almond Blossom queen contestant
quickly learned

37:18.069 --> 37:23.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that she was about to marry a
man whom she'd
never met, forced by her father
into a marriage

37:23.875 --> 37:26.010 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
she didn't want.

37:26.044 --> 37:28.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She says she tried everything to
avoid it.

37:28.413 --> 37:33.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINA ALAHRI: The first thing I
imagined was,
I can make a run for it right
now.

37:33.551 --> 37:35.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I knew that wasn't an
option.

37:35.587 --> 37:40.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: According
to custom,
Alahri was taken to her new
husband's home,

37:40.058 --> 37:45.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where she was expected to
consummate the marriage
while his whole family waited
for proof.

37:45.663 --> 37:53.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINA ALAHRI: I remember my
father in-law telling
me, what is the problem?

37:53.238 --> 37:55.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why are you not doing it?

37:55.173 --> 37:58.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The faster you do this, the
faster you get
to go home.

37:58.943 --> 38:04.449 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The faster that you have
intercourse is the
faster that you can come home.

38:04.482 --> 38:08.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: But Alahri
was 8,000
miles away from her home.

38:08.586 --> 38:12.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And no one, it seemed, could
help her, not
even her government.

38:12.223 --> 38:16.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINA ALAHRI: You think, well, I
am a U.S.
citizen, and the one thing that
you want to

38:16.161 --> 38:20.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do is, you want to take off, hit
the U.S.
Embassy, and then they are your
savior and

38:20.198 --> 38:21.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they will fly you out.

38:21.199 --> 38:23.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: But it
wasn't the case.

38:23.134 --> 38:28.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A close friend of Alahri's was
able to contact
the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa,
Yemen's capital,

38:28.640 --> 38:30.108 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on her behalf.

38:30.141 --> 38:34.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Tell her that we're unable to
intervene directly,"
their response read.

38:34.646 --> 38:40.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"If she can find her way to the
U.S. Embassy,
we are open."

38:40.451 --> 38:44.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But she couldn't get there
because it was
too dangerous.

38:44.055 --> 38:47.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And in the end, she consummated
the marriage.

38:47.425 --> 38:50.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She felt it was her only path to
getting home
alive.

38:50.528 --> 38:53.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINA ALAHRI: Sometimes, the only
way out is
through.

38:53.398 --> 38:54.365 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

38:54.399 --> 38:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CASEY SWEGMAN: The whole system
failed Lina.

38:56.134 --> 38:57.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The world failed Lina.

38:57.936 --> 39:01.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Casey
Swegman took on
Alahri's case after her best
friend back in

39:01.306 --> 39:03.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
California contacted the group.

39:03.441 --> 39:08.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CASEY SWEGMAN: When a women's
only choice,
only option for getting to
safety is to capitulate

39:08.813 --> 39:12.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to rape, into a forced marriage,
that is a
failure of the entire system.

39:12.517 --> 39:14.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE BERNIER-TOTH, Managing
Director,
Overseas Citizens Services,
Bureau of Consular

39:14.452 --> 39:18.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Affairs: We failed them by not
having mechanisms
to prevent them from going
overseas and being

39:18.957 --> 39:20.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
forced into marriage in the
first place.

39:20.825 --> 39:24.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Michelle
Bernier-Toth
is the managing director for
overseas citizens

39:24.796 --> 39:28.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
services in the State
Department's Bureau
of Consular Affairs.

39:28.533 --> 39:33.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE BERNIER-TOTH: They're
being held
against their will, but in
accordance with

39:33.071 --> 39:38.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
local law, because they have
been legally
married in that country.

39:38.643 --> 39:46.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And their spouse now has legal
authority and
control over what happens to
them.

39:46.351 --> 39:55.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And contrary to a kidnapping or
a hostage-taking,
there is a legal basis for that
action that

39:55.994 --> 39:59.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is one of the big -- it's a huge
challenge.

39:59.597 --> 40:06.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Americans
usually think
that, if they're threatened
overseas, the

40:06.271 --> 40:11.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State Department can swoop in
and rescue them,
but the reality is much more
complicated.

40:11.409 --> 40:15.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both young women in this story
reached out
seeking help from abroad.

40:15.179 --> 40:21.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the truth is, Americans
don't take their
laws with them when they travel.

40:21.319 --> 40:26.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In both cases here, these young
women were
able to orchestrate trips back
to the United

40:26.057 --> 40:27.825 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

40:27.859 --> 40:32.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then-12-year-old Jada's family
won custody
of her when she came to the U.S.
for a visit

40:32.163 --> 40:33.931 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with her father.

40:33.965 --> 40:37.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Alahri's plan for freedom
was even more
intrepid.

40:37.302 --> 40:42.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With the war in Yemen pounding
outside her
windows, she worked with Tahirih
and her best

40:42.340 --> 40:45.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
friend from home to orchestrate
the plan.

40:45.043 --> 40:49.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After marrying the stranger, she
returned
to the U.S. on a pledge to
acquire visas for

40:50.014 --> 40:51.416 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
her in-laws.

40:51.449 --> 40:55.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When she landed in the United
States, Tahirih
was waiting.

40:55.253 --> 41:00.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It took several agonizing months
for each
of them to find their escape
routes.

41:00.825 --> 41:05.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now on American soil, Tahirih
has helped them
restart their lives and
continues to offer

41:05.663 --> 41:08.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
counseling and support.

41:08.299 --> 41:13.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Swegman and her colleagues
still feel
these are isolated successes
over a problem

41:13.371 --> 41:18.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
few Americans even know exists:
forced marriage
in the United States.

41:18.309 --> 41:24.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CASEY SWEGMAN: I think the worst
outcomes
are probably somewhere out
there, with a woman

41:24.582 --> 41:28.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who maybe only have the 15
minutes to call,
but I never heard from her
again.

41:28.753 --> 41:33.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, you know the bad
endings are
the ones we never see.

41:33.191 --> 41:38.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: "PBS
NewsHour" attempted
to contact both Alahri's and
Jada's fathers,

41:38.963 --> 41:41.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and received no reply.

41:41.532 --> 41:47.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, home once again in
California, Alahri
considers Swegman a member of
her own family.

41:47.739 --> 41:52.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINA ALAHRI: To have that
support and have
that love from somebody you have
never even

41:52.610 --> 41:55.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
met before, it makes a huge
difference.

41:55.580 --> 42:03.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, Tahirih and like Casey,
and I seem so
lucky to have all that, because
if it weren't

42:03.187 --> 42:07.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for those people, you don't know
where you
would be.

42:07.458 --> 42:14.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: But now
the former Miss
Almond Blossom contestant is
back studying

42:14.265 --> 42:18.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and working toward a future she
nearly lost.

42:18.636 --> 42:22.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm Gayle Tzemach Lemmon for the
"PBS NewsHour"
in California.

42:22.473 --> 42:27.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You can go online to
watch the
first of Gayle's reports and a
conversation

42:27.445 --> 42:29.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about the series.

42:29.213 --> 42:33.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, tomorrow, join our Twitter
chat about
forced marriage at 1:00 p.m.
Eastern, with

42:33.618 --> 42:36.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gayle and a number of experts
and advocates.

42:36.387 --> 42:41.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: what
specific skills employers
want from college graduates, and
what a college

42:50.868 --> 42:53.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can do to prove students are
ready.

42:53.571 --> 42:58.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has the story
as part of
our special series this week on
Rethinking

42:58.676 --> 42:59.911 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
College.

42:59.944 --> 43:03.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Graduation day
at Georgetown
University.

43:03.881 --> 43:12.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It takes four years, more than
$200,000, and
a lot of hard work to get here.

43:12.223 --> 43:16.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But now more employers are
asking, what does
a four-year degree really mean?

43:16.961 --> 43:21.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What true marketable skills can
new graduates
offer the work force?

43:21.065 --> 43:23.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Georgetown University is trying
to answer
that question.

43:23.234 --> 43:27.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RANDALL BASS, Georgetown
University: We're
hearing from employers, how do
you differentiate

43:27.071 --> 43:28.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
between two graduates?

43:29.006 --> 43:32.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Professor
Randall Bass leads
the college's Designing the
Future Initiative.

43:32.610 --> 43:37.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDALL BASS: If you have got a
pile of 10
graduates who all have degrees
from quality

43:37.248 --> 43:41.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
liberal arts schools, and they
all look more
or less alike in terms of their
formal credentials,

43:41.385 --> 43:44.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are there ways to differentiate
them?

43:44.789 --> 43:52.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Last semester,
Bass and
colleagues at Georgetown offered
a free experimental

43:52.263 --> 43:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
course for students who want to
further distinguish
themselves.

43:55.800 --> 44:01.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Instead of receiving a
traditional credit,
students who meet the
requirements are awarded

44:01.372 --> 44:03.107 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a digital badge.

44:03.140 --> 44:08.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDALL BASS: What we see in the
badges is
a way of trying to help students
tell a story

44:08.446 --> 44:13.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about some dimension of their
learning that
might otherwise be merely a line
on their

44:13.451 --> 44:15.253 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
resume.

44:15.286 --> 44:17.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIKA COHEN-DERR, Georgetown
University; It's
easy with a degree to show what
you have learned

44:17.622 --> 44:20.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in biology or in business.

44:20.525 --> 44:23.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's not easy to show what
you have learned
in terms of leadership.

44:23.694 --> 44:27.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Erika
Cohen-Derr, who was
part of the Georgetown team that
designed

44:27.164 --> 44:31.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the new badge, says employers
want to know
more about as student's
disposition.

44:31.235 --> 44:33.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ERIKA COHEN-DERR: These are the
soft skills.

44:33.137 --> 44:40.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are skills like empathy,
communication,
ethical leadership, the
dispositions that

44:40.278 --> 44:43.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a student has that they bring to
any team
or any group.

44:43.848 --> 44:46.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DESY OSUNSADE, Job Recruiter: A
resume has
never been enough.

44:46.384 --> 44:49.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why the concept of
badging is appealing
to me.

44:49.287 --> 44:54.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Job
recruiters, like Desy
Osunsade, see digital badges as
a way to better

44:54.425 --> 44:56.127 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
define talent.

44:56.160 --> 44:59.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DESY OSUNSADE: We spend a lot of
time and
money as recruiters trying to
make sure that

44:59.330 --> 45:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have the perfect fit, because
recruiting
is expensive.

45:01.799 --> 45:06.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Osunsade
recruits for Arabella
Philanthropic Investment
Advisors.

45:06.504 --> 45:09.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She says a degree doesn't say
enough about
a potential hire.

45:09.974 --> 45:13.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DESY OSUNSADE: It tells me the
person's line
of study.

45:13.744 --> 45:19.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It doesn't tell me if they are
good at things
like critical thinking,
problem-solving, do

45:19.584 --> 45:22.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they work well in teams, do they
have oral
communication?

45:22.453 --> 45:26.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A resume, in itself, with a
degree from anywhere
doesn't tell me that.

45:26.557 --> 45:31.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The digital
badge offered
by Georgetown is called a
Catalyst Badge.

45:31.829 --> 45:34.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Alexis Oni-Eseleh participated
in the pilot.

45:34.198 --> 45:36.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXIS ONI-ESELEH, Graduate: The
Catalyst
Badge is just affirming that
when we see something

45:37.001 --> 45:41.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that needs to be changed, we
just go about
it, proving that you are an
agent of change

45:41.639 --> 45:43.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in accomplishing the goals you
set for yourself.

45:43.941 --> 45:48.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Don Fraser,
from the Education
Design Lab, works with
Georgetown, George

45:48.646 --> 45:53.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mason University, and University
of Virginia,
as part of a larger effort
called the 21st

45:53.818 --> 45:55.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Century Skill Badging Challenge.

45:55.786 --> 46:01.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: If I'm an
employer, I'm
going to get a better employee
if they have

46:01.258 --> 46:05.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
badges that say they are a
creative problem
solver or critical thinker, a
good oral communicator?

46:05.863 --> 46:09.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DON FRASER, Education Design
Lab: If there's
rigor in those badges, I would
-- and those

46:09.967 --> 46:13.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are skills that you find
valuable in the work
that you're doing, I would say
yes.

46:13.838 --> 46:18.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: More so than
just if they
came out of a specific school
with a certain

46:18.175 --> 46:20.011 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
degree?

46:20.044 --> 46:23.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DON FRASER: Exactly, right,
because they have
been working specifically to
acquire those

46:23.280 --> 46:28.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
skills, which is totally
different than the
implicit way in which we believe
they are

46:28.686 --> 46:32.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
getting those right now, hoping
that by the
time they graduate and get this
degree, they

46:32.890 --> 46:34.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have gained these skills in some
capacity.

46:34.692 --> 46:38.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Anthony
Carnevale is the
director of the Georgetown
University Center

46:38.329 --> 46:40.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on Education and the Workforce.

46:40.231 --> 46:43.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTHONY CARNEVALE, Georgetown
University:
What's happening is that the
on-the-job training

46:43.834 --> 46:48.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is no longer sufficient, because
employers
don't commit to employees for a
lifetime the

46:48.639 --> 46:51.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way they used to, so we have got
to get our
own job training.

46:51.509 --> 46:59.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In may, Alexis
Oni-Eseleh
graduated from Georgetown with a
major in

46:59.050 --> 47:02.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
global health and a minor in
women's gender
studies.

47:02.386 --> 47:06.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since graduation, she has been
helping with
her parents' company and will
start a more

47:06.123 --> 47:07.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
serious job search this fall.

47:08.025 --> 47:10.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEXIS ONI-ESELEH: Here it is,
certification
Catalyst Credential.

47:10.961 --> 47:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I had to pass a certain level of
criteria,
which you can find here.

47:15.666 --> 47:19.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you click there, it will
take you to
this Web site, which tells you
everything

47:19.570 --> 47:22.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I needed to do to become a
Catalyst.

47:22.206 --> 47:26.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Catalyst Credential is
awarded to a student
who embraces challenges,
demonstrates initiative,

47:27.011 --> 47:28.479 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pursues positive social change.

47:28.512 --> 47:31.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DON FRASER: You host them
online, and they're
hosted digitally.

47:31.716 --> 47:36.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People have the ability to click
on that badge
and get at the metadata
associated with how

47:36.554 --> 47:40.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the learner, the student
achieved that particular
badge.

47:40.458 --> 47:45.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if I am so inclined, I can
look at assessments
that were a part of that badge.

47:45.663 --> 47:52.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can look at the work, the body
of work that
the student did in order to earn
that badge.

ANNOUNCER: The same degree from
different
schools produces different
workers.

HARI SREENIVASAN: Some emerging
for-profit
education ventures see a much
bigger role

48:00.778 --> 48:02.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for digital badges.

48:02.646 --> 48:03.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN CRAIG, Author, "College
Disrupted: The
Great Unbundling of Higher
Education": A degree

48:03.514 --> 48:04.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
doesn't say a lot.

48:04.815 --> 48:07.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A badge or a micro-credential
can say a lot
more.

48:07.818 --> 48:11.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Ryan Craig is
the author
of "College Disrupted: The Great
Unbundling

48:11.655 --> 48:13.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Higher Education."

48:13.324 --> 48:19.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RYAN CRAIG: The primary
credential that we
use in our labor market is the
degree.

48:19.130 --> 48:20.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the sort of default
credential.

48:21.031 --> 48:25.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Micro-credentials, or badges,
breaks that
down into literally
competencies.

48:25.903 --> 48:32.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What micro-credentials are
signaling is the
shift from degree-based hiring
to competency-based

48:32.376 --> 48:33.711 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hiring.

48:33.744 --> 48:36.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ANNOUNCER: That's right,
LinkedIn, it's not
just for top executives.

48:36.447 --> 48:39.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's for you, and it's the
perfect place for
you to start your professional
story.

48:39.917 --> 48:43.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Craig points
to Microsoft
and its recent purchase of
LinkedIn as new

48:43.888 --> 48:49.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
players in the field of
post-secondary education
because they offer educational
training, certificates,

48:49.860 --> 48:52.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and a marketplace to display
skills.

48:52.263 --> 48:58.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RYAN CRAIG: Competency
marketplaces, we think,
are the way in which a decade
from now are,

48:58.702 --> 49:01.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
most post-secondary education
will be purchased.

49:01.238 --> 49:06.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But Anthony
Carnevale cautions
that commercial badges,
micro-credentials,

49:06.143 --> 49:08.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and certificates need more
scrutiny.

49:08.112 --> 49:13.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTHONY CARNEVALE: It's a whole
industry where
I there's no transparency, no
consumer protection,

49:13.517 --> 49:18.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so let the buyer beware of what
happened to
the people who took this course,
got this

49:18.455 --> 49:22.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
badge, so that people can tell
if something
is worth the money.

49:22.193 --> 49:26.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Alexis
Oni-Eseleh says she
recently used the Catalyst badge
in a job

49:26.831 --> 49:28.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
interview.

49:28.699 --> 49:30.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALEXIS ONI-ESELEH: The
interviewer asked me
to talk about a time where I
showed initiative,

49:30.768 --> 49:34.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I was able to talk about the
digital badge
and all the steps I had to take
in order to

49:34.638 --> 49:36.407 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
get it and to qualify for it.

49:36.440 --> 49:40.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I even encouraged her to go
look up the
digital badge on my LinkedIn
page.

49:40.611 --> 49:43.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This fall,
designers of
the badge challenge are
expanding their reach

49:43.881 --> 49:49.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to colleges who serve
non-traditional students,
who often have a harder struggle
to find jobs.

49:49.587 --> 49:52.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Washington, D.C., I'm Hari
Sreenivasan
for the "PBS NewsHour."

49:52.890 --> 49:58.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a nice
postscript to the
story: This month, Alexis
Oni-Eseleh started

49:58.562 --> 50:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a job as a media buyer at an ad
agency on
Madison Avenue in New York.

50:03.434 --> 50:09.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And online, a look at whether
remedial classes
really help college students
succeed.

50:09.206 --> 50:14.211 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

50:14.245 --> 50:26.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now a "NewsHour"
Shares, something
that caught our eye that we
thought might

50:26.790 --> 50:28.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be of interest to you.

50:28.659 --> 50:33.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A town in Washington state is
home to a group
of seven former lab chimpanzees
who have been

50:34.031 --> 50:39.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
given a second chance to live
out their lives
in the rural pastures of Cle
Elum, where they

50:39.436 --> 50:40.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are honorary citizens.

50:41.005 --> 50:46.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The story comes to us from PBS
station KCTS
in Seattle.

MULCAHY, Chimpanzee Sanctuary
Northwest: Diana
and I have been here a couple
months prior

51:01.692 --> 51:03.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the chimps' arrival.

51:03.227 --> 51:06.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now it's been a little over
eight years that
we have been with the chimps.

51:06.230 --> 51:09.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANA GOODRICH,, Chimpanzee
Sanctuary Northwest:
So they are honorary citizens of
Cle Elum

51:09.600 --> 51:14.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and are known throughout the
world as the
Cle Elum 7.

51:14.138 --> 51:17.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Annie is a really sweet, sweet
chimp.

51:17.975 --> 51:19.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she's best friends with
Missy.

51:19.977 --> 51:22.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She just adores Missy.

51:22.646 --> 51:26.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Burrito is super goofy, really
charming.

51:26.450 --> 51:34.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our Facebook followers of Cle
Elum are just
totally in love with Burrito.

51:36.293 --> 51:44.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MULCAHY: Negra is the oldest of
the group,
about to turn 43.

51:44.101 --> 51:48.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Foxie is known around the world
now for her
level of troll dolls, because
she probably

51:48.906 --> 51:50.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has about 400 dolls.

51:50.808 --> 51:55.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DIANA GOODRICH: Jody, we call
the manager.

51:55.079 --> 51:56.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She is like watching out for
everybody.

51:56.780 --> 51:59.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jamie is the boss of the group.

52:00.017 --> 52:08.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She also really likes Instagram.

52:08.692 --> 52:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This area is what called Young's
Hill.

52:16.000 --> 52:21.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an open enclosure, so it
was the first
time the chimps ever were
outside without

52:21.238 --> 52:24.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something over their heads, so
they could
actually see the sky.

52:24.274 --> 52:27.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some of them, it was the
first time they
had actually ever stepped on
grass probably

52:27.945 --> 52:36.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in their entire lives, because
many of the
chimps were born in captivity.

J.B.

52:39.423 --> 52:46.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MULCAHY: We never go into the
enclosure with
the chimps.

52:46.530 --> 52:50.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Aggression is a normal part of
chimpanzees'
life.

52:50.801 --> 52:52.669 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so it's just not safe.

52:52.703 --> 52:57.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But also we want to respect
their space, since
they are territorial.

52:57.074 --> 53:03.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we want, as much as we
can, to respect
that boundary and let them be
chimps.

53:03.747 --> 53:08.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Chimps.

53:08.118 --> 53:16.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:16.894 --> 53:20.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Friday, correspondent William
Brangham
reports on the showdown between
the Standing

53:20.998 --> 53:25.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Rock Sioux Tribe and oil
companies over the

53:25.235 --> 53:26.203 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm Gwen Ifill.
