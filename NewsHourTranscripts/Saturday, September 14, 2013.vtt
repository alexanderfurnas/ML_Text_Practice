NEXT ON "PBS NEWS HOUR WEEKEND."

00:41.400 --> 00:49.933
>> GOOD EVENING, THANKS FO

00:49.933 --> 00:51.200
JOINING US

00:51.200 --> 00:51.900
THERE IS NOW A DEAL IN PLACE T

00:51.900 --> 00:53.767
FORCE SYRIAN PRESIDENT BASHA

00:53.767 --> 00:56.533
AL-ASSAD TO GET RID OF ALL-HIS

00:56.533 --> 00:57.767
CHEMICAL WEAPONS BY THE MIDDLE

00:57.767 --> 00:58.500
OF NEXT YEAR

00:58.500 --> 00:59.967
>> THAT MEANS A MILITARY STRIK

00:59.967 --> 01:02.333
IS UNLIKELY ANY TIME SOON.

01:02.333 --> 01:08.233
AFTER THREE DAYS OF MARATHON

01:08.233 --> 01:09.867
TALKS IN SWITZERLAND, THEY

01:09.867 --> 01:11.167
ANNOUNCED THE AGREEMENT.

01:11.167 --> 01:15.933
>> THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSI

01:15.933 --> 01:16.767
ELIMINATING CHEMICAL WEAPONS I

01:16.767 --> 01:18.600
THE SOONEST AND SAFEST MANNER.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.267
WE AGREE THAT SYRIA MUST SUBMI

01:21.267 --> 01:24.067
WITHIN A WEEK, NOT IN 30 DAYS,

01:24.067 --> 01:27.133
BUT IN ONE WEEK A COMPREHENSIV

01:27.133 --> 01:28.900
LISTING AND ADDITIONAL DETAILS

01:28.900 --> 01:30.467
WILL BE ADDRESSED REGARDING THAT

01:30.467 --> 01:32.533
IN THE COMING DAYS

01:32.533 --> 01:34.833
THERE CAN BE NO GAMES, NO ROOM

01:34.833 --> 01:40.267
FOR AVOIDANCE OR ANYTHING LESS

01:40.267 --> 01:41.867
THAN FULL COMPLIANCE BY TH

01:41.867 --> 01:42.333
ASSAD REGIME

01:42.333 --> 01:44.333
>> UNDER THE DEAL, INTERNATIONAL

01:44.333 --> 01:44.767
INSPECTORS WOULD BE ON THE

GROUND IN SYRIA IN NOVEMBER AN

01:47.500 --> 01:48.933
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BEGIN

01:48.933 --> 01:50.700
DESTROYING EQUIPMENT USED TO

01:50.700 --> 01:52.300
PRODUCE CHEMICAL WEAPONS

01:52.300 --> 01:53.533
ONE POTENTIAL COMPLICATION I

01:53.533 --> 01:55.500
HOW TO ENFORCE THE INSPECTIO

01:55.500 --> 01:56.533
AGREEMENT WHEN THE COUNTRY IS IN

01:56.533 --> 01:59.200
THE MIDST OF A CIVIL WAR THAT'

01:59.200 --> 02:00.667
RESULTED IN MORE THAN 100,00

02:00.667 --> 02:01.167
DEATHS

02:01.167 --> 02:03.833
THE REBEL LEADER PLEDGED TODAY

02:03.833 --> 02:05.167
NOT TO INTERFERE WITH TH

02:05.167 --> 02:06.633
INSPECTION PROCESS BUT SAYS TH

02:06.633 --> 02:08.300
DEAL WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A

02:08.300 --> 02:09.467
STALL TACTIC BY THE ASSA

02:09.467 --> 02:09.933
REGIME

02:09.933 --> 02:12.667
>> AND WE THINK THE RUSSIANS AND

02:12.667 --> 02:14.300
THE SYRIAN REGIME ARE PLAYIN

02:14.300 --> 02:17.700
GAMES TO WASTE TIME AND TO WIN

02:17.700 --> 02:19.367
TIME FOR THE CRIMINAL REGIME

02:19.367 --> 02:20.500
DAMASCUS, THERE WILL BE NO

02:20.500 --> 02:21.067
CEASE-FIRE

02:21.067 --> 02:23.400
>> CAN THE CHEMICAL WEAPON

02:23.400 --> 02:27.600
DEELTS BE ENFORCED AND WHA

02:27.600 --> 02:29.567
OTHER WEAPONS DOES THE ASSAD

02:29.567 --> 02:32.300
REGIME RETAIN AND HOW MUCH OF

02:32.300 --> 02:36.867
LET DOES IT REMAIN

02:36.867 --> 02:37.933
OUR NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYS

02:37.933 --> 02:39.433
JOINS US FROM WASHINGTON

02:39.433 --> 02:43.000
I HAVE TO ASK, THE REBELS SAID

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
YOU WERE AT THE PENTAGON, HO

02:45.000 --> 02:46.167
CONFIDENT ARE THEY IN TH

02:46.167 --> 02:48.067
ENFORCEMENT OF THE DEAL?

02:48.067 --> 02:51.433
>> NOBODY CAN BE CONFIDENT YET

02:51.433 --> 02:52.833
THE DEAL COVERS ALL THE BASES.

02:52.833 --> 02:54.967
IT TALKS ABOUT VERIFICATION.

02:54.967 --> 02:57.767
IT TALKS ABOUT DISPOSAL.

02:57.767 --> 02:59.567
IT SETS TIGHT DEADLINES.

02:59.567 --> 03:06.033
IT GIVES ACCESS TO THE

03:06.033 --> 03:07.700
INSPECTING VOTES

03:07.700 --> 03:09.000
ON PAPER IT'S REALLY GOOD T.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.367
PROBLEM IS YOU NEVER KNOW HO

03:10.367 --> 03:11.767
ANY OF THIS WORKS UNTIL YOU GO

03:11.767 --> 03:12.733
INTO THE FIELD

03:12.733 --> 03:14.500
YOU WILL BE DOING THIS IN

03:14.500 --> 03:16.433
COUNTRY THAT'S AT WAR.

03:16.433 --> 03:18.200
THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

03:18.200 --> 03:18.800
SITES.

03:18.800 --> 03:21.467
THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF

03:21.467 --> 03:21.767
WEAPONS.

03:21.767 --> 03:23.333
UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY GET THERE

03:23.333 --> 03:25.400
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT METHODS OF

03:25.400 --> 03:28.767
DISPOSAL YOU ARE GOING TO USE.

03:28.767 --> 03:30.167
YOU DON'T KNOW THE PROBLEMS IN

03:30.167 --> 03:31.567
MOVING THEM IF YOU ARE GOING T

03:31.567 --> 03:32.700
TAKE THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY

03:32.700 --> 03:34.033
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW TH

03:34.033 --> 03:35.333
TECHNICAL WAY TO DO IT

03:35.333 --> 03:37.133
THEN YOU RUN UP AGAINST TH

03:37.133 --> 03:40.200
PROBLEM OF EXACTLY HOW MANY AR

03:40.200 --> 03:40.400
THERE?

03:40.400 --> 03:42.467
CAN YOU REALLY DO CHALLENG

03:42.467 --> 03:42.733
INSPECTION

03:42.733 --> 03:44.133
WILL HE TRY TO HIDE SOME

03:44.133 --> 03:47.033
>> SO, LET'S SAY, BEST CAS

03:47.033 --> 03:48.200
SCENARIO, THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS

03:48.200 --> 03:49.900
ARE REMOVED OFF THE TABLE, WHA

03:49.900 --> 03:51.500
ABOUT ALL OF THE OTHER WEAPONS

03:51.500 --> 03:54.100
THAT THE ASSAD REGIME WILL STILL

03:54.100 --> 03:55.067
RETAIN THAT MIGHT HAVE BEE

03:55.067 --> 03:56.733
TAKEN OUT HAD THERE BEEN A

03:56.733 --> 03:57.367
MILITARY STRIKE?

03:57.367 --> 03:58.833
>> WELL, QUITE FRANKLY, THOS

03:58.833 --> 03:59.767
ARE THE KEY.

03:59.767 --> 04:03.933
THEY HAVE BEEN THE SOURCE OF

04:03.933 --> 04:05.100
VIRTUALLY EVERY SINGLE KASHLTHTY

04:05.100 --> 04:05.967
THAT HAS OCCURRED.

04:05.967 --> 04:07.433
NO MATTER HOW YOU ESTIMATE IT,

04:07.433 --> 04:10.700
EVEN IF YOU ONLY COUNT THE DEA

04:10.700 --> 04:12.467
AND NOT SOME 6 MILLION SYRIANS

04:12.467 --> 04:14.833
THAT HAVE BEEN DISPLACED OR MADE

04:14.833 --> 04:18.800
INTO REFUGEES, CHEMICAL WEAPON

04:18.800 --> 04:21.500
WOULD CAUSE LESS THAN 20% OF THE

04:21.500 --> 04:23.533
MOST CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE I

04:23.533 --> 04:24.967
ANY NUMBER OF PEOPLE

04:24.967 --> 04:26.700
THE KILLING MECHANISMS HAVE BEEN

04:26.700 --> 04:27.367
ARTILLERY.

04:27.367 --> 04:30.400
THEY HAVE BEEN EXECUTIONS.

04:30.400 --> 04:33.533
THERE HAS BEEN A U.N. REPORT

04:33.533 --> 04:36.533
ISSUED UP ON OUR 9/11 THAT SHOWS

04:36.533 --> 04:38.667
THAT THE PRIMARY MECHANISMS HAVE

04:38.667 --> 04:41.867
BEEN THINGS LIKE TORTURE

04:41.867 --> 04:43.900
DETENTION, DISPLACEMENTS

04:43.900 --> 04:45.333
THIS HAS NOT BEEN SOMETHIN

04:45.333 --> 04:46.700
WHERE CHEMICAL WEAPONS HAV

04:46.700 --> 04:49.800
PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE.

04:49.800 --> 04:52.833
AND WE KNOW FIRST THAT THEY CA

04:52.833 --> 04:54.100
SHIFT VERY RAPIDLY

04:54.100 --> 04:57.000
AFTER THE PRESIDENT MADE HIS

04:57.000 --> 04:57.967
ANNOUNCEMENT, THE FIRST TIME

04:57.967 --> 04:59.967
THAT HE WOULD USE CRUISE

04:59.967 --> 05:02.000
MISSILES, WITHIN HOURS, THEY'D

05:02.000 --> 05:04.233
SHOW A POPULATED AREA IN SYRIA

05:04.233 --> 05:06.833
THAT WAS COVERED BY THE BBC.

05:06.833 --> 05:09.267
AFTER THEY ANNOUNCED THIS DEAL

05:09.267 --> 05:12.700
IN TERMS OF ABOLISHING CHEMICA

05:12.700 --> 05:13.933
WEAPONS, AND IT WAS CLEA

05:13.933 --> 05:15.800
THERE'D BE A PAUSE TO TH

05:15.800 --> 05:16.800
CERTAIN GOVERNMENT IMMEDIATELY

05:16.800 --> 05:18.833
STARTED USING AIR POWER AN

05:18.833 --> 05:19.867
ARTILLERY AGAIN.

05:19.867 --> 05:23.600
SO THIS IS NOT GOING TO MAKE

05:23.600 --> 05:24.500
MUCH DIFFERENCE AS FAR AS ANY OF

05:24.500 --> 05:28.300
THE SYRIANS ARE CONCERNED.

05:28.300 --> 05:29.567
>> ALL RIGHT

05:29.567 --> 05:30.833
FINALLY, A QUICK QUESTION.

05:30.833 --> 05:33.300
I'M ASSUMING EVEN THOUGH VLADMIR

05:33.300 --> 05:34.867
PUTIN MAKES HIS CASE IN THE NE

05:34.867 --> 05:37.333
YORK TIMES, HE IS STILL APPLYING

05:37.333 --> 05:39.333
ASSAD WITH WEAPONS

05:39.333 --> 05:41.100
WE HAVE HAD STATEMENTS B

05:41.100 --> 05:42.267
MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESS THAT

05:42.267 --> 05:44.400
THERE ARE REGULAR RUSSIA

05:44.400 --> 05:44.633
SHIPMENTS.

05:44.633 --> 05:47.600
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE HERE

05:47.600 --> 05:50.133
IS NO ONE HAS PROVIDED ANY

05:50.133 --> 05:52.567
ASSESSMENT AT ANY LEVEL FROM THE

05:52.567 --> 05:55.700
ADMINISTRATION OF OUR EFFORTS TO

05:55.700 --> 05:56.900
SHIP ARMS, OF HOW MANY ARMS THEY

05:56.900 --> 05:58.600
ARE GETTING FROM THE 18IAN, HO

05:58.600 --> 06:00.100
MANY ARMS THEY ARE GETTING FRO

06:00.100 --> 06:01.067
THE RUSSIANS

06:01.067 --> 06:03.867
WE'VE HEARD ESTIMATES OF SOM

06:03.867 --> 06:05.700
5,000 HEZBOLLAH WITHOUT ANYONE

06:05.700 --> 06:07.833
FULLY VERIFYING IT

06:07.833 --> 06:10.067
THERE ARE REPORTS OF AT LEAS

06:10.067 --> 06:14.400
THREE IRANIAN TRAINING CAMPS FOR

06:14.400 --> 06:16.133
THE MILITIA AND, YET, NONE O

06:16.133 --> 06:17.400
THOSE HAVE BEEN MADE PUBLIC.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.600
>> THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.

06:19.600 --> 06:20.933
>> THANK YOU

06:20.933 --> 06:23.267
>> AND NOW TO COLORADO WHERE

06:23.267 --> 06:25.333
EXTENSIVE FLOODING HAS LEF

HUNDREDS STRANDED NORTH OF

06:46.933 --> 06:48.133
MORE THAN 30 PEOPLE WERE

08:39.100 --> 08:40.067
>> Reporter: FIVE YEARS AGO, A

08:40.067 --> 08:42.567
TERRIBLE FAMILY TRAGEDY OCCURRED

08:42.567 --> 08:44.167
HERE IN ROYAL BRITISH COLUMBIA

08:44.167 --> 08:45.500
BUT OVER TIME, IT BECAME MUC

08:45.500 --> 08:46.267
MORE THAN THAT

08:46.267 --> 08:48.767
THIS TRAGEDY SET IN MOTION

08:48.767 --> 08:51.033
DRAMATIC CHANGES TO THE LAWS

08:51.033 --> 08:52.500
GOVERNING DRINK AND DRIVING,

08:52.500 --> 08:54.467
CHANGES SUPPORTERS SAY HAV

08:54.467 --> 08:55.700
ALREADY SAVED ACCIDENCE OF

08:55.700 --> 08:56.133
LIVES.

08:56.133 --> 08:58.200
>> THAT TRAGEDY INVOLVED A

08:58.200 --> 08:58.767
4-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

08:58.767 --> 09:01.133
HER NAME WAS ALEXA

09:01.133 --> 09:02.867
>> IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL MAY LONG

09:02.867 --> 09:06.567
WEEKEND AND MY DAUGHTER ALEX

09:06.567 --> 09:07.700
LOVED THIS ONE PARTICULAR HORS

09:07.700 --> 09:09.667
AND SHE REALLY WANTED TO SHO

09:09.667 --> 09:12.067
HER GRANDPARENTS THAT HORSE.

09:12.067 --> 09:13.767
SO I REMEMBER SAYING GOOD-BYE TO

09:13.767 --> 09:13.867
HER.

09:13.867 --> 09:17.700
THEN VERY SHORTLY AFTER THAT, WE

09:17.700 --> 09:19.600
HEARD ALL KIND OF SIRENS

09:19.600 --> 09:21.567
AT THAT MOMENT I JUST, I JUS

09:21.567 --> 09:24.367
KNEW, I SAID, IT'S ALEXA

09:24.367 --> 09:27.200
SOMETHING'S HAPPENED TO ALEXA.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.100
>> A 56-YEAR-OLD DOING NEARL

09:29.100 --> 09:30.533
TWICE THE SPEED LIMIT SMASHE

09:30.533 --> 09:34.733
INTO THE EXACT SPOT WHERE ALEX

09:34.733 --> 09:35.700
STOOD FEEDING THE HORSE ON THE

09:35.700 --> 09:36.767
SIDE OF THE ROAD

09:36.767 --> 09:38.700
THE WOMAN ADMITTED TO POLICE SHE

09:38.700 --> 09:39.833
HAD THREE CLASS IFS OF WEE

09:39.833 --> 09:42.167
BEFORE GETTING INTO HER CAR.

09:42.167 --> 09:44.267
>> WHEN WE KNEW ROADSIDE THA

09:44.267 --> 09:46.067
OUR DAUGHTER WAS DEAD, I

09:46.067 --> 09:48.200
REMEMBER MY HUSBAND JUST IN TH

09:48.200 --> 09:49.433
AMBULANCE, WE BOTH HELD EACH

09:49.433 --> 09:52.100
OPTS AND HE SAID, THIS WILL NO

09:52.100 --> 09:53.100
WRECK US

09:53.100 --> 09:55.533
THIS WILL DEFINE US.

09:55.533 --> 09:56.900
THERE WILL BE SOME CHANGE IN

09:56.900 --> 09:57.300
THIS

09:57.300 --> 10:00.200
>> Reporter: AFTER THE ACCIDENT,

10:00.200 --> 10:01.567
ALEXA'S PARENTS, MICHAEL AND

10:01.567 --> 10:03.233
LAUREL, LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN TO

10:03.233 --> 10:05.167
TRY AND CHANGE THE CULTURE

10:05.167 --> 10:06.533
AROUND DRINKING AND DRIVING TO

10:06.533 --> 10:09.767
DETER PEOPLE FROM DOING IT THEIR

10:09.767 --> 10:11.500
HE VENT BECAME A LOCAL FEATURE

10:11.500 --> 10:12.200
ON THE LOCAL NEWS.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.100
>> WE WILL HONOR OUR DAUGHTE

10:14.100 --> 10:16.233
AND WE WILL MAKE THE NECESSARY

10:16.233 --> 10:17.333
CHANGES THAT NUMBER ONE...

10:17.333 --> 10:19.000
>> THEY SOON REALIZED IT WOULD

10:19.000 --> 10:19.700
TAKE MORE THAN THAT.

10:19.700 --> 10:21.500
THEY REALIZED THEY HAD TO CHANGE

10:21.500 --> 10:23.000
THE DRUNK DRIVING LAWS, WHIC

10:23.000 --> 10:25.500
LIKE IN THE U.S. SET THE LOCAL

10:25.500 --> 10:27.000
ALCOHOL LIMIT AT .08%.

10:27.000 --> 10:27.933
AFTER LOBBYING THE GOVERNMEN

10:27.933 --> 10:30.200
FOR NEARLY A YEAR ALONGSID

10:30.200 --> 10:31.967
GROUPS LIKE MOTHERS AGAINS

10:31.967 --> 10:33.200
DRUNK DRIVING, THEIR EFFORTS

10:33.200 --> 10:33.833
PAID OFF

10:33.833 --> 10:35.767
IN 2010, THE PROISHL GOVERNMEN

10:35.767 --> 10:38.100
NOT ONLY STIFFENED PENALTIES

10:38.100 --> 10:41.367
AGAINST DRIVING AT .08 BUT, MORE

10:41.367 --> 10:43.033
IMPORTANTLY, IT TARGETED DRIVERS

10:43.033 --> 10:51.033
WHO FALL BELOW THA

10:51.033 --> 10:52.367
TO .05

10:52.367 --> 10:53.667
TWO DRINKS FOR A WOMAN AND THREE

10:53.667 --> 10:55.300
FOR A MAN CAN IMPAIR YOU

10:55.300 --> 10:56.267
ABILITY TO DRIVE

10:56.267 --> 10:58.500
THE BIG CHANGE WAS IF YOU AR

10:58.500 --> 11:01.900
NOW CAUGHT DRIVING WITH A .0

11:01.900 --> 11:02.833
BLOOD ALCOHOL LEVEL THE POLICE

11:02.833 --> 11:04.800

YOUR XAR FOR AT LEAST THRE

11:08.900 --> 11:09.300
DAYS

11:09.300 --> 11:11.800
THEY WOULD GET YOU OUT OF TH

11:11.800 --> 11:13.333
VEHICLE AND A TOW TRUCK WOUL

11:13.333 --> 11:14.533
HAUL IT AWAY

11:14.533 --> 11:16.500
IF LATE 2010, POLICE BEGAN

11:16.500 --> 11:18.033
ENFORCING THE NEW LAWS AND

11:18.033 --> 11:19.967
POLICE IMPOUND LOTS ACROSS

11:19.967 --> 11:21.267
BRITISH COLUMBIA BEGAN FILLING

11:21.267 --> 11:21.567
UP

11:21.567 --> 11:24.067
THE CHANGES SPARKED AN UPROAR,

11:24.067 --> 11:26.267
CIVIL LIBERTARIANS ARGUED IT

11:26.267 --> 11:27.900
GAVE THE POLICE TOO MUCH POWER

11:27.900 --> 11:30.167
RESTAURANT OWNERS LIKE MAR

11:30.167 --> 11:31.833
ROBERT SAID THE NEW LAWS DAMAGED

11:31.833 --> 11:32.933
THE ECONOMY.

11:32.933 --> 11:34.633
HE SAYS HIS BUSINESS DROPPED

11:34.633 --> 11:35.700
BETWEEN 10 AND 20%

11:35.700 --> 11:37.600
>> WHEN THE CHANGE OF DRINKING

11:37.600 --> 11:39.400
DRIVING LAWS CAME OUT, WE KNEW

11:39.400 --> 11:40.600
IT WAS GOING TO HAVE A STRON

11:40.600 --> 11:41.700
IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS

11:41.700 --> 11:43.333
>> WHAT DID YOU THINK, THA

11:43.333 --> 11:45.367
CUSTOMERS WOULD SUDDENLY BY

11:45.367 --> 11:46.233
PLAYED THE AND WOULDN'T COME T

11:46.233 --> 11:46.933
YOUR DOOR?

11:46.933 --> 11:49.133
>> WE THOUGHT THERE WAS A LOT OF

11:49.133 --> 11:51.033
UNKNOWNS OF WHAT THAT MEANT A,

11:51.033 --> 11:52.533
HOW MANY DRINKS PEOPLE HAD

11:52.533 --> 11:53.200
THERE WAS LITTLE INFORMATION

11:53.200 --> 11:54.700
ABOUT HOW THAT WAS GOING TO BE

11:54.700 --> 11:56.433
ENFORCED, HOW IT WAS GOING T

11:56.433 --> 11:57.767
IMPACT WHAT PEOPLE COULD DRINK

11:57.767 --> 11:59.667
WE WERE CREATING NON-ALCOHOLIC

11:59.667 --> 12:01.367
DRINKS TO TRY TO MAKE UP FOR

12:01.367 --> 12:02.133
THOSE LOST SALES

12:02.133 --> 12:05.467
IT REALLY WAS A LOT OF FEAR, A

12:05.467 --> 12:07.067
LOT OF UNKNOWN AND SOME REAL

12:07.067 --> 12:09.767
CHANGES IN PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOR

12:09.767 --> 12:12.033
>> Reporter: AND THE IMPACT WA

12:12.033 --> 12:12.200
IMMEDIATE.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.400
DURING THE FIRST YEAR THE IF YOU

12:13.400 --> 12:15.533
LAWS WERE IN EFFECT, THE NUMBE

12:15.533 --> 12:17.267
OF DRUNK DRIVING DEATHS IN

12:17.267 --> 12:19.500
BRITISH COLUMBIA PLUNGED

12:19.500 --> 12:20.733
CRITICS ARGUE THAT FIRST YEA

12:20.733 --> 12:21.467
WAS A FLUKE.

12:21.467 --> 12:23.167
BUT THE SECOND YEAR THE FOOTBALL

12:23.167 --> 12:24.233
DECLINED AGAIN

12:24.233 --> 12:26.467
A 55% REDUCTION IN DEATHS IN

12:26.467 --> 12:27.833
JUST TWO YEARS

12:27.833 --> 12:29.767
THE MESSAGE, IT SEEMED, HA

12:29.767 --> 12:31.233
STARTED GETTING THROUGH TO

12:31.233 --> 12:31.833
DRIVERS.

12:31.833 --> 12:34.867
>> SO IT WAS QUITE WEL

12:34.867 --> 12:37.133
PUBLICIZED AND FOR DETERRENCE TO

12:37.133 --> 12:38.500
WORK IT'S ABOUT AS MUCH AS

12:38.500 --> 12:40.233
KNOWING AND EXPECTING

12:40.233 --> 12:41.567
CONSEQUENCE THAN FULLY BEING

12:41.567 --> 12:43.000
LIKELY

12:43.000 --> 12:44.300
PEOPLE'S PERCEPTION THAT IT WA

12:44.300 --> 12:46.233
WAY HIGH THAN IT ACTUALLY WAS.

12:46.233 --> 12:47.333
>> AND THAT'S KEY?

12:47.333 --> 12:48.733
>> IT IS KEY

12:48.733 --> 12:49.367
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

12:49.367 --> 12:50.800

12:53.333 --> 12:55.300
THINK OF A SINGLE REFORM THAT'

12:55.300 --> 12:58.167
HAD THIS BIG OF AN IMPACT THIS

12:58.167 --> 12:58.300
QUICKLY.

12:58.300 --> 13:00.667
HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES REVIEWED A

13:00.667 --> 13:02.067
PEER STUDY OF THE EFFECTIVENES

13:02.067 --> 13:06.900
OF THE NEW LAWS.

13:06.900 --> 13:08.067
>> THESE LAWS EPITOMIZE TAKING

13:08.067 --> 13:09.233
ACTION AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

13:09.233 --> 13:12.300
TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DON'T

13:12.300 --> 13:16.833
NEED DRA CONIAN SEVERE

13:16.833 --> 13:20.533
PENALTY -- DRACONIAN SEVER

13:20.533 --> 13:21.467
PENALTIES, MORE IMPORTANT THAT

13:21.467 --> 13:22.167
THEY ARE CERTAIN AND SWIFT

13:22.167 --> 13:23.967
SO ON THE SPOT, LOSING YOUR CA

13:23.967 --> 13:29.833
FOR THREE DAYS A WEEK, THAT'

13:29.833 --> 13:31.100
SEVERE ENOUGH.

13:31.100 --> 13:33.633
THE NEW LAWS HAVE SETBACKS

13:33.633 --> 13:36.967
POLICE HAVE PROBLEMS WIT

13:36.967 --> 13:37.133
BREATHALYZERS.

13:37.133 --> 13:38.933
COURTS RULED DRIVERS DESERVED

13:38.933 --> 13:40.000
BETTER APPEALS PROCESS

13:40.000 --> 13:41.933
J YOU THIS WEEK, A JUDGE RULED

13:41.933 --> 13:45.067
IN FAVOR OF A DRIVER WHA

13:45.067 --> 13:46.467
APPEALED HIS 2012 DRIVIN

13:46.467 --> 13:46.700
SUSPENSION

13:46.700 --> 13:47.833
CRITICS SAY THAT RULING COUL

13:47.833 --> 13:49.333
FORCE A REWRITING OF THE LAWS.

13:49.333 --> 13:50.533
FOR NOW, THOUGH, THE HEART O

13:50.533 --> 13:52.600
THE LAWS REMAIN INTACT

13:52.600 --> 13:54.633
>> WHAT ABOUT THE ARGUMENT THA

13:54.633 --> 13:56.767
THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY LEAVES

13:56.767 --> 13:59.467
SAVED BY THESE NEW RULES THAT,

13:59.467 --> 14:01.200
YES, THEY MAY HAVE TAKEN A HIT

14:01.200 --> 14:02.633
OUT OF THE BORE BUSINESS, BUT TO

14:02.633 --> 14:04.267
SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES, THAT'S AN

14:04.267 --> 14:05.567
OKAY PRICE TO PAY.

14:05.567 --> 14:06.267
>> YEAH.

14:06.267 --> 14:07.767
IT'S HARD TO ARGUE THAT.

14:07.767 --> 14:09.433
I SIMPLY CERTAINLY AM NOT GOIN

14:09.433 --> 14:11.000
TO SIT HERE AND SAY, WELL, W

14:11.000 --> 14:12.767
SHOULD ALOPEOPLE TO DRIN

14:12.767 --> 14:14.900
WHATEVER AND WHATEVER TH

14:14.900 --> 14:15.767
CONSEQUENCES ARE, THAT'S THE WAY

14:15.767 --> 14:16.867
IT'S GOING TO BE

14:16.867 --> 14:17.933
I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T ADVOCAT

14:17.933 --> 14:18.233
THAT

14:18.233 --> 14:20.100
>> WHY DO YOU THINK THIS HAS

14:20.100 --> 14:21.167
BEEN SO EFFECTIVE IN

14:21.167 --> 14:23.233
>> I THINK BECAUSE THE

14:23.233 --> 14:25.700
CONSEQUENCE IS FIRM.

14:25.700 --> 14:27.900
I THINK THAT PEOPLE RESPOND WHEN

14:27.900 --> 14:29.633
THERE IS A HARSHER CONSEQUENCE

14:29.633 --> 14:33.300
AND I THINK, TOO, BECAUSE IT'S A

14:33.300 --> 14:34.067
LARGER BOWL.

14:34.067 --> 14:35.833
JUST LIKE SECOND-HAND SMOKE, W

14:35.833 --> 14:38.067
HAVE NO TOLERANCE FOR THAT

14:38.067 --> 14:38.200
ANYMORE.

14:38.200 --> 14:39.900
JUST LIKE WHEN SEATBELTS CAM

14:39.900 --> 14:41.600

14:41.600 --> 14:41.767
SHIFT.

14:41.767 --> 14:44.067
MY GOAL HAS ALWAYS BEEN THER

14:44.067 --> 14:45.233
WILL BE A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT THAT

14:45.233 --> 14:47.400
IT'S NOT OKAY TO DRINK AND

14:47.400 --> 14:47.933
DRIVE.

16:02.400 --> 16:03.267
HOW MANY PEOPLE WOISH ABOU

16:03.267 --> 16:04.567
THINGS DAY-TO-DAY RIGHT NOW.

16:04.567 --> 16:06.400
THE OTHER NUMBER THAT JUMPED OUT

16:06.400 --> 16:08.767
AT ME, LAST FALL, 45% OF PEOPL

16:08.767 --> 16:10.200
SAID THEY TOT THE ECONOMY WA

16:10.200 --> 16:12.000
THE GOING TO GET BETTER OVER THE

16:12.000 --> 16:13.133
NEXT 12 MONTHS

16:13.133 --> 16:14.700
>> THAT NUMBER IS NOW DOWN T

16:14.700 --> 16:15.067
27%.

16:15.067 --> 16:16.500
SO, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

16:16.500 --> 16:17.900
LOOKING FOR FIVE YEARS FOR THE

16:17.900 --> 16:19.067
SIGN THE REAL RECOVERY THAT'

16:19.067 --> 16:20.567
GOING TO PRODUCE THE REA

16:20.567 --> 16:21.800
ECONOMIC GROWTH MAY BE A LITTL

16:21.800 --> 16:22.933
BIT OF AN ECONOMIC BOOM IS

16:22.933 --> 16:23.367
COMING

16:23.367 --> 16:25.833
THEY STILL DON'T SEE TLITS AND

16:25.833 --> 16:27.400
SO THEY'RE WORRIED NOT JUS

16:27.400 --> 16:29.333
ABOUT THE LONG RUN, THEY'R

16:29.333 --> 16:30.900
WORRIED ABOUT THE SHORT RUN.

16:30.900 --> 16:32.733
>> THE OTHER NUMBER I WA

16:32.733 --> 16:33.933
WORRIED IS THE NUMBER OF PEOPL

16:33.933 --> 16:36.267
IN YOUR SURVEY THAT IDENTIFY

16:36.267 --> 16:37.767
THEMSELVES AS POOR DOUBLE AN

16:37.767 --> 16:39.167
THE PERCENTAGE CALLING

16:39.167 --> 16:41.167
THEMSELVES MIDDLE CLASS HA

16:41.167 --> 16:41.433
SLIPPED.

16:41.433 --> 16:42.233
HOW UNUSUAL IS THIS.

16:42.233 --> 16:42.933
>> THAT IS UNUSUAL

16:42.933 --> 16:44.100
>> THAT ITSELF THE AMERICA

16:44.100 --> 16:44.500
DREAM.

16:44.500 --> 16:47.000
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE POOR AND THEY

16:47.000 --> 16:48.733
STRIVE TO BE MIDDLE CLASS.

16:48.733 --> 16:50.233
THE MIDDLE CLASS STRIVE TO B

16:50.233 --> 16:50.400
RIVEN.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.067
YOU SEE A REVERSAL OF THAT

16:52.067 --> 16:53.767
THE OTHER NUMBER IN THAT REGAR

16:53.767 --> 16:55.367
THAT JUMPED OUT TO ME THOS

16:55.367 --> 16:56.900
PEOPLE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES

16:56.900 --> 16:58.533
MIDDLE CLASS, KNOWN% SAID THEY

16:58.533 --> 16:59.800
MIGHT, THEY FEAR AT LEAST THEY

16:59.800 --> 17:01.967
MIGHT DROP OUT OF THE MIDDLE

17:01.967 --> 17:03.433
CLASS IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS, I

17:03.433 --> 17:05.267
THE NEXT FIVE YEARS OR SO.

17:05.267 --> 17:06.933
THAT'S A REAL SIGN OF WORRY AS

17:06.933 --> 17:07.433
WELL

17:07.433 --> 17:10.500
YOU SAID, CAN I PAY MY GROCERY

17:10.500 --> 17:12.000
BILLS, MY UTILITY BILLS?

17:12.000 --> 17:14.867
THIS IS A NUMBER LONG TERM

17:14.867 --> 17:15.933
CONCERNS NOT JUST SHORT TERM

17:15.933 --> 17:16.367
CONCERNS

17:16.367 --> 17:18.633
>> FINALLY, THERE IS ONLY 24

17:18.633 --> 17:20.533
PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS SAID THEY

17:20.533 --> 17:21.867
HAD BEEN AFFECTED A GREAT DEAL

17:21.867 --> 17:24.200
BY THE HOUSING CRISIS, SO WHAT

17:24.200 --> 17:25.567
ELSE ACCOUNTS FOR THIS GROWING

17:25.567 --> 17:26.800
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO FEEL POOR

17:26.800 --> 17:28.333
OR THINK THEY HAVE FALLEN OUT OF

17:28.333 --> 17:29.433
THE MIDDLE CLASS

17:29.433 --> 17:31.467
>> TWO THINGS, IF YOU DIVIDE

17:31.467 --> 17:34.000
THAT NUMBER BY THE PEOPLE WH

17:34.000 --> 17:35.200
SAID THEY WERE SOMEWHAT AFFECTED

17:35.200 --> 17:36.900
BE I THE WALL STREET COLLAPSE,

17:36.900 --> 17:38.167
YOU GET OVER 50%

17:38.167 --> 17:40.367
SO PEOPLE DIDN'T JUST OBSERV

17:40.367 --> 17:41.300
THIS CRISIS.

17:41.300 --> 17:43.667
A LOT OF PEOPLE FELT IT AFFECTED

17:43.667 --> 17:45.033
THEM OR SOMEBODY IN THEI

17:45.033 --> 17:45.333
FAMILY

17:45.333 --> 17:47.167
THAT'S THE FIRST THING T. SECOND

17:47.167 --> 17:48.433
THING I THINK IT'S PRODUCED

17:48.433 --> 17:49.000
GENERAL ANXIETY.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.833
YOU SEE THE IN A LOT OF POLL

17:50.833 --> 17:51.367
NUMBERS.

17:51.367 --> 17:52.900
FRANKLY, I THINK YOU SEE IT ON

17:52.900 --> 17:54.000
THE DEBATE ON SYRIA.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.600
THIS IS AN UNEASY COUNTRY.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.000
EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T FEEL YOU WERE

17:57.000 --> 17:58.433
DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THE WAL

17:58.433 --> 17:59.567

17:59.567 --> 18:00.867
SORT OF WATCHED IT UP CLOSE,

18:00.867 --> 18:01.933
CLOSE ENOUGH THAT YOU WORR

18:01.933 --> 18:03.600
ABOUT IT AND IT'S PRODUCED KIN

18:03.600 --> 18:06.133
OF AN UNDERLYING ANXIETY AND

18:06.133 --> 18:06.933
THERE HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH

18:06.933 --> 18:08.500
ECONOMIC GROWTH TO MAKE THAT

18:08.500 --> 18:09.500
ANXIETY GO AWAY.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.900
>> THAT I THINK IS THE REA

18:11.900 --> 18:13.967
RESIDUAL EFFECT FIVE YEARS

18:13.967 --> 18:14.700
LATER.

18:14.700 --> 18:17.667

IS REMEMBERED FOR HER HOME

19:21.067 --> 19:22.667
ABOUND AND IF A HOME CAN SERVE

19:22.667 --> 19:24.833
AS AN AUTO BIOGRAPHY, THE MOUN

19:24.833 --> 19:25.367
IS IT.

19:25.367 --> 19:27.367
SITTING ON A HILL IN LENNOX,

19:27.367 --> 19:28.467
MASSACHUSETTS, THE MOUNT WAS

19:28.467 --> 19:29.967
CONCEIVED BY THE WRITER FROM THE

19:29.967 --> 19:30.600
GROUND UP.

19:30.600 --> 19:33.133
SHE DREAMED ITS LOCATION, GUIDED

19:33.133 --> 19:35.833
ITS AESTHETIC PRINCIPLES AND

19:35.833 --> 19:37.400
DESIGNED HER ELABORATE GARDENS

19:37.400 --> 19:40.833
IT WAS IN A SENSE HER OWN HOUS

19:40.833 --> 19:44.000
OF MYRR WHICH SHE LIVED IN HERE.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.567
>> THIS HOUSE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY

19:45.567 --> 19:46.900
FOR HER TO DO THINGS THE WAY

19:46.900 --> 19:48.133
THEY OUGHT TO BE DONE.

19:48.133 --> 19:52.067
THAT WAS TO CHAMPION A RETURN OF

19:52.067 --> 19:53.733
CLASSICISM, SYMMETRY, BALANCE,

19:53.733 --> 19:54.033
PROPORTION

19:54.033 --> 19:55.333
LOTS OF LIGHT AND OPENING UP

19:55.333 --> 19:57.600
SPACES AND TO MAKE THEM LIVABLE.

19:57.600 --> 19:59.500

HOME PRACTICALLY

20:00.767 --> 20:02.233
NO SPACE WENT UNUSED

20:02.233 --> 20:03.333
IT WAS LARGE BUT NOT GRAND

20:03.333 --> 20:08.867
AND IT FAVORED HER PREDELICTIO

20:08.867 --> 20:09.933
FOR PRIVACY.

20:09.933 --> 20:11.767
A WRITER STAGED IN HER LIBRARY

20:11.767 --> 20:13.167
SHE ACTUALLY WROTE ELSEWHERE

HER BEST WORK WRITING IN BED

20:17.533 --> 20:19.233
THAT WAS WHERE THE CREATIV

20:19.233 --> 20:20.333
GENIUS INSPIRED HER.

20:20.333 --> 20:22.100
SO I THINK IN BUILDING THE

20:22.100 --> 20:23.767
MOUNT, SHE CREATED A SPACE WHERE

20:23.767 --> 20:25.533
SHE COULD HAVE THE PRIVACY SHE
