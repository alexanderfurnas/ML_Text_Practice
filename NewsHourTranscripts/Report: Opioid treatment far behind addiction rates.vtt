JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: A new study
by one of the nation's biggest
health insurance companies

00:04.933 --> 00:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
provides a startling
look at the toll that
prescription opioids are
taking on its policy-holders.

00:11.233 --> 00:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has that.

00:13.166 --> 00:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The insurance
giant Blue Cross Blue Shield
analyzed medical records

00:16.933 --> 00:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for 30 million of its customers.

00:18.733 --> 00:20.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it found some
striking results.

00:20.833 --> 00:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2015, roughly 20 percent of
their customers, one in five,
filled at least one prescription

00:26.800 --> 00:28.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for opioid painkillers.

00:28.900 --> 00:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Almost half of those patients
were prescribed high doses of
those drugs, which are more

00:32.733 --> 00:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
likely to cause dependence.

00:34.833 --> 00:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, indeed, between 2010 and
2016, the rate of abuse or
addiction to those painkillers

00:41.333 --> 00:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shot up dramatically by almost
500 percent, this while the
rate of medically assisted

00:47.700 --> 00:51.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
treatment, considered the
most successful way to curb
those addictions, grew by just

00:52.966 --> 00:55.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
65 percent in the
same time frame.

00:55.566 --> 00:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The report also detailed
differences in opioid
abuse between men and
women and among different

00:59.033 --> 01:00.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
parts of the country.

01:00.600 --> 01:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For more on this, I'm joined
now by Dr. Trent Haywood.

01:03.400 --> 01:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's the chief medical
officer for the Blue Cross
Blue Shield Association.

01:07.466 --> 01:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to the "NewsHour."

01:09.766 --> 01:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a very, very interesting
set of data that you have
produced from your patients'

01:14.666 --> 01:16.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
records.

01:16.700 --> 01:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have said one in five have
had a prescription for these
painkillers, obviously, most of

01:20.066 --> 01:23.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
them for very legitimate
pain-suppression needs.

01:23.833 --> 01:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we have also discovered
here that the rate of
addiction has shot up.

01:28.400 --> 01:29.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why do you think that
has been happening?

01:29.800 --> 01:31.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

01:31.766 --> 01:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRENT HAYWOOD, Chief Medical
Officer, Blue Cross Blue Shield
Association: Well, one of

01:33.900 --> 01:35.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the things, the reason
why we wanted to focus
on this particular
issue is just what you

01:35.900 --> 01:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just alluded to, the escalation
in the opioid addiction from
physicians prescribing these

01:41.066 --> 01:43.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
particular opioids.

01:43.133 --> 01:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Starting in the '90s, we really
went aggressive as physicians
making sure that we address

01:47.566 --> 01:49.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pain.

01:49.700 --> 01:53.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Unfortunately, it was found out
later, as we are starting to see
unfold now, we underestimated

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the risk related to that
particular high doses
of prescribing those
particular opioids.

01:59.466 --> 02:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And now we are suffering
the consequences of that.

02:01.566 --> 02:04.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Some of this
data that you guys have put
together, it is not necessarily

02:04.166 --> 02:06.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
new news.

02:06.100 --> 02:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why hasn't the message seemingly
gotten out to the medical
community just how serious

02:10.100 --> 02:11.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
these drugs really are?

02:11.166 --> 02:13.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRENT HAYWOOD: Well, one of
the things that we know when
it comes to medicine and the

02:15.400 --> 02:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
practice of medicine is that it
really requires a substantial
amount of time for it to change.

02:20.133 --> 02:23.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We're headed into the
independence holiday,
and so people are
moving off to make sure

02:23.900 --> 02:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they enjoy times with
their friends and family, but
as this report highlights, all

02:28.133 --> 02:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of us won't necessarily be
independent this particular
day, because whether it be your

02:32.266 --> 02:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
family, whether it be your
neighbor's family or whether it
be someone down the block, we're

02:36.400 --> 02:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all struggling with this
issue of opioid addiction.

02:39.633 --> 02:44.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Over two million Americans
each year are suffering
from this opioid addiction.

02:44.266 --> 02:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what is key about that
particular aspect is that it's
not one specific demographic.

02:48.666 --> 02:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
treatments, the best-known
treatments for these
addictions have barely

02:54.433 --> 02:55.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
kept up with the pace.

02:55.866 --> 02:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why do you think that is?

02:56.900 --> 02:58.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

02:58.966 --> 03:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRENT HAYWOOD: We're talking
about someone moving from what
would normally would be an

03:00.500 --> 03:03.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
acute situation to
a chronic condition.

03:03.466 --> 03:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so this opioid addiction
is a chronic condition and
we need to treat it that way.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We need to make certain
these people are not
only in treatment, but
they have the necessary

03:12.433 --> 03:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
support for the chronic
condition that they have.

03:14.766 --> 03:19.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: If I am a
policy holder of Blue Cross
Blue Shield and I recognize

03:19.200 --> 03:23.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that I have a substance problem,
and I come and I try to get
treatment for that, will

03:23.600 --> 03:25.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
my policy cover that
addiction treatment?

03:25.966 --> 03:26.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

03:26.966 --> 03:28.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRENT HAYWOOD: Yes.

03:28.966 --> 03:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, one of the reasons why we're
highlighting this is because
you -- actually make certain

03:32.400 --> 03:36.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that you follow up at
your local plan level
to get that treatment.

03:36.233 --> 03:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this is something that
is actually covered in
most members' policies.

03:40.433 --> 03:43.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so you absolutely
should be following up
to get that treatment.

03:43.100 --> 03:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: One of the
things I was also struck by
in your report is the gender

03:46.466 --> 03:48.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
differences.

03:48.533 --> 03:51.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It seemed that younger -- when
the genders are younger, when
men and women are younger,

03:51.766 --> 03:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
men seem to be more vulnerable.

03:53.366 --> 03:57.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But as we age, women
seem to become more
vulnerable to addiction.

03:57.100 --> 03:58.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do you have a sense
of why that is?

03:58.433 --> 04:00.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

04:00.500 --> 04:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRENT HAYWOOD: One of the
reasons why we think women are
being impacted as we get into an

04:02.933 --> 04:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
older age group is the fact that
they're appropriately following
up with their physicians.

04:07.633 --> 04:10.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you think about it, the
more that you are following
up, the more likely that you're

04:10.866 --> 04:12.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to be
prescribed an opioid.

04:12.933 --> 04:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we're seeing women are
actually at an accelerated
pace the more that we get into

04:17.500 --> 04:19.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the older age groups.

04:19.600 --> 04:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so that's the correlation
that you're seeing, why women
would necessarily be higher,

04:23.100 --> 04:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because they are more
predisposed to actually
getting that prescribed opioid.

04:26.366 --> 04:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: At the very
moment we're talking, the
Senate is debating a health care

04:29.633 --> 04:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bill that could eliminate
hundreds of billions of
dollars from Medicaid.

04:34.066 --> 04:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Medicaid itself pays for
much of addiction treatment
around the country.

04:38.133 --> 04:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you share concern of many
that, if this bill were to
become law, that this -- those

04:44.600 --> 04:47.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
cuts to Medicaid
could only worsen an
already awful epidemic?

04:47.466 --> 04:49.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

04:49.500 --> 04:52.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRENT HAYWOOD: From every
indication, this particular
issue is not partisan at all.

04:52.800 --> 04:56.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, whether you're on the
right or on the left, what we
have understood is, as relates

04:56.566 --> 05:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the opioid epidemic, both
sides of the aisle are eager
to be able to address that

05:01.400 --> 05:03.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
particular concern.

05:03.533 --> 05:07.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so, while there may
be broader implications
as it relates to health
care reform, on this

05:07.333 --> 05:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
particular topic, I think we
all stand together as Americans.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All
right, Dr. Trent Haywood,
chief medical officer of
Blue Cross Blue Shield,

05:14.366 --> 05:15.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thank you so much.

05:15.366 --> 05:16.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

05:16.366 --> 05:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRENT HAYWOOD: Thank you.
