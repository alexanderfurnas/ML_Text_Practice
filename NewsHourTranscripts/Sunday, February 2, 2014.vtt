IN, MORE DRUG TESTING THAN

17:43.967 --> 17:45.267
REGULAR PROBATION?

17:45.267 --> 17:47.900
>> JUST BY HAVING THEM DO DRUG

17:47.900 --> 17:49.367
TESTING IS NOT SUPERVISION

17:49.367 --> 17:50.933
IT'S ONE FORM OF SUPERVISION

17:50.933 --> 17:53.500
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

17:53.500 --> 17:55.067

REGULAR PROBATION WILL B

18:38.433 --> 18:39.133
CHARGED WITH CRIMES.

THE PEOPLE ON H.O.P.E. ARE BEING

18:41.433 --> 18:43.267
CHARGED WITH CRIMES A LOT LESS

PUBLIC FUNDING FOR THE NATIONA

POLITICAL CONVENTIONS.

MOLLY HOOPER, A REPORTER FOR THE

HILL HAS BEEN WORKING ON THE

I SPOKE WITH HER EARLIER FRO

19:43.933 --> 19:44.300
WASHINGTON

HOW MUCH PUBLIC FUNDING IS THERE

19:46.133 --> 19:47.300
THAT GOES FOR THESE CONVENTION

19:47.300 --> 19:48.633
AND WHAT ARE THEY PROPOSING TO

19:48.633 --> 19:49.533
DO WITH IT

19:49.533 --> 19:52.833
>> WELL, RIGHT NOW, AS OF 2012

19:52.833 --> 19:55.667
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE PAID $36

19:55.667 --> 19:57.067
MILLION BETWEEN THE TWO MAJO

19:57.067 --> 20:00.767
PARTY CONVENTIONS, BUT THE MONEY

20:00.767 --> 20:02.200
THAT THE REPUBLICANS AND

20:02.200 --> 20:03.633
DEMOCRATS WANT TO USE WOUL

20:03.633 --> 20:05.500
ACTUALLY BE FUNDING A TEN-YEAR

20:05.500 --> 20:07.533
RESEARCH INITIATIVE FO

20:07.533 --> 20:09.733
PEDIATRIC HEALTH ISSUES, AND

20:09.733 --> 20:12.167
THAT MONEY WOULD BE $126 MILLION

20:12.167 --> 20:13.867
OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME

20:13.867 --> 20:16.133
SO THAT WOULD ENCAPSULATE TW

20:16.133 --> 20:17.067
POLITICAL CONVENTIONS.

20:17.067 --> 20:17.800
>> OKAY.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.233
SO RIGHT NOW ABOUT A QUARTER O

20:19.233 --> 20:20.500
THE POLITICAL CONVENTIONS COME

20:20.500 --> 20:22.900
FROM OUR POCKETS AND THE RES

20:22.900 --> 20:24.767
FROM SPONSORS?

20:24.767 --> 20:26.333
>> YES, SPONSORS

20:26.333 --> 20:28.000
IT'S ACTUALLY A LOOPHOLE THA

20:28.000 --> 20:31.433
THE PARTIES HAVE FOUND WHERE YOU

20:31.433 --> 20:33.000
GO TO THESE CONVENTIONS EVER

20:33.000 --> 20:34.433
FOUR YEARS, SHOW UP IN THE CIT

20:34.433 --> 20:36.000
AND THERE'S A HOST COMMITTEE

20:36.000 --> 20:37.700
THAT HOST COMMITTEE CAN TAKE

20:37.700 --> 20:38.967
UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY FROM

20:38.967 --> 20:41.400
CORPORATE SPONSORS

20:41.400 --> 20:43.267
THE LAW WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN

20:43.267 --> 20:45.867
SO CORPORATIONS COULD NO

20:45.867 --> 20:48.167
ESSENTIALLY BUY POLITICA

20:48.500 --> 20:50.500

IT WON'T BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR

THEM TO RAISE THE MONEY TO MAK
