THEY ARE SEEING AN IMPACT

05:11.833 --> 05:13.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALREADY, BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT

05:13.667 --> 05:15.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOO EARLY TO SAY, IF THEY WILL

05:26.567 --> 05:27.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE NOT DETAINED, IS THERE A

05:27.867 --> 05:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POSSIBILITY THAT THEY DECIDE TO

ERDOGAN.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

MAYBE LONGER DEPENDING HOW IT

05:44.700 --> 05:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOES.

05:45.233 --> 05:47.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

DISMISSED.

05:56.267 --> 05:57.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS, I'D SAY A BROAD FEAR

05:57.967 --> 06:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT NOW ABOUT THIS CRACKDOWN,

06:05.767 --> 06:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ISN'T A LOT OF SPACE HERE,

06:07.533 --> 06:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WOULD SAY, FOR POLITICAL

06:10.233 --> 06:12.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPOSITION AGAINST PRESIDENT

06:12.367 --> 06:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

06:14.400 --> 06:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEFORE THE COUP, NOW THAT IT'S

06:16.333 --> 06:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN PUT DOWN IT'S GIVEN

06:18.733 --> 06:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

WANTS IN THIS COUNTRY WHICH IS

06:23.533 --> 06:27.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

RESOURCES UNDER HIS CONTROL.

06:30.333 --> 06:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS YOU MENTIONED AT THE

06:32.133 --> 06:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

IMPORTANT TO TRY TO PURGE OR TO

06:40.700 --> 06:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RETAIN UNDER HIS CONTROL?

06:41.800 --> 06:45.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION.

06:45.333 --> 06:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NOTION HERE BY THE

06:46.533 --> 06:47.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

06:58.667 --> 07:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, I GUESS THE SUSPICIONS WITH

07:00.433 --> 07:01.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MILITARY ACADEMY IS THAT

07:01.767 --> 07:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

FEEL LIKE THEY MUST WIPE THE

SLATE CLEAN AND START AGAIN.

07:16.033 --> 07:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
