04:15.588 --> 04:17.857 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT ERDOGAN HAS THEN USED

04:17.857 --> 04:19.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE POST-COUP POWERS, STATE OF

04:19.192 --> 04:21.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMERGENCY, GIVEN TO HIM TO GO

04:21.261 --> 04:22.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFTER HIS OTHER OPPONENTS.

04:22.862 --> 04:24.497 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TURKEY IS AN EXTREMELY POLARIZED

04:24.497 --> 04:26.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACE, WITH HALF OF THE COUNTRY

04:26.232 --> 04:28.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADORING ERDOGAN, AND THE OTHER

04:28.268 --> 04:29.269 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HALF OF THE COUNTRY THAT

04:29.269 --> 04:30.403 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASICALLY LOATHES HIM.

04:30.403 --> 04:31.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ERDOGAN HAS TARGETED

04:31.838 --> 04:33.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYONE IN THAT GROUP THAT

04:33.006 --> 04:33.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOATHES HIM.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT NOT ONLY INCLUDES MEMBERS

04:35.642 --> 04:36.843 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE GULEN MOVEMENT, WHO

04:36.843 --> 04:38.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ERDOGAN BELIEVES IS ALIGNED

04:38.444 --> 04:40.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THE COUP EFFORT, BUT ALSO

04:40.780 --> 04:42.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIBERALS, LEFTISTS AND KURDISH

04:42.148 --> 04:43.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATIONALISTS.

04:43.116 --> 04:43.783 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: ERDOGAN WILL

04:43.783 --> 04:44.851 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY, "LISTEN, I'M IN A... I'M

04:44.851 --> 04:45.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN A ROUGH NEIGHBORHOOD.

04:45.818 --> 04:47.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE PEOPLE ALL... IN PARTS

04:47.787 --> 04:49.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF MY COUNTRY THAT WANT TO SPLIT

04:49.422 --> 04:50.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFF AND BREAK OFF.

04:50.423 --> 04:51.658 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'VE HAD TERRORIST ATTACK

04:51.658 --> 04:53.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENING ON MY OWN SOIL.

04:53.159 --> 04:55.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I NEED THIS POWER, I NEED IT

04:55.128 --> 04:56.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSOLIDATED."

04:56.162 --> 04:57.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HE'S... THAT MESSAGE HAS

04:57.997 --> 04:59.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUNK IN WITH HIS SUPPORTERS.

04:59.899 --> 05:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT HAS.

05:00.533 --> 05:01.701 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND OF COURSE, ERDOGAN HAS A

05:01.701 --> 05:02.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRIGHT SIDE, AS WELL-- THAT HE

05:02.835 --> 05:04.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS DELIVERED ECONOMIC GROWTH,

05:04.203 --> 05:05.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH IS WHY THE CONSERVATIVES

05:05.872 --> 05:07.373 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE BANDED AROUND HIM.

05:07.373 --> 05:08.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT HE ALSO HAS A DARK SIDE,

05:08.441 --> 05:10.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH IS THAT HE HAS CRACKED

05:10.176 --> 05:12.578 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOWN ON OPPOSTION AND ERODED

05:12.578 --> 05:14.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRATIC CHECKS AND BALANCES.

05:14.580 --> 05:16.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PROBLEM IS, WHILE HALF OF

05:16.182 --> 05:17.383 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COUNTRY LOVES HIM, THE OTHER

05:17.383 --> 05:18.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HALF OF THE COUNTRY THAT

05:18.117 --> 05:19.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DESPISES HIM WILL NEVER FOLD

05:19.619 --> 05:20.286 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDER HIM.

05:20.286 --> 05:22.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE RISK FOR ERDOGAN IS THAT

05:22.121 --> 05:24.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE KNOWS, AS I EXPLAINED IN "THE

05:24.057 --> 05:25.692 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEW SULTAN," HE KNOWS THAT HE

05:25.692 --> 05:27.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CANNOT CONTINUE TO GOVERN TURKEY

05:27.226 --> 05:28.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WAY HE LIKES SO LONG AS IT'S

05:28.695 --> 05:29.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRATIC.

05:29.395 --> 05:30.763 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT IS WHY IT LOOKS TO ME

05:30.763 --> 05:31.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND TO OTHER ANALYSTS THAT HE'S

05:31.931 --> 05:33.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKING STEPS TO END DEMOCRACY IN

05:33.599 --> 05:34.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TURKEY.

05:34.367 --> 05:35.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR EXAMPLE, HE'S JUST SAID THAT

05:35.435 --> 05:36.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE STATE OF EMERGENCY PUT IN

05:36.803 --> 05:38.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACE AFTER THE COUP WILL BE

05:38.805 --> 05:40.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXTENDED INDEFINTELY UNTIL THERE

05:40.873 --> 05:42.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS PEACE AND WELFARE IN TURKEY.

05:42.875 --> 05:44.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW DO YOU MEASURE PEACE AND

05:44.110 --> 05:45.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELFARE?

05:45.011 --> 05:46.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THAT MEANS IT'S BASICALLY

05:46.112 --> 05:46.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERMANENT.

05:46.979 --> 05:48.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND FOR THE 40 MILLION TURKS WHO

05:48.381 --> 05:49.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPOSE HIM, THAT'S NOT

05:49.716 --> 05:50.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACCEPTABLE.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, I FEAR THAT IF HE ENDS

05:51.984 --> 05:53.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRACY, THERE'S DEFINITELY A

05:53.619 --> 05:55.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RISK FOR THAT HALF THAT OPPOSES

05:55.421 --> 05:57.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIM WHO WILL NOW THINK THAT THEY

05:57.390 --> 05:58.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CANNOT VOTE HIM OUT.

05:58.758 --> 06:00.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT SOME ELEMENTS OF THEM,

06:00.026 --> 06:01.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAYBE YOUTH ELEMENTS OF THEM,

06:01.194 --> 06:02.295 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIGHT EVEN RADICALIZE.

06:02.295 --> 06:04.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, TURKEY'S POLARIZATION COULD

06:04.063 --> 06:05.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN GET WORSE AS A RESULT OF

06:05.665 --> 06:06.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE POLICIES.

>> Sreenivasan: HOW MUCH OF

06:08.501 --> 06:11.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ERDOGAN'S POSITION IS BOLSTERED

06:11.037 --> 06:13.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BY THE CRUCIAL NATURE OF TURKEY

06:13.973 --> 06:16.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE FIGHTING IN SYRIA OR IN

06:16.142 --> 06:16.809 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MIDDLE EAST?

06:16.809 --> 06:18.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, IT SEEMS THAT THERE'S

06:18.244 --> 06:20.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME PRETTY HUGE ALLIES THAT ARE

06:20.646 --> 06:22.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTING ON TURKEY'S SUPPORT.

06:22.181 --> 06:23.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK ERDOGAN BASICALLY

06:23.316 --> 06:25.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOWS THAT THE UNITED STATES AND

06:25.385 --> 06:27.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATO ALLIES NEED TURKEY TO

06:27.120 --> 06:29.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTINUE TO FIGHT ISIS, AND HE

06:29.088 --> 06:30.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASICALLY GETS A HALL PASS IN

06:30.623 --> 06:31.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT REGARD.

06:31.557 --> 06:32.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DESPITE HIS DEMOCRATIC

06:32.759 --> 06:33.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRANSGRESSIONS, HE'S STILL

06:33.926 --> 06:35.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INVITED TO SUMMITS AND

06:35.361 --> 06:36.129 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEETINGS.

06:36.129 --> 06:38.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH TURKEY

06:38.231 --> 06:40.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN CONTINUE WITH THIS POLARIZED

ENVIRONMENT, EVEN THOUGH ERDOGAN

06:42.135 --> 06:44.370 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIGHT RECEIVE OPEN ARMS FROM

06:44.370 --> 06:46.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUTSIDE DIGNITARIES, BECAUSE OF

06:46.639 --> 06:48.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FACT THAT SOME OF THE

06:48.307 --> 06:50.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPOSITION GROUPS ARE VIOLENT

06:50.176 --> 06:51.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

CHALLENGE COMING FROM THE RIGHT.

06:57.950 --> 06:59.152 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

HISTORIC LINKS TO KURDISH GROUPS

07:04.924 --> 07:06.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
