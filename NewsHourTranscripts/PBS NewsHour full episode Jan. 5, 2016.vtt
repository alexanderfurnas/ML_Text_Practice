JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:07.975 --> 00:09.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:09.843 --> 00:15.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Every time I think about those
kids. it gets

00:15.182 --> 00:20.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me mad. And, by the way, it
happens on the
streets of Chicago everyday.

00:20.254 --> 00:25.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
makes an emotional
appeal for background checks and
outlines

00:25.826 --> 00:29.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other actions to curb gun
violence.

00:29.196 --> 00:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead this Tuesday: how New
Hampshire
is grappling with a heroin
epidemic.

00:33.533 --> 00:39.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TED GATSAS (R), Mayor of
Manchester, New Hampshire:
We need to do something about
it. If we don't,

00:39.039 --> 00:42.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're not going to have to worry
about building
more beds to try and treat
people. We're going

00:42.910 --> 00:44.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to have to start building more
coffins.

00:44.711 --> 00:50.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And photographer
and MacArthur
grant winner LaToya Ruby Frazier
on why she

00:50.584 --> 00:52.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
documents her struggling
hometown.

00:52.686 --> 00:56.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER,
Photographer: I'm not
saying that it's a dying town.
I'm saying

00:56.156 --> 01:02.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we survived. Like, look at
all of the
damage, all the abuse we have
endured, and

01:02.629 --> 01:05.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we're still steadfast and
existing.

01:05.866 --> 01:09.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:09.937 --> 01:14.207 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:14.241 --> 01:27.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president was
by turns
tearful and tough today, as he
pushed a plan

01:27.454 --> 01:33.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to regulate more gun sales. He
said he's targeting
transactions at shows and flea
markets because

01:33.794 --> 01:36.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Congress is afraid to cross the
gun lobby.

01:36.663 --> 01:41.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The National Rifle Association
answered that
the proposals are -- quote --
"ripe for abuse."

01:41.635 --> 01:45.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will have the story in full
after the news
summary.

01:45.539 --> 01:50.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news, an
American soldier
died in a firefight in Southern
Afghanistan.

01:50.577 --> 01:55.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two other U.S. service members
were wounded,
along with several Afghan
soldiers. Pentagon

01:55.983 --> 02:00.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officials said it happened in
Helmand Province,
and the fighting continued for
hours.

02:00.520 --> 02:03.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER COOK, Pentagon Press
Secretary: There
is fighting on the ground as we
speak, which

02:03.457 --> 02:07.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is why it's hard for us to have
every single
detail as to what's transpired,
and there's

02:08.028 --> 02:14.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been an effort once again, as I
mentioned
before, to make sure that
everything's being

02:14.601 --> 02:19.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
done to secure the safety of
those Americans
and the Afghan forces that
they're accompanying

02:19.940 --> 02:22.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in this particular situation in
Helmand.

02:22.275 --> 02:26.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: U.S. special
operations forces
have been working with Afghan
troops in Helmand

02:26.947 --> 02:31.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in recent weeks to repel new
Taliban attacks.

02:31.251 --> 02:37.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fighting in Yemen returned to
full pitch today,
just days after a shaky truce
ended. Shiite

02:37.591 --> 02:43.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rebels blasted the city of Marib
with a rocket
barrage, while Saudi Arabia
launched new airstrikes

02:44.031 --> 02:50.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a series of cities, including
Sanaa. Residents
of the capital surveyed the
damage today.

02:50.604 --> 02:55.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some accused the Saudis of
hitting civilian
targets, including a health
center for the

02:55.509 --> 02:59.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
blind, but there were no
casualties.

02:59.746 --> 03:04.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Turkey, an all-too-familiar
scene today,
as the bodies of dozens more
migrants washed

03:04.851 --> 03:11.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up on shore. Authorities say at
least 36 people
drowned when their boats
capsized in the Aegean

03:11.058 --> 03:17.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sea trying to reach Greece.
Turkish crews
found the victims strewn along
beaches. They

03:17.497 --> 03:23.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also managed to rescue at least
12 others
from the choppy waters, but a
mass migration

03:23.270 --> 03:26.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agency said the danger has not
deterred people.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOEL MILLMAN, International
Organization for
Migration: Migrants and refugees
continue

03:28.275 --> 03:33.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to enter Greece at a rate of
over 2,500 a
day from Turkey, which is very
close to the

03:33.947 --> 03:40.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average through December, so we
see the migrant
flows are continuing through the
winter, and,

03:40.120 --> 03:43.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
obviously, the fatalities are
continuing as
well.

03:43.390 --> 03:49.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last year, nearly
3,800 migrants
died trying to reach Europe by
sea.

03:49.930 --> 03:54.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, the gun
control debate
dominated presidential politics
today, with

03:54.668 --> 04:00.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one exception. Democratic
hopeful Bernie Sanders
went after Wall Street, calling
it an industry

04:00.407 --> 04:06.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fueled by greed, fraud and
arrogance. He told
a crowd in New York that he'd
break up the

04:06.279 --> 04:09.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nation's big banks in his first
year in office.

04:09.816 --> 04:16.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The armed men occupying a
national wildlife
refuge in Oregon now say that
they will stay

04:16.223 --> 04:21.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
until federal officials let
locals manage
the land. They made that demand
today at the

04:21.828 --> 04:27.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
site they have occupied since
Saturday night.
Their leader also dismissed a
sheriff's appeal

04:27.567 --> 04:31.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they go home. He said local
people welcome
their presence.

04:31.204 --> 04:37.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMMON BUNDY, Armed Protester: We
also appreciate
the advice that the community
members have

04:37.811 --> 04:45.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
given us about how to reach out
and how to
share our message, so that other
community

04:45.418 --> 04:52.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
members will know that we are
not about fear.
We're not about force. We're not
about intimidation.

04:52.092 --> 04:58.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So far, federal
agents have
made no move to physically force
the group

04:58.165 --> 04:59.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to leave.

04:59.966 --> 05:05.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2015, it turns out, was a banner
year for
U.S. automakers, the best ever,
in fact. Industry

05:05.839 --> 05:11.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officials projected today that
nearly 17.5
million vehicles were sold
through December.

05:11.645 --> 05:17.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That tops the old record set in
2000. General
Motors led the pack with more
than three million

05:17.851 --> 05:20.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cars and trucks sold.

05:20.520 --> 05:25.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The stock market struggled to
make any headway
today, after Monday's big
losses. The Dow

05:25.458 --> 05:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jones industrial average gained
nine points
to close at 17158. The Nasdaq
rose 11 points,

05:32.999 --> 05:36.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the S&amp;P 500 added four.

05:36.336 --> 05:42.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And West Point now has its first
female commandant
of cadets. Brigadier General
Diana Holland

05:42.542 --> 05:48.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was sworn in today at the United
States Military
Academy. She's a West Point
graduate herself

05:48.448 --> 05:53.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a veteran of the Iraq and
Afghanistan
wars. Holland's appointment
comes one month

05:53.787 --> 05:59.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after the military opened all
combat roles
to women, and 40 years since
West Point admitted

05:59.593 --> 06:02.028 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
women as cadets.

06:02.062 --> 06:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the president's
order on guns, too far or not
far enough?;

06:07.234 --> 06:13.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a view from Tehran as tensions
with Saudi
Arabia escalate; tracing
Benjamin Netanyahu's

06:13.807 --> 06:23.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
path to power; what can be done
to loosen
heroin's grip on New Hampshire;
and much more.

06:23.850 --> 06:31.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
path to power; what can be done
to loosen
heroin's grip on New Hampshire;
and much more.

06:31.491 --> 06:36.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president delivered a
lengthy, emotional
speech as he unveiled new steps
today to reduce

06:36.696 --> 06:38.565 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gun violence.

06:38.598 --> 06:42.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans quickly denounced
many of his
remarks, and others wondered
just how much

06:42.902 --> 06:49.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
impact his changes could have in
a country
where Americans own an estimated
300 million

06:49.376 --> 06:51.177 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
guns.

06:51.211 --> 06:55.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Victims' families hailed many of
the measures,
and the president argued that --
quote -- "We

06:55.248 --> 06:58.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
maybe cannot save everybody, but
we could
save some."

06:58.952 --> 07:09.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Fort Hood. Binghamton. Aurora.
Oak Creek.

07:09.529 --> 07:19.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Newtown. The Navy Yard. Santa
Barbara. Charleston.
San Bernardino. Too many.

07:19.372 --> 07:26.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: With that litany
of mass shootings,
President Obama announced his
decision to

07:26.279 --> 07:27.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
use executive action.

07:28.014 --> 07:36.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: People are dying.
And the constant
excuses for inaction no longer
suffice.

07:36.389 --> 07:42.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why we're here today, not
to debate
the last mass shooting, but to
do something

07:42.228 --> 07:43.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to try to prevent the next one.

07:43.997 --> 07:49.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The audience was
filled with
victims of gun violence,
including former

07:49.369 --> 07:55.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Arizona Congresswoman Gabby
Giffords, who
received a standing ovation when
she arrived.

07:55.842 --> 08:01.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Standing behind the president
were other survivors
and family members of people
killed by guns

08:01.848 --> 08:08.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the past 20 years. They
included parents
of some of the 26 slain at Sandy
Hook Elementary

08:08.922 --> 08:13.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
School in Newtown, Connecticut,
in 2012.

08:13.159 --> 08:19.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president was moved to tears
over the
20 children who died there.

08:19.199 --> 08:29.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: First-graders, and
from every
family who never imagined that
their loved

08:29.642 --> 08:39.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one would be taken from our
lives by a bullet
from a gun.

08:39.686 --> 08:48.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one would be taken from our
lives by a bullet
from a gun.

08:48.261 --> 08:56.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every time I think about those
kids, it gets
me mad. And, by the way, it
happens on the

08:56.136 --> 08:57.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
streets of Chicago every day.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.606 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

08:59.639 --> 09:04.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: After Newtown,
Mr. Obama tried
to get Congress to pass
comprehensive background

09:04.277 --> 09:09.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
checks for gun buyers, but he
failed. Today,
he declared it can't end there.

09:09.849 --> 09:13.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: So, the gun lobby
may be holding
Congress hostage right now, but
they cannot

09:13.420 --> 09:14.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hold America hostage.

09:14.354 --> 09:15.855 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

09:15.889 --> 09:19.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: We do not have to
accept this
carnage as the price of freedom.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.894 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

09:20.927 --> 09:25.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now he's using
presidential
powers for a limited effort to
expand private

09:25.265 --> 09:28.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gun sales subject to background
checks.

09:28.601 --> 09:34.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To do that, the government will
widen the
definition of gun dealers and
sellers to include

09:34.407 --> 09:43.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gun shows, Web sites and flea
markets. And
the FBI will hire 230 background
check processors

09:43.650 --> 09:45.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to help strengthen enforcement.

09:45.819 --> 09:52.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A recent Harvard study found
that up to 40
percent of guns purchased in the
U.S. don't

09:52.292 --> 09:55.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
go through any background checks
at all.

09:55.495 --> 10:01.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Separately, Mr. Obama called
today for more
research into technologies to
keep guns safe.

10:01.568 --> 10:06.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: If we can set it
up so you can't
unlock your phone unless you've
got the right

10:07.006 --> 10:11.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fingerprint, why can't we do the
same thing
for our guns?

10:11.411 --> 10:13.179 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

10:13.213 --> 10:19.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: If a child can't
open a bottle
of aspirin, we should make sure
that they

10:19.786 --> 10:21.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
can't pull a trigger on a gun.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

10:22.489 --> 10:24.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BARACK OBAMA: Right?

10:24.324 --> 10:29.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the
presidential campaign
trail, Republican candidates
roundly rejected

10:29.829 --> 10:31.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
President Obama's actions.

10:32.031 --> 10:33.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Ted Cruz was in Iowa.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
I can tell you right now those
executive orders

10:36.302 --> 10:40.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are not worth the paper they are
printed on,
because, when you live by the
pen, you die

10:40.974 --> 10:44.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by the pen, and my pen has got
an eraser.

10:44.577 --> 10:47.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Jeb Bush
spoke in New Hampshire.

10:47.547 --> 10:50.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEB BUSH (R), Presidential
Candidate: It's
not going to solve any problems
by having

10:50.116 --> 10:55.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the so-called gun show loophole
be taken -- taken
care of by executive order. The
president

10:55.788 --> 10:59.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doesn't have authority to do it.
If there
is an issue related to federal
gun laws, then

10:59.692 --> 11:02.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he ought to go to Congress and
try to forge
consensus to make it happen. He
doesn't have

11:03.029 --> 11:04.797 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this power.

11:04.831 --> 11:08.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president had
anticipated
some of the reaction, insisting
he's within

11:08.601 --> 11:13.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his authority and that he's
upholding the
Second Amendment's right to bear
arms.

11:13.606 --> 11:23.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Contrary to the
claims of what
some gun rights proponents have
suggested,

11:23.917 --> 11:31.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this hasn't been the first step
in some slippery
slope to mass confiscation.
Contrary to claims

11:31.090 --> 11:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of some presidential candidates,
apparently,
before this meeting, this is not
a plot to

11:40.934 --> 11:42.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
take away everybody's guns.

11:42.735 --> 11:47.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still, the
president may need
additional funding from Congress
for mental

11:47.440 --> 11:54.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health care and extra FBI
workers, money the
Republican-controlled Congress
is unlikely

11:54.280 --> 11:56.115 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to approve.

11:56.149 --> 12:02.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Speaker of the House Paul Ryan
made that clear
today in a statement that said
-- quote -- "His

12:02.121 --> 12:06.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
words and actions amount to a
form of intimidation
that undermines liberty."

12:06.893 --> 12:14.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, gun sales are
soaring. More guns
were sold in December, after the
attacks in

12:14.133 --> 12:20.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
San Bernardino, California, than
almost any
month in the last 20 years.

12:20.873 --> 12:25.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's look at both the symbol
and substance
of what the president announced
today and

12:25.445 --> 12:27.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what its impact is likely to be.

12:27.880 --> 12:33.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Feinblatt is the president
of Everytown
for Gun Safety, which was
created after the

12:33.186 --> 12:39.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Newtown shootings and supported
in part by
former New York City Mayor
Michael Bloomberg.

12:39.058 --> 12:44.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And David Kopel, he is research
director at
The Independence Institute. It's
a libertarian

12:44.664 --> 12:50.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think tank. And he's well --
also an adjunct
professor of constitutional law
at the University

12:50.269 --> 12:51.738 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Denver.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we welcome both of you.

12:53.640 --> 12:58.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Feinblatt, is the president
on the right
track with these moves that he
says are going

12:58.578 --> 13:00.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to reduce the number of gun
deaths?

13:00.346 --> 13:02.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINBLATT, Everytown for
Gun Safety:
Yes, I think what the president
did today

13:02.248 --> 13:04.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was pretty straightforward.

13:04.384 --> 13:10.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What he did was took some
actions to enforce
laws already on the books. One
was, he clarified

13:10.890 --> 13:15.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the law, that, if you're in the
business of
selling guns, you need to get a
license and

13:15.128 --> 13:16.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
do a background check.

13:16.896 --> 13:20.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the second is, he said that
he was going
to devote the resources to
enforce it. And

13:21.000 --> 13:26.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that, when you combine
clarifying
the law with additional
enforcement resources,

13:26.673 --> 13:32.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what you're going to do is
interrupt some
commercial sellers who are
actually taking

13:32.178 --> 13:37.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
advantage of loopholes in the
laws, not getting
a license, and selling without
background

13:37.116 --> 13:38.484 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
checks.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Kopel, do
you -- excuse
me for interrupting.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Kopel, do you agree the
president is
generally on the right track
with this?

13:42.588 --> 13:45.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID KOPEL, The Independence
Institute: Well,
I agree with most of what Mr.
Feinblatt just

13:45.858 --> 13:49.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said, because the president
didn't do anything
at all that changes the law.

13:50.029 --> 13:56.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He just very forcefully and
passionately restated
what has been the law since
1968, which is,

13:56.402 --> 14:00.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you are engaged in the
business, as the
statute says, of selling
firearms, then you

14:00.907 --> 14:06.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to have a federal firearms
license. And
of course he's correct that that
mandate is

14:06.646 --> 14:11.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the same whether you sell in
your basement
or at a gun store or on the
Internet or at

14:11.617 --> 14:13.419 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a gun show.

14:13.453 --> 14:17.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's always been like that.
So, he restated
it. He didn't change anything,
but I think

14:17.990 --> 14:21.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's fine to remind people who
might not know
about that requirement that it
exists.

14:21.761 --> 14:25.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, John
Feinblatt, it's really
not that much of a change? It's
just a matter

14:25.198 --> 14:26.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of enforcing what was already
there?

14:26.999 --> 14:31.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINBLATT: Look, the law
has been blurry.
It's always -- the law has been,
if you're

14:31.037 --> 14:34.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
engaged in the business of
selling guns, you
need to get a license and do
background checks.

14:34.807 --> 14:38.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the problem was that there
was never any
meat on the bone. So, people
didn't know what

14:38.945 --> 14:42.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
engaged in the business actually
meant. And
so what the president did today,
which was

14:43.015 --> 14:49.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very significant, was, he
actually indicated
what would be the criteria to
know whether

14:49.088 --> 14:50.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you were engaged in business.

14:50.089 --> 14:51.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What are some of
those criteria?

14:51.858 --> 14:56.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINBLATT: So, did you buy
a gun and
recently resell it? And, so,
clearly, you're

14:56.262 --> 15:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in it for commerce. It's not
part of your
own collection? It is new in the
box with

15:00.733 --> 15:04.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
price tags already on it?

15:04.036 --> 15:08.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are you -- do you have business
cards printed
that actually show that you're
repeatedly

15:08.307 --> 15:14.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
selling guns? Are you showing up
at gun shows
month after month? Things like
that. They're

15:14.480 --> 15:18.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
commonsense, but they are very
important,
because what they're offering is
guidance

15:18.618 --> 15:23.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to both law enforcement and to
people who
are selling guns about who needs
to get a

15:23.356 --> 15:25.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
license and who doesn't.

15:25.191 --> 15:31.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then by saying that he would
put enforcement
might behind it, what I think
will happen

15:32.031 --> 15:37.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that you will see dealers
becoming licensed,
doing background checks, where,
heretofore,

15:37.937 --> 15:39.739 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they hadn't.

15:39.772 --> 15:43.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, David Kopel,
just spelling
out some of these specifics
could lead to

15:43.242 --> 15:45.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a reduction in gun deaths?

15:45.111 --> 15:48.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID KOPEL: Well, it will lead
to the public
being better informed.

15:48.381 --> 15:54.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I read the guidance document
that the ATF
published today. And it was
fine. It adhered

15:54.353 --> 15:59.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very closely to the statutory
definition enacted
by Congress and then provided
some examples.

15:59.826 --> 16:04.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And part of what it did was
based on court
cases interpreting the statute.

16:04.263 --> 16:10.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that's good. And I think it
will lead
to more people getting federal
firearms licenses,

16:10.069 --> 16:14.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is necessary to be engaged
in the business
of selling guns, because what
the president

16:14.240 --> 16:19.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is doing is implicitly reversing
a Clinton
era policy, which was to revoke
dealers' licenses

16:19.946 --> 16:24.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because, supposedly, they
weren't selling
enough guns to count as being
engaged in the

16:24.851 --> 16:26.619 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
business.

16:26.652 --> 16:30.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, 200,000 people lost their
firearms licenses
under the Clinton administration
program,

16:30.923 --> 16:35.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so, hopefully, this is a step to
restore those
licenses that probably never
should have been

16:35.895 --> 16:37.630 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
taken away.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Kopel, what
about some
of the other things the
president is talking

16:39.732 --> 16:46.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about, spending more money on
mental health,
making mental health treatment
more available,

16:46.472 --> 16:51.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spending money to advance
research to make
guns safer in the hands of
children? What

16:51.711 --> 16:53.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about those things? Will those
make a difference?

16:53.713 --> 16:58.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID KOPEL: Oh, the mental
health is really
important, and we, as a country,
tend to only

16:58.251 --> 17:03.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
focus on it when there's these
notorious crimes
committed by a severely mentally
ill person.

17:03.689 --> 17:09.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But just on a day-to-day basis,
one out of
five prisoners in state prisons
for homicide

17:09.362 --> 17:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is seriously mentally ill. And,
of course,
people with mental illness are
victimized

17:14.233 --> 17:18.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by violent crime at a much
higher rate than
the general population.

17:18.404 --> 17:23.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I applaud the president for
putting resources
towards that, and that's
something we ought

17:23.643 --> 17:28.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be working on constantly. And
both sides
of the gun debate ought to be
able to come

17:28.281 --> 17:33.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
together to support helping
mentally ill people,
not stigmatizing them, not
having punitive

17:33.552 --> 17:37.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
harsh laws against people, but
just giving
people treatment resources.

17:37.657 --> 17:41.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Feinblatt,
given the fact
that, I mean, just at least the
two of you

17:41.460 --> 17:46.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agree, coming from somewhat
different places
on this, how do you explain the
very vocal

17:46.332 --> 17:47.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
opposition out there?

17:47.500 --> 17:49.235 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

17:49.268 --> 17:50.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINBLATT: Well, it's
interesting, because
it's not just me and David. It's
actually

17:50.303 --> 17:52.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
90 percent of Americans.

17:52.238 --> 17:56.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, 90 percent of Americans
believe in universal
background checks. Gun owners
believe in it.

17:56.642 --> 18:02.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even NRA members, 74 percent of
NRA members
do. And so this is what the
American public

18:02.815 --> 18:05.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
actually wants. And the
president is taking
steps to do it.

18:05.685 --> 18:11.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, for years, we have
heard these issues
that, if the president acts,
he's going to

18:11.090 --> 18:15.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take people's guns away, he's
confiscating
guns, it's a slippery slope. And
I think David

18:15.361 --> 18:19.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I agree that background
checks can save
lives. Americans believe in it.

18:19.765 --> 18:24.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all the president is really
doing today
is enforcing the laws already on
the books,

18:24.603 --> 18:30.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is what people who oppose
any efforts
at gun safety always say: Why
don't you just

18:30.076 --> 18:31.877 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
enforce the laws on the books?

18:31.911 --> 18:35.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's surprising to hear that
today, when,
in fact, what the president has
done is exactly

18:35.848 --> 18:37.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what people have called for.

18:37.583 --> 18:40.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, David Kopel,
though, is
there more the president -- is
there more

18:40.786 --> 18:46.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- what more could -- let me put
it this way.
What more could Congress do to
make it harder

18:47.026 --> 18:50.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a gun to be in the hands of
someone who
is going to commit a terrible
crime?

18:50.629 --> 18:57.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID KOPEL: Well, I think as
Mr. Feinblatt
said, enforcing existing laws.

18:57.336 --> 19:01.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The -- we have cases where
people have been
straw purchasers. That's
somebody where you're

19:01.907 --> 19:07.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a legal buyer, but you're buying
on behalf
of someone else, so that they
can avoid the

19:07.113 --> 19:12.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
background check and get the
gun. And that's
a very common way that criminals
get guns.

19:12.651 --> 19:15.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the background check system
can't stop
that.

19:15.755 --> 19:21.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Obama administration's
prosecution
of straw purchase cases has been
very lax,

19:21.694 --> 19:24.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
especially compared to the
previous administration.

19:24.063 --> 19:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINBLATT: So, the most
important thing
that you can do is pass
universal background

19:27.833 --> 19:29.035 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
checks.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Eighteen states have passed
universal background
checks.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which the U.S.
doesn't have.
We don't have that now.

19:31.937 --> 19:33.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN FEINBLATT: Which the U.S.
doesn't have.

19:33.739 --> 19:37.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we're going -- we're moving
state by state.
And in the past year or two, you
have seen

19:37.910 --> 19:43.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Oregon, Colorado, Washington
state, in two
cases by the legislature, in one
case by ballot.

19:43.682 --> 19:49.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you look at the states
that have passed
universal background checks, 48
percent fewer

19:49.155 --> 19:54.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
homicides of cops, 48 percent
fewer domestic
homicides with guns, almost half
the amount

19:54.727 --> 19:56.429 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of trafficking.

19:56.462 --> 19:59.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Background checks work. And it's
important
to know that that's the step
that we have

19:59.932 --> 20:03.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do. That's the final step
here. It's the
major step.

20:03.302 --> 20:07.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, David Kopel,
that's not
what the president has done so
far. It's not

20:07.506 --> 20:14.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what he's doing today. Would
that make a huge
difference in unnecessary gun
deaths, universal

20:14.847 --> 20:16.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
background checks?

20:16.715 --> 20:19.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID KOPEL: Well, we have one
of these Bloomberg
laws that was passed in
Colorado. And I'm

20:19.985 --> 20:24.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
currently representing most of
the state sheriffs
in federal court in a lawsuit
against it because

20:24.623 --> 20:26.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's so badly structured.

20:26.492 --> 20:31.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It makes it very difficult for
people to teach
gun safety classes. For example,
the Washington

20:31.597 --> 20:38.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
analogue, it's illegal if you're
a gun safety
instructor to hand a gun to a
student empty,

20:38.304 --> 20:42.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unloaded, and show the student
how to handle
it. Those are -- these are
ridiculous laws.

20:42.475 --> 20:44.376 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're not universal background
checks.

20:44.410 --> 20:49.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Colorado law was so badly
structured that
it actually reduced the number
of people getting

20:49.415 --> 20:53.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
background checks because it
made them so
difficult to obtain. So,
whatever polls say

20:53.686 --> 20:59.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the theory of background
checks, the
practice and the laws pushed by
Everytown

20:59.425 --> 21:05.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been terrible and highly
destructive to
the shooting sports and
responsible gun use.

21:05.131 --> 21:08.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just quickly, so
it sounds
like, once one gets beyond what
the president

21:08.901 --> 21:10.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
suggested today, you do see
opposition?

21:10.736 --> 21:14.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINBLATT: You see it, but
you see it
-- certainly, David objects it
to, but every

21:15.007 --> 21:18.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
poll would show that 90 percent
of Americans
believe in universal background
checks, whether

21:18.777 --> 21:22.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're a gun owner, whether
you're not a gun
owner, whether you live in a
rural community

21:22.548 --> 21:24.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or an urban community.

21:24.517 --> 21:28.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's what the American public
wants. It's
what the people of Washington
state voted

21:28.154 --> 21:32.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for on their own at the ballot,
and it's what
state legislatures are passing.

21:32.091 --> 21:36.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and, today,
we're looking
at what the president did
through his executive

21:36.629 --> 21:37.363 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
actions.

21:37.396 --> 21:38.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINBLATT: That's correct.

21:38.731 --> 21:40.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Feinblatt,
David Kopel,
we thank you both.

21:40.900 --> 21:46.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID KOPEL: Thank you.

21:46.071 --> 21:51.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINBLATT: Thank you.

21:51.210 --> 21:59.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The tensions
between Saudi
Arabia and Iran continued to
echo throughout

21:59.485 --> 22:05.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Persian Gulf today, as
Kuwait became the
latest Sunni nation to pull its
ambassador

22:05.291 --> 22:09.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from Tehran, though it didn't
fully cut off
diplomatic ties.

22:09.929 --> 22:12.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But how is this crisis seen from
Iran?

22:12.932 --> 22:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We go to William Brangham for
that.

22:14.767 --> 22:18.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For more on
the story, I'm
now joined on the phone by
Thomas Erdbrink,

22:18.204 --> 22:20.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who is the New York Times bureau
chief in
Tehran.

22:20.906 --> 22:26.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, Thomas, Saudi Arabia
executes this Shiite
cleric, Nimr al-Nimr. Protests
in Iran against

22:26.745 --> 22:31.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Saudis get out of hand, and
the Saudi
Embassy in Iran is destroyed.
You reported

22:31.083 --> 22:35.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this morning that the government
likely instigated
those initial protests, but did
they want

22:35.254 --> 22:37.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it to get as far out of hand as
it did?

22:37.423 --> 22:42.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS ERDBRINK, The New York
Times: Just
today, one of the heads of the
Iranian Revolutionary

22:42.394 --> 22:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Guard Corps told to the Fars
News Agency that
what happened at the embassy was
completely

22:47.900 --> 22:56.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unjustifiable, it should have
never have happened,
and he was sure that his troops
were not involved.

22:56.075 --> 23:00.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have been hearing similar
comments
from other people in the Iranian
establishment,

23:00.346 --> 23:06.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is clearly a sign that
either they feel
the protests have gone too far
or, of course,

23:06.752 --> 23:13.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have been shocked by the
level of blowback
from Saudi Arabia, and are now
trying to do

23:13.659 --> 23:15.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some damage control.

23:15.594 --> 23:19.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The focus completely shifted
toward them because
of their own actions. And this
is what actually

23:19.898 --> 23:23.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Iranian officials are
telling me off the
record: Look, we don't like to
admit it, but

23:23.669 --> 23:26.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we shoved ourselves to the front
by doing
this.

23:26.605 --> 23:30.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You report
that this crisis
comes at a time when Iran was
really hoping

23:30.709 --> 23:34.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to emerge as a growing power in
the Middle
East. They just signed a nuclear
deal. Sanctions

23:34.980 --> 23:38.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were soon to be eased. President
Rouhani was
hoping to be celebrating, not be
dealing with

23:38.951 --> 23:40.286 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

23:40.319 --> 23:42.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what does this mean for him
and for other
reformers in Iran?

23:42.521 --> 23:47.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS ERDBRINK: Well, of
course, Mr. Rouhani
came to power with the promise
of mending

23:47.860 --> 23:49.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
relations with other countries.

23:49.695 --> 23:55.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The historic nuclear deal was a
clear example
of his administration going out,
negotiating

23:55.467 --> 24:01.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for two -- for two full years,
and then getting
Iran a deal that its supreme
leader, Ayatollah

24:01.040 --> 24:03.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Khamenei, could sign off on. So,
that, by
itself, was a major boost for
President Rouhani.

24:03.208 --> 24:12.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, of course, now, in a time
that he was
hoping to see the result of
those negotiations,

24:12.618 --> 24:21.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and sanctions are about to be
lifted in the
coming days or weeks, he is
faced with the

24:21.660 --> 24:24.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
remains of the Saudi Arabian
Embassy.

24:24.530 --> 24:31.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And several countries, Bahrain,
the United
Arab Emirates and two other
nations have either

24:31.303 --> 24:37.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
completely disconnected their
diplomatic relations
with Iran or have at least
seriously downgraded

24:37.242 --> 24:39.044 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

24:39.078 --> 24:45.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for President Rouhani, this
is a setback.
At the same time, he is trying
literally to

24:45.851 --> 24:51.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come out with a more positive
spin on this.
He's been condemning, like many
other officials,

24:51.590 --> 24:55.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what happened at the embassy.
And, of course,
the Iranians are hoping that, in
the long

24:56.028 --> 25:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
run, it will be, in the end,
Saudi Arabia
that will come out as the bad
guy, if you

25:01.367 --> 25:03.135 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will, out of this.

25:03.168 --> 25:05.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let's look a
little bit
more broadly in the region. Does
this jeopardize

25:05.904 --> 25:09.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the larger diplomatic
initiatives that Iran
was involved in, the talks about
ending the

25:09.908 --> 25:14.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Syrian civil war and the
fighting in Yemen?
What does this crisis do to
those efforts?

25:14.680 --> 25:16.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THOMAS ERDBRINK: Well, it's
absolutely a major
obstacle.

25:16.982 --> 25:23.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And let's face it. Iran is a
player in those
two theaters that you mentioned.
It allegedly

25:23.622 --> 25:30.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supports the Houthi rebels in
Yemen. And,
of course, it supports President
Bashar al-Assad

25:30.763 --> 25:32.531 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Syria.

25:32.564 --> 25:38.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Iran has just, through
negotiations, gotten
so far that it was invited in
these major

25:38.637 --> 25:43.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talks that we're seeing every
couple months
on Saudi Arabia. The next one is
about the

25:43.742 --> 25:49.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take place on January 25. But
now the whole
debate has shifted towards the
relationship

25:49.281 --> 25:54.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between Iran and Saudi Arabia,
instead of
solving the crisis inside Syria.

25:54.052 --> 26:00.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if that meeting will still
happen on the
25th, will the -- will Saudi
Arabia allow

26:00.592 --> 26:06.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it? Will Iran go along as it is
now? Because
we don't know how this will spin
out of control.

26:06.165 --> 26:10.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So all and all, this is a major
obstacle to
peace in Syria and Yemen.

26:10.636 --> 26:14.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Again, does
this indicate
that the Saudis intentionally
killed Nimr

26:14.606 --> 26:18.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now to incite this very reaction
and set back
the talks because they didn't
like the way

26:18.610 --> 26:19.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they were heading?

26:19.445 --> 26:21.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
THOMAS ERDBRINK: Well,
absolutely.

26:21.313 --> 26:25.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what the Iranians will
also tell you.
They feel as if a trap was laid
out for them,

26:25.284 --> 26:28.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they sort of stepped in it
with their
eyes closed.

26:28.987 --> 26:34.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The view of the Iranians is that
Saudi Arabia
has always been their regional
competitor.

26:34.760 --> 26:41.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, whenever there is a conflict
involving
a Shia minority, or, for
instance, the execution

26:41.800 --> 26:47.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this Shia ayatollah in Saudi
Arabia, the
Iranians feel as if the Saudis
are actually

26:47.906 --> 26:49.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
trying to hurt them.

26:49.441 --> 26:53.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Thomas
Erdbrink of The New
York Times, thank you very much.

THOMAS ERDBRINK: Thank you.

27:01.220 --> 27:09.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One additional
fallout from
the U.S.-led nuclear deal with
Iran, the growing

27:09.828 --> 27:13.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rift with longtime ally Israel.

27:13.098 --> 27:18.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight's "Frontline" explores
the rise to
power of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.

27:18.470 --> 27:24.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Back in 2013, the Obama
administration held
secret talks with Tehran. Israel
wasn't happy

27:24.610 --> 27:31.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be left in the dark.

27:31.183 --> 27:37.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Just as outlines of a
secret deal
became public, Secretary of
State John Kerry

27:37.256 --> 27:46.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made a stopover in Israel.
Netanyahu rushed
to Ben-Gurion Airport for a
face-to-face meeting

27:46.732 --> 27:48.467 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Kerry.

27:48.500 --> 27:54.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TZACHI HANEGBI, Netanyahu
Adviser: We felt
it's ridiculous, unjustified,
immoral. It

27:54.306 --> 28:00.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will be more of the same and
worse than the
same.

28:00.212 --> 28:07.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: While Kerry waited in
the first-class
lounge, Netanyahu stopped for a
word with

28:07.386 --> 28:09.187 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the press.

28:09.221 --> 28:11.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, Israeli
Prime Minister:
I understand the Iranians are
walking around

28:11.089 --> 28:15.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very satisfied, as well they
should be, because
they got everything and paid
nothing. This

28:15.627 --> 28:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a very bad deal. And Israel
utterly rejects
it.

28:21.533 --> 28:25.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: Then Netanyahu headed
for Kerry.
He didn't hold back.

28:25.971 --> 28:28.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN INDYK, Former U.S. Envoy
to Middle
East: It was just Kerry and
Netanyahu, but

28:28.807 --> 28:33.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was outside the room. And I
could hear it.
I could hear it. That's for
sure.

28:33.745 --> 28:40.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had a really strong sense of
betrayal.
He was furious. When Bibi gets
upset, he starts

28:40.652 --> 28:48.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
screaming and pounding the
table. And so it
was one of those moments.

28:48.594 --> 28:55.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: But he wasn't done.
Before leaving,
Netanyahu went before the
cameras one more

28:55.867 --> 28:57.636 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

28:57.669 --> 29:02.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: This is a
bad deal, a
very, very bad deal. It's the
deal of the

29:02.941 --> 29:09.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
century for Iran. It's a very
dangerous and
bad deal for peace and the
international community.

29:10.015 --> 29:15.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Later that day,
Netanyahu summoned
Obama's former adviser Dennis
Ross.

29:15.587 --> 29:19.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENNIS ROSS, Former U.S. Envoy
to Middle East:
Bibi asked me to come and see
him on Friday

29:19.891 --> 29:23.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
evening at his -- at the prime
minister's
residence.

29:23.795 --> 29:31.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's Shibadi (ph) and me.
And I get there,
and I have to wait about close
to an hour

29:31.937 --> 29:34.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because he's on the phone with
the president.

29:34.306 --> 29:39.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: In an emergency phone
call from
Air Force One, Obama tried to
calm Netanyahu

29:39.444 --> 29:46.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down and persuade him that a
deal with Iran
would make Israel safer. But it
didn't work.

29:46.318 --> 29:52.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENNIS ROSS: As many times as I
have dealt
with Bibi, I had never seen him
this way.

29:52.057 --> 30:00.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wasn't angry, but he was --
the only way
I can put it is that he was
feeling alarmed,

30:00.132 --> 30:04.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not angry, but alarmed.

30:04.870 --> 30:09.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the first thing he says to
me is, "The
president decided he has no
choice but to

30:09.941 --> 30:12.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do a deal with the Iranians.
Force is off
the table."

30:12.577 --> 30:19.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I said, "He didn't say that
to you."

30:19.518 --> 30:20.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He said, "He did."

30:20.385 --> 30:22.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I said, "No, he didn't say that
to you."

30:22.120 --> 30:23.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He said, "He did."

30:23.789 --> 30:27.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Netanyahu believes the
Iranians
would only respond to the threat
of force.

30:27.459 --> 30:33.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To him, if that wasn't an
option, Obama was
surrendering to the Iranians.

30:33.298 --> 30:39.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Watch the entire
film, "Netanyahu
at War," tonight on "Frontline."
Check your

30:39.705 --> 30:44.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
local listing for times.

30:44.876 --> 30:53.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

30:53.085 --> 30:59.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
first for female
students in Afghanistan; and a
MacArthur fellow's

30:59.725 --> 31:03.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
complicated portrait of her
hometown.
®MDNM/

31:03.128 --> 31:09.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, say New Hampshire,
and most people
in the political world think
first-in-the-nation

31:09.267 --> 31:11.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
primary, coming up February 9.

31:11.703 --> 31:17.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, these days, there's
another, more disturbing
distinction for the Granite
State, the expectation

31:17.409 --> 31:23.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that last year's fatal drug
overdoses will
hit a record 400 deaths.

31:23.548 --> 31:29.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, presidential candidates
and state political
leaders gathered for a forum to
tackle addiction

31:29.755 --> 31:31.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the growing heroin crisis.

31:31.656 --> 31:36.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I traveled to New Hampshire last
month to
get a firsthand look at the
epidemic and its

31:36.628 --> 31:38.864 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
repercussions.

31:38.897 --> 31:43.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like the rest of the country,
New Hampshire
has long grappled with its share
of drug abuse.

31:43.635 --> 31:51.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in the past few years, the
easy availability
of cheap heroin and fentanyl,
another opiate,

31:51.943 --> 31:56.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has exploded into a crisis that
leaders in
both parties say needs urgent
attention.

31:56.982 --> 32:01.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. MAGGIE HASSAN (D), New
Hampshire: The
opioid epidemic is really our
most pressing

32:01.353 --> 32:04.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
public health and public safety
issue right
now.

32:04.055 --> 32:06.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONNA SYTEK (R), Former New
Hampshire House
Speaker: Drug abuse has always
been a challenge

32:06.658 --> 32:10.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for New Hampshire, but, with the
opioid crisis,
it has reached epic proportions.

32:11.029 --> 32:16.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Democrats like
Governor Maggie
Hassan and Republicans like the
former Speaker

32:17.002 --> 32:23.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the State Assembly Donna
Sytek agree the
state was slow to recognize what
was happening

32:23.441 --> 32:26.645 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in front of everyone's eyes.

32:26.678 --> 32:31.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's no mistaking it here
at HOPE for
New Hampshire, where the
holidays mean no

32:31.850 --> 32:35.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
slowdown in people needing help
on their road
to recovery.

32:35.387 --> 32:39.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOLLY CEKALA, Hope for New
Hampshire: Some
people are staying busy,
connecting with their

32:39.958 --> 32:41.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
peers, staying in recovery.

32:41.860 --> 32:47.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The center
provides nonclinical
support for men and women coping
with an alcohol

32:47.465 --> 32:52.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or drug addiction that in many
cases started
with a painkiller prescribed by
a physician.

32:52.871 --> 32:58.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOLLY CEKALA: You can be tall,
short, white,
black. You could speak English,
you could

32:58.510 --> 33:06.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not. You could be a CEO or you
could be a
homeless vet. And it really just
doesn't discriminate.

33:06.785 --> 33:13.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Director of
recovery supports,
Holly Cekala, herself in
long-term recovery,

33:13.692 --> 33:18.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
told us the center was created
in response
to a growing need in New
Hampshire's largest

33:19.030 --> 33:20.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
city, Manchester.

33:20.832 --> 33:25.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOLLY CEKALA: Even if I opened
up six more
treatment centers here, you're
still going

33:25.136 --> 33:30.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to fill them. And you're still
going to have
a rotation, unless we protect
our investment

33:30.342 --> 33:32.177 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in treatment.

33:32.210 --> 33:39.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The statistics
are staggering.
In 2013, New Hampshire saw 192
drug overdose

33:39.317 --> 33:49.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deaths. That number shot up to
326 in 2014.
As of mid-December, 342 people
died this past

33:49.394 --> 33:52.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
year. And the fatalities are
just the tip
of the iceberg.

33:52.631 --> 33:55.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LINDA SAUNDERS PAQUETTE,
Executive Director,
New Futures: We have a
population in New Hampshire

33:55.333 --> 34:04.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of about 1.3 million people. And
approximately
100,000 folks are in need of
substance use

34:04.476 --> 34:06.278 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
treatment.

34:06.311 --> 34:10.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Linda Saunders
Paquette is
the executive director of New
Futures, a group

34:10.282 --> 34:14.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that advocates for drug and
alcohol abuse
prevention and reduction.

34:14.319 --> 34:20.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDA SAUNDERS PAQUETTE: With
those high rates
of people with substance use
disorder, we

34:20.091 --> 34:24.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are also second to last in the
country when
it comes to somebody in need of
treatment

34:24.896 --> 34:27.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
being able to access

34:27.832 --> 34:33.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Access is an issue state
Representative Gladys
Johnsen saw firsthand almost a
decade ago.

34:33.338 --> 34:37.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GLADYS JOHNSEN (D), New
Hampshire State Representative:
It's really a disease. And I had
not owned

34:37.776 --> 34:39.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that until I witnessed it.

34:39.644 --> 34:45.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Years before she
became a state
legislator, the father of
Johnsen's grandson

34:45.884 --> 34:48.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fatally overdosed in their home.

34:48.586 --> 34:53.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GLADYS JOHNSEN: My daughter
Jorinda (ph) comes
running upstairs at 5:15. "I
can't wake Jesse

34:54.025 --> 34:56.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
(ph). I can't wake Jesse."

34:56.494 --> 35:01.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we, of course, rushed down
there. And
Jesse was gone. And we --
immediately, my

35:01.132 --> 35:05.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
husband did the chest
compressions, and I
tried breathing in his mouth.
And I knew in

35:05.470 --> 35:12.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my heart he was gone. And so,
you know, it
has taken me a long time. And he
wasn't -- they

35:12.744 --> 35:14.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weren't married, but he was one
of mine.

35:14.946 --> 35:20.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Johnsen says just
weeks before
Jesse's death, he had tried to
get help for

35:20.218 --> 35:22.020 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his addiction.

35:22.053 --> 35:26.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GLADYS JOHNSEN: It still hurts
my soul. I
watched him call place after
place after place

35:26.758 --> 35:33.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after place, saying: "I really
need help.
Can you find me a place?" And he
could not

35:33.698 --> 35:36.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
find a place because he didn't
have any money.

35:36.334 --> 35:41.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Bryan Patriquin,
an intern
at HOPE for New Hampshire, told
us that although

35:41.573 --> 35:47.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he has gotten help throughout
his four years
of recovery, stories like
Jesse's are all

35:47.612 --> 35:49.447 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
too common.

35:49.481 --> 35:51.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRYAN PATRIQUIN, HOPE for New
Hampshire: If
we were to walk down the streets
of Manchester,

35:51.449 --> 35:58.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it would be a matter of time
before we saw
a drug deal happen. But if you
call a treatment

35:58.990 --> 36:05.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
center right now, you're going
to get a waiting
list for four to six weeks, on
average.

36:05.497 --> 36:10.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The drug crisis
here is not
just happening behind closed
doors. Among

36:10.769 --> 36:15.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the cans and bottles littering
the state's
parks and little league fields,
authorities

36:15.840 --> 36:21.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
have found lots of drug
paraphernalia, including
hundreds of needles.

36:21.346 --> 36:27.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Drug abuse is such a problem,
that Manchester's
mayor, Ted Gatsas, says he has
regular visits

36:27.652 --> 36:33.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from parents of young people
who've overdosed
on opioids like heroin and
fentanyl.

36:33.158 --> 36:36.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TED GATSAS (R), Mayor of
Manchester, New Hampshire:
We need to do something about
it. If we don't,

36:36.895 --> 36:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're not going to have to worry
about building
more beds to try and treat
people. We're going

36:41.566 --> 36:43.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to have to start building more
coffins.

36:43.668 --> 36:48.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Governor Maggie
Hassan has
presented her own set of
proposals to combat

36:48.907 --> 36:54.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the opioid crisis. It seems
likely the legislature
will adopt at least some of
them.

36:54.345 --> 36:59.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. MAGGIE HASSAN: The most
important thing
we know we need to do is
increase access to

36:59.184 --> 37:04.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
treatment in New Hampshire, and
that really
boils down to making sure we
reauthorize our

37:04.155 --> 37:09.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Medicaid expansion program,
because, for the
first time, under Medicaid
expansion, the

37:09.327 --> 37:13.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Medicaid program covers
treatment and behavioral
health issues.

37:13.498 --> 37:19.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Realizing drug
abuse has become
an issue important to New
Hampshire, the presidential

37:19.104 --> 37:20.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hopefuls have also responded.

37:20.839 --> 37:23.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEB BUSH (R), Presidential
Candidate: Look,
I have some personal experience
with this

37:23.108 --> 37:27.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just as a dad. It's the most
heartbreaking
thing in the world to have to go
through.

37:27.879 --> 37:32.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R-NJ),
Presidential Candidate:
My friend, they found him dead
in a motel

37:32.584 --> 37:39.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
room by himself with an empty
bottle of Percocet
and an empty quart of vodka. He
was 52 years

37:39.557 --> 37:51.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
old. My friend had every success
in the world,
as we define it, and then,
because of his

37:51.069 --> 37:52.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
addiction, he had nothing.

37:52.871 --> 37:57.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: State
Representative Johnsen
raised the drug crisis at a
Clinton campaign

37:57.809 --> 37:59.644 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
event.

37:59.677 --> 38:04.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GLADYS JOHNSEN: We are
grandparents raising
our 10-year-old grandson,
because his father,

38:04.115 --> 38:06.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we lost him to an overdose.

38:06.050 --> 38:11.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Well, I have to say, Gladys,
that you're the

38:11.523 --> 38:16.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
third grandmother that I have
personally met
in New Hampshire in the last
several months

38:16.361 --> 38:19.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who is raising a grandchild
because of drugs.

38:19.063 --> 38:24.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Donna Sytek, who
recently endorsed
New Jersey Governor Chris
Christie, says the

38:24.435 --> 38:27.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
debate now lies in how to solve
the problem.

38:27.405 --> 38:33.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONNA SYTEK: When budgets get
tight, that's
one area where there are
cutbacks. And so

38:33.778 --> 38:38.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it has been a problem. There
hasn't been a
lot of money. It's not
surprising that New

38:38.049 --> 38:43.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hampshire doesn't spend a lot on
that. We
don't spend a lot on a lot of
other programs,

38:43.087 --> 38:44.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because we believe in small
government.

38:44.789 --> 38:50.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is, after
all, the state
with the motto "Live Free or
Die."

38:50.562 --> 38:56.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even so, Republican Mayor Gatsas
is in favor
of spending more on law
enforcement to tackle

38:56.901 --> 38:58.636 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the crisis.

38:58.670 --> 39:03.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TED GATSAS: We need to start
from the top,
and preventing folks from
getting addicted

39:03.308 --> 39:08.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by preventing the cross-line of
heroin coming
across into this state.

39:08.646 --> 39:13.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Governor Hassan,
who is backing
Hillary Clinton for president,
argues the

39:13.351 --> 39:18.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state investment in treatment is
not only
the right thing to do for
addicts, but also

39:18.223 --> 39:20.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the best interest of the
business community.

39:20.191 --> 39:25.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. MAGGIE HASSAN: This has got
a huge economic
impact. We have a 3.2 percent
unemployment

39:25.663 --> 39:31.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rate in New Hampshire. It's one
of the lowest
in the country. If we can't find
a work force

39:31.236 --> 39:36.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that isn't struggling with an
addiction problem,
that has a direct economic
impact on us.

39:36.741 --> 39:42.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Advocates say
that understanding
addiction and eliminating its
stigma should

39:42.513 --> 39:44.549 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
go hand in hand with treatment.

39:44.582 --> 39:50.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDA SAUNDERS PAQUETTE: In the
past, a person
who had an addiction was thought
to have a

39:50.221 --> 39:58.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moral failing. But thanks to
science, we now
know that addiction is a chronic
relapsing

39:58.663 --> 40:00.465 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
brain disease.

40:00.498 --> 40:05.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's
exactly what HOPE
for New Hampshire stresses to
politicians

40:05.036 --> 40:07.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and to those struggling with
addiction.

40:07.639 --> 40:13.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BRYAN PATRIQUIN: At 21
years-old, I was well
over 500 pounds. I was unhealthy
and a daily

40:13.478 --> 40:23.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
substance user. I found this
group of people
who I still -- still see today
-- I'm sorry

40:23.921 --> 40:31.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- it's like really kind of an
emotional thing.
It's an emotional thing for me.
And they stuck

40:31.162 --> 40:32.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
behind me and they supported me.

40:32.964 --> 40:37.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOLLY CEKALA: I believe that if
I had a place
like this to come to when I was
struggling

40:37.769 --> 40:45.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with my addiction, it would have
taken me
much less time to put my life
back together.

40:45.410 --> 40:56.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's why I do what I do.

40:56.654 --> 41:04.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now a different
look at the
war in Afghanistan, through the
lens of inspiring

41:04.062 --> 41:07.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
young women, making history by
way of education.

41:07.398 --> 41:12.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, we brought you the
story of the
Zabuli girls school about 100
miles north

41:12.303 --> 41:17.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Kabul. Just before Christmas,
the first
class graduated.

41:17.175 --> 41:20.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Beth Murphy of The GroundTruth
Project has
their story.

41:20.244 --> 41:24.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETH MURPHY, The GroundTruth
Project: Winter
in Afghanistan signals that the
school year

41:24.549 --> 41:30.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is ending. In this village, this
unprecedented
graduation comes at a difficult
time in the

41:30.421 --> 41:32.190 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

41:32.223 --> 41:36.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAZIA JAN, Founder, Zabuli
Education Center:
Today is a very special day for
us. It is

41:36.361 --> 41:43.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beyond my thoughts, beyond my
dreams that
we will be sitting here with our
first graduating

41:43.368 --> 41:44.369 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
class.

41:44.402 --> 41:46.204 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

41:46.237 --> 41:50.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETH MURPHY: This is the first
time girls
in this village have ever
graduated from high

41:50.975 --> 41:57.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
school. When the Zabuli
Education Center opened
in 2008, the villagers wanted it
to be a boys

41:58.015 --> 42:03.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
school. But attitudes here have
changed.

42:03.321 --> 42:13.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAZIA JAN: This is our first
young woman who
get married and she is still in
school. And

42:13.364 --> 42:20.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAZIA JAN: This is our first
young woman who
get married and she is still in
school. And

42:20.304 --> 42:25.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she wants to continue her
education.

42:25.476 --> 42:27.412 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

42:27.445 --> 42:37.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): And
thanks to the
people of this village, who
really supported

42:37.789 --> 42:41.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and helped the school. Without
your help,
this wouldn't be possible.

42:42.026 --> 42:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAZIA JAN (through translator):
And, also,
you really helped us. Without
your help, this

42:49.000 --> 42:50.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wouldn't be possible.

42:50.835 --> 42:53.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MUHAMMAD MALANGATAYE,
Afghanistan (through
translator): It is my duty, and
I feel a strong

42:54.005 --> 42:58.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
responsibility. These are our
students, and
they are like my daughters.
Coming to this

42:58.709 --> 43:03.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ceremony will help convince them
to continue
their education, and also help
to convince

43:03.815 --> 43:05.616 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their parents.

43:05.650 --> 43:09.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BETH MURPHY: This first
graduation followed
many of the traditions you would
expect, parents

43:09.520 --> 43:12.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
overcome with pride and lots of
time spent
reminiscing.

43:12.223 --> 43:18.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAZIA JAN: You have opened a
door that, at
one time, I couldn't even
imagine. This is

43:18.896 --> 43:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAZIA JAN: You have opened a
door that, at
one time, I couldn't even
imagine. This is

43:39.016 --> 43:41.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
truly a dream come true.

43:41.719 --> 43:47.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETH MURPHY: Highlights from
their high school
years include field trips to
Kabul, videoconference

43:47.258 --> 43:53.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
calls with girls in
Massachusetts, where Razia
called home in the U.S., and the
groundbreaking

43:53.064 --> 44:00.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Razia Jan Institute, that
will allow
them to go to college right in
their own village.

44:00.204 --> 44:02.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Despite the successes,
challenges remain.

44:02.039 --> 44:08.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAZIA JAN: When we started,
there was great
hope that things will get
better. But within

44:09.013 --> 44:15.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these eight years, things have
gone worse.
Many schools have been burned.
Many girls

44:15.953 --> 44:21.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been poisoned. Believe me,
we are very
cautious. We can't put our
guards down.

44:21.792 --> 44:27.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETH MURPHY: 2015 has not been a
good year
for Afghanistan. According to a
new Pentagon

44:27.498 --> 44:31.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
report, things have gotten worse
since Afghan
forces took over the U.S. and
NATO-led mission

44:31.836 --> 44:38.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one year ago. Taliban attacks in
Kabul alone
jumped nearly 30 percent.

44:38.209 --> 44:42.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROUALLAH SAHIB, Mayor of Deh
Sabz District
(through translator): The
security of this

44:42.280 --> 44:47.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
village is better than a lot of
places, because,
here, we support the government
and police.

44:47.051 --> 44:51.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are supporting them. The
international
community and Obama decided to
get out of

44:51.322 --> 44:56.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the country. They decided to
leave. At the
time, ISIS wasn't in Afghanistan
and the Taliban

44:56.727 --> 45:01.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was weak. But now ISIS is here,
and the Taliban
is getting stronger.

45:01.065 --> 45:08.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETH MURPHY: Stronger and more
deadly, 54
people dead after a 24-hour
Taliban assault

45:08.205 --> 45:15.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the Kandahar Airport, an
attack that was
staged from a nearby school, and
then another

45:15.246 --> 45:17.081 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
attack.

45:17.114 --> 45:20.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): There
was an explosion
here. It was really powerful.
And right after

45:20.084 --> 45:21.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the blast, this area was
shaking.

45:21.953 --> 45:27.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETH MURPHY: Amidst all the
danger, graduation,
a pocket of relative peace and a
success to

45:27.925 --> 45:33.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
celebrate, it's the kind of
investment the
U.S. wants to protect and a
reason for troops

45:33.864 --> 45:37.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to remain on the ground.

45:37.935 --> 45:43.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The administration made an
about-face on pulling
U.S. troops, a recognition that
there's no

45:43.474 --> 45:49.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
end in sight to increased
threats from insurgent
and terrorist groups.

45:49.213 --> 45:51.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Obama announced the
change in October.

45:51.248 --> 45:54.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
I have decided to maintain our
current posture

45:54.251 --> 46:01.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of 9,800 troops in Afghanistan
through most
of next year, 2016. This modest,
but meaningful

46:01.759 --> 46:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
extension of our presence, while
sticking
to our current narrow missions,
can make a

46:09.200 --> 46:11.002 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
real difference.

46:11.035 --> 46:15.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROUALLAH SAHIB (through
translator): Without
their help, we will have more
terrorists here.

46:15.940 --> 46:20.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Regional security and world
security will
be at risk. We need them to be
here.

46:20.378 --> 46:29.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAZIA JAN: America has and other
international
countries have invested so much
here. It is

46:29.987 --> 46:39.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really something that they
cannot lose completely,
because there are such great
other supreme

46:39.897 --> 46:46.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
powers that will come in a very
passive way,
like Russia and China.

I think America will never
leave. America
is going to be always. I think
there is a

46:52.810 --> 46:58.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
great interest of America in
this country
for their own security.

BETH MURPHY: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm Beth
Murphy in Deh Sabz District,
Afghanistan.

47:10.594 --> 47:20.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, a look
at a photographer's
more-than-decade-long project
documenting

47:20.404 --> 47:23.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hope and despair in her
hometown.

47:23.474 --> 47:25.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has that story.

47:25.409 --> 47:30.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Braddock,
Pennsylvania, about
nine miles outside of
Pittsburgh, a once thriving

47:30.214 --> 47:36.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
steel town of some 20,000, now
down to one-tenth
of that, and captured through
the very personal

47:36.587 --> 47:42.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lens of LaToya Ruby Frazier, the
32-year-old
winner of one of this year's
MacArthur fellowships.

47:42.093 --> 47:46.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER,
Photographer: I see myself
as an artist and a citizen
that's documenting

47:46.697 --> 47:52.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and telling the story and
building the archive
of working-class families facing
all this

47:52.336 --> 47:56.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
change that's happening, because
it has to
be documented.

47:56.607 --> 48:01.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: These days,
Frazier teaches
and lives in Chicago, where we
talked to her,

48:01.212 --> 48:05.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but her true home, her childhood
home, is
the one found in her work.

48:05.850 --> 48:11.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a project titled "The
Notion of Family"
that she began more than a
decade ago, documenting

48:11.388 --> 48:17.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
three generations of
African-American women
in a particular time and place.

48:17.061 --> 48:20.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER: My
grandmother, who grew
up there in the '30s, when
Braddock was prosperous

48:20.331 --> 48:27.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a city itself that everyone
came to, to
my mother growing up there in
the '60s during

48:27.104 --> 48:32.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
segregation and white flight and
the beginning
of the collapse of the steel
industry, to

48:32.576 --> 48:38.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
myself growing up there in the
'80s and '90s,
when the factories were already
dismantled

48:38.315 --> 48:41.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the war on drugs kind of hit
its peak.

48:41.051 --> 48:47.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Educator and
photographer Lewis
Hine used his camera for social
reform. Photographers

48:47.725 --> 48:53.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from the Farm Security
Administration documented
the poverty of the Depression,
the pioneering

48:53.230 --> 48:57.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
work of Gordon Parks in the
1940s and '50s.

48:57.101 --> 49:02.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Frazier sees herself working in
this tradition,
first and foremost, though, as a
visual artist.

49:02.106 --> 49:07.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER: The art
comes in with
how it's crafted, how it's made,
the material,

49:07.211 --> 49:12.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me understanding the history,
because the
images, they're not purely
documents.

49:12.316 --> 49:17.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look at them, first and
foremost, the
fact that I appear on the other
side of the

49:18.022 --> 49:23.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
camera lets you know that this
is contemporary
art, because now I'm performing
and doing

49:23.360 --> 49:26.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gestures in front of the camera
to create...

49:26.363 --> 49:27.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You're part of
the scene.

49:27.631 --> 49:28.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER: ... the
narrative and
the scene, yes.

49:28.833 --> 49:30.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But are they
posed photographs?

49:30.501 --> 49:36.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER: They sit in
between staged
and documentation.

49:36.240 --> 49:41.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we think about the image
"Grandma Ruby
and Me, 2005," I know her
routine. I know

49:41.478 --> 49:46.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she will get up, she will have
her Folgers
cup of coffee, she will smoke
her Pall Mall

49:46.050 --> 49:48.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cigarettes, she will clean her
dolls.

49:48.185 --> 49:53.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, looking at my grandmother
one day, I said,
well, grandma, could you redo my
hair the

49:53.390 --> 49:55.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way you used to when I was a
child?

49:55.326 --> 50:02.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I'm in my 20s in this image.
So, I come
and I sit next to her while
she's rearranging

50:02.399 --> 50:08.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her dolls. And then we both
quietly happen
to look over our shoulders, and
the cable

50:08.739 --> 50:14.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
release is running behind to the
camera, and
I press the cable release.

50:14.245 --> 50:20.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so that's how it sits
between documentation
and actual staged portraiture.

50:20.684 --> 50:26.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In 2013, Frazier
flew in a
helicopter above Braddock to
expand her view

50:26.357 --> 50:28.025 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the town.

50:28.058 --> 50:31.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER: I just knew
I had to
shoot this, so the family could
see what was

50:31.829 --> 50:33.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
happening to their property.

50:33.664 --> 50:37.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And to capture
the plight of
one particular home owned by the
Bunn family

50:37.902 --> 50:42.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the neighborhood known as The
Bottom, right
near the old plant. It's now
surrounded by

50:42.840 --> 50:45.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bundles of crushed rubber tires.

50:45.142 --> 50:49.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER: And what's
interesting
is, at one point, anyone who
immigrated or

50:50.014 --> 50:54.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
migrated to work in this factory
lived exactly
these two blocks.

50:54.418 --> 50:56.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Really?

50:56.253 --> 50:59.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER: And this is
really important
to me because it's not about
being black or

51:00.024 --> 51:05.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
white. This was our rites of
passage, so it
didn't matter if you came from
Germany, Croatia,

51:05.529 --> 51:12.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Italy, Africa, North Carolina,
or South Carolina.
We all lived here together.

51:12.803 --> 51:17.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And over the years, these were
all, through
eminent domain, taken because
people died

51:17.975 --> 51:26.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from terminal illnesses,
couldn't upstand
or keep their homes. And then
this family,

51:26.850 --> 51:31.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Bunn family, decided that
they didn't
want to move.

51:31.922 --> 51:38.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In more recent
years, a new
story of Braddock has been told,
one of grit

51:38.996 --> 51:50.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and revival. Levi's even used
the city in
a 2010 ad campaign called "Ready
for Work."

51:50.240 --> 51:55.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHILD: Maybe the world breaks on
purpose,
so we can have work to do.

51:55.846 --> 51:57.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Frazier isn't
buying it.

51:57.748 --> 52:05.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER: Out of
concern for this
narrative and what I saw as
propaganda, I

52:05.322 --> 52:13.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
started to make the portraits to
counterbalance
this narrative. Right. It's not
an empty land.

52:13.364 --> 52:19.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not a frontier. Like,
people actually
live here and have been dealing
with the environmental

52:19.269 --> 52:21.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
crisis for decades.

52:21.138 --> 52:25.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: She points to
government policies
and corporate decisions like the
closing of

52:25.909 --> 52:30.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the main hospital, which had
served many in
the town, including Frazier's
own family,

52:30.881 --> 52:34.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
who say they suffer from
environment-related
illnesses.

52:34.618 --> 52:39.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fight over the hospital was
captured in
a 2012 documentary by Tony Buba,
who's been

52:39.923 --> 52:45.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
filming life in Braddock since
the 1970s.
The protests became another
point of Frazier's

52:45.429 --> 52:47.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
own mix of art and activism.

52:47.698 --> 52:50.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER: So, here,
I'm talking
about the history of protests.

52:50.601 --> 52:56.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Taken altogether,
it's a complicated
picture. Frazier wants us not to
forget those

52:56.040 --> 52:58.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who continue to struggle amid
the changes.

52:58.375 --> 53:02.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER: I'm not
saying that it's
a dying town. I'm saying that we
survived.

53:02.246 --> 53:09.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, look at all of the damage,
all the abuse
we have endured, and we're still
steadfast

53:09.920 --> 53:16.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and existing. So, for me, it's a
triumphant
story. It's really a testimony.
It's not -- we're

53:16.393 --> 53:18.328 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not dying.

53:18.362 --> 53:22.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Even though it
looks -- I mean,
much of it looks so depressed
and depressing-type

53:22.066 --> 53:23.534 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
scenes.

53:23.567 --> 53:25.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER: But look at
me in the
flesh right now in front of you.

53:25.235 --> 53:26.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

53:26.136 --> 53:27.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER: I'm not
that girl.

53:28.005 --> 53:33.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And she plans to
use the money
from the MacArthur grant,
$625,000 over five

53:33.544 --> 53:39.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years, to continue to document
and complicate
our picture of Braddock,
Pennsylvania.

53:39.316 --> 53:41.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm Jeffrey Brown for the "PBS

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online: Five
long years of civil war haven't
stopped Syrian

53:58.936 --> 54:04.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
artists from showing the world
the country
they call home. We talked to two
filmmakers

54:04.108 --> 54:10.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
currently living outside of
Syria on the urgency
of telling their stories of war
and everyday

54:10.314 --> 54:14.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
life. It's part of an ongoing
series highlighting
Syrian artists.

54:14.451 --> 54:17.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can find today's story on
our home page.

54:17.621 --> 54:23.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And El Nino-related weather has
recently battered
the South and the Midwest, but
the trouble

54:23.327 --> 54:28.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
may just be getting started. In
the first
of a two-part science series, we
explore what's

54:28.665 --> 54:33.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in store for blossoming flower
to the cost
of cookies.

54:33.103 --> 54:38.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

54:38.208 --> 54:43.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tune in later tonight on
"Charlie Rose": Saudi
Arabia, Iran, and the deepening
divide between

54:43.714 --> 54:46.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Sunni and Shia Muslims.

54:46.316 --> 54:48.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

54:48.118 --> 54:53.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Wednesday, we will look at
efforts to crack
down on sky-high interest rates
for payday

54:53.257 --> 54:54.258 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

54:54.291 --> 54:56.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:56.160 --> 55:00.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening. For all of us at the
"PBS NewsHour,"

55:00.464 --> 55:01.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.
