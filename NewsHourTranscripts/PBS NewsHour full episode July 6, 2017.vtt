one of the primary sonic
architects of rock and roll.

00:57.133 --> 01:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he helped establish this
art form that we all know and
love, and that really sort

(BREAK)

01:15.366 --> 01:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: President Trump faced
dramatically different crowds
as he made his way across

01:22.566 --> 01:24.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Europe today.

01:24.600 --> 01:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His second overseas trip began
in Poland, before he moved
on to Hamburg, Germany, the

Special correspondent
Ryan Chilcote reports.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

01:39.266 --> 01:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE, PBS NEWSHOUR
SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
(voice-over): President
Trump kicked off his

01:41.366 --> 01:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
second trip to Europe by doing
something he was criticized
for not doing on his first:

01:47.533 --> 01:49.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
offering America's full
commitment to the NATO alliance.

01:49.666 --> 01:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: The United States has
demonstrated not merely with
words but with its actions

01:55.766 --> 02:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we stand firmly
behind Article 5, the
mutual defense commitment.

02:02.933 --> 02:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Words are easy but
actions are what matters.

02:06.533 --> 02:11.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHILCOTE: Mr. Trump was
addressing a friendly
crowd of some 15,000
in Warsaw, Poland, some

02:13.633 --> 02:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the spectators bused
in by the country's
center-right governing party.

02:18.033 --> 02:22.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
To the delight of Poles
concerned about Russia,
their neighbor to the
east, he declared the

02:22.700 --> 02:25.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
West would triumph over
its many adversaries.

02:25.766 --> 02:30.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: The fundamental question
of our time is whether the
West has the will to survive.

02:33.433 --> 02:38.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I declare today for the
world to hear that the West
will never, ever be broken.

02:40.466 --> 02:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our values will prevail, our
people will thrive, and our
civilization will triumph.

02:48.600 --> 02:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHILCOTE: The president, though,
reiterated criticism of some
NATO allies in Western Europe

02:54.766 --> 02:57.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for not committing more
to defense spending.

02:57.400 --> 03:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump also offered his
most forceful condemnation
yet of Russia, just a
day before his meeting

03:02.700 --> 03:04.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with President Vladimir Putin.

03:04.766 --> 03:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: We urge Russia to cease
its destabilizing activities in
Ukraine and elsewhere and its

03:12.600 --> 03:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
support for hostile regimes,
including Syria and Iran, and
to instead join the community

03:19.333 --> 03:21.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of responsible nations.

03:21.533 --> 03:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHILCOTE: Hours earlier, at a
press conference with Poland's
president, though, Mr. Trump

03:26.366 --> 03:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
skirted questions about Russian
meddling in the 2016 election.

03:30.133 --> 03:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REPORTER: Will you once and for
all, yes or no, definitively
say that Russia interfered

03:35.066 --> 03:37.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with the 2016 election?

03:37.533 --> 03:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, I think it
was Russia and I think
it could've been other
people and other countries.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It could've been a lot
of people interfered.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nobody really knows, nobody
really knows for sure.

03:46.633 --> 03:50.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CHILCOTE: Mr. Trump also
cast blame on former
President Barack Obama.

03:50.733 --> 03:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: I think what happened is
that he thought Hillary Clinton
was going to win the election

03:54.866 --> 03:57.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and he said, let's not
do anything about it.

03:57.266 --> 04:00.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Had he thought the other
way, he would have done
something about it.

04:00.200 --> 04:04.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHILCOTE: President Trump
then flew to Hamburg,
Germany for the G20 Summit.

04:04.566 --> 04:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There he met German
Chancellor Angela Merkel.

04:06.933 --> 04:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The two have publicly tussled
on a variety of issues including
trade and climate change.

04:13.933 --> 04:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All the while the "welcome to
hell" protest, its actual title,
was already under way, turning

04:19.800 --> 04:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
violent almost immediately.

04:21.833 --> 04:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thousands of protesters clashed
with police in riot gear who
used water cannons to disperse

04:27.033 --> 04:28.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
crowds.

04:28.566 --> 04:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Others rushed demonstrators,
tackling them to the ground.

04:31.033 --> 04:33.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(END VIDEOTAPE)

04:33.000 --> 04:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHILCOTE: President Trump's
most important meeting
is, of course, tomorrow.

04:34.933 --> 04:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That will be his first
ever meeting with the
president of Russia -- Judy.

04:38.933 --> 04:41.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And, Ryan,
you've covered the Kremlin.

04:41.866 --> 04:46.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you think Mr. Putin is
going to react to what President
Trump had to say today about

04:48.033 --> 04:50.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russia's interference
in last year's election?

04:50.000 --> 04:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHILCOTE: Well, look, I don't
think that President Putin
will like those remarks.

04:54.266 --> 04:59.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time, I think in
a way he will appreciate that
they were made in Poland and

05:00.833 --> 05:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not here at the G20 Summit, not
alongside the Russian president.

05:07.766 --> 05:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, they're well
aware that President Trump
is optically challenged.

05:14.466 --> 05:18.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will be very difficult
for him to say something
pro-Russian at this point.

05:20.600 --> 05:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They feel that, at this point,
it would be very difficult
for him to really achieve much

05:26.000 --> 05:30.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when it comes to improving the
Russian-American relationship.

05:30.166 --> 05:32.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They just don't want to
see it get any worse.

05:32.866 --> 05:37.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think they'll think
that he was sort of speaking
to the crowd, speaking to the

05:39.766 --> 05:43.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
parlor, if you will, and what
really matters is what President
Trump tells them in that

05:45.100 --> 05:49.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
- - or tells President
Putin in that room when
it comes to policy, and
namely what President

05:51.600 --> 05:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Putin is hoping is two
things, that one, President
Trump will perhaps listen
to some of the issues

05:56.266 --> 06:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he has with the Ukrainian
side, when it comes to
Russia's conflict in Ukraine,

06:02.800 --> 06:06.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and secondly, President Putin
will be hoping that he can use
Russia's precedence in Syria,

06:08.000 --> 06:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what Russia is doing in Syria
as a bridge to the United
States, find some kind of common

06:13.900 --> 06:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ground, encourage President
Trump to pursue for example
Islamic State in Syria together

06:18.633 --> 06:20.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Syria.

06:20.666 --> 06:23.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That is a whole lot
of challenges but that
has always been the
Russians' big hope that

06:23.566 --> 06:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they can team up with the United
States or at least the lower
the level, the temperature

06:28.000 --> 06:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the relationship by
working together in Syria.

06:32.233 --> 06:35.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: Ryan Chilcote
reporting for us from
Hamburg, thank you.

06:35.633 --> 06:37.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHILCOTE: Thank you.

06:37.733 --> 06:41.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And we'll hear more
about President Trump's visit
to Poland and Germany, after

06:41.566 --> 06:43.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the news summary.

06:43.566 --> 06:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the day's other news,
world powers are jousting over
how to handle North Korea's

06:47.633 --> 06:50.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
test of an intercontinental
ballistic missile.

06:50.366 --> 06:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president of China,
Pyongyang's closest ally,
called for restraint.

06:55.233 --> 07:00.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Europe earlier today,
President Trump says
he still hopes that
Beijing can help resolve

07:02.133 --> 07:04.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the North Koreans'
tensions, but said the U.S.
has a range of options.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

07:05.566 --> 07:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: I don't like to talk
about what I have planned.

07:07.933 --> 07:12.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But I have some pretty
severe things that we
are thinking about.

07:12.466 --> 07:14.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That does not mean we
are going to do them.

07:14.300 --> 07:16.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't draw red lines.

07:16.800 --> 07:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a shame that they're
behaving this way, but
they are behaving in
a very, very dangerous

07:23.233 --> 07:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
manner and something will
have to be done about it.

07:26.666 --> 07:28.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(END VIDEO CLIP)

07:28.766 --> 07:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, there's
word that it was Russia that
blocked the U.N. Security

07:31.333 --> 07:35.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Council's approval of
a statement strongly
condemning that launch.

07:35.633 --> 07:40.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Trump administration
has renewed its offer
to cooperate with Russia
over the Syria conflict.

07:43.166 --> 07:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement last night,
Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson said the U.S.
is open to coordinating

07:47.600 --> 07:50.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on no fly-zones in Syria.

07:50.100 --> 07:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Later, State Department
spokeswoman Heather Nauert said
the broader American strategy

07:54.633 --> 07:55.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
remains the same.

HEATHER NAUERT, STATE
DEPARTMENT SPOKESWOMAN:
If our two countries
can establish stability

08:00.333 --> 08:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the ground, we believe
that will lay a foundation
for progress on the
political settlement

08:02.833 --> 08:04.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Syria's future.

08:04.933 --> 08:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The policy has not changed,
some of the words and some of
the phrasing may have changed

08:10.966 --> 08:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at this point, but overall,
it's just one of a series of
options that the United States

08:13.900 --> 08:14.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will now consider.

08:14.900 --> 08:16.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

WOODRUFF: For his part, Russia's
foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov,
asked for more information

08:19.533 --> 08:24.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the proposal, but said
cooperation is, quote, a
step in the right direction.

08:26.466 --> 08:29.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A survey commissioned by the

WOODRUFF: As we've heard,
President Trump has voiced,
at times, contradictory views

11:16.766 --> 11:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the U.S.'s relationship
with its European
allies and with Russia.

11:20.900 --> 11:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To parse out where things stand
after the first full day of
the president's trip abroad

11:25.866 --> 11:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the road ahead, we
turn to Paula Dobriansky.

11:29.600 --> 11:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was under secretary
of state for democracy
and global affairs
during the George W. Bush

11:35.533 --> 11:37.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration.

11:37.666 --> 11:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's now a senior fellow
at Harvard University and
she joins us from Warsaw.

11:41.233 --> 11:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Karen Donfried was special
assistant to the president and
senior director for European

11:48.266 --> 11:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
affairs on the National
Security Council during
the Obama administration.

11:52.133 --> 11:57.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She's now the president
of the German Marshall
Fund in the U.S., an
organization which seeks

11:58.233 --> 12:00.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to straighten
relations with Europe.

12:00.266 --> 12:02.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we welcome both
of you to the program.

12:02.333 --> 12:05.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Paula Dobriansky, to
you first in Warsaw.

12:05.533 --> 12:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Overall, what would you say
the message is from President
Trump that's come across to

12:11.266 --> 12:13.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his European listeners?

12:13.766 --> 12:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL DOBRIANSKY, FORMER
GEORGE W. BUSH STATE
DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:
Well, the primary message

12:19.633 --> 12:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was that European security
matters to us greatly,
that towards that end that
the forward deployment

12:25.000 --> 12:28.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of our troops on the
border matter greatly.

12:28.266 --> 12:32.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They reassure not just the
Poles but the neighborhood.

12:32.166 --> 12:37.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And also the important of the
alliance, that Article 5, our
collective defense is crucial

12:39.100 --> 12:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and toward that end, that
alliance has played an
important role in the past.

12:42.566 --> 12:45.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It does now and it
will in the future.

12:45.033 --> 12:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And let me just add, combined
with that, it was very clear
that, related, the president

12:52.133 --> 12:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also made it very clear that he
was very concerned about Russian
aggression and the need to have

12:58.100 --> 13:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a cessation of the violence
and the conflict in Ukraine,
as well as in Syria.

13:04.400 --> 13:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He talked about Islamic radical
terrorism, and then he also
talked about energy security,

13:09.633 --> 13:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which hasn't gotten a lot of
attention and it's behind me
here at the royal castle where

13:14.500 --> 13:19.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he gave a speech actually before
what's called the Three Seas
Summit, an initiative paid

13:21.566 --> 13:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the Poles, the Croats and
there were 12 countries from
Central Europe that spoke to

13:24.500 --> 13:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this issue about the need
for energy dependents,
energy security and
energy efficiency and

13:31.100 --> 13:33.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the establishment
of an infrastructure
in Central Europe.

13:33.333 --> 13:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Karen Donfried, are
those the main messages that
to you have come across from

13:37.633 --> 13:39.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this trip?

13:39.600 --> 13:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREN DONFRIED, FORMER OBAMA
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL STAFF:
There were two things that

13:41.100 --> 13:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
struck me about President
Trump's stop in Poland.

13:42.866 --> 13:47.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
One was what a big boost
this was to the current
Polish government.

13:49.866 --> 13:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Poland is an overwhelmingly
pro-American country and that's
significant in the context of a

13:55.233 --> 14:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
European Union that's been
quite critical of democratic
backsliding in Poland.

14:02.266 --> 14:06.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the European Commission
has been looking at whether
Poland is staying true to rule

14:06.033 --> 14:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of law, independent judiciary,
freedom of the press.

14:09.200 --> 14:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it was very significant
for this Polish government.

14:12.633 --> 14:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The second thing that struck
me was the speech he gave
that Paula just referred to.

14:17.000 --> 14:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the one hand, had
many elements of the
traditional transatlantic
speech, reaffirming

14:24.533 --> 14:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. commitment to the
Article 5, the collective
defense piece of the NATO
alliance, his support

14:29.933 --> 14:32.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for strong transatlantic
relationship.

14:32.100 --> 14:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But then on the other hand,
you had a dark view of a clash
of civilizations and you had

14:39.100 --> 14:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it on your opening clip, the
president's comment about the
West and our ability to stand up

14:43.533 --> 14:45.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to this challenge.

14:45.633 --> 14:50.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think some people
are wondering how we in
the U.S. under President
Trump are defining

14:50.833 --> 14:52.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that West.

14:52.466 --> 14:54.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: Well, how do
you respond to that,
Paula Dobriansky?

14:54.900 --> 14:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because it did raise, I think,
questions in people's minds
about what is this conflict

14:59.600 --> 15:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as the president sees it?

15:02.300 --> 15:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOBRIANSKY: Well, first, I
think that Karen was right,
the president did highlight the

15:09.266 --> 15:14.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
importance over decades of the
Polish relationship with the
United States and even cited the

15:15.700 --> 15:19.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
roles of such generals,
Kosciuszko and Pilsudski.

15:19.466 --> 15:22.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, our relationship
has mattered greatly.

15:22.600 --> 15:26.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I saw it in a broader
context, though, than
Karen had expressed.

15:26.566 --> 15:28.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I saw it as a bond.

15:28.633 --> 15:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on the other issue,
I saw and looked at the
words that he enunciated.

15:35.133 --> 15:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He really spoke a great deal
to freedom, to liberty, to
captive nations, he referred to

15:40.266 --> 15:42.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in his remarks.

15:42.300 --> 15:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He did talk about the importance
of values and even towards the
end of the speech expressed

15:48.400 --> 15:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how it's not just only about
military might, but it is also
about the will -- the will

15:53.500 --> 15:58.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of the people and,
towards that end, I did
not see that as a dark.

16:00.100 --> 16:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I saw that as underscoring
the kind of values that
we do hold very dearly.

16:05.633 --> 16:10.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: So, if he was
stressing the common
values, Karen Donfried,
how then do you read

16:12.300 --> 16:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what the president has said?

16:14.366 --> 16:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because we know it was on his
other trip to Europe where
he withheld a statement about

16:20.733 --> 16:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so-called Article 5, the mutual
commitment to defense among
the NATO countries, but this

16:25.333 --> 16:26.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
time he did.

16:26.266 --> 16:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, how do you square that?

16:28.333 --> 16:31.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONFRIED: So, on the one hand,
I don't think we would have
been so focused on the more

16:31.766 --> 16:36.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
traditional aspects of
the speech were it not
to the earlier trip
to Europe for a NATO

16:36.466 --> 16:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leaders meeting where the
president did not affirm
U.S. support for Article 5.

16:42.333 --> 16:44.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's why it was significant.

16:44.266 --> 16:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But in that transatlantic
context, it was also significant
that he didn't mention the

16:47.566 --> 16:52.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
European Union because
typically, the U.S. has
defined its relationship
with Europe both

16:54.533 --> 16:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through NATO, but also through
U.S. cooperation with this body
that emphasizes cooperation

16:59.700 --> 17:01.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
among Europeans.

17:01.733 --> 17:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The second piece I would
mention is, I was struck by the
focus on values but I actually

17:08.133 --> 17:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
searched the speech for the
word democracy, and it didn't
appear and that was striking

17:11.933 --> 17:14.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to me.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And though he did talk about
the importance of rule of law
and freedom of press in the

17:16.966 --> 17:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
speech, when you looked at the
press conference he gave with
President Duda, he was asked

17:24.333 --> 17:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the issue of the
press and said -- expressed
his concern about fake
news and the dishonest

17:28.800 --> 17:30.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
media.

17:30.900 --> 17:34.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, it was a bit of a
mixed message I thought
on those issues around
democratic principles.

17:34.700 --> 17:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Paula Dobriansky,
what about that?

17:36.700 --> 17:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, we know the president's
view toward the press in the
United States has certainly

17:43.500 --> 17:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been a subject of controversy
and a lot of discussion
and debate recently.

17:49.233 --> 17:52.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOBRIANSKY: Well, I think,
in the speech, which was his
primary platform, in my view,

17:58.266 --> 18:03.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not the press conference but the
primary platform where he had
an opportunity not just to speak

18:05.300 --> 18:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Poland but, as I mentioned,
to the region at large, and
also to set the foundation for

18:11.900 --> 18:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his meetings coming up in
Hamburg and particularly
with President Putin
where he did underscore

18:17.400 --> 18:20.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this importance, as
I said, of communism.

18:20.900 --> 18:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He talked about it, about the
freedoms that were deprived,
the kind of oppression that

18:25.800 --> 18:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this region was under and how,
in terms of the present time,
this is a different period.

18:33.366 --> 18:37.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This is a period where
we do have to reaffirm
these kinds of values.

18:37.900 --> 18:42.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I saw it in a
broader strategic sense
of setting a foundation
that has applicability

18:44.833 --> 18:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to a number of the issues
that we've just mentioned,
not just Poland, the region at

18:48.933 --> 18:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
large, but also for Russia.

18:51.433 --> 18:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Karen Donfried,
just about 30 seconds here.

18:54.266 --> 18:59.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But how does all this play
into expectation for tomorrow's
meeting between President Trump

19:00.166 --> 19:02.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and President Putin?

19:02.266 --> 19:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONFRIED: So, it becomes much
more complicated for President
Trump when he gets -- well,

19:04.233 --> 19:06.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he is now in
Germany for the G20.

19:06.800 --> 19:11.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Germany context is more
complicated, because you have a
German chancellor who's facing

19:11.566 --> 19:13.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reelection campaign
in September.

19:13.533 --> 19:17.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She has a public that
is not supportive of
President Trump's policies.

19:17.766 --> 19:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She very much values the
relationship with the U.S., so
she wants to try to reach an

19:22.033 --> 19:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agreement with President Trump
while also staying true to her
principle stands on climate

19:27.633 --> 19:28.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and trade.

19:28.900 --> 19:31.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, it will become
very challenging.

19:31.033 --> 19:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The meeting with President Putin
will be something everyone will
be watching and it sounds, based

19:35.600 --> 19:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on his comments to the press
conference today, that he won't
be raising the issue of Russian

19:39.333 --> 19:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
meddling in U.S. elections.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOODRUFF: Yes.

19:42.600 --> 19:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He certainly -- he said,
yes, it may have happened
but it may not have.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He said nobody knows for
sure who was behind it.

19:49.766 --> 19:52.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONFRIED: Which was
also a rebuke of U.S.
intelligence, I would say.

19:52.966 --> 19:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Karen Donfried, Paula
Dobriansky, we thank you both.

19:56.300 --> 20:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONFRIED: Thank you so much.

20:03.200 --> 20:06.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

20:06.133 --> 20:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Now to a major legal
case involving the alleged
smuggling of ancient religious

20:13.933 --> 20:16.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
artifacts.

20:16.033 --> 20:19.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Late yesterday, the
Department of Justice
said that the nationwide
arts and crafts company

20:19.400 --> 20:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hobby Lobby illegally
imported thousands of ancient
relics from the Middle East.

20:25.266 --> 20:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the story.

WILLIAM BRANGHAM, PBS NEWSHOUR
CORRESPONDENT: The government's
complaint against Hobby Lobby

20:30.233 --> 20:34.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
involves the purchase
and importation of 5,500
rare clay tablets and
artifacts from Israel

20:36.133 --> 20:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the UAE, antiquities that
likely once came from Iraq.

20:40.400 --> 20:45.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Prosecutors allege that
company missed several
red flags indicating
that this purchase was

20:45.000 --> 20:46.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
highly suspicious.

20:46.766 --> 20:50.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Hobby Lobby argues this
was an innocent mistake
caused by inexperience.

20:50.133 --> 20:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In an agreement with the Justice
Department, the company must
now turn over all the artifacts

20:55.900 --> 20:57.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and pay $3 million.

20:57.466 --> 21:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hobby Lobby is a family-owned
evangelical Christian company.

21:01.033 --> 21:05.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were at the center of the
2014 Supreme Court case that
ruled companies can't be forced

21:05.766 --> 21:10.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to cover birth control for their
employees, and they're also
constructing a multimillion

21:12.366 --> 21:16.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
dollar bible museum here
in Washington, D.C. that
will open this fall.

21:17.466 --> 21:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For more on this case, I'm
joined now by Deborah Lehr.

21:19.566 --> 21:23.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She's chairman of George
Washington University's
Capitol Archaeological
Institute and she's

21:23.766 --> 21:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
founder of the Antiquities
Coalition, which works to stop
the looting of world cultures.

21:29.633 --> 21:31.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to the "NewsHour".

21:31.166 --> 21:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Can you tell me just the basics?

21:32.700 --> 21:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is -- you heard what I said
about the overview of this case.

21:36.033 --> 21:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is the government alleging
that Hobby Lobby did wrong here?

21:39.233 --> 21:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBORAH LEHR, FOUNDER,
ANTIQUITIES COALITION:
The government is alleging
that they imported

21:46.700 --> 21:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
knowingly items from
Iraq and that they used
falsified shipping labels
and that they didn't

21:54.800 --> 21:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get the appropriate import
permits to be able to
bring these antiquities
into the country.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BRANGHAM: And what
are these antiquities?

22:02.400 --> 22:04.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What are the items that
we're talking about?

22:04.500 --> 22:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEHR: They are things, as you
said, that are destined for
their biblical museum, and they

22:11.466 --> 22:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are clay tablets and cylinder
seals and ancient items that
were part of that time period in

22:16.433 --> 22:18.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Iraq.

22:18.533 --> 22:22.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANGHAM: So, my understanding
is the company says these were
not destined for the museum,

22:22.400 --> 22:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they said they were just part
of their larger collection.

22:24.700 --> 22:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the government also argues
that there were all sorts of
red flags that should have

22:31.466 --> 22:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tipped off Hobby Lobby
that this was not an
appropriate purchase to make.

22:36.566 --> 22:37.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Can you tell us what were
some of those red flags?

22:37.700 --> 22:40.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LEHR: Absolutely.

22:40.300 --> 22:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, Hobby Lobby is a
sophisticated importer
and they know very well
that you have to designate

22:46.300 --> 22:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the country of origin and the
appropriate tariff line when
bringing these into the country.

22:50.766 --> 22:52.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This was not done.

22:52.866 --> 22:57.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These items, instead of being
declared as antiquities, were
declared as clay tiles or

22:57.566 --> 22:59.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
samples.

22:59.666 --> 23:03.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were not noted that they
were coming from Iraq but,
instead, that they were coming

23:05.533 --> 23:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from turkey, and it's no mistake
that we have an agreement with
Iraq that if they were being

23:10.833 --> 23:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brought in and declared coming
from Iraq, they would have
to get an appropriate permit.

23:14.533 --> 23:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yet, we don't have a similar
type of agreement with Turkey.

23:18.133 --> 23:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're also coming from a part
of the world where conflict
antiquities are being actually

23:25.133 --> 23:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
excavated by groups like Daesh
or ISIS, and knowingly being
exported and used as a means

23:31.233 --> 23:33.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for funding terrorism.

23:33.266 --> 23:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, there are quite a few
red flags that they should have
known, and at a minimum they

23:37.433 --> 23:41.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
should have done provenance
research, which they didn't do.

23:41.566 --> 23:46.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What they actually paid
five individuals through
seven different accounts
and, as I said, then,

23:49.666 --> 23:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shipped these in different
packets, which might
be understandable, but
to several different

23:53.733 --> 23:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
locations in the United States
and without the appropriate
or accurate shipping records.

24:00.833 --> 24:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANGHAM: Now, the company
agreed they're going to give
back these items and willing

24:04.000 --> 24:07.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to pay this $3 million
to the government.

24:07.300 --> 24:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The company argues that they
are new to this business and
that this was really sort of

24:11.800 --> 24:16.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a rookie mistake, that
inexperience is what
caused these problems,
not any intentional

24:17.900 --> 24:20.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
looking past these
concerns you've raised.

24:20.766 --> 24:25.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEHR: Well, that's a very
interesting argument for a group
that has a business that's based

24:27.800 --> 24:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
largely on importing into the
country, and it's those two
claims that they are actually

24:32.433 --> 24:34.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
being fined for.

24:34.466 --> 24:38.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We could understand
potentially that they
may not be sophisticated
about the specifics

24:38.333 --> 24:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of what importing antiquities
from Iraq are involved, but
they are building a museum where

24:45.266 --> 24:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they are importing and
collecting historic items
from around the world.

24:47.733 --> 24:52.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we hope that there are
not other rookie mistakes that
they have made within their

24:52.666 --> 24:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bible museum and the
antiquities that are there.

24:55.266 --> 24:59.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANGHAM: I mean, Hobby Lobby
is certainly not the first
organization or institution

24:59.100 --> 25:01.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to sort of trip this
particular wire.

25:01.466 --> 25:06.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, major cultural
institutions in the
United States in the
past have had similar

25:06.266 --> 25:07.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
problems.

25:07.533 --> 25:09.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, this is -- it's
not an uncommon problem.

25:09.466 --> 25:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEHR: Well, it's not an uncommon
problem, but we haven't seen
a find quite this large,

25:16.333 --> 25:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that it's very hard to bring
about these kinds of cases,
though we commend the United

25:19.800 --> 25:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States government and
certainly ICE for the
seizures that they're making.

25:24.433 --> 25:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the trade in antiquities
and the list of antiquities
is a global problem, and we're

25:31.433 --> 25:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seeing it on the increase as
we see conflict in the Middle
East and -- where there are

25:36.066 --> 25:39.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
millions of sites still
yet to be excavated.

25:39.666 --> 25:44.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's very much just an
endless, almost excavation
that's out there for
thieves to take advantage

25:46.433 --> 25:48.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of.

25:48.433 --> 25:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANGHAM: As we mentioned,
they're building this enormous
museum and some of Hobby Lobby's

25:51.933 --> 25:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
40,000 other items apparently
are destined to go into this
museum, and other experts

25:58.900 --> 26:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in antiquities have raised
concerns about the speed at
which some of those items were

26:03.800 --> 26:04.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gathered.

26:04.966 --> 26:07.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Have you heard
those same concerns?

26:07.100 --> 26:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEHR: Yes, we've heard those
same concerns and one hopes
they have actually tone the

26:12.333 --> 26:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
type of provenance research
that they should be doing to
ensure these are not part of the

26:17.400 --> 26:19.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
illicit trade.

26:19.466 --> 26:23.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They actually had consulted one
of the leading cultural heritage
lawyers in the case of this

26:23.266 --> 26:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
specific import with items
coming of these 5,000 items
who had recommended that they

26:30.066 --> 26:32.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do a lot more
additional research.

26:32.066 --> 26:36.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so, they actually
had ignored the warning
they received from
their own attorney.

26:36.233 --> 26:37.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRANGHAM: All right.

26:37.666 --> 26:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Deborah Lehr of the Antiquities
Coalition, thanks so much.

WOODRUFF: now, the Trump
administration has set a lower
refugee limit for the U.S. for

26:58.366 --> 27:00.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this fiscal year.

27:00.433 --> 27:05.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the coming week, the U.S.

accepting 50,000 new refugees.

27:06.600 --> 27:09.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The city of Utica, New
York, has long taken a
more welcoming approach.

27:09.833 --> 27:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One out of every four citizens
there is a refugee and the
evidence is they're helping

PAUL SOLMAN, PBS NEWSHOUR
CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):
Post-industrial Utica,
New York, upstate,

27:28.600 --> 27:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
downtrodden, and, in the heart
of downtown, where the United
Methodist Church used to

27:32.666 --> 27:35.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be, a thriving mosque.

27:35.600 --> 27:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the world beyond Utica,
the tide of refugees rises,
the fear of foreigners swells.

27:44.133 --> 27:48.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Muslim terrorists, real
and imagined, haunt us.

27:48.666 --> 27:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Donald J. Trump is
calling for a total and complete
shutdown of Muslims entering

27:56.066 --> 27:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United States until our
country's representatives
can figure out what
the hell is going on.

28:03.600 --> 28:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: President Trump's
calls for even a partial Muslim
ban were repeatedly rebuffed

28:08.066 --> 28:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in court, but the Supreme Court
has now let some of it stand
until it considers the ban's

28:14.133 --> 28:16.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

28:16.666 --> 28:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when we asked Utica
Mayor Robert Palmieri
if the city would be
willing to resettle Syrian

28:21.800 --> 28:23.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
refugees --

28:23.733 --> 28:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAYOR ROBERT PALMIERI,
UTICA, NEW YORK: I would say,
absolutely, we would be, because

28:24.933 --> 28:25.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Utica starts with you.

28:25.933 --> 28:27.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's as simple as that.

28:27.900 --> 28:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: There's the humanitarian
aspect, of course, America's
historic promise to extend

28:31.900 --> 28:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a hand to huddled masses
yearning to breathe free.

28:35.966 --> 28:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But Utica likes the economics.

28:37.900 --> 28:40.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PALMIERI: They're
willing to work and they
work extremely hard.

28:40.233 --> 28:42.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's the rebound
for our great city.

SOLMAN: Refugee resettlement as
an economic development tool,
a Rust Belt revival strategy

28:47.933 --> 28:50.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Utica has pioneered.

28:50.566 --> 28:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After decades of decline --
the city lost a third of its
population when its factories

28:54.933 --> 28:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
closed -- Utica is growing
again, back up to 62,000 people,
thanks in part to its reputation

29:02.400 --> 29:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as, quote, the town that loves
refugees, who now make up one
out of every four residents.

29:09.400 --> 29:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thousands are Muslims from
Bosnia, refugees of the
war there in the 1990s.

SAKIB DURACAK, BOSNIAN

we left everything what
we have at that time

29:17.566 --> 29:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SOLMAN: Sakib Duracak,
who trained in Bosnia
as a construction

looking to build a new

life.

29:34.333 --> 29:37.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DURACAK: A huge opportunity,
because, at the time when we
came in Utica, it's a relatively

29:37.066 --> 29:39.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
very dead and poor city.

29:39.700 --> 29:44.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: Bosnians have
visibly spruced up Utica's
east side and beyond.

29:44.466 --> 29:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there's an even more
basic reason to welcome
refugees to a town like Utica.

ELLEN KRALY, COLGATE UNIVERSITY:
To have an economy, you have
to have workers, and you

29:51.266 --> 29:53.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have to have consumers.

29:53.300 --> 29:57.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: Professor Ellen
Kraly teaches demography at
nearby Colgate University.

29:57.166 --> 30:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KRALY: The influx of refugees
to Utica allowed us to retain
some smaller industries that

30:04.300 --> 30:06.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
were looking for
highly motivated labor.

30:06.966 --> 30:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

When she was 14 --

30:28.466 --> 30:32.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAW: Burmese army, they
just shoot our refugee
camp and make it burn.

30:34.433 --> 30:36.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
My sister's best

her 17-year-old sister
committed suicide.

30:41.366 --> 30:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAW: I think she tired of life.

30:43.700 --> 30:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Whole, our life, we have to
run, run, run, run for safety.

30:48.066 --> 30:53.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

years ago, worked as a nursing
home aide and housekeeper

30:53.000 --> 30:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
while studying English, then

joined the direct sales
firm Mary Kay Cosmetics.

31:03.100 --> 31:05.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%

worked her way up to the
coveted pink Cadillac.

PAW: I travel in
Albany, Buffalo.

31:09.800 --> 31:13.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's really hard, but
now I love to live here.

IBRAHIM ROSIC, BOSNIAN WAR

31:23.766 --> 31:26.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

AL SAAD: He got beat up.

34:55.400 --> 34:57.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I lost many friends of mine.

34:57.366 --> 35:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: They spent three years
in a camp on the Syrian border,
before being cleared for

35:01.666 --> 35:03.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
transit to the United States.

35:03.666 --> 35:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yousif al Saad went to work
at the Chobani yogurt plant
outside Utica, whose CEO, Hamdi

35:11.033 --> 35:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ulukaya, has championed
the rights of refugees and
hired hundreds of them.

35:18.033 --> 35:22.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were supposed to tape there,
but at the last minute, Chobani
pulled out, citing security

35:24.066 --> 35:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
concerns, fear for the safety
of employees in the current
political environment.

35:29.366 --> 35:33.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Understandably, as right
wing media had targeted
a Chobani plant in Twin
Falls, Idaho, where

35:34.733 --> 35:36.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
some 30 percent of the
workers are refugees.

35:36.866 --> 35:39.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALEX JONES, INFO WARS: So,
let's look at the headlines.

35:39.066 --> 35:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: According to
conspiracy theorist Alex
Jones, citing Breitbart --

35:42.733 --> 35:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONES: TB spiked 500 percent
in Twin Falls during 2012 as
Chobani yogurt opened the plant.

35:50.366 --> 35:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Idaho refugee boys admit to
sexually assaulting 5-year-old.

35:55.833 --> 35:57.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK.

35:57.933 --> 36:01.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Twin Falls refugee rape
special report: why
are refugees moving in?

36:01.866 --> 36:03.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Oh, the Chobani plant.

36:03.900 --> 36:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: But the sexual assault
by minors is shrouded in
secrecy, and the TB case spike

36:10.333 --> 36:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was from one positive test to
six, in a nearly 12,000 square
mile area that included twin

36:16.200 --> 36:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
falls, none of the cases
contagious, none involving
Chobani employees.

36:20.800 --> 36:22.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JONES: This isn't
some game people.

36:22.033 --> 36:23.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's a total Islamic
takeover taking place.

36:23.566 --> 36:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Behind the scenes, they got
Muslims following me around.

36:29.700 --> 36:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: In April, the
company sued Jones for false
and defamatory reports.

36:34.066 --> 36:36.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JONES: And I'm ready
to take them on.

36:36.233 --> 36:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Christ, please help us win this.

36:37.566 --> 36:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Please help me be strong.

36:39.566 --> 36:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: The following
month, Jones issued an
apology and a retraction.

36:41.833 --> 36:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONES: On behalf of Info Wars, I
regret that we mischaracterized
Chobani, its employees

36:48.166 --> 36:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the people of Twin
Falls, Idaho, the way we did.

36:50.233 --> 36:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: Two final follow-ups:
unemployment in Twin Falls
has dropped from 7 percent to

36:55.966 --> 36:59.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
3 percent since Chobani
came to town in 2012.

36:59.033 --> 37:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Please
remain standing for the
Pledge of Allegiance.

37:01.966 --> 37:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: And the Trump
administration is seeking
to cut the number of
refugees allowed annually

37:06.466 --> 37:10.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

JUDY WOODRUFF, PBS NEWSHOUR
ANCHOR: The technology
sector, and especially
the start-up culture

38:14.233 --> 38:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Silicon Valley, has long been
criticized for its record on
diversity, gender and inclusion.

38:21.233 --> 38:25.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, the spotlight is
being shone a spotlight
on the investors and
funders in the valley.

38:25.566 --> 38:26.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's Hari Sreenivasan.

38:26.566 --> 38:28.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

38:28.600 --> 38:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN, PBS NEWSHOUR
CORRESPONDENT: The scrutiny
has intensified in recent weeks

38:30.633 --> 38:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after two publications, "The
Information" and "The New York
Times," documented how prominent

38:36.700 --> 38:40.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
venture capitalists had
been accused of making
unwanted sexual advances
through texts, phone

38:41.166 --> 38:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
calls and physical intimidation.

38:43.233 --> 38:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These powerful investors used
their power to harass dozens
of women in whose companies

38:47.366 --> 38:49.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they might invest.

38:49.400 --> 38:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It led to the resignation of
Dave McClure, who was the CEO
of tech incubator, 500 Startups.

38:56.033 --> 38:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
McClure apologized after he was
accused of harassment by other
women and wrote to a prospective

39:01.300 --> 39:04.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
employee, quote, I was getting
confused figuring out whether
to hire you or hit on you.

39:06.633 --> 39:09.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Freada Kapor Klein is an
entrepreneur and leading voice
pushing companies to increase

39:09.566 --> 39:11.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
culture and diversity.

39:11.566 --> 39:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kapor Klein and her husband
invest in several startups,
including some funds run by 500

39:15.966 --> 39:16.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Startups.

39:16.966 --> 39:18.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She joins me now from Oakland.

39:18.466 --> 39:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Freada, you have been
working on this for decades.

39:20.466 --> 39:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why are those two stories in the
past couple of weeks resonating?

39:23.100 --> 39:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FREADA KAPOR KLEIN, FOUNDER,
LEVEL PLAYING INSTITUTE: Well,
I think, finally, Silicon

39:26.833 --> 39:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Valley is willing to look at
itself and to recognize it
may be on the leading edge of

39:33.200 --> 39:35.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
investing in tech.

39:35.366 --> 39:39.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's certainly on the
trailing edge of dealing
with its own ecosystem,
diversity and inclusion

39:41.766 --> 39:42.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in particular.

39:42.766 --> 39:43.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Why is it --

39:43.766 --> 39:44.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAPOR KLEIN: Venture capital --

39:44.766 --> 39:45.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SREENIVASAN: Go ahead.

39:45.766 --> 39:47.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAPOR KLEIN: Pardon?

39:47.733 --> 39:51.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was going to say, venture
capital is now looking at
behaviors that it's engaging in

39:53.200 --> 39:58.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that were addressed on Wall
Street more than 20 years ago.

40:00.100 --> 40:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: there aren't
exactly any stats on this,
but how pervasive is it?

40:02.066 --> 40:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, you've started projects
to include women and people
of color to try to foster

40:09.033 --> 40:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
change in the pipeline and it's
important to point out that
this isn't just about gender.

40:13.733 --> 40:16.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is also about race and
sexual orientation sometimes.

40:16.166 --> 40:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAPOR KLEIN: Exactly, and I
think a term that's a bit bulky
but a very important concept,

40:23.166 --> 40:27.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
what we see is
intersectionality,
meaning we can have
multiple identities.

40:29.166 --> 40:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's important to point out
that the women who told their
stories to the information

40:32.300 --> 40:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about binary capital and the
women who came forward against
Dave McClure in the "New York

40:39.300 --> 40:43.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Times," all of those were
women of color, and talking
about unwelcome advances from

40:44.133 --> 40:46.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Caucasian men.

40:46.233 --> 40:50.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we need to look at that
racial dynamic as it's layered
in with the gender dynamic.

40:52.400 --> 40:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And you're absolutely right.

40:54.266 --> 40:56.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's an abuse of power.

40:56.233 --> 40:59.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: One of the
interesting things people point
out about Uber is that there

40:59.266 --> 41:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were so many different
scandals where nothing
happened to the CEO really
until his big investors

41:05.800 --> 41:08.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
signed a letter and
asked him to step down.

41:08.233 --> 41:12.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It seems that money
talks much louder here.

41:12.500 --> 41:16.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAPOR KLEIN: Unfortunately,
money does talk much louder.

41:16.900 --> 41:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we've hit an era in
venture capital where greed is
everything and it, again, mimics

41:24.633 --> 41:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wall Street in the 1990s where
greed is good was a commonplace
statement and, in fact,

41:31.966 --> 41:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a commencement speech.

41:33.966 --> 41:38.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think now we have to
look at is the only thing
that matters dollars?

41:39.866 --> 41:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is it the dollars that get
invested in the entrepreneur?

41:42.400 --> 41:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is it the, quote-unquote,
unicorn status meaning
the billion-dollar
evaluation of a startup?

41:48.333 --> 41:52.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when are we going to expand
the ledger sheet to include
how people are treated, to

41:54.666 --> 41:59.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
include how venture capital
and startups behave as citizens
of the communities and of the

42:00.933 --> 42:03.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

42:03.000 --> 42:06.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: So, how do you
change that dynamic for venture
funding that's all chasing those

42:06.033 --> 42:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unicorns, they all want to get
rich quick, they all want to
fund the right startup that's

42:09.166 --> 42:12.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
going to make billions
and billions of dollars,
and it seems that
they're almost enabling

42:12.333 --> 42:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a culture that goes on because,
hey, it's all about profits?

42:15.766 --> 42:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAPOR KLEIN: Well, I think
that's right, and I think there
are several groups that are

42:19.700 --> 42:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to need to join
forces to make that change.

42:23.800 --> 42:28.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The venture capital
community itself has to
say, wait a second, we
aren't with the bottom

42:30.400 --> 42:34.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of the bottom here, and
we need to work to clean
up our own industry.

42:34.433 --> 42:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we also need to see the
limited partners who invest
in these venture funds need to

42:41.433 --> 42:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
start doing different kinds of
due diligence, different kinds
of demands about diversity

42:47.200 --> 42:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and inclusion in the venture
capital firm itself, in the
companies that are funded and

42:52.700 --> 42:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the values of the
startups that are created.

42:55.266 --> 42:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, the limited partners
can create a lot of change.

42:59.500 --> 43:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The entrepreneurs
themselves, one of the
things we need to point
out is that venture capital

43:06.866 --> 43:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as currently constructed
is leaving billions of
dollars on the table
because they're overlooking

43:12.500 --> 43:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
underrepresented entrepreneurs
who have great ideas and who
can serve real communities'

43:19.466 --> 43:20.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
real needs.

WOODRUFF: Chuck Berry was a
pioneer in his field, often
referred to as the father of

43:42.000 --> 43:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rock 'n' roll who influenced
a generation of musicians.

CORRESPONDENT: You know
it when you hear it.

44:02.000 --> 44:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Beginning in the mid-1950s,
Chuck Berry helped define the
sound and look, the attitude and

44:10.400 --> 44:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
raw power of rock 'n' roll.

44:13.933 --> 44:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The man is now gone, but his
music lives on, in a new album,
titled "Chuck," berry's first

album since 1979.

44:23.300 --> 44:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He'd worked on the project off

and on his 90th birthday,

44:29.666 --> 44:32.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%

personal memories of the man and

his music.

44:48.533 --> 44:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLES BERRY, JR., SON OF
CHUCK BERRY: This was a guy
when he was a little boy he sold

44:51.333 --> 44:54.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
vegetables off a
cart with his father.

44:54.400 --> 44:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a man that worked
at a General Motors
plant, not assembling the
cars, but as a janitor.

45:01.566 --> 45:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He heard from other people the
significance that he brought
to the table, but my -- he

45:08.466 --> 45:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
didn't really dwell on that.

45:10.533 --> 45:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLES BERRY III, GRANDSON
OF CHUCK BERRY: I remember in
elementary school, I'd have

45:11.966 --> 45:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
teachers coming up to me
like, who's your grandfather?

45:13.933 --> 45:16.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'd be like, pawpaw (ph).

45:16.766 --> 45:18.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They were like, that's so cool.

45:18.766 --> 45:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN (on camera): Did
you have any idea who your
grandfather was in history?

45:22.833 --> 45:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLES BERRY III: I always
knew he played the guitar,
but I didn't think he was like

45:27.466 --> 45:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this bigger than life
person to everybody else
because he was just pawpaw.

45:31.566 --> 45:32.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
BROWN: Yes.

45:32.766 --> 45:34.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Oh, boy, did he play
the guitar, huh?

45:34.300 --> 45:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHARLES BERRY III: Oh, yes.

45:36.500 --> 45:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN (voice-over): In fact,
both Charles and Charlie play
the guitar and had the chance

45:43.200 --> 45:45.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to play with Chuck.

45:45.033 --> 45:47.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Charles is part of the
band for many years.

45:47.800 --> 45:52.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Since Chuck's death, they've
played on, here just recently
promoting the new album on "The

45:55.400 --> 45:59.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The album charts Chuck
Berry's life in stages,
an autobiographical
epitaph of sorts.

46:02.000 --> 46:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the song "Big Boys," he
returns to his childhood with
the ambitions of a teenager,

46:06.566 --> 46:11.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
while "The Eyes of Man"
describes the wisdom
of women in his life.

46:14.033 --> 46:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLES BERRY JR.: It's almost
to the point that he was being
philosophical over his life

46:21.466 --> 46:26.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and letting everybody
else knows, like, hey,
from a wonderful woman
to a big boy to an

46:27.666 --> 46:31.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
eye of a man, here's my book.

46:31.966 --> 46:36.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here's the next chapter of
my life that you get to have,
and I hope you enjoy it.

46:38.933 --> 46:41.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: Berry continued to
perform into his late '80s,
including his renowned monthly

46:41.566 --> 46:46.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
gig at Blueberry Hill,
a diner and music venue
in his native St. Louis.

46:46.133 --> 46:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC CLAPTON, MUSICIAN: He's
really laid the law down for
playing that kind of music.

46:53.100 --> 46:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, MUSICIAN:
When I'm 65 or 70, I've
got to tell my grandkids.

46:56.933 --> 46:58.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Yes, I met Chuck Berry.

46:58.400 --> 47:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As a matter of fact, I backed
up Chuck Berry one night.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
You did?

47:04.000 --> 47:05.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

47:05.966 --> 47:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LITTLE RICHARD, MUSICIAN:
My favorite song with
Chuck is all of 'em.

47:09.300 --> 47:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: His influence is
everywhere in rock music.

47:16.300 --> 47:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The initial cultural jolt was
jokingly portrayed in the 1985
hit movie, "Back to the Future."

47:28.500 --> 47:32.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And honored nine years
later in" Pulp Fiction."

47:32.000 --> 47:37.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEVIN STRAIT, MUSEUM CURATOR:
Rock and roll has such a firm
place in our cultural memory.

47:40.066 --> 47:43.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BROWN: Kevin Strait is
a musical historian and
curator at the museum.

47:43.866 --> 47:46.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
STRAIT: He's one of the
primary sonic architects
of rock and roll.

47:46.933 --> 47:51.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he helped establish this
art form that we all know and
love, and that really sort

47:51.666 --> 47:53.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of took over the world.

47:53.233 --> 47:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Its helm really was this
young musician from St. Louis.

47:57.000 --> 48:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, he really sort
of helped to sort of establish
the template for how rock

48:03.733 --> 48:05.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and roll should sound.

48:05.600 --> 48:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, he's a
phenomenal guitar player,
phenomenal showman.

48:08.233 --> 48:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: Strait acquired objects
from Berry for the museum's
musical crossroads collection,

48:14.100 --> 48:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
including this prized guitar.

48:15.333 --> 48:17.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STRAIT: This guitar
is pretty special.

48:17.433 --> 48:19.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a Gibson ES-350T.

48:19.500 --> 48:24.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it's one of his early
touring and recording guitars
that he used, and it's nicknamed

48:24.966 --> 48:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Maybellene after his first hit.

48:26.233 --> 48:27.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BROWN (on camera):
Yes, quite a first hit.

48:27.900 --> 48:31.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Quite a name, right?

48:31.600 --> 48:33.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(MUSIC)

48:33.133 --> 48:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN (voice-over): And that
red 1973 Cadillac Eldorado?

48:49.000 --> 48:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Berry drove it on stage in
1986 for his 60th birthday and
the filming of the documentary

48:54.866 --> 48:57.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"Hail, Hail Rock 'n' Roll".

48:57.066 --> 49:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was at the Fox Theater
in St. Louis, which had denied
him entry as a child because

49:01.833 --> 49:03.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he was black.

49:03.966 --> 49:08.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHUCK BERRY, MUSICIAN:
And my forefathers a few
blocks away were sold
on the civil courthouse

49:12.300 --> 49:17.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
steps, sold, and
that's a big change.

49:19.733 --> 49:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES BERRY JR.: It was
difficult, absolutely,
but as opposed to,
man, these white people

49:25.366 --> 49:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are just, they're playing me.

49:26.366 --> 49:28.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My God, I can't -- nope.

49:28.366 --> 49:33.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My dad took it as, oh, so you're
telling me I can't go in the
front of this venue to play

49:34.433 --> 49:36.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in front of this crowd.

49:36.700 --> 49:41.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
OK, I'm going to keep
writing my music.

49:42.433 --> 49:43.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're going to change.

49:43.433 --> 49:45.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm going to make it.

49:45.633 --> 49:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm going to make a scenario
where the people that are
listening to my music are having

49:52.566 --> 49:56.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
such a blast that skin
color becomes irrelevant.

49:56.500 --> 50:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN (on camera): How do you
see what your grandfather,
what he went through and what

50:02.100 --> 50:04.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he achieved?

50:04.100 --> 50:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLES BERRY III: That you
could go from selling out a
packed house to then being told

50:06.966 --> 50:08.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you can't stay in
this hotel room.

50:08.933 --> 50:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is like I that probably
would have left me pretty
bitter throughout the rest of my

50:12.666 --> 50:14.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

50:14.700 --> 50:19.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I don't know because what
he's done with his music and
everything, it's just that much

50:21.333 --> 50:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more amazing because he was
able to do it during that time.

50:27.900 --> 50:31.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BROWN: A pioneering life
that had dramatic ups
and downs, for sure.

50:34.233 --> 50:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, "Chuck" the album
adds new music to what was
already an enormous legacy.

50:40.733 --> 50:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

50:51.333 --> 50:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Love his music.

50:55.266 --> 50:58.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And now to another in our
"Brief but Spectacular Series".

50:58.466 --> 51:01.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Tonight, we hear
from Georgina Kleege.

51:01.000 --> 51:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's a lecturer in the English
department at the University
of California, Berkeley.

51:05.200 --> 51:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her forthcoming book is "More

51:12.633 --> 51:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGINA KLEEGE, LECTURER,
UC BERKELEY DEPARTMENT
OF ENGLISH: It's a common
experience for people

51:14.733 --> 51:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with disabilities to feel that
they are being stared at or to
notice they are being stared

51:18.266 --> 51:20.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at.

51:20.266 --> 51:24.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in fact, blind people
can feel that, too, a kind of
collective intake of breath even

51:26.900 --> 51:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if nobody says anything, you can
tell when you attract attention.

51:37.900 --> 51:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am legally blind, I
became legally blind, I was
diagnosed when I was 11.

51:44.466 --> 51:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I probably lost my vision
gradually over a few years.

51:48.033 --> 51:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I remember feeling that I
wasn't supposed to feel anything
about it, because there wasn't

51:53.933 --> 51:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
anything anybody could do.

51:55.800 --> 51:59.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My complicated relationship
with Helen Keller
came from childhood.

51:59.366 --> 52:04.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She was held up as this
role model that she
was deaf and blind, but
she was always cheerful

52:05.833 --> 52:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and she did well in school and
you never heard her complain.

52:09.066 --> 52:10.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I took this very personally.

52:10.666 --> 52:15.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I took this as a
reproach towards me.

52:15.366 --> 52:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I hated Helen Keller and I
loved Helen Keller jokes and
I, you know, told them with

52:23.300 --> 52:26.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
relish in the schoolyard.

52:26.466 --> 52:31.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I started to wonder if I
had been unfair to Helen
Keller when I was a child.

52:33.433 --> 52:37.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I ended up writing a book
about her, which is a series
of letters by me, to her, and

52:39.433 --> 52:42.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
she doesn't write back
because she's dead.

52:42.000 --> 52:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's basically me asking
questions about different
moments in her life
and calling her out and

52:51.233 --> 52:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
asking her to explain herself.

52:53.633 --> 52:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so, it was a way for me to
enter her life imaginatively.

52:57.633 --> 53:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I tell my students all the
time that they should tell
their friends not to text while

53:04.600 --> 53:09.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
walking because I am always
bumping into people who
are texting while walking.

53:11.533 --> 53:16.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then they make themselves
a hazard to blind people,
because I am counting on all

53:18.100 --> 53:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the other pedestrians to pay
attention, to see me coming
and to get out of my way.

53:24.433 --> 53:29.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think there is still
discrimination in
all sorts of arenas.

53:29.000 --> 53:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's problems with access
to Web sites and electronic
media and so on and so forth,

53:36.833 --> 53:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
captioning, audio description.

53:38.833 --> 53:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The technology exists, people
know how to do this, but
it's not as if everything is

53:42.900 --> 53:45.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
made accessible.

53:45.033 --> 53:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The problem is that
people's understanding of
blindness is very limited.

53:52.466 --> 53:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's the sort of
joke scenario of a blind
person coming to an
intersection and somebody

53:58.033 --> 54:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
grabbing their arm and leading
them across the street when
in fact they wanted to go

54:01.433 --> 54:03.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a different direction.

54:03.466 --> 54:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's never happened to me
and I think part of it is jus
that I tend to look like I know

54:10.400 --> 54:12.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
where I'm going.

54:12.333 --> 54:15.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I
would agree with that.

54:15.400 --> 54:17.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

KLEEGE: My name is Georgina
Kleege and this is my brief but
spectacular take on blindness.

54:22.166 --> 54:23.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
