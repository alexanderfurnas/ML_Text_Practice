WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Continuing
our theme of national parks,
the Channel Islands National

00:04.233 --> 00:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Park -- they're off the coast
of Southern California -- was
the site of a recent discovery

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of part of a Pygmy mammoth, a
species of ancient elephant that
roamed the Earth 13,000 years

00:14.100 --> 00:16.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ago.

00:16.666 --> 00:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This story was produced
by students from Etiwanda
High School in Southern
California, part of

00:19.333 --> 00:21.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the "NewsHour"'s
Student Reporting Labs.

00:21.400 --> 00:25.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's narrated by rising high
school senior Nick Hinojosa.

00:25.066 --> 00:30.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK HINOJOSA: Off the
California coast lies
Channel Islands National
Park, where archaeological

00:31.466 --> 00:33.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
discoveries are
still being made.

00:33.633 --> 00:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Laura Kirn is the chief of
cultural resources for the
Channel Islands National Park.

00:37.333 --> 00:39.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURA KIRN, Chief of
Cultural Resources, Channel
Islands National Park:
Channel Islands national

00:39.033 --> 00:41.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
park is world-famous
for its archaeology.

00:41.866 --> 00:46.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Channel Islands really represent
a part of California that
doesn't exist on the mainland

00:47.633 --> 00:49.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
anymore.

00:49.700 --> 00:53.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And because we don't
have burrowing animals
here, the archaeological
record, the evidence

00:55.833 --> 00:58.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the ground is intact.

00:58.866 --> 01:01.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that is unheard of.

01:01.400 --> 01:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK HINOJOSA: The
preservation of the islands'
archaeology has made it
possible for new artifacts

01:04.733 --> 01:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be discovered, such as a
mammoth skull excavated in
fall 2016 on Santa Rosa Island.

01:11.666 --> 01:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Monica Bugbee, a preparator and
archaeologist for the mammoth
site in South Dakota, has

01:15.766 --> 01:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
begun the painstaking
process of removing the
skull from its plaster cast.

01:19.566 --> 01:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MONICA BUGBEE, Preparator:
This is kind of an
exciting discovery
because Pygmy mammoths,

01:23.700 --> 01:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even though they're really
cool, everybody likes them
because they're small, they're

01:27.266 --> 01:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
neat, we actually don't
know a whole lot about them.

01:29.333 --> 01:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This guy was found by a
park service intern who
was doing a stream survey.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, they were just doing
routine walk down a canyon,
and they happened to notice it.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK HINOJOSA: The intern who
discovered the skull, Peter
Larramendy, was a recent college

01:43.133 --> 01:46.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
graduate who recognized the
tusk sticking out of the wall
could be something much more

01:46.866 --> 01:48.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than just a rock.

01:48.066 --> 01:50.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LAURA KIRN: He was
part of the excavation.

01:50.100 --> 01:54.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was something that you dream
about as a child, discovering
something like a dinosaur

01:55.366 --> 01:57.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or something really exciting.

01:57.966 --> 02:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK HINOJOSA: Don Morris
is a retired archaeologist
for the National Park
Service who aided in

02:01.266 --> 02:03.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the excavation of
this discovery.

02:03.333 --> 02:08.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DON MORRIS, National
Park Service: I think
I can confidently say
this is the best skull,

02:09.533 --> 02:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Pygmy mammoth skull, that's
ever come off the island.

02:11.433 --> 02:14.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Certainly, it's the best
one I have ever seen.

02:14.033 --> 02:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MONICA BUGBEE: This skull
in particular, because
it looks like it might
be in the middle of

02:18.566 --> 02:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the two species, Columbian and
Pygmy, it can give us a much
better idea of how that process

02:24.166 --> 02:25.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
actually worked.

02:25.866 --> 02:28.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You know, how did they
actually dwarf from
Columbians to Pygmies?

02:28.866 --> 02:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK HINOJOSA: Scientists used
radiocarbon dating to discover
how long ago this mammoth

02:33.633 --> 02:35.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was alive.

02:35.600 --> 02:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This kind of dating is done
by measuring the amount of
carbon-14 in a sample and using

02:39.233 --> 02:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
its half-life to calculate
how old the sample is.

02:41.733 --> 02:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MONICA BUGBEE: There was some
charcoal that we found in the
dirt, and we radiocarbon dated

02:46.533 --> 02:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, and it's about 15,000
years old, I believe, so this
guy's actually pretty young.

02:53.600 --> 02:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK HINOJOSA: Justin Wilkins,
a curator at the mammoth site,
has been working with Bugbee

02:56.700 --> 02:58.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to clean and prepare
the skull for display.

02:58.800 --> 03:03.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUSTIN WILKINS, Curator: So
in looking at the past, we can
then access how our species

03:05.200 --> 03:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or other species handled
changes in the environment.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, we look at the mammoths.

03:09.066 --> 03:11.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We look at humans.

03:11.133 --> 03:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We also look at a bunch of
small animals to see how those
animals handle these changes,

03:15.600 --> 03:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then try to decide, predict,
based on the information and
patterns we see from these

03:22.600 --> 03:25.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
specimens, what patterns we're
seeing in the present, how
that's going to change in the

03:25.400 --> 03:27.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
future.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK HINOJOSA: Much
of archaeology still
depends on careful
observation and human work.

03:29.900 --> 03:31.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DON MORRIS: You have
got to move dirt.

03:31.966 --> 03:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have got to keep your
eyes open and pay attention
to what you're observing.

03:36.200 --> 03:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURA KIRN: It's incredibly
exciting to think that
these things are still
out here, they're

03:43.100 --> 03:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still very fragile, and we
want to protect them and
study them in the right ways.

03:48.766 --> 03:51.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it doesn't mean that people
can't still discover exciting
new things that happen to

03:53.266 --> 03:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be thousands of years
old on Santa Rosa Island.
