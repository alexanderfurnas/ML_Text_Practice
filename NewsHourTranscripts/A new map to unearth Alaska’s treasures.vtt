The U.S. Geological Survey on
Tuesday released
its first ever digital map of
the nation's

00:11.879 --> 00:18.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
northernmost state. In vibrant
colors, it
reveals thousands of Alaska's
geological details

00:18.819 --> 00:24.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that can be used to contribute
to mineral,
energy, hazard, and other types
of scientific

00:24.458 --> 00:26.226 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
assessments.

Shades of red represent areas
where rare-earth
elements, like those used in
electronics,

00:31.064 --> 00:37.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are most likely to be uncovered,
while green
represents the rocks where most
dinosaur fossils

00:37.070 --> 00:44.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are found. It took Frederic
Wilson, along
with a team of a dozen unpaid
retired scientists,

00:44.578 --> 00:51.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some 20 years to create. They
drew on more
than 750 references, some dating
back to the

00:51.351 --> 00:53.654 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
early 1900s.

Scientists say a map like this
could help
identify new earthquake fault
zones and help

the oil and gas industry scope
out their next
big find.
