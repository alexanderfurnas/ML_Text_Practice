00:58.800 --> 00:59.700

01:01.967 --> 01:03.033
FOR MANY YEARS, OUR SON SUFFERED

01:03.033 --> 01:04.800
FROM DEPRESSION.

01:04.800 --> 01:06.300
IT GRIEVES US BEYOND BELIEF TO

01:06.300 --> 01:07.567
KNOW THAT HIS PAIN FOUND ITS

01:07.567 --> 01:08.333
EXPRESSION IN THIS HEINOUS ACT

02:09.333 --> 02:11.100
ON THE DEAL TO CURB IRAN'S

02:11.100 --> 02:12.667
NUCLEAR PROGRAM, WHICH WOULD

02:12.667 --> 02:14.233
LIFT THE SANCTIONS ON IRAN IN

02:14.233 --> 02:16.100
EXCHANGE FOR ALLOWING U.N.

02:21.667 --> 02:22.433

02:22.433 --> 02:24.533
RUN" AROUND CONGRESS, SAYING

02:24.533 --> 02:25.567
LAWMAKERS HAVEN'T EVEN HAD A

02:25.567 --> 02:27.900
CHANCE TO EXAMINE THE AGREEMENT.

02:27.900 --> 02:29.300
THE STATE DEPARTMENT SENT THE

02:29.300 --> 02:30.267
DETAILED PACT TO CONGRESS ONLY

02:30.267 --> 02:31.767
TODAY.

02:31.767 --> 02:33.367
LAWMAKERS HAVE 60 DAYS TO REVIEW

02:33.367 --> 02:34.100
IT, AND ANOTHER 22 DAYS TO VOTE

02:34.100 --> 02:36.667
ON IT.

02:36.667 --> 02:38.067
SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY

02:38.067 --> 02:38.833
SAYS THE DEAL IS THE BEST WAY TO

02:38.833 --> 02:39.767
STOP IRAN FROM GETTING A NUCLEAR

02:39.767 --> 02:41.667
BOMB.

02:41.667 --> 02:43.667
>> IF CONGRESS SAYS NO TO THIS

02:43.667 --> 02:45.267
DEAL, THEN THERE WILL BE NO

02:45.267 --> 02:46.967
RESTRAINTS ON IRAN, THERE WILL

02:46.967 --> 02:48.933
BE NO SANCTIONS LEFT, OUR

02:48.933 --> 02:50.967
FRIENDS IN THIS EFFORT WILL

02:50.967 --> 02:52.500
DESERT US, WE WILL BE VIEWED AS

02:52.500 --> 02:54.167
HAVING KILLED THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:54.167 --> 02:55.967
STOP THEM FROM HAVING A WEAPON,

02:55.967 --> 02:57.667
THEY WILL BEGIN TO ENRICH AGAIN,

02:57.667 --> 02:58.767
AND THE GREATER LIKELIHOOD IS

02:58.767 --> 02:59.633
WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID THEY

02:59.633 --> 03:01.033
OTHER DAY, YOU'LL HAVE A WAR.

03:01.033 --> 03:02.000
>> Sreenivasan: ISRAELI PRIME

03:02.000 --> 03:03.133
MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAYS

03:03.133 --> 03:04.700
THE PACT WON'T STOP THAT FROM

03:04.700 --> 03:06.000
HAPPENING.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.400
>> I THINK THE RIGHT THING TO DO

03:07.400 --> 03:08.867
IS MERELY NOT TO GO AHEAD WITH

03:08.867 --> 03:10.200
THIS DEAL, THERE ARE MANY OTHER

03:10.200 --> 03:11.467
THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE TO STOP

03:11.467 --> 03:13.400
IRAN'S AGGRESSION, BUT MAKING

03:13.400 --> 03:16.467
THIS DEAL IS NOT ONE OF THEM.

03:16.467 --> 03:17.967
>> Sreenivasan: THE OBAMA

03:17.967 --> 03:18.667
ADMINISTRATION AGREED TO LIFT

03:18.667 --> 03:19.433
ECONOMIC SANCTIONS ON IRAN IN

03:19.433 --> 03:20.133
EXCHANGE FOR ALLOWING WEAPONS

03:20.133 --> 03:21.400
INSPECTIONS, BUT ONLY CONGRESS

03:21.400 --> 03:22.500
HAS THE POWER TO ACTUALLY REPEAL

03:22.500 --> 03:28.267
OR REJECT THOSE SANCTIONS.

03:28.267 --> 03:29.767
IN UKRAINE, GOVERNMENT FORCES

03:29.767 --> 03:31.667
AND PRO-RUSSIAN SEPARATISTS ARE

03:31.667 --> 03:34.167
ACCUSING EACH OTHER OF VIOLATING

03:34.167 --> 03:35.667
A CEASEFIRE, LAST NIGHT IN THE

03:35.667 --> 03:36.400
CITY OF DONETSK, IN THE EASTERN

03:36.400 --> 03:37.933
PART OF THE COUNTRY.

03:37.933 --> 03:39.667
PRO-RUSSIAN REBELS CLAIM THE

03:39.667 --> 03:41.067
UKRAINIAN MILITARY DESTROYED

03:41.067 --> 03:42.667
BUILDINGS AND KILLED AT LEAST

03:42.667 --> 03:43.500
ONE CIVILIAN IN THE SHELLING OF

03:43.500 --> 03:45.533
A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD.

03:45.533 --> 03:46.933
BUT THE UKRAINE GOVERNMENT SAYS

03:46.933 --> 03:48.100
THE REBELS WERE THE ONES WHO

03:48.100 --> 03:49.067
TARGETED THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND

03:49.067 --> 03:52.333
FIRED ON UKRAINIAN POSITIONS.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.300
DONETSK HAS NOT SEEN ANY

03:53.300 --> 03:56.133
FIGHTING SINCE FEBRUARY.

03:56.133 --> 03:57.433
AN INTERNATIONAL MONITORING

03:57.433 --> 03:58.667
GROUP SAYS NEITHER SIDE IS FULLY

03:58.667 --> 04:01.133
COMPLYING WITH THE PEACE DEAL.

04:01.133 --> 04:02.100
WHILE THE ISLAMIC STATE MILITANT

04:02.100 --> 04:03.167
GROUP, OR ISIS, CAPTURES CITIES

04:03.167 --> 04:04.667
IN SYRIA AND IRAQ, CARRIES OUT

04:04.667 --> 04:07.433
SUICIDE BOMBINGS, IT IS ALSO

04:07.433 --> 04:08.267
WORKING TO BUILD A NEW

04:08.267 --> 04:10.400
GENERATION OF JIHADIST FIGHTERS.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.900
IN A STORY PUBLISHED TODAY,

04:11.900 --> 04:13.667
ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTER ZEINA

04:13.667 --> 04:15.667
KARAM DESCRIBES HOW ISIS IS

04:15.667 --> 04:17.500
INDOCTRINATING YOUNG BOYS IN

04:17.500 --> 04:19.400
SCHOOLS AND MOSQUES, AND

04:19.400 --> 04:22.167
TRAINING THEM WITH WEAPONS.

04:22.167 --> 04:26.567
SHE JOINS ME NOW FROM BEIRUT.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.367
SO TELL ME, YOUR REPORT, ONE OF

04:28.367 --> 04:30.833
THE MOST DISTURBING FACTS IS

04:30.833 --> 04:32.667
LITTLE KIDS ARE BEHEADING DOLLS

04:32.667 --> 04:33.467
FOR PRACTICE.

04:33.467 --> 04:38.800
WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE?

04:38.800 --> 04:39.800
>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT.

04:39.800 --> 04:44.067
AS WE WERE REPORTING THIS STORY,

04:44.067 --> 04:45.333
WE HEARD HORRIBLE STORIES FROM

04:45.333 --> 04:49.267
PEOPLE WHO FLED THE ISIS AREAS

04:49.267 --> 04:52.600
AND ONE OF THEM WAS A

04:52.600 --> 04:55.867
14-YEAR-OLD TEENAGER WHO TOLD US

04:55.867 --> 04:57.600
ABOUT THIS TIME IN A TRAINING

04:57.600 --> 05:01.767
CAMP IN RUSSIA, IN NORTHERN

05:01.767 --> 05:04.900
SYRIA.

05:04.900 --> 05:08.733
THE BOY WAS PICKED OUT FROM HIS

05:08.733 --> 05:10.100
FAMILY AND HUNDREDS OF OTHERS

05:10.100 --> 05:12.733
FROM HIS FAITH WHEN ISIS OVERRAN

05:12.733 --> 05:14.667
PARTS OF NORTHERN IRAQ LAST

05:14.667 --> 05:15.700
SUMMER.

05:15.700 --> 05:19.067
AND HE ENDED UP IN TRAINING CAMP

05:19.067 --> 05:23.500
AND SPENT THE NEXT FIVE MONTHS

05:23.500 --> 05:25.767
LEARNING HOW TO USE WEAPONS,

05:25.767 --> 05:30.867
TRAINING ON EXPLOSIVES.

05:30.867 --> 05:35.367
THEY CHANGED HIS FACE TO MUSE

05:35.367 --> 05:36.667
LIMB.

05:36.667 --> 05:39.333
HE WAS FORCED TO MEMORIZE THE

05:39.333 --> 05:39.867
KORAN.

05:39.867 --> 05:42.800
AND MOST DISTURBINGLY OF ALL, HE

05:42.800 --> 05:45.767
WAS -- AMONG OTHER KIDS HE WAS

05:45.767 --> 05:47.833
FORCED TO WATCH BEHEADINGS.

05:47.833 --> 05:49.967
AND HE SAID HOW KIDS WERE HANDED

05:49.967 --> 05:53.000
SWORDS AND GUNS AND ASKED TO

05:53.000 --> 05:57.500
CHOP OFF THE HEADS OF THE DOLLS

05:57.500 --> 05:58.967
AS PRACTICE ON BEHEADINGS.

05:58.967 --> 06:04.267
AND HE HOLD US, YOU KNOW, THAT

06:04.267 --> 06:07.767
HE COULDN'T DO IT AND THEN THEY

06:07.767 --> 06:09.500
MILITARY TOLD THEM HOW TO HOLD

06:09.500 --> 06:13.333
THE SWORD AND HOW TO DO IT

06:13.333 --> 06:15.400
RIGHT, AND THEY TOLD THEM THESE

06:15.400 --> 06:20.033
ARE THE HEADS OF THE INFIDELS.

06:20.033 --> 06:22.000
SO -- BUT THAT'S WHAT KIDS ARE

06:22.000 --> 06:25.300
SUBJECTED TO IN ISLAM STATE

06:25.300 --> 06:27.233
TRAINING CAMPS IN SYRIA AND

06:27.233 --> 06:28.167
IRAQ.

06:28.167 --> 06:29.667
>> Sreenivasan: SO WHY IS ISIS

06:29.667 --> 06:30.500
TARGETING CHILDREN?

06:30.500 --> 06:33.167
DO THEY FEEL THEIR A LOST CAUSE

06:33.167 --> 06:35.067
OR IT'S HARDER TO CONVERT THEM

06:35.067 --> 06:36.933
AND BELIEVE BUT A KID YOU CAN

06:36.933 --> 06:38.667
ALMOST TRAIN AND MOLD?

06:38.667 --> 06:39.367
>> Reporter: WELL, YES.

06:39.367 --> 06:41.900
QUITE SIMPLY, THE ISIS GROUP IS

06:41.900 --> 06:43.667
TRYING TO BUILD A NEW GENERATION

06:43.667 --> 06:44.200
OF MILITANTS.

06:44.200 --> 06:49.233
THEY ARE TRYING TO MOLD A NEW

06:49.233 --> 06:50.433
GENERATION OF -- AND THE GROUP

06:50.433 --> 06:51.967
HAS SO MANY ENEMIES AND THEY

06:51.967 --> 06:54.600
KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT POPULAR,

06:54.600 --> 06:57.200
YOU KNOW, PARTICULARLY IN SYRIA

06:57.200 --> 06:59.067
AND MOST OF THE PLACES THAT THEY

06:59.067 --> 07:00.100
CONTROL, THEY KNOW THEY ARE NOT

07:00.100 --> 07:00.933
POPULAR.

07:00.933 --> 07:02.267
THEY KNOW THAT PEOPLE -- MOST --

07:02.267 --> 07:05.000
OR MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY HATE

07:05.000 --> 07:06.067
THEM.

07:06.067 --> 07:08.400
AND SO, YOU KNOW, ONE RESIDENT

07:08.400 --> 07:11.667
TOLD US THAT THEY COMPENSATE ON

07:11.667 --> 07:12.500
THE CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY

07:12.500 --> 07:14.967
BELIEVE THAT THE ADULTS ARE A

07:14.967 --> 07:19.333
LOST CAUSE, AND SO THEY FOCUS ON

07:19.333 --> 07:21.867
TRAINING AND BRAINWASHING KIDS

07:21.867 --> 07:23.733
ALMOST TO THE POINT OF

07:23.733 --> 07:24.467
OBSESSION.

07:24.467 --> 07:25.167
>> Sreenivasan: AND HOW MANY

07:25.167 --> 07:26.167
CHILDREN ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

07:26.167 --> 07:28.100
OR HOW DO YOU ESTIMATE THAT?

07:28.100 --> 07:30.767
HOW ARE THEY INGRATIATING

07:30.767 --> 07:32.133
THEMSELVES OR WINNING THE FAVOR

07:32.133 --> 07:35.700
OF THESE KIDS?

07:35.700 --> 07:37.133
>> Reporter: THEY USE LOTS OF

07:37.133 --> 07:38.800
WAYS, ANY WAY AT THEIR DISPOSAL,

07:38.800 --> 07:40.167
THEY WILL USE.

07:40.167 --> 07:41.367
THEY TRY -- IT STARTS ON THE

07:41.367 --> 07:42.133
STREETS.

07:42.133 --> 07:46.867
THEY TRY TO GET CHILDREN UP THE

07:46.867 --> 07:48.267
STREETS AND MOSQUES.

07:48.267 --> 07:50.967
THEY USE CASH AND GIFTS,

07:50.967 --> 07:51.800
INTIMIDATION.

07:51.800 --> 07:54.267
THEY GIVE CHILDREN TOYS ON THE

07:54.267 --> 07:55.600
STREET.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.900
THEY HAVE SPECIAL EVENTS FOR

07:56.900 --> 07:59.600
CHILDREN TO TRY TO ENTICE THEM.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.000
AND BIT BY BIT, THEY SUBJECT

08:01.000 --> 08:05.100
THEM TO THE PROPAGANDA, AND THEY

08:05.100 --> 08:07.500
TRAIN THEM EVENTUALLY THEY TURN

08:07.500 --> 08:11.667
THEM AGAINST THEIR PARENTS.

08:11.667 --> 08:15.300
WE SAW THROUGH ONE WHO TOLD US

08:15.300 --> 08:19.533
ABOUT THIS 15 -- TEENAGER WHO

08:19.533 --> 08:21.700
LEFT HOME BECAUSE THEY TURNED

08:21.700 --> 08:22.733
HIM AGAINST HIS PARENTS.

08:22.733 --> 08:25.267
HE ACCUSED HIS PARENTS OF BEING

08:25.267 --> 08:26.400
NONBELIEVERS AND BAD MUSLIMS

08:26.400 --> 08:28.833
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T PRAY AND,

08:28.833 --> 08:30.967
EVENTUALLY, HE JOINED ISIS AND

08:30.967 --> 08:32.900
DISAPPEARED.

08:32.900 --> 08:37.233
SO THAT'S WHAT THEY DO.

08:37.233 --> 08:39.433
AND UNFORTUNATELY, PARENTS ARE

08:39.433 --> 08:41.800
UNABLE TO TO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS

08:41.800 --> 08:44.700
SAD REALITY SHORT OF LOCKING

08:44.700 --> 08:45.533
THEIR CHILDREN AT HOME.

08:45.533 --> 08:47.333
THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO.

08:47.333 --> 08:48.267
>> Sreenivasan: YOU ALSO POINTED

08:48.267 --> 08:49.900
OUT THIS IS HAPPENING IN SOME

08:49.900 --> 08:51.767
REFUGEE CAMPS.

08:51.767 --> 08:53.467
>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT.

08:53.467 --> 08:58.467
I WAS IN TURKEY.

08:58.467 --> 08:59.967
I WORKED ON THIS STORY, AND WE

08:59.967 --> 09:03.000
WERE TOLD BY MANY PEOPLE THERE,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.700
PEOPLE WHO -- FORMER RESIDENTS

09:05.700 --> 09:08.433
OF REFUGEE CAMPS THAT ISLAMIC

09:08.433 --> 09:11.967
STATE USES THE CAMPS TO TRY AND

09:11.967 --> 09:17.700
FIND NEW RECRUITS AS WELL.

09:17.700 --> 09:20.900
SOMETIMES IT'S DONE UNDER THE

09:20.900 --> 09:24.700
GUISE OF HUMANITARIAN WORK.

09:24.700 --> 09:25.800
THEY IN IN AND THEY START

09:25.800 --> 09:28.300
TALKING TO PEOPLE.

09:28.300 --> 09:30.800
THEY FIND -- SOMETIMES IT'S

09:30.800 --> 09:31.233
ORPHANS.

09:31.233 --> 09:34.367
SOMETIMES IT'S CHILDREN WHO ARE

09:34.367 --> 09:37.667
IN DESPERATE NEED OF MONEY, AND

09:37.667 --> 09:39.300
SOMETIMES THEY GIVE THEM CASH,

09:39.300 --> 09:43.033
AND THEY TRY TO GAIN THEIR

09:43.033 --> 09:43.967
SYMPATHY THAT WAY.

09:43.967 --> 09:46.200
AND THAT'S HOW IT STARTS.

11:43.367 --> 11:44.733
HAPPEN IF YOU DON'T DO YOUR

RESEARCH.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.200

11:50.167 --> 11:51.433
GOOD HOSPITAL BASED ON

11:51.433 --> 11:53.367
REPUTATION OR SOMETHING ELSE.

11:53.367 --> 11:55.167
THERE'S SORT OF A REASONABLE

11:55.167 --> 11:57.867
EXPECTATION THAT THAT HOSPITAL

11:57.867 --> 12:01.000
HAS SORT OF SCREENED OUT ANY

12:01.000 --> 12:02.433
SURGEONS WHO ARE SUBPAR.

12:02.433 --> 12:03.700
WE FOUND IN OUR RESEARCH THERE

12:03.700 --> 12:05.333
ARE GREAT SURGEONS IN PLACES YOU

12:05.333 --> 12:06.433
WOULDN'T EXPECT AND ALSO

12:06.433 --> 12:09.733
SURGEONS THAT APPEAR TO BE

SUBJECTED TO THE PAINFUL

12:31.333 --> 12:32.033
PROCEDURE OR COULD STILL BE AT

12:32.033 --> 12:33.967
RISK.

12:33.967 --> 12:35.667
THAT RISK, ADVOCATES SAY, CAN GO

12:35.667 --> 12:37.433
UP DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS,

12:37.433 --> 12:38.667
WHEN GIRLS OFTEN TRAVEL BACK TO

GIRL'S CLITORIS TO, IN THE MOST

13:58.767 --> 14:00.400
SEVERE CASES, NARROWING THE

BEING PROMISCUOUS AND MORE

14:11.067 --> 14:13.033
ELIGIBLE FOR MARRIAGE.

14:24.800 --> 14:25.967
YOU HEAR THEM SCREAM.

14:39.733 --> 14:41.667

14:41.667 --> 14:43.433
SHE SAYS IT HAPPENED TO

14:43.433 --> 14:44.967
VIRTUALLY EVERY GIRL SHE KNEW,

14:44.967 --> 14:47.467
BUT NO ONE TALKED ABOUT IT.

14:47.467 --> 14:49.300
16 YEARS LATER, SHE STILL FEELS

14:49.300 --> 14:51.100
PAIN FROM THE SCARRING, ENDURES

14:51.100 --> 14:52.100
EMBARRASSING CONVERSATIONS WITH

14:52.100 --> 14:54.133
DOCTORS AND BOYFRIENDS.

14:54.133 --> 14:55.267
AND, SHE SAYS, SHE WILL NEVER

14:55.267 --> 14:58.033
FORGET THE FEAR.

I KNEW WHO I WAS.

PERSON.

AWAY FROM SOMETHING AND THEN NOT

15:14.400 --> 15:16.500
BEING ABLE TO.

I THINK THAT IT DOES SOMETHING

15:17.667 --> 15:20.767
TO YOU.

15:20.767 --> 15:22.800
I THINK THAT IT-- IT REALLY

15:22.800 --> 15:23.467
TOUCHES YOU TO THE CORE OF

YOURSELF.

REPORT IT.

15:34.900 --> 15:36.433
BUT IN THE LAST 15 YEARS, THE

15:36.433 --> 15:38.067
NUMBER OF IMMIGRANTS FROM AFRICA

15:38.067 --> 15:39.433
HAS DOUBLED, TO ABOUT

15:39.433 --> 15:41.100
1.8 MILLION.

15:41.100 --> 15:43.133
ONE RESEARCH GROUP, THE

15:43.133 --> 15:45.333
POPULATION REFERENCE BUREAU,

15:45.333 --> 15:46.667
ESTIMATES HALF A MILLION AFRICAN

15:46.667 --> 15:49.267
WOMEN AND GIRLS IN THE U.S. ARE

15:49.267 --> 15:51.233
AT RISK OF FGM OR MIGHT BEING

15:51.233 --> 15:52.733
HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO CUTTING

15:52.733 --> 15:53.333
BACK HOME.

15:53.333 --> 15:54.700
IT'S ESPECIALLY A CONCERN HERE

15:54.700 --> 15:56.400
IN NEW YORK, WHICH HAS THE

15:56.400 --> 15:57.233
LARGEST AFRICAN IMMIGRANT

15:57.233 --> 16:02.300
POPULATION IN THE COUNTRY.

16:02.300 --> 16:03.300
>> IT'S HORRIBLE.

16:03.300 --> 16:04.400
IT IS A VIOLATION OF THE RIGHT

16:04.400 --> 16:09.533
OF THE WOMAN.

16:09.533 --> 16:10.667
MA WHAT THEY -- WHAT THEY ARE

16:10.667 --> 16:12.833
TAKING WILL NEVER COME BACK.

16:12.833 --> 16:15.133
MIRIAMO DIALLO SERVES THE LARGE

16:15.133 --> 16:17.233
AFRICAN IMMIGRANTS.

16:17.233 --> 16:19.000
SEIZE SEEN A NUMBER OF WOMEN

16:19.000 --> 16:21.367
GRAPPLING WITH THE CONSEQUENCES

16:21.367 --> 16:23.433
OF FGM WHICH CAN INCLUDE

16:23.433 --> 16:24.200
MENSTRUATION AND CHILDBIRTH.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.033
AND WOMEN CAN HAVE TROUBLE WITH

16:26.033 --> 16:27.233
INTERESTS SENSITIVE TO THE

16:27.233 --> 16:27.733
ISSUE.

16:27.733 --> 16:29.100
DIALLO ALSO SEES GIRLS

16:29.100 --> 16:31.500
THREATENED BY FGM AND MOTHERS

16:31.500 --> 16:32.667
FACING SOCIAL PRESSURE TO HAVE

16:32.667 --> 16:34.067
IT DONE ON THEIR DAUGHTERS,

16:34.067 --> 16:35.100
EVEN.

16:35.100 --> 16:41.067
THEY DON'T WANT TO.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.900
>> ONE IS COMPLETELY EXCLUDED

16:42.900 --> 16:44.433
FROM THE COMMUNITY.

16:44.433 --> 16:45.567
AND SO IT MAKES PEOPLE GO

16:45.567 --> 16:50.667
THROUGH IT OR THE FAMILY, THEY

16:50.667 --> 16:53.867
WANT TO HAVE A WOMAN IN THE

16:53.867 --> 16:56.233
FAMILY THAT IS NOT MUTILATED

16:56.233 --> 16:58.800
BECAUSE IT CAN AFFECT THE

16:58.800 --> 17:03.667
REPUTATION THE OF THE FAMILY.

17:03.667 --> 17:05.033
AND IT'S A WAY TO BECOME A

17:05.033 --> 17:06.133
WOMAN.

17:06.133 --> 17:06.900
>> Reporter: DIALLO SAYS IT'S

17:06.900 --> 17:08.433
RARE, BUT SHE HAS SEEN YOUNG

17:08.433 --> 17:09.900
WOMEN SENT BACK TO AFRICA TO

17:09.900 --> 17:11.433
HAVE IT DONE.

17:11.433 --> 17:13.667
IT'S KNOWN AS VACATION CUTTING,

17:13.667 --> 17:15.000
BECAUSE IT USUALLY HAPPENS

17:15.000 --> 17:17.433
DURING SUMMER VACATION FROM

17:17.433 --> 17:18.900
SCHOOL.

17:18.900 --> 17:24.700
>> I HAVE FOUR CASES LIKE THAT.

17:24.700 --> 17:25.500
THEY ARE BORN IN THE UNITED

17:25.500 --> 17:27.967
STATES BUT WENT FOR VACATION AND

17:27.967 --> 17:28.467
IT HAPPENED.

17:28.467 --> 17:30.333
I HEAR FROM MY CLIENT ALSO LIKE

17:30.333 --> 17:33.367
SOMEONE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT

17:33.367 --> 17:36.100
SENT THEIR CHILD TO AFRICA FOR

17:36.100 --> 17:37.600
THE PURPOSE OF FGM.

17:37.600 --> 17:38.533
>> Reporter: DIALLO SAYS DOCTORS

17:38.533 --> 17:40.767
AND EDUCATORS COULD PLAY AN

17:40.767 --> 17:41.867
IMPORTANT ROLE IN IDENTIFYING

17:41.867 --> 17:44.667
GIRLS AT RISK, BUT MANY HAVEN'T

17:44.667 --> 17:46.033
HAD THE TRAINING.

17:46.033 --> 17:47.400
DIALLO HELPED ONE CLIENT WHOSE

17:47.400 --> 17:48.900
FAMILY PLANNED TO SEND HERE BACK

17:48.900 --> 17:50.433
TO AFRICA TO BE CUT.

17:50.433 --> 17:53.233
SHE TRIED TO GET HELP AT SCHOOL.

17:53.233 --> 17:54.333
>> AND SHE WENT TO SCHOOL, AND

17:54.333 --> 17:55.800
SHE SPOKE WITH THE GUIDANCE

17:55.800 --> 17:57.067
COUNSELOR WHO DID NOT KNOW WHAT

17:57.067 --> 17:58.767
SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT, AND THE

17:58.767 --> 17:59.700
GUIDANCE COUNSELOR ACCEPTED SENT

17:59.700 --> 18:01.300
HER BACK HOME!

18:01.300 --> 18:04.300
AND I THINK IF IT WAS A CASE

18:04.300 --> 18:06.667
WHERE THE CHILD WENT TO SEE A

18:06.667 --> 18:08.067
GUIDANCE COUNSELOR, TOLD THE

18:08.067 --> 18:09.667
GUIDANCE COUNSELOR SOMETHING AS

18:09.667 --> 18:11.367
SIMPLE AS I DON'T FEEL SAFE, I'M

18:11.367 --> 18:13.467
NOTE GOING BACK HOME, THEY WOULD

18:13.467 --> 18:16.867
CALL THE CHILDREN'S SERVICES.

18:16.867 --> 18:19.667
BUT WITH FGM, THEY SEE IT AS A

18:19.667 --> 18:20.667
CULTURAL PROBLEM, SO THEY DON'T

18:20.667 --> 18:21.800
WANT TO GET INVOLVED.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.067
AND I THINK THIS IS A SERIOUS

18:24.067 --> 18:27.233
PROBLEM, BECAUSE IT IS, YOU

18:27.233 --> 18:29.133
KNOW, IT IS CHILD ABUSE.

18:35.800 --> 18:36.467
POPULATIONS.

18:36.467 --> 18:40.433
FGM IS OUTLAWED IN THE U.S. AND

18:40.433 --> 18:42.400
IN 2013, CROWLEY HELPED PASS A

18:48.933 --> 18:51.433
PROSECUTIONS SO FAR AND CROWLEY

18:51.433 --> 18:52.833
ADMITS IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO

KNOW HOW OFTEN IT ACTUALLY

18:54.900 --> 18:55.233
HAPPENS.

18:55.233 --> 18:56.933
>> I THINK IT IS A SENSITIVE

18:56.933 --> 18:57.833
ISSUE.

18:57.833 --> 18:59.433
BUT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT.

18:59.433 --> 19:00.667
RIGHT NOW THERE'S SILENCE.

19:00.667 --> 19:02.833
IT JUST HAPPENS.

19:02.833 --> 19:05.733
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO

BE ADDRESSED.

19:06.567 --> 19:07.400
>> Reporter: DO WE KNOW THIS IS

A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM OR IS IT

19:08.667 --> 19:09.733
MAYBE JUST A FEW ISOLATED

19:09.733 --> 19:10.733
INCIDENTS?

19:10.733 --> 19:12.100
>> WE KNOW THAT THE POTENTIAL IS

19:12.100 --> 19:12.567
THERE.

19:12.567 --> 19:15.533
IF IT'S ONE GIRL, IN MY OPINION,

19:15.533 --> 19:16.400
IT'S ONE GIRL TOO MANY.

19:16.400 --> 19:17.900
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE NEED

19:17.900 --> 19:18.500
TO FOCUS ON.

19:18.500 --> 19:19.667
WE KNOW IT HAS HAPPENED.

19:19.667 --> 19:21.300
WE KNOW IT CAN HAPPEN AND

19:21.300 --> 19:23.700
PROBABLY WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.

19:23.700 --> 19:24.700
WE -- OUR COUNTRY, THE UNITED

19:51.900 --> 19:53.367
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE

19:53.367 --> 19:55.467
THAT IS SO -- SOMETHING THAT IS

19:55.467 --> 19:57.367
SO SECRETIVE, IT INVOLVES GIRLS

19:57.367 --> 19:59.667
THAT MAY NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT'S

20:02.033 --> 20:02.767

20:02.767 --> 20:05.733
BUT I DO THINK -- IT'S VERY

20:05.733 --> 20:07.300
DIFFICULT, BUT I DO THINK WE

20:07.300 --> 20:11.000
NEED AN AWARENESS CAMPAIGN TO

20:11.000 --> 20:12.367
HAVE POSTERS AT AIRPORTS AND

UNDERSTANDING THAT IT IS AGAINST

20:17.433 --> 20:18.800
THE LAW TO DO THIS AND THEY

20:18.800 --> 20:20.067
SHOULD BE ON THE LOOKOUT.

20:20.067 --> 20:21.233
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WANT TO

20:21.233 --> 20:22.133
BREAK THE LAW.

20:22.133 --> 20:24.467
I THINK IF THEY KNOW THAT

20:24.467 --> 20:26.267
SOMETHING HAS BEEN MADE ILLEGAL

20:26.267 --> 20:27.733
THAT THEY WILL RESPECT THE LAW.
