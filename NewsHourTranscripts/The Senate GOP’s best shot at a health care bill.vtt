JUDY WOODRUFF: Republicans
faced another challenge
today in their efforts to
dismantle the Affordable

00:05.733 --> 00:06.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Care Act.

00:06.666 --> 00:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins has more.

00:07.766 --> 00:09.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:09.466 --> 00:10.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader: This
certainly won't be easy.

00:10.700 --> 00:13.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hardly anything in
this process has been.

00:13.033 --> 00:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The whirlwind
process ticked on in the Senate
today, but Republicans found

00:19.900 --> 00:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
themselves no closer to passing
a plan to repeal or replace
the Affordable Care Act.

00:24.700 --> 00:28.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Two key GOP ideas failed
by significant margins
in the past 24 hours.

00:31.566 --> 00:36.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, last night, nine
Republicans voted against the
latest Senate plan, including

00:38.666 --> 00:43.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Ted Cruz's proposal
plan to allow insurance plans
with almost no regulations.

00:45.766 --> 00:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then today came an idea backed
by conservatives like Kentucky
senator Rand Paul, a straight

00:51.633 --> 00:54.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
repeal in two years with
no replacement attached.

00:54.133 --> 00:57.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Paul said Obamacare's
relations mean options
are far too limited.

00:57.800 --> 00:59.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:59.866 --> 01:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAND PAUL (R), Kentucky: Do you
think that the -- that every
American should get to choose,

01:02.600 --> 01:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that every American gets
to choose whether they have
insurance or not, and what kind

01:06.366 --> 01:07.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of insurance they have?

01:07.800 --> 01:08.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is what it's about.

01:08.800 --> 01:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a freedom of choice.

01:10.266 --> 01:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But his
straight repeal lost 45-55.

01:16.133 --> 01:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Seven Republican senators
rejected the idea.

01:19.666 --> 01:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican leaders
instead focused on a
longer game, reminding
their party of its pledge

01:24.400 --> 01:25.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to repeal Obamacare.

01:25.400 --> 01:27.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:27.366 --> 01:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN THUNE (R), South
Dakota: We made a commitment
to the American people.

01:29.566 --> 01:31.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's time to make
good on that promise.

01:31.900 --> 01:36.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And it now
appears the Senate GOP's best
shot at a bill is what's known

01:38.733 --> 01:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as skinny repeal, repealing
the individual mandate,
and not much else.

01:41.933 --> 01:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is expected to be one of
the last votes this week, and
so begins the jockeying for

01:46.600 --> 01:48.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what goes in it.

01:48.566 --> 01:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
South Carolina Lindsey Graham
wants more block grants
for states in the plan.

01:52.233 --> 01:54.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:54.366 --> 01:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South
Carolina: And if it can't do
that, I'm not voting for it.

01:57.333 --> 02:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: All this a
day after the Senate barely
voted to begin debate.

02:01.833 --> 02:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, President Trump singled
out Alaska's Lisa Murkowski
for her vote against starting

02:08.900 --> 02:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debate yesterday, tweeting that
she "really let the Republicans
and our country down yesterday.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Too bad."

02:14.866 --> 02:19.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Murkowski defended her vote
to The Alaska Dispatch News,
saying, "I didn't think that

02:19.066 --> 02:24.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we were ready for the
debate, and I have said
pretty consistently
that process really does

02:24.533 --> 02:26.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
matter."

02:26.633 --> 02:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As it does to Democrats, like
Oregon's Ron Wyden, calling
for fixes, rather than repeal

02:30.933 --> 02:31.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for Obamacare.

02:31.933 --> 02:33.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:33.900 --> 02:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RON WYDEN (D), Oregon: We
all agree that the Affordable
Care Act is not perfect.

02:35.966 --> 02:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to take steps
immediately to stabilize the
private insurance market.

02:42.633 --> 02:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The clock is
now ticking on the 20 hours
of debate required for any

02:47.933 --> 02:50.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bill.

02:50.566 --> 02:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After that, any amendments
not already passed can
be tacked on in a process
known as vote-a-rama.

02:54.766 --> 02:56.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Senate Republican
Whip John Cornyn:

02:56.166 --> 02:58.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:58.166 --> 03:01.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN CORNYN (R), Texas: We will
conclude one way or another
on either late Thursday or

03:01.166 --> 03:03.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Friday morning.

03:03.133 --> 03:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That means
the Senate, and Americans
watching, have two days to weigh

03:06.366 --> 03:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in on this critical draft about
the future of health care.

03:10.333 --> 03:12.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
