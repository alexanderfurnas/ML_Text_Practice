a straightforward debate about

02:10.163 --> 02:15.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But make no mistake, this
destroys Medicaid
as we know it.

02:15.769 --> 02:21.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is the fundamental reworking

Care Act, give the states
flexibility to run
their Medicaid programs, that,
by golly, they

02:34.221 --> 02:38.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will figure out how to provide
the best health
care they can for their

02:55.642 --> 03:02.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before the CBO can truly expose
the consequences,
the catastrophic consequences of
their health

03:02.482 --> 03:04.418 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

Ryan, meanwhile,
rolled up his sleeves with a

and replacing Obamacare.

LISA DESJARDINS: The Republican
sales pitch
has an aggressive goal: to get
this bill through

03:29.276 --> 03:32.245 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Congress in one month, by April
7.

03:32.279 --> 03:36.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's when lawmakers leave for
Easter recess,
hence the pace, with two House
committees

03:36.850 --> 03:42.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voting on two halves today and
next week the

into one.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Pause, start over.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Get it right, don't get it
fast."

about Medicaid.

04:23.597 --> 04:27.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

Kentucky,
Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee

04:36.776 --> 04:40.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House is also moving

in our opinions, to be able to
erase a lot

05:15.916 --> 05:20.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the past statements that were

Russia has rejected U.S. claims
that a new
missile violates a landmark
nuclear arms treaty.

07:26.046 --> 07:31.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A top U.S. general charged
Wednesday that
the land-based cruise missile is
meant to

07:31.051 --> 07:33.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
threaten U.S. and NATO interests
in Europe.

07:34.020 --> 07:39.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In response, a spokesman for
President Vladimir
Putin said: "Russia has adhered
to and will

07:39.092 --> 07:42.562 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
adhere to all its international
obligations."

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange
says his
organization will help tech
firms defend against

07:47.267 --> 07:49.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CIA hacking tools.

07:49.336 --> 07:54.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WikiLeaks released a trove of
documents this
week about the CIA's ability to
breach smartphone

07:54.474 --> 07:56.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and TV encryption.

07:56.376 --> 08:02.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Today, in an online news
conference, Assange
accused the spy agency of
devastating incompetence

08:02.782 --> 08:04.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for letting the tools leak.

08:04.517 --> 08:09.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JULIAN ASSANGE, Founder,
WikiLeaks: The CIA
developed a giant arsenal, what
appears to

08:09.422 --> 08:15.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be the largest arsenal of
Trojans and viruses
in the world, and didn't secure
it, lost control

08:15.862 --> 08:21.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of it, and then appears to have
covered up
that fact.

08:21.301 --> 08:24.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Assange spoke
from Ecuador's
embassy in London.

08:24.571 --> 08:28.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He sought refuge there in 2012
after being
charged with rape in Sweden.

08:28.575 --> 08:32.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, President Trump met
this afternoon
with CIA Director Mike Pompeo.

08:32.812 --> 08:37.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House said Mr. Trump
thinks the
agency's systems need updating.

08:37.350 --> 08:42.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A blast of gale-force winds left
utility crews
scrambling today across parts of
the Great

08:42.255 --> 08:44.124 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Lakes region.

08:44.157 --> 08:48.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A million homes and other
buildings lost power
in Michigan overnight, the most
in the state's

08:48.495 --> 08:50.029 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
history.

08:50.063 --> 08:53.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gusts of more than 60 miles an
hour took down
power lines across the state.

08:53.333 --> 08:57.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The damage sparked a fire that
killed five
people in a Detroit apartment
building.

08:57.837 --> 09:03.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The storm also left more than
200,000 customers
in the dark in Western New York.

09:03.109 --> 09:08.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The state of Utah is ready to
put the nation's
toughest drunken driving law on
the books.

09:08.214 --> 09:13.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lawmakers voted last night to
lower the legal
blood alcohol limit to 0.05
percent.

09:13.253 --> 09:16.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The limit in most states is 0.08
percent.

09:16.790 --> 09:19.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Wall Street, stocks
managed very slight
gains today.

09:19.759 --> 09:22.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
was up two
points to close at 20858.

09:22.962 --> 09:27.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose a point, and the
S&amp;P 500 added
nearly two.

09:27.600 --> 09:32.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
more U.S.
troops land in Syria to help
take back the

09:32.205 --> 09:43.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
city of Raqqa; how the GOP's
health care plan
could seriously impact Medicaid;
and much

09:43.349 --> 09:48.855 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

09:48.888 --> 09:55.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The coming battle for the ISIS
capital, Raqqa,
in Syria is beginning to take
shape; 400 additional

09:55.829 --> 10:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American troops, Marines and
some Army Rangers
will join 500 U.S. special
operations troops

10:00.934 --> 10:06.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
already on the ground, with an
array of Turkish
and rebel forces.

10:06.105 --> 10:09.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russian and Syrian army troops
are also there.

10:09.209 --> 10:13.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The top American general for
Middle East operations,
General Joseph Votel, was on
Capitol Hill

10:13.947 --> 10:16.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today in the Senate Armed
Services Committee.

10:16.449 --> 10:21.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chairman John McCain pushed him
on a particular
flash point: U.S. support for
Syrian Kurdish

10:21.988 --> 10:24.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
forces, whom Turkey considers
terrorists.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.959 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

10:25.992 --> 10:28.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MCCAIN (R), Arizona: I
think there's
a possibility of an impending
conflict between

10:28.728 --> 10:37.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey and the Kurds, as opposed
to us all
working together to try to
defeat ISIS and

10:37.403 --> 10:38.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
remove them from Raqqa.

10:38.805 --> 10:42.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you see that as a scenario
that we should
be concerned about?

10:42.742 --> 10:44.110 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSEPH VOTEL, Commander, U.S.
Central Command:
I do, Mr. Chairman.

10:45.712 --> 10:49.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to that end, we are trying
to take actions
to prevent that from occurring.

10:49.682 --> 10:53.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For more, I
spoke with Michael
Gordon, the chief military
correspondent for

10:53.520 --> 10:58.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The New York Times, who said
U.S. troops will
play a key role in the upcoming
battle.

10:58.224 --> 11:02.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GORDON, The New York
Times: If you
look at what we're doing in Iraq
right now,

11:02.195 --> 11:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I have been there, the
United States is
providing artillery support,
along with the

11:07.000 --> 11:08.434 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
French.

11:08.468 --> 11:11.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's providing -- firing
surface-to-surface
rockets into Western Mosul.

11:11.437 --> 11:13.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's providing air support.

11:13.206 --> 11:14.974 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's providing advisers.

11:15.008 --> 11:20.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is what has enabled the
Iraqi forces
to move forward in what is a
very difficult

11:20.346 --> 11:22.081 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fight.

11:22.115 --> 11:26.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, something very similar is
needed in
Syria in we want the Syrian
fighters to go

11:26.252 --> 11:30.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into a town that's defended by
3,000 to 4,000
ISIS militants.

11:30.823 --> 11:35.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You were just
there a couple
weeks ago, and there's lots of
different factions

11:35.595 --> 11:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here who at certain times are
working toward
a shared goal and other times
are working

11:40.400 --> 11:41.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
toward their own ends.

11:41.401 --> 11:42.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a complicated situation.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lay out the map for us a little
bit.

11:44.637 --> 11:47.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL GORDON: The map is a bit
chaotic.

11:47.473 --> 11:52.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Northern Syria, the Turkish
military has
intervened.

11:52.045 --> 11:58.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And along with Turkish-supported
opposition
forces, Syrian oppositions
forces, they have

11:58.117 --> 11:59.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
taken the town of Al-Bab.

11:59.419 --> 12:03.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, at times, the Turks have
threatened to
move on Manbij.

12:03.122 --> 12:09.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You also have hundreds of
American troops
there serving primarily as
advisers.

12:09.128 --> 12:14.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they have helped train and
equip the security
forces in the town of Manbij.

12:14.867 --> 12:19.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And more recently, the Syrian
government and
the Russians have moved into
that area.

12:19.973 --> 12:21.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So it's a bit of a tinderbox
right now.

12:21.941 --> 12:24.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Given all, who
goes in to
take Raqqa?

12:24.911 --> 12:30.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GORDON: Well, that's the
billion-dollar
question really.

12:30.516 --> 12:36.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What the Trump administration
has done so
far pretty much goes by the
Obama administration's

12:36.889 --> 12:38.691 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
playbook.

12:38.725 --> 12:44.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, their idea was the local
provide the
fighters, we provide the
firepower, and that's

12:44.530 --> 12:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how we grab back territory from
ISIS.

12:47.266 --> 12:53.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the big question is, who are
going to
be the fighters who seize the
town?

12:53.272 --> 12:59.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the most capable forces that
the American
military has found in the region
is this YPG

12:59.812 --> 13:01.514 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Kurdish militia.

13:01.547 --> 13:03.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're the ones that have the
most experience
fighting.

13:03.783 --> 13:07.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're the ones that played the
key role
in taking back Manbij.

13:07.320 --> 13:12.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're the force that the
American military
is counting on to be a
component, not the

13:12.625 --> 13:17.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
majority of the force, that
takes Raqqa, but
a key component of the assault
force.

13:18.031 --> 13:21.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem is, Turkey considers
them to be
terrorists, and they have sort
of drawn a

13:21.968 --> 13:24.270 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
red line at arming the YPG.

13:24.303 --> 13:30.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, unless we arm the YPG,
they're in no
position to help out in the
Raqqa assault.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's pretty much where
things stand
at this point.

13:32.345 --> 13:35.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, so
best-case
scenario, this operation goes as
planned and

13:35.948 --> 13:38.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we recapture this particular
town or city.

13:38.651 --> 13:39.886 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Then what?

13:39.919 --> 13:42.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GORDON: Well, I mean,
there are a
couple things.

13:42.488 --> 13:48.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, best case from the
American military's
standpoint is, they work with
the YPG, they

13:48.327 --> 13:56.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
give them anti-tank weapons,
vehicles, machine
guns, heavy machine guns, the
Raqqa fight

13:56.235 --> 13:57.537 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
goes forward.

13:57.570 --> 14:01.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's going to be a long,
difficult fight,
just like Mosul is.

14:01.040 --> 14:07.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, once the capital of the
Islamic State
is retaken, a couple things
happen.

14:07.280 --> 14:13.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
First, there has to be a
day-after plan for
who governs the city, who
provides essential

14:13.086 --> 14:15.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
services, who is really going to
be in control
there.

14:15.254 --> 14:16.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It can't be the YPG.

14:16.823 --> 14:19.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Second, the war with ISIS isn't
over.

14:19.726 --> 14:24.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, they have already begun
to move some
of their senior leadership to
Deir el-Zour.

14:24.230 --> 14:25.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're in al-Qaim in Iraq.

14:25.932 --> 14:30.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They still have a shrunken
caliphate in parts
of Syria and Iraq.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so that fight has to go on.

14:32.105 --> 14:40.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, lastly, steps have to be
taken to avoid
a confrontation between the
Kurds and the

14:40.179 --> 14:41.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Turks, who are our NATO ally.

14:41.781 --> 14:46.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I was in Syria with General
Votel, I
talked to the head of the Manbij
military

14:46.252 --> 14:50.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
council, and I asked him, who is
your greatest
enemy, ISIS or the Turks?

14:50.656 --> 14:52.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said that Turkey is the main
enemy.

14:52.358 --> 14:55.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Michael Gordon
of The New York Times, thanks so
much.

14:55.995 --> 15:04.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL GORDON: All right, thank
you.

15:04.971 --> 15:12.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The WikiLeaks
release earlier
this week showed the CIA could
use hacking

15:12.111 --> 15:16.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tools to break into cell phones,
computers
and Internet-connected
televisions.

15:16.949 --> 15:19.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We should say there is no
evidence the CIA
used this against Americans.

15:19.986 --> 15:22.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the revelations surprised
many.

15:22.388 --> 15:27.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It raises the concerns for the
increasing
number of Internet-connected
devices all around

15:27.426 --> 15:30.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
us, and what they're monitoring
and who has
access to it.

15:30.863 --> 15:35.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, in a recent murder
case, law enforcement
is trying to gather recordings
from an Amazon

15:35.568 --> 15:40.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Echo in order to see if it might
have picked
up evidence surrounding the
crime.

15:40.873 --> 15:42.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Brian Barrett covers these
issues for "Wired."

15:42.708 --> 15:44.043 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He joins me now.

15:44.076 --> 15:46.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brian, let's separate the fact
from the fiction
a little bit here.

15:46.712 --> 15:49.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What have we learned from these
leaks?

15:49.148 --> 15:51.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What are these devices capable
of recording?

15:51.350 --> 15:54.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRIAN BARRETT, "Wired": Well,
you know, it's
interesting.

15:54.220 --> 15:58.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we learned from the leaks
is more of
a confirmation that the CIA is
hacking into

15:58.591 --> 16:00.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a lot of devices.

16:00.359 --> 16:04.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You would sort of expect that,
but what it
shows is that these devices can
be used in

16:04.730 --> 16:06.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ways that we might not have
expected.

16:06.566 --> 16:12.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, a smart TV, for instance,
has a microphone
on it because sometimes remote
controls are

16:12.438 --> 16:13.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
voice-activated now.

16:13.739 --> 16:16.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the CIA has found a way to
use that to
listen to you.

16:16.809 --> 16:21.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Your smartphone, which the CIA
knows how to,
whether it's an iPhone or
Android phone, compromise,

16:21.180 --> 16:23.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those, too, the microphones can
listen to
you.

16:23.449 --> 16:25.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They can access the camera.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They can look through all of the
documents
that you have.

16:27.119 --> 16:30.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's really full access to your
digital life.

16:30.089 --> 16:36.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Unlike the
Snowden revelations,
this isn't about mass
surveillance, bulk collection

16:36.429 --> 16:37.396 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of information.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is in the targeted sense.

16:39.198 --> 16:42.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there's kind of a violation
of a sense
of privacy here.

16:43.002 --> 16:46.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRIAN BARRETT: Yes, well, I
think that's an
important distinction to make.

16:46.572 --> 16:49.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is nothing in these leaks
to indicate
that the CIA is looking at
anyone that they

16:49.909 --> 16:52.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
shouldn't be or that you
wouldn't expect them
to be.

16:52.578 --> 16:57.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What it does say is that there
are a lot more
vulnerabilities out there than
we may have

16:57.083 --> 17:01.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thought and that people other
than the CIA
may have access to them as well.

17:01.087 --> 17:06.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The CIA doesn't necessarily have
the only
access to, say, an IOS exploit
that allows

17:06.826 --> 17:10.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them to get into everybody's
iPhone, especially
when you consider that these
documents, according

17:10.630 --> 17:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to WikiLeaks and other reports,
have been
out for two months circulating
in sort of

17:14.433 --> 17:16.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the underground channels that
you would expect.

17:16.402 --> 17:19.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the real danger here isn't
necessarily
from the CIA.

17:19.138 --> 17:22.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's that these tools exist and
that other
people may have access to them
and may be

17:22.708 --> 17:24.510 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
using them.

17:24.543 --> 17:26.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And the fact
the government
didn't necessarily come clean
and tell the

17:26.512 --> 17:30.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tech companies that, hey, there
is this hole,
there's this backdoor, there's
this side door

17:30.249 --> 17:34.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you can go through, does
that mean that
essentially since the
vulnerabilities were

17:34.420 --> 17:39.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
discovered until now or until
whenever these
tech companies are made aware of
it, that

17:39.225 --> 17:41.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we have kind of been at greater
risk?

17:41.560 --> 17:45.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRIAN BARRETT: Well, you know, I
want to be
cautious there, because we don't
know for

17:45.097 --> 17:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sure if the CIA talked to tech
companies or
not.

17:47.667 --> 17:51.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The companies themselves,
understandably,
don't want to talk a lot about
it.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The CIA is very quiet about it.

17:53.606 --> 17:57.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that's true, and
especially when
you consider there is a
framework that has

17:57.376 --> 18:01.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been in place for a few years
developed by
the Obama White House where
intelligence agencies

18:01.881 --> 18:06.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agreed in certain circumstances
to give up
these so-called zero day
patches, if they

18:06.819 --> 18:08.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are not as useful as they need.

18:08.854 --> 18:14.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this indicates that there
are hundreds
of these vulnerabilities that
both the CIA

18:14.527 --> 18:18.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
uses, presumably the NSA --
presumably, the
FBI has their own as well --
that are not

18:19.031 --> 18:20.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
being disclosed.

18:20.733 --> 18:24.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that lack of disclosure,
yes, does mean
that people could be at risk at
large.

18:24.670 --> 18:28.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This isn't
necessarily the
privacy vs. security false
dichotomy, but

18:28.774 --> 18:33.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there seems to be some privacy
that we exchange
for convenience, when we get
objects in our

18:33.879 --> 18:38.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
home, whether it's a smart TV or
one of these
Amazon Echo or Google Home
devices that's

18:38.551 --> 18:41.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
perpetually on and just waiting
for us to
say something.

18:41.520 --> 18:46.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I guess we trade in the fact
that there is
something listening to us if
it's waiting

18:46.492 --> 18:47.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for us to say something.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRIAN BARRETT: That's true.

18:49.295 --> 18:52.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's more evident
than ever
before, especially as we start
to connect

18:52.198 --> 18:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more and more devices to the
Internet.

18:54.633 --> 18:59.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is nothing in the CIA
leaks to indicate
that they had any access to an
Amazon Echo

18:59.438 --> 19:03.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or a Google Home, for instance,
but these
are devices that have
microphones on them

19:03.709 --> 19:05.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and listen to you.

19:05.511 --> 19:09.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Internet of Things, almost
everything
has some sort of Internet
connection, which

19:09.348 --> 19:13.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
isn't to say that your
dishwasher, Internet-connected
dishwasher, is going to be
spying on you,

19:13.819 --> 19:15.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but maybe it gets enlisted in a
botnet.

19:15.921 --> 19:20.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the most important
takeaway is for
people at home realizing that
every time you

19:20.393 --> 19:24.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
let one of these devices into
your house,
you're creating a new entry
point potentially

19:24.897 --> 19:25.865 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for hackers.

19:25.898 --> 19:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's not to be alarmist.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it is, as you said,
a trade-off,
one that most people are happy
with and one

19:30.136 --> 19:33.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that most people won't run into
a problem
with, but it is something to be
mindful of.

19:33.539 --> 19:35.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Brian Barrett
of "Wired," thanks so much.

19:35.775 --> 19:40.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRIAN BARRETT: Thank you.

19:40.179 --> 19:50.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The House
Republican plan
moved a step forward today, but
big concerns

19:51.023 --> 19:52.525 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
remain.

19:52.558 --> 19:54.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a moment, William Brangham
talks to the
head of an insurance company.

19:54.827 --> 19:59.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, Judy Woodruff zeros
in on some
of the basics about key changes
in the Republican

19:59.932 --> 20:01.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bill.

20:01.734 --> 20:05.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tonight, we look
at Medicaid
and some big changes that could
be in store

20:05.638 --> 20:07.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
under the Republican plan.

20:07.640 --> 20:13.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under the Affordable Care Act,
more than 10
million more people got coverage
in 31 states

20:13.579 --> 20:15.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that expanded their Medicaid
program.

20:15.815 --> 20:20.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The GOP approach would
eventually change that
and more.

20:20.352 --> 20:25.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For now, the federal government
would continue
paying for those already added.

20:25.291 --> 20:30.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Starting in 2020, however,
enrollment would
freeze, and states wouldn't get
additional

20:30.529 --> 20:33.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dollars for signing anyone up.

20:33.232 --> 20:39.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republican bill would also
cap how much
the federal government pays per
Medicaid enrollee.

20:39.572 --> 20:42.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That is a fundamental change.

20:42.041 --> 20:45.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Julie Rovner of Kaiser Health
News joins us
again.

20:45.711 --> 20:47.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome back, Julie.

20:47.279 --> 20:50.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, remind us briefly, how did
Medicaid work
under the Affordable Care Act?

20:50.883 --> 20:52.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How does it work now?

20:52.918 --> 20:55.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER, Kaiser Health
News: Well, Medicaid
has always been thought of as
the health insurance

20:55.354 --> 20:59.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
program for the poor, but you
had to be more
than poor to get on Medicaid
prior to the

20:59.658 --> 21:01.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Affordable Care Act.

21:01.427 --> 21:06.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You had to be poor and a
pregnant woman or
child, poor and disabled, poor
and elderly.

21:06.132 --> 21:10.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you were poor and none of
those things,
you were not eligible in many
states.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Affordable Care Act changed
that.

21:11.770 --> 21:15.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It said that all you had to be
was poor, and
you could get Medicaid.

21:15.341 --> 21:17.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And originally it was a
requirement.

21:17.042 --> 21:19.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Supreme Court struck that
down and made
it optional.

21:19.945 --> 21:25.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as you mentioned, 31 states
have expanded
Medicaid to basically allow
everyone who is

21:25.518 --> 21:27.186 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
poor.

21:27.219 --> 21:29.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's under 138 percent of
poverty, about
$15,000 a year for an
individual.

21:29.955 --> 21:33.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, why is the
Republican leadership
changing this?

21:33.826 --> 21:38.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JULIE ROVNER: Well, the
Republican leadership,
the Republican Party has been
agitating to

21:38.998 --> 21:44.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really scale back Medicaid for
many, many
years, really starting in the
1980s under

21:44.436 --> 21:46.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
President Reagan.

21:46.272 --> 21:49.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There have been many effort,
none of which
have come to fruition, to scale
back the basic

21:49.508 --> 21:51.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Medicaid program.

21:51.443 --> 21:55.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in particular, they don't
like the expansion,
which they say is for
able-bodied people,

21:55.214 --> 21:59.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, in practice, not all of the
people on
the expansion are what you would
consider

21:59.285 --> 22:00.753 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
able-bodied.

22:00.786 --> 22:03.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the first thing they want to
do is get
rid of that expanded Medicaid.

22:03.889 --> 22:10.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And they would
put a cap on
how much it is that they would
give people.

22:10.196 --> 22:11.163 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: That's right.

22:11.197 --> 22:12.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Well, they would put a cap.

22:12.198 --> 22:13.632 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's called a per capita cap.

22:13.666 --> 22:17.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Basically, they would cap
funding per enrollee.

22:17.069 --> 22:20.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a different kind of
change than had
been talked about before, which
would just

22:20.439 --> 22:23.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be a block grant, where they
would just basically
say to state , we're going to
give you a chunk

22:23.876 --> 22:25.544 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of money.

22:25.578 --> 22:27.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a state says, well, what
happens if we
have a recession and more people
qualify?

22:27.546 --> 22:31.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this would at least make up
for the number
of people on the program, but it
would still

22:31.884 --> 22:37.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cap spending on what has been
since it was
created in 1965 an open-ended
entitlement

22:37.590 --> 22:41.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's shared between the
federal government
and the states in terms of
funding.

22:41.660 --> 22:46.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Basically, what it would do over
time is make
states pay a larger and larger
share of their

22:46.098 --> 22:47.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Medicaid costs.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's -- and
so we're
hearing from governors,
including Republican

22:50.603 --> 22:52.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
governors, that they're
concerned about this.

22:52.171 --> 22:53.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: That's right.

22:54.006 --> 22:57.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while many Republican
governors took the
expanded Medicaid, we should
point out that

22:57.409 --> 23:01.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the federal government is
actually paying
a larger share of that expansion
than they're

23:01.213 --> 23:03.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
paying for the traditional
Medicaid population.

23:03.949 --> 23:08.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why the complicated
phase-out in
the Republican proposal.

23:08.420 --> 23:12.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, eventually, the Republican
governors
see that they would not only
stop getting

23:12.992 --> 23:14.760 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the extra money.

23:14.793 --> 23:18.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They would probably get less
money than they
were getting before the
Affordable Care Act

23:18.764 --> 23:20.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the Medicaid program.

23:20.633 --> 23:24.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Medicaid program is
either the largest
or second largest program in
virtually every

23:24.203 --> 23:25.170 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
state's budget.

23:25.204 --> 23:27.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we're talking about a lot of
dollars here.

23:27.039 --> 23:30.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, a number of
these governors
are still -- still don't see eye
to eye with

23:30.209 --> 23:32.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Republican leadership and
the White House.

23:32.144 --> 23:36.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: That's right, and
a lot of senators
in those states are basically
coming out in

23:36.649 --> 23:39.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
favor of their governors, saying
they're concerned
about this.

23:39.051 --> 23:42.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly,
Julie, this
gets to why some states would be
hurt more

23:42.721 --> 23:44.156 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than others under this plan.

23:44.189 --> 23:45.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: That's right.

23:45.190 --> 23:46.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It would be complicated.

23:46.191 --> 23:48.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not just how many people
are on Medicaid.

23:48.460 --> 23:50.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's how much Medicaid costs in
those states.

23:50.996 --> 23:52.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's what it's based on.

23:52.731 --> 23:57.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the ultimate formula
fight, which
Congress is very familiar with,
and it's a

23:57.169 --> 24:00.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
big piece of this legislation
that the Republicans
are trying the push.

24:00.706 --> 24:05.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we should
say this is
all based on what is in this
proposed legislation.

24:05.277 --> 24:08.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you and I are talking, we
know all this
is subject to change.

24:08.614 --> 24:10.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this is what we can talk
about at this
point.

24:10.749 --> 24:12.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: That's right.

24:12.117 --> 24:15.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Julie Rovner,
Kaiser Health
News, we thank you.

24:15.220 --> 24:21.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JULIE ROVNER: Thank you.

24:21.427 --> 24:29.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, let's pick
up where
Judy and Julie Rovner left off
and hear from

24:29.568 --> 24:33.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an insurance executive whose
business is focused
on Medicaid patients and who is
concerned

24:33.939 --> 24:35.808 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about these potential changes.

24:35.841 --> 24:40.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dr. Mario Molina is CEO of
Molina Healthcare,
which offers insurance through
the Obamacare

24:40.979 --> 24:44.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exchanges and contracts with the
government
for Medicaid.

24:44.249 --> 24:45.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It operates in 13 states.

24:45.250 --> 24:46.352 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Welcome.

24:46.385 --> 24:48.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIO MOLINA, CEO, Molina
Healthcare: Thank
you.

24:48.354 --> 24:50.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, you just
heard the conversation
about the changes that are --
the proposed

24:50.322 --> 24:51.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
changes to Medicaid.

24:52.024 --> 24:56.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you obviously have a lot of
people under
your umbrella who receive
Medicaid.

24:56.428 --> 24:58.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's your concern?

24:58.097 --> 25:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIO MOLINA: Well, I'm very
concerned about
the long-term funding of the
program.

25:01.300 --> 25:05.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the members of Congress
said yesterday,
if you have Medicaid today,
you're going to

25:05.738 --> 25:08.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have Medicaid tomorrow and
things are going
to be fine.

25:08.540 --> 25:12.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that's only partially true,
because, beginning
in 2020, there are going to be
major cuts

25:12.644 --> 25:17.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Medicaid, and people who have
gotten coverage
through the ACA may lose it.

25:17.116 --> 25:21.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And people that have had
coverage through
traditional Medicaid may lose it
as well.

25:21.220 --> 25:26.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you heard, the two biggest
things in the
state budget are Medicaid and
education.

25:26.492 --> 25:32.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so you're going to see
competition between
funding Medicaid and funding
education.

25:32.531 --> 25:35.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so states are going to have
the make cuts
to one program or the other, or
they're going

25:35.601 --> 25:37.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to have to raise taxes.

25:37.369 --> 25:41.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the burden for paying for
health care
for low-income people is being
shifted to

25:41.173 --> 25:42.941 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the states.

25:42.975 --> 25:46.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The GOP, for
years, not
just with regards to Obamacare,
has said that

25:46.345 --> 25:51.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Medicaid is too big, costs the
government
too much, costs the states too
much, and that

25:51.316 --> 25:54.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they have to control these
costs.

25:54.186 --> 25:55.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is your response to that?

25:55.587 --> 25:59.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIO MOLINA: Well, you know,
the CBO has
looked at this.

25:59.158 --> 26:03.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have found that the
most cost-effective
way of covering low-income
people is actually

26:03.929 --> 26:05.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
through Medicaid.

26:05.230 --> 26:08.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Medicaid accounts for 50 percent
of all births
in this country.

26:08.667 --> 26:12.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One-third of all the children
are covered
under Medicaid, and it pays for
half of long-term

26:12.805 --> 26:13.939 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
care.

26:13.972 --> 26:16.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it's a big program that
covers 72 million
people.

26:16.942 --> 26:21.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You obviously,
I understand,
have some concerns about what
this means for

26:21.413 --> 26:25.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Obamacare exchanges and for
the individual
marketplace as well.

26:25.184 --> 26:26.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What are your concerns in that
regard?

26:26.952 --> 26:30.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIO MOLINA: Well, right now,
we cover about
a million people under the
marketplace.

26:30.088 --> 26:35.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these are people who are
working, but
their employers don't offer them
insurance.

26:35.294 --> 26:39.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're getting subsidies
that allow them
to purchase insurance.

26:39.097 --> 26:40.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they are going to be
threatened.

26:40.933 --> 26:44.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Obviously,
there are a lot
of other larger insurance
companies, larger

26:44.136 --> 26:47.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than yours, who have expressed a
lot of concern
with the exchanges.

26:47.339 --> 26:50.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what have you heard from
them about their
concerns?

26:50.142 --> 26:53.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIO MOLINA: Well, most of the
big insurance
companies have gotten out.

26:53.912 --> 26:54.980 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
United is out.

26:55.013 --> 26:57.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Aetna is getting out, Humana,
Cigna.

26:58.016 --> 27:02.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the major insurance companies
that you
traditionally think of as
employee -- take

27:02.654 --> 27:05.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care of employer-sponsored care
are really
not participating.

27:05.624 --> 27:10.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is being left to smaller
insurers, those
that focus on Medicaid, and many
local companies

27:10.729 --> 27:13.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like not-for-profits or Blue
Cross or Blue
Shield plans.

27:13.432 --> 27:16.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I know you
have been on
the Hill and talking to a lot of
members of

27:16.235 --> 27:17.703 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Congress.

27:17.736 --> 27:19.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you tell them when
they're in the
midst of this debate right now?

27:19.738 --> 27:21.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What have you been saying to
them?

27:21.473 --> 27:23.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIO MOLINA: Well, you know, we
have been
trying to educate them about
what this is

27:24.009 --> 27:27.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to mean for the average
American and
then the ripple effects through
the economy.

27:27.412 --> 27:32.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for example, there was a
study done by
the University of Michigan that
showed this

27:32.251 --> 27:36.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was going to put about $400
million into the
Michigan economy.

27:36.488 --> 27:37.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's going to go away.

27:37.489 --> 27:40.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's going to have a ripple
effect.

27:40.125 --> 27:43.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many smaller rural hospitals are
likely to
go out of business.

27:43.996 --> 27:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, even if you have private
insurance,
you have difficulty getting
access to care,

27:48.367 --> 27:50.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because your community hospitals
may be gone.

27:50.669 --> 27:54.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The E.R. is going to be crowded
with people
who were insured and now have no
place to

27:54.406 --> 27:56.074 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
go.

27:56.108 --> 27:58.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So it's going to affect
everyone, regardless
of what type of insurance you
have.

27:58.210 --> 27:59.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right.

27:59.378 --> 28:02.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dr. Mario Molina, thank you very
much.

28:02.347 --> 28:08.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARIO MOLINA: Thank you.

28:08.420 --> 28:15.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Even as the
president is
working to pass the health care
law, there

28:15.727 --> 28:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are reports he would also like
to craft a
trillion-dollar infrastructure
plan this summer.

28:21.400 --> 28:25.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That leads to questions about
priorities and
the question of public
investment.

28:25.604 --> 28:29.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman,
takes a trip on the rails in a
second look

28:29.341 --> 28:31.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for his weekly series, Making
Sense.

28:31.877 --> 28:35.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNOUNCER: Attention, please,
this is the
last call.

28:35.914 --> 28:39.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Mid-morning at New
York's Penn
Station.

28:39.084 --> 28:46.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Throngs rush to the 10:00 a.m.
Acela to Washington,
D.C. Ridership is up and these
highish-speed

28:46.058 --> 28:52.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trains are at or near capacity
as business
travelers chug up and down the
Northeast Corridor.

28:52.798 --> 28:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Amtrak conductor 2153 to
the heading.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
All stations are cleared.

28:57.202 --> 29:03.976 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: But they're
hurrying up in an
America of slowed-down
productivity, the amount

29:04.009 --> 29:12.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of output per hour of work
rising at just
1.3 percent a year since 2007,
compared to

29:12.150 --> 29:18.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than double that rate from
1947 to 1973.

29:18.390 --> 29:25.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One cause, America's crumbling
infrastructure,
like our passenger rail system,
some of which

29:25.097 --> 29:31.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dates to the Civil War, causing
delays that
hamstring the economy.

29:31.136 --> 29:35.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wick Moorman worked his way to
the top of
the Norfolk Southern Freight
Railroad, before

29:35.340 --> 29:43.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
retiring last year, returning to
work recently,
at a dollar a year, to steer and
revive Amtrak.

29:43.181 --> 29:47.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Riding the Acela back to New
York, he insisted
it's not just our railroads that
need work.

29:47.953 --> 29:52.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WICK MOORMAN, CEO, Amtrak: When
you look at
the state of our highway system
today, which

29:52.824 --> 29:54.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we all get out and drive on
every day, in
terms of congestion, in terms of
the surface

29:54.893 --> 30:03.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conditions, in terms of the fact
that we're
seeing that more and more
bridges have to

30:03.502 --> 30:06.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be closed to rehabilitate, it
has to be an
economic drag, right?

30:06.071 --> 30:08.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Highway congestion alone costs
this country
an enormous amount of
productivity.

30:08.440 --> 30:12.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, why aren't we
investing in
infrastructure of the kind that
made America

30:12.511 --> 30:19.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
great in the '40s, '50s, '60s,
government
investments that hiked our
economy to unheard-of

30:19.985 --> 30:22.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
heights of productivity?

30:22.187 --> 30:24.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So asks Yale's Jacob Hacker.

30:24.890 --> 30:26.792 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
His answer?

30:26.825 --> 30:29.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACOB HACKER, Yale University:
We have forgotten
the incredibly important role
that government

30:29.327 --> 30:31.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
plays in our prosperity.

30:31.229 --> 30:37.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And thus the term
"American Amnesia,"
Hacker's new book, subtitled
"How the War

30:37.269 --> 30:44.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Government Led Us to Forget
What Made America
Prosper," because, in the 19th
and 20th centuries,

30:44.710 --> 30:46.611 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
prosper, we did.

30:46.645 --> 30:51.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACOB HACKER: We went from being
from a relatively
poor, relatively undereducated
and relatively

30:51.349 --> 30:58.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unhealthy society to being the
richest, the
most well-educated and the
healthiest society

30:58.123 --> 30:59.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that the world had ever seen.

30:59.891 --> 31:05.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After World War II, we see the
blossoming
of this really active investing
state that's

31:05.330 --> 31:12.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investing on both non-defense
and defense
technology and really sowing the
seeds for

31:12.170 --> 31:16.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the productivity revolution that
occurs during
this period.

31:16.508 --> 31:22.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Government outlays
of land for
railroads, say, subsidies for
airports and

31:22.047 --> 31:27.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
waterways that helped make the
country one
market, speed goods and labor
from coast to

31:27.886 --> 31:29.321 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
coast.

31:29.354 --> 31:32.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Think of Republican President
Eisenhower's
interstate highway system.

31:32.691 --> 31:37.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACOB HACKER: The estimates are
that it accounted
for something like a third of
productivity

31:37.262 --> 31:42.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
growth in the U.S. economy in
the late 1950s,
and around a quarter in the
1960s.

31:42.400 --> 31:47.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And what's true of
hard infrastructure
is true of what were once
America's greatest

31:47.939 --> 31:52.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
soft productivity advantages:
health and education.

31:52.077 --> 31:56.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACOB HACKER: If you look at
older Americans
in the United States, they're
the most educated

31:56.948 --> 31:58.750 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
older citizens in the world.

31:58.784 --> 32:04.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you look at younger
Americans, we have
fallen to the high teens in
terms of college

32:04.923 --> 32:06.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
completion rates.

32:06.825 --> 32:08.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in a new economy that's
based much more
on knowledge and technology,
we're not investing

32:08.493 --> 32:10.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
adequately or correctly to get
kids through
college the way other countries
are.

32:10.362 --> 32:11.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In short, claims
Hacker, we forgot
what made us great, and instead
adopted a

32:11.863 --> 32:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
profound skepticism about
government.

32:14.599 --> 32:20.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACOB HACKER: As we have seen
government become
weaker and lobbyists more
powerful, Americans

32:20.672 --> 32:23.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have also become less trusting
of governments.

32:23.241 --> 32:28.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And yet, these
days, government
investments may actually be the
most productive

32:28.280 --> 32:30.015 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ones available.

32:30.048 --> 32:35.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACOB HACKER: If you look at how
our economy
has suffered over the last 15 or
20 years,

32:35.787 --> 32:40.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's in significant part because
we haven't
done the investments in research
and development

32:40.559 --> 32:45.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and infrastructure and other
public goods
that are necessary for our
growth.

32:45.063 --> 32:46.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, unfortunately, we're going
to be feeling
that overhang for a long time to
come, because

32:46.832 --> 32:50.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's the investments we made in
the 1950s
and '60s and '70s that result in
some of the

32:50.569 --> 32:52.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
greatest technological
breakthroughs that
we enjoy today.

32:52.871 --> 32:53.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Such as?

32:53.872 --> 32:55.607 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JACOB HACKER: The iPhone.

32:55.640 --> 32:56.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have an iPhone here?

32:56.675 --> 32:58.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: I have got one.

32:58.510 --> 33:06.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACOB HACKER: Every major
component of your
iPhone is as a result of public
investment

33:06.318 --> 33:08.186 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and development.

33:08.220 --> 33:13.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GPS, the memory processors,
touch-screen technology,
originated in public research
projects.

33:13.792 --> 33:19.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: As we neared New
York, the lack
of investment in passenger rail
was hard to

33:19.364 --> 33:20.498 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
miss.

33:20.532 --> 33:26.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Acela decelerated, cars on
I-95 whizzing
past us.

33:26.238 --> 33:31.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That prompted a question to
Amtrak's CEO:
Why had we slowed to a crawl?

33:31.610 --> 33:36.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WICK MOORMAN: Because there's a
New Jersey
transit train going into Penn
Station ahead

33:36.615 --> 33:41.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of us, and we have exactly two
tracks under
that river.

33:41.319 --> 33:44.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and we get this kind of
congestion all the
time.

33:44.489 --> 33:49.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Moreover, those
rail tunnels,
now more than a century old,
were flooded

33:49.227 --> 33:51.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by Hurricane Sandy four years
ago.

33:51.529 --> 34:02.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WICK MOORMAN: And I think that
the day is
coming when this nation is just
going to be

34:02.807 --> 34:05.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forced to invest, if we want to,
you know,
maintain our place in the world.

34:05.577 --> 34:08.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
President-Elect: We are going to
fix our inner

34:08.046 --> 34:14.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cities and rebuild our highways,
bridges,
tunnels, airports, schools,
hospitals.

34:14.686 --> 34:18.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to rebuild our
infrastructure,
which will become, by the way,
second to none.

34:18.857 --> 34:25.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: On election night,
president-elect
Donald Trump touted his plan for
rebuilding

34:25.163 --> 34:34.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America, $137 billion in federal
tax credits
to private investors who would
then be incentivized

34:34.139 --> 34:40.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to finance toll roads, toll
bridges or other
projects that generate their own
revenue,

34:40.512 --> 34:46.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unleashing a hoped-for trillion
dollars of
infrastructure investment over
10 years.

34:46.418 --> 34:49.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, if it works, says Jacob
Hacker, a Democrat:

34:49.587 --> 34:54.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JACOB HACKER: He's the
Nixon-goes-to-China
of infrastructure spending.

34:54.159 --> 34:58.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I also think he has a very
good chance
of putting through massive tax
cuts.

34:58.296 --> 35:03.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're going to take away a lot
of the public
funds that we need to do that
kind of infrastructure

35:03.401 --> 35:05.337 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investment.

35:05.370 --> 35:08.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Furthermore, some
private infrastructure
investments, like toll roads,
have failed

35:08.840 --> 35:10.842 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in recent years.

35:10.875 --> 35:13.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As for private investment in
Amtrak?

35:13.545 --> 35:15.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Well, says its new CEO:

35:15.347 --> 35:17.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WICK MOORMAN: I'm skeptical.

35:17.282 --> 35:23.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where -- how do you -- you fund
private investment,
as you know, in the highways by
things like

35:23.888 --> 35:24.856 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tolls.

35:24.889 --> 35:25.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Right.

35:25.890 --> 35:26.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WICK MOORMAN: Right?

35:26.891 --> 35:28.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Well, that's harder out here.

35:28.460 --> 35:31.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Not going to have a
toll at Wilmington.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WICK MOORMAN: No.

35:33.465 --> 35:37.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, every time the train
goes through
with an E-ZPass, and you kind of
click off

35:37.168 --> 35:38.303 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
another one?

35:38.336 --> 35:40.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just -- it's harder for me
to see right
now.

35:40.939 --> 35:43.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And you're a guy
who went to
Harvard Business School.

35:43.708 --> 35:49.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're not talking as some kind
of left-wing
Democrat who's always for more
and more spending,

35:49.347 --> 35:50.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more and more taxes.

35:50.348 --> 35:52.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WICK MOORMAN: No, no, no.

35:52.183 --> 35:56.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm just a person who looks at
the country
and what needs to be done and
says, this is

35:56.955 --> 36:01.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what we do in the business
world.

36:01.393 --> 36:02.694 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We fix this.

36:02.727 --> 36:04.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why can't you fix it?

36:04.295 --> 36:07.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Good question, to
which we will
all be waiting for the answer.

36:07.432 --> 36:12.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
economics
correspondent Paul Solman,
reporting aboard

36:12.937 --> 36:17.175 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Amtrak 2168.

36:17.208 --> 36:31.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Next: the
memoirs of a hippie,
physician and disease fighter.

36:31.823 --> 36:35.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fred de Sam Lazaro reports, part
of our ongoing
series Agents for Change.

36:35.994 --> 36:43.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The shiny
red T-bird convertible
is a nod to its owner's Detroit
roots.

36:43.835 --> 36:47.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's in San Francisco that
he first made
a name for himself.

36:47.472 --> 36:49.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was quite a name to begin
with.

36:49.240 --> 36:51.176 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LARRY BRILLIANT, Epidemiologist:
It's so arrogant
to have a name like Brilliant
that I put Sometimes

36:52.710 --> 36:54.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Brilliant and Sometimes Not So
Brilliant.

36:54.379 --> 36:56.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's what I sign.

36:56.214 --> 37:01.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The memoir
Larry Brilliant
is autographing chronicles a
life of unusual

37:01.519 --> 37:07.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
journeys, a civil rights, an
anti-Vietnam
War activist, and hippie, who
helped eradicate

37:07.892 --> 37:09.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
smallpox from the world.

37:09.961 --> 37:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, he's an adviser to
Silicon Valley philanthropists
who are helping him tackle other
major diseases.

DR.

37:17.469 --> 37:21.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LARRY BRILLIANT: In the last 30
years we've
had 30 pathogens, viruses jump
from animals

37:21.206 --> 37:22.774 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to humans.

37:22.807 --> 37:29.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know some of them, SARS,
MERS, swine flu,
bird flu, Ebola, Zika.

37:29.047 --> 37:35.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: It all began
in 1969 in
San Francisco, where Brilliant
had come for

37:35.820 --> 37:41.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an internship after medical
school and volunteered
to work at the recently closed
federal prison

37:41.626 --> 37:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Alcatraz Island, which was
occupied by
a group of about 100 Native
American protesters.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That stint got him on the
evening news.

37:50.468 --> 37:52.303 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

37:52.337 --> 37:55.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LARRY BRILLIANT: Somebody from
Warner Brothers
saw me on television, and they
called me the

37:55.073 --> 38:00.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
next day and they said, we're
starting a movie
in two or three days.

38:00.712 --> 38:05.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to be gathering at
the same place
I got off the boat, and it's
going to be a

38:05.350 --> 38:07.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
movie about hippies and rock 'n'
roll.

38:07.352 --> 38:10.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's going to have the Grateful
Dead and the
Jefferson Airplane and Pink
Floyd.

38:10.922 --> 38:16.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He joined
the crew as
a doctor, the film was a flop,
but Brilliant

38:16.628 --> 38:19.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
became friends with some of the
era's iconic
figures.

38:19.931 --> 38:24.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: What we have in mind is
breakfast in
bed for 400,000.

38:24.602 --> 38:31.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: They
included the Woodstock
emcee who became famous in clown
costume as

38:31.743 --> 38:32.710 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Wavy Gravy.

38:32.744 --> 38:33.711 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

38:33.745 --> 38:34.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LARRY BRILLIANT: This is Wavy
Gravy.

38:34.746 --> 38:37.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: I am so honored to meet
you.

38:37.815 --> 38:42.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: At 80, he's
slowed only
physically.

38:42.620 --> 38:47.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The friends still gather often
and recount
their adventures, including a
journey across

38:47.525 --> 38:49.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Europe toward India.

38:49.494 --> 38:54.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They had planned to feed flood
victims in
what was then East Pakistan, now
Bangladesh.

38:54.065 --> 38:58.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WAVY GRAVY, Entertainer: And the
idea was
that we had so much media from
doing the free

38:58.736 --> 39:05.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kitchen at Woodstock, that if we
got there
and started feeding people, that
it would

39:05.810 --> 39:08.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
embarrass the government: My
God, there's
hippies doing it.

39:08.446 --> 39:10.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We better do it better!

39:10.281 --> 39:14.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: For Larry
Brilliant and
his wife, Girija, this was a
transformative

39:14.719 --> 39:16.120 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
journey.

39:16.154 --> 39:19.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They became disciples of a
spiritual leader
or guru, Neem Karoli Baba.

39:19.924 --> 39:22.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Were you able to converse with
him in Hindi?

39:22.227 --> 39:23.194 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

39:23.228 --> 39:24.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LARRY BRILLIANT: Yes.

39:24.996 --> 39:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Hindi was a
big asset
for the assignment the guru gave
him: to help

39:28.466 --> 39:34.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eradicate small pox in India and
Bangladesh,
which were among last holdouts
for the virus

39:34.539 --> 39:37.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that had killed half-a-billion
people through
history.

39:38.009 --> 39:38.977 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

39:39.010 --> 39:41.346 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LARRY BRILLIANT: Bad disease.

39:41.379 --> 39:44.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Most people thought it could
never be eradicated.

39:44.916 --> 39:51.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We had had a vaccine for 200
years, and what
we were doing is we were
vaccinating everybody.

39:51.723 --> 39:55.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: That
strategy worked in
the West and developed
countries, but could

39:55.860 --> 40:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
never work in India, he says,
with a population
then of 600 million people, some
20 million

40:02.100 --> 40:05.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of whom were on a bus or train
on any given
day.

40:05.837 --> 40:10.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The hippie doctor coaxed his way
into the
World Health Organization team
that took a

40:10.241 --> 40:16.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
different approach: tracking
down every single
infected person and vaccinating
everyone around

40:16.681 --> 40:21.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them, creating a so-called ring
of immunity,
so the virus couldn't spread.

40:21.619 --> 40:23.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was a Herculean task.

40:23.121 --> 40:24.756 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

40:24.789 --> 40:30.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LARRY BRILLIANT: We had to visit
every house
in India every month for 20
months.

40:30.061 --> 40:36.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We made two billion house calls,
150,000 people,
doctors from 170 countries.

40:36.334 --> 40:42.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Smallpox
became the first
disease ever eradicated from the
planet.

40:42.340 --> 40:46.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brilliant went on to become a
leading expert
on infectious disease, a
consultant to the

40:46.377 --> 40:50.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
White House most recently when
Ebola threatened
to escalate.

40:50.181 --> 40:52.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: What is it going to take to
prevent an
outbreak?

40:52.450 --> 40:56.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Today, Larry
Brilliant
heads a group called the Skoll
Global Threats

40:56.854 --> 41:02.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fund, which focuses on issues
like climate
change, nuclear proliferation,
and pandemics.

41:02.493 --> 41:06.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is an affiliate of the Skoll
Foundation,
which also helps fund the

41:07.031 --> 41:09.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: It's about detect and
report.

41:09.367 --> 41:13.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: These
epidemiologists
are setting up pilot studies to
gather data

41:13.271 --> 41:18.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 28 countries, trying to
determine early
patterns of how a disease breaks
out.

DR.

41:20.645 --> 41:24.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LARRY BRILLIANT: Wouldn't you
like to create
advisory panels and partnerships
with tech

41:24.415 --> 41:27.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
companies, major universities,
epi departments?

41:27.218 --> 41:32.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Brilliant
has raised millions
of philanthropic dollars for
other efforts

41:32.090 --> 41:37.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that include the Seva
Foundation, an eye care
charity now in several countries
that he started

41:37.528 --> 41:40.365 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Wavy Gravy.

41:40.398 --> 41:44.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After the smallpox campaign,
Larry Brilliant
began forging ties in Silicon
Valley, where

41:44.936 --> 41:50.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's been a kind of guru to many
tech industry
leaders, including the late
Apple founder,

41:50.108 --> 41:51.909 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Steve Jobs.

41:51.943 --> 41:56.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The two men met in the '70s here
in India,
where both had come seeking
spiritual harbor.

42:01.586 --> 42:06.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The
Brilliants' California
home is replete with symbols
that reflect

42:06.090 --> 42:08.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an embrace of all major
religions.

Baba, he would always say sab
ek, all one.

42:14.565 --> 42:19.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: That was the
spirit of
the '60s and '70s, he writes,
when beautiful

42:20.004 --> 42:25.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
flowers blossomed alongside
vicious weeds,
an era that was neither all
Martin Luther

42:25.443 --> 42:27.879 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
King nor all Charles Manson.

42:43.394 --> 42:45.029 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
challenges by writing a book.

42:45.062 --> 42:48.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

hear from your
local PBS station.

42:48.633 --> 42:53.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a chance to offer your

in our Brief
But Spectacular series.

43:03.147 --> 43:14.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from Kelly
Corrigan, a New

KELLY CORRIGAN, Author: I do, do
a word a
day, and I love it.

43:37.281 --> 43:45.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My word of the day the other day
on my e-mail
was ripsnorter, that, like, a
party could

43:45.189 --> 43:46.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be a real ripsnorter.

43:46.891 --> 43:51.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's mine forever now,
because I'm going
to use that one.

43:51.963 --> 43:54.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My father was easily impressed
by everyone.

43:54.932 --> 44:00.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He sort of gave me the
impression that the
world was rooting for me.

44:00.438 --> 44:08.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He always used to say, "Ah,
lovey, you're
going to write the great
American novel someday."

44:08.279 --> 44:15.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I thought, boy, that would
be the thrill
of a lifetime to hand him a book
that I wrote.

44:15.052 --> 44:21.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was 36 with two kids in
diapers, and I had
discovered a pretty big tumor in
my breast.

44:21.759 --> 44:26.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so I went over to my
friend's house who
is an OB-GYN.

44:26.497 --> 44:32.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I took my shirt off on her
sofa in front
of my daughters, who were 1 and
2.

44:32.937 --> 44:35.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she kind of felt me up on
the sofa.

44:35.940 --> 44:50.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she said, "You got to go --
you got to
go have it looked at tomorrow."

44:50.888 --> 44:54.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The doctor said, "I am very
concerned."

44:54.392 --> 44:58.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then I said, "Why are you
concerned?"

44:58.796 --> 45:03.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he said, "Because it looks
like an explosion."

45:03.768 --> 45:05.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Talk about words.

45:05.436 --> 45:07.038 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Like, really?

45:07.071 --> 45:14.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You want to say explosion to a
36-years-old
who is, like, holding back
tears?

45:14.478 --> 45:25.256 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's not

45:25.289 --> 45:26.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a good choice, Doctor.

45:26.490 --> 45:35.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so I started chemotherapy
right away.

45:35.433 --> 45:38.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then, while I was in
chemotherapy, my
father was diagnosed with
cancer.

45:38.869 --> 45:50.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His was more complex because of
his age and
because of some previous health
issues.

45:50.314 --> 46:00.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so we were really told to

46:00.358 --> 46:08.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so we were really told to

46:08.733 --> 46:19.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a great year, and not to
have -- quote,
unquote -- "outrageous
expectations" for more.

46:19.810 --> 46:29.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was in a panic, and I sort of
sent that
panicked energy on writing.

46:29.987 --> 46:38.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just felt like you can't
possibly let this
man die without telling him,
with sufficient

46:38.329 --> 46:45.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
emphasis, what it has been to be
his kid.

46:45.369 --> 46:57.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If I were to try to say to him,
God, you're
a great dad or you're, like, the
foundation

46:57.314 --> 47:10.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of my life, he would say, "Oh,
lovey, lovey,
lovey," and he would switch it
back to me.

47:10.061 --> 47:17.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it really had to be a book,
because I
had to have uninterrupted space
on the page

47:17.668 --> 47:32.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to say, no, this
is going to take more than a
minute.

47:32.650 --> 47:36.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is going to take 300 pages.

47:36.787 --> 47:47.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is no quantifying how
thrilling it was
to go on that ride with my dad.

47:47.798 --> 47:51.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, he came to readings.

47:51.402 --> 47:53.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He signed books with me.

47:53.838 --> 47:56.207 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He shook hands with people.

47:56.240 --> 48:00.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was the absolute dream come
true of all
dreams.

48:00.344 --> 48:06.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If nothing ever good ever
happens to me again,
I got more than I needed.

48:06.851 --> 48:10.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If nothing ever good ever
