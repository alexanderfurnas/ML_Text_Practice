JUDY WOODRUFF: Brutal
wars in the Middle East,
Africa and Asia have forced
the world's populations

00:06.666 --> 00:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of refugees and displaced
persons to near record highs.

00:09.300 --> 00:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the Trump
administration has
signaled its intention to
substantially change U.S.

00:15.366 --> 00:17.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
refugee policy.

00:17.466 --> 00:21.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Filippo Grandi, who is
the United Nations' top
official leading the
response to the refugee

00:21.600 --> 00:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crisis, is in Washington
this week for meetings at
the White House and Pentagon.

00:26.566 --> 00:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our William Brangham sat down
with him earlier this evening.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Hi,
Commissioner Filippo Grandi.

00:31.233 --> 00:33.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Welcome.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI, United
Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees: Thank you.

00:35.433 --> 00:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You're here
in Washington, D.C., obviously
this week to meet with some

00:36.666 --> 00:38.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
members of the Trump
administration.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm curious, what message are
you here to convey to them?

00:40.566 --> 00:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: A message
that I have already
conveyed in previous visits.

00:47.533 --> 00:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. leadership in humanitarian
matters and specifically in
matters concerning responses

00:55.533 --> 01:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to refugee crisis is
very important, continues
to be very important.

01:00.300 --> 01:02.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the response I
get is quite good.

01:02.266 --> 01:03.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
What is that response?

01:03.700 --> 01:05.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you hear back from them?

01:05.766 --> 01:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: Well, I think
we all watched Ambassador Haley,
the U.S. ambassador to United

01:11.833 --> 01:13.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Nations...

01:13.100 --> 01:15.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Nikki Haley, yes.

01:15.233 --> 01:18.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: ... visit
recently refugee programs
in Turkey and in Georgia.

01:18.666 --> 01:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're talking about Syrian
refugees, the biggest
refugee crisis in the world.

01:23.566 --> 01:26.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And her message was very
clear and very strong.

01:26.833 --> 01:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
United States' generosity and
United States' support for
refugees continues to be strong

01:35.366 --> 01:37.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and constant.

01:37.400 --> 01:41.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I greatly appreciated
this message on her part.

01:41.966 --> 01:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I know
Ambassador Haley has said
that on several occasions.

01:45.866 --> 01:50.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we have also seen President
Trump try to pass through
an executive order that, in

01:52.266 --> 01:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
effect, says, we're not taking
any refugees in the U.S.

01:54.800 --> 01:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the president has conflated
refugees with the fear of
terrorism, saying, we can't know

02:00.600 --> 02:02.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who these people are.

02:02.533 --> 02:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this something
that you bring up with
administration officials?

02:04.800 --> 02:08.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Do you talk with them
about those concerns
that they have shared?

02:08.100 --> 02:10.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: A great deal.

02:10.166 --> 02:15.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, I don't think there
was ever any statement saying
that no more refugees should

02:16.033 --> 02:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
come to the United States.

02:18.133 --> 02:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were decisions to increase
the vetting of those selected
to come here and to limit

02:24.733 --> 02:26.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
certain nationalities.

02:26.400 --> 02:31.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
All this, as you know,
is now being discussed
in the judicial sphere.

02:33.200 --> 02:36.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So we have to wait for
that discussion, which
is an American, a U.S.
discussion to finish.

02:38.233 --> 02:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our message is, resettlement
programs -- this is what we're
talking about -- are a very

02:42.300 --> 02:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
important tool to protect
the most vulnerable refugees.

02:47.300 --> 02:52.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And vetting is already quite
strong for those refugees
that enter that program.

02:54.266 --> 02:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, this is a sovereign
decision of the United
States, but I think and I hope

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, after all this is done,
after conclusions are made,
that program will be preserved.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it may be reduced to
previous higher levels, but
I hope that, with the passage

03:11.366 --> 03:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of time and once these controls
-- once the administration
confident that the controls

03:17.066 --> 03:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are there, will we continue
to see robust resettlement
to the United States.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The reason
I ask about this is, this is
not just a concern expressed by

03:22.933 --> 03:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump, but even
Chancellor Angela Merkel in
Germany has seen a good deal of

03:27.666 --> 03:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
resistance to her very
open embrace of refugees.

03:30.933 --> 03:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There still is a very strong
fear, a conflation of refugees
with the fear of terrorism.

03:37.900 --> 03:42.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm just curious what you
-- what do you say to world
leaders when they express this,

03:42.666 --> 03:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we don't have the
political appetite to take
refugees onto our shores?

03:46.633 --> 03:51.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FILIPPO GRANDI: The
fear of insecurity is
a very understandable
one, especially in a

03:53.700 --> 03:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
world in which terrorism
has created so much damage
and killed so many people.

03:59.933 --> 04:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we are, of course,
with states in saying
controls, checks, vetting
have to be carried

04:07.566 --> 04:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out in the most -- in the
strongest possible way.

04:11.533 --> 04:13.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is absolutely true.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But I also pass another message.

04:16.033 --> 04:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, it's very rare, if
ever, that refuges coming from
situations of war, of violence,

04:24.300 --> 04:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of violations of human rights
perpetrate crimes of terrorism.

04:28.733 --> 04:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is not they who do that.

04:30.366 --> 04:31.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is other people.

04:31.600 --> 04:36.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In fact, those people
do not bring terror.

04:37.333 --> 04:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Refugees flee from terror.

04:39.433 --> 04:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's very important
not to conflate refugees and
terrorists in this sense.

04:42.866 --> 04:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's very important to control,
it's very important to check,
but it's also very important

04:46.633 --> 04:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make that distinction,
and never forget where
these people come from.

04:50.933 --> 04:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Lastly, a
quick question on funding.

04:53.800 --> 04:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I know this is obviously an
enormous challenge for the U.N.

04:57.100 --> 05:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you have enough money to
do the work you need to do?

05:01.066 --> 05:03.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: Certainly not.

05:03.800 --> 05:08.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Our budget last year was
calculated at 7 billion
U.S. dollars, 2016.

05:10.766 --> 05:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We got billion U.S. dollars.

05:13.333 --> 05:16.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So about 55 percent of
our needs the covered.

05:16.433 --> 05:19.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This means that we do a
lot of prioritization.

05:19.700 --> 05:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we prioritize, evidently.

05:22.033 --> 05:27.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
With so many refugee
crises, with 65 million
refugees and displaced
people around the world,

05:28.266 --> 05:31.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we have to prioritize
lifesaving activities.

05:31.233 --> 05:33.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What suffers?

05:33.233 --> 05:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What suffers what is not
immediately vital and necessary,
but which is equally important,

05:38.500 --> 05:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like education, livelihoods.

05:41.166 --> 05:46.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why we're looking at
other ways to meet those needs
with other sources of funding,

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because they're equally
important in the long
run to sustain assistance
to millions of refugees.

05:52.900 --> 05:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Filippo
Grandi, thank you very
much for being here.

05:54.533 --> 05:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: Thank you.
