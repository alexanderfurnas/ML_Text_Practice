07:05.025 --> 07:07.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT ONE OF THE POSSIBILITIES

07:07.494 --> 07:09.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS THAT IT'S BASED ON

07:09.596 --> 07:12.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SKILL-BASED TECHNOLOGIES THAT

07:12.132 --> 07:14.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REQUIRE PEOPLE TO HAVE MORE

SKILLS BEFORE THEY CAN GET A JOB

07:15.935 --> 07:19.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU COULD HAVE A GUY WHO DROPPED

07:19.306 --> 07:20.607 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL COULD GO

07:20.607 --> 07:23.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIRECTLY TO A FACTORY, A UNION

07:23.943 --> 07:25.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

A FAIRLY GOOD LIFE AND HIS

07:37.424 --> 07:39.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERYBODY ELSE'S OVER THE LAST

07:39.659 --> 07:43.129 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
30 OR 40 YEARS, A HUGE AMOUNT OF

07:43.129 --> 07:44.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE POVERTY PROBLEM WOULD BE

07:44.664 --> 07:45.632 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REDUCED.

07:45.632 --> 07:49.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THERE IS A REAL PROBLEM WITH

THE LACK OF GROWTH OF WAGES

07:50.470 --> 07:54.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMONG LOW-EDUCATED, YOUNG, AND

07:54.674 --> 07:56.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ESPECIALLY AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN.

07:56.509 --> 07:58.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

WAGE.

08:03.983 --> 08:04.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK SOME PEOPLE MIGHT FIND

08:04.918 --> 08:05.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT A LITTLE SURPRISING THAT

08:05.985 --> 08:07.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME CONSERVATIVES SORT OF CAME

08:07.754 --> 08:09.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AROUND TO THAT, GIVEN JUST HOW

08:09.055 --> 08:11.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTROVERSIAL-- YOU KNOW, IT IS,

08:11.491 --> 08:12.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

KAY, CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE

08:14.728 --> 08:17.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSERVATIVE JUSTIFICATION FOR

08:17.731 --> 08:19.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE?

08:19.099 --> 08:21.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THAT WAS A VERY TRICKY

08:21.034 --> 08:22.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AREA.

08:22.369 --> 08:23.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WOULD SAY IT WAS ONE OF THE

08:23.536 --> 08:26.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TWO TOP TRICKIEST AREAS.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR INSTANCE, CONSERVATIVES ARE-

08:27.640 --> 08:29.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
- THE CONSERVATIVE GROUP WAS

08:29.109 --> 08:31.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE LIKELY TO BE WORRIED ABOUT

08:31.144 --> 08:34.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LOSS OF JOBS THAT MIGHT

08:34.147 --> 08:37.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOLLOW A MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE,

08:37.984 --> 08:40.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE THAN THE PROGRESSIVES WERE

08:40.754 --> 08:42.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.

08:42.622 --> 08:43.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WERE MUCH MORE CONCERNED

08:43.556 --> 08:44.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THE INCOME OF THE PEOPLE

08:44.858 --> 08:46.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO HAD THE JOBS.

08:46.459 --> 08:49.129 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE

08:49.129 --> 08:51.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROUP OF TRIED TO PRACTICE

08:51.564 --> 08:52.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRINCIPLED AND REASONED

08:52.966 --> 08:56.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISCUSSION TO GET TO DECISIONS.

08:56.436 --> 08:59.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO KAY IS EXACTLY RIGHT.

08:59.139 --> 09:14.053 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT SUCH LOW WAGES NOW DOES NOT

09:14.053 --> 09:15.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIFT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOW-

09:15.555 --> 09:18.124 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAGE JOBS OUT OF POVERTY.

09:18.124 --> 09:19.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSERVATIVES DON'T WANT THAT

09:19.092 --> 09:21.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EITHER.

09:21.361 --> 09:22.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

09:26.199 --> 09:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT REALLY WAS WHAT THE

09:27.300 --> 09:28.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISCUSSION WAS ABOUT.

09:28.368 --> 09:29.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, THE SWEET SPOT IS HIGHLY

09:29.836 --> 09:31.304 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICIZED.

LIGHT, NOT HEAT, TO THESE

09:34.541 --> 09:35.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

09:35.842 --> 09:36.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

09:37.444 --> 09:38.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

09:38.244 --> 09:38.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

09:38.912 --> 09:39.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

09:39.546 --> 09:40.346 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

09:40.346 --> 09:41.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NUMBER.

09:41.047 --> 09:41.848 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, FOR THAT--

09:41.848 --> 09:42.816 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YES, IT SHOULD BE HIGHER THAN

09:42.816 --> 09:43.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CURRENT LEVEL AND LOWER THAN

09:43.850 --> 09:44.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
$15 AN HOUR.

09:44.884 --> 09:45.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
(LAUGHS)

09:45.819 --> 09:47.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WE ALL AGREE ON THAT.

09:47.086 --> 09:47.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YEAH.

09:47.987 --> 09:49.322 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S WHERE WE HAD TO LEAVE IT.

09:49.322 --> 09:50.490 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: THE REPORT SUGGESTS

09:50.490 --> 09:52.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IT COULD BE HELPFUL TO

09:52.325 --> 09:53.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCREASE WORK REQUIREMENTS FOR

09:53.793 --> 09:55.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CERTAIN BENEFITS.

09:55.094 --> 09:58.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THE 1996 WELFARE REFORM

09:58.631 --> 10:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAW, REMEMBER, EMPHASIZED

10:00.366 --> 10:03.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT ADDED A WORK REQUIREMENT.

10:05.004 --> 10:06.840 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT WAS SOMETHING NEW IN

10:06.840 --> 10:08.274 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POVERTY POLICY.

10:08.274 --> 10:11.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT WELFARE IS

10:11.110 --> 10:13.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NO LONGER A CHIEF DRIVER OF

10:13.580 --> 10:15.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BENEFITS FOR THE POOR.

10:15.682 --> 10:17.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE MANY, MANY OTHER SOURCES

10:17.183 --> 10:19.152 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF BENEFITS FOR THE POOR.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND NONE OF THEM, OR VERY FEW OF

10:21.621 --> 10:23.122 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEM, HAVE ANY WORK REQUIREMENTS

10:23.122 --> 10:24.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTACHED TO THEM.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO FOR CONSERVATIVES, ESPECIALLY

10:27.627 --> 10:28.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THEY DO BELIEVE THAT THE

10:28.795 --> 10:30.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELFARE REFORM BILL WAS

10:30.063 --> 10:33.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASICALLY A SUCCESS, THE BELIEF

10:33.132 --> 10:34.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THAT AT THE VERY LEAST, WE

10:34.934 --> 10:36.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOULD EXPERIMENT WITH WORK

10:36.970 --> 10:39.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REQUIREMENTS FOR FOOD STAMPS OR

10:39.239 --> 10:42.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR HOUSING AND THAT KIND OF

10:42.876 --> 10:52.652 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THING.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> STRONGLY THAT IF WE WERE

10:54.787 --> 10:56.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONDITIONED FOOD STAMPS THERE

10:56.489 --> 10:59.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD BE NO SAFETY NET THAT

10:59.893 --> 11:02.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CERTAIN VERY VULNERABLE FAMILIES

11:02.362 --> 11:04.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD NOT FALL THROUGH.

11:04.931 --> 11:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT SEEMED JUST UNVIABLE TO

11:07.500 --> 11:08.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
US.

11:08.201 --> 11:11.204 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THE OTHER HAND, I THINK THAT

11:11.204 --> 11:13.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS A BELIEF THAT, AND IT'S

11:13.573 --> 11:15.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSISTENT WITH DATA THAT WORK

11:15.008 --> 11:17.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REQUIREMENTS IN THE WELFARE

11:17.010 --> 11:18.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REFORM BILL DID INCREASE SINGLE

11:18.978 --> 11:20.280 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOTHER'S LABOR FORCE

11:20.280 --> 11:21.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTICIPATION IN A ROBUST

11:21.681 --> 11:22.549 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ECONOMY.

11:22.549 --> 11:23.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: THERE'S ANOTHER

11:23.316 --> 11:24.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATISTIC IN THE COURT REPORT

11:24.317 --> 11:26.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT HOW THE EMPLOYMENT RATE

11:26.452 --> 11:28.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMONG YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN

11:28.154 --> 11:29.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS BASICALLY DROPPED IN THE

11:29.822 --> 11:31.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAST FEW DECADES.

11:31.524 --> 11:32.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAIN, JUST SPEAKING IN TERMS OF

11:32.492 --> 11:33.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOLUTIONS, HOW DO WE SOLVE THOSE

11:33.993 --> 11:36.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBLEMS?

11:36.195 --> 11:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, WE HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF

11:40.300 --> 11:42.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCERN, THROUGHOUT THE REPORT

11:42.502 --> 11:44.304 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT WHAT WE CALL "DISCONNECTED

11:44.304 --> 11:45.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEN."

11:45.405 --> 11:50.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE WANT TO SEE BETTER SKILLS FOR

11:50.176 --> 11:51.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE MEN.

11:51.778 --> 11:54.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS A MAJOR PIECE OF OUR

11:54.314 --> 11:57.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTRIBUTION I THINK HERE WAS TO

11:57.917 --> 12:00.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKE THE FOCUS AWAY SO MUCH FROM

12:00.386 --> 12:02.755 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE, WHICH IS THE

12:02.755 --> 12:04.023 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND TO THINK MORE ABOUT THE

12:04.023 --> 12:05.658 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KINDS OF OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE

12:05.658 --> 12:08.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AVAILABLE IN MORE TECHNICAL,

12:08.227 --> 12:10.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE BLUE-COLLAR AREAS.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND-- SO THAT'S ANOTHER THING WE

12:12.532 --> 12:13.499 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD LIKE TO SEE.

12:13.499 --> 12:15.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WHEN YOUNG MEN DON'T EITHER

12:15.802 --> 12:19.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE THE EDUCATION TO GET THE

12:19.138 --> 12:21.341 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOBS THAT EXIST OR THE WORK

12:21.341 --> 12:25.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPERIENCE TO GET IT, THEN WE

12:25.945 --> 12:28.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RECOMMENDED APPRENTICESHIPS AS A

12:28.815 --> 12:31.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORM WHERE THEY CAN GET BOTH,

12:31.050 --> 12:32.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN-- EVEN WHEN THEY'RE NOT

12:32.418 --> 12:33.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUITE READY TO TAKE THAT NEXT

12:33.720 --> 12:35.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEP INTO THE FORMAL LABOR

12:35.188 --> 12:36.122 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARKET.

12:36.122 --> 12:40.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE SECTORS THAT NEED TO TAKE

12:40.526 --> 12:44.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UP THE CHALLENGE ARE POLITICAL

12:44.831 --> 12:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECTORS, COMMUNITY

12:47.200 --> 12:50.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORGANIZATIONS, THE MEDIA.

12:50.703 --> 12:51.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> STATE GOVERNMENTS, TOO.

12:51.871 --> 12:52.972 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> STATE GOVERNMENTS, WHAT

12:52.972 --> 12:55.108 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITIES COULD DO IN THIS.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK OUR JOB WAS TO

12:57.677 --> 13:01.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDICATE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE FOR

13:01.047 --> 13:03.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROGRESSIVES AND CONSERVATIVES,

13:03.082 --> 13:04.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGH PRINCIPLED AND

13:04.217 --> 13:05.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REASONDISCUSSIONS, THAT COULD

13:05.952 --> 13:08.254 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COME UP WITH A SET OF IDEAS THAT

13:08.254 --> 13:10.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD MOVE US FORWARD.

13:10.523 --> 13:13.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK THAT WE ARE FACING A

13:13.993 --> 13:18.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FUTURE WHERE WE HAVE A LOT OF

13:24.303 --> 13:26.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

LEGAL JUJITSU.

14:58.164 --> 14:59.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SERVICE PROVIDERS WANT THE

PASSED ON TO THE CUSTOMERS.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

POLICY TO DEBATE.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WHAT HAPPENED IS THE FCC

16:03.062 --> 16:05.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECIDED TO RULE ON THE

16:05.364 --> 16:07.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

A REACTION THE INDUSTRY IS

16:14.340 --> 16:16.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIGHTING OR ARE THEY TRYING TO

16:16.309 --> 16:17.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PREVENT SOMETHING?

16:17.844 --> 16:19.178 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY

16:19.178 --> 16:21.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARGUING THAT THE SERVICE

16:21.681 --> 16:23.983 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROVIDERS DON'T REALLY PROVIDE A

16:23.983 --> 16:25.218 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOT OF INTELLIGENCE INTO THE

16:25.218 --> 16:26.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NETWORK ITSELF.

16:26.085 --> 16:28.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE LITERALLY BEING ASKED TO

16:28.487 --> 16:31.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PASS ON PACKETS AND DATA,

16:31.624 --> 16:33.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ESSENTIALLY ON A BEST-EFFORT

16:33.426 --> 16:36.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASIS AN TO TREAT EVERY PACKET

16:36.062 --> 16:37.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ESSENTIALLY THE SAME.

16:37.563 --> 16:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE EXAMPLE I'VE ALWAYS USED

16:40.733 --> 16:43.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS IF YOU ARE SETTING UP A TOLL

16:43.169 --> 16:45.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROAD YOU CAN CHARGE MORE FOR

16:45.037 --> 16:47.473 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUCKS VERSUS REGULAR CARS.

16:47.473 --> 16:48.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THIS CASE THEY'RE BEING ASKED

16:48.975 --> 16:50.576 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO ESSENTIALLY CHARGE THE SAME

16:50.576 --> 16:52.078 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RATE FOR EVERY VEHICLE THAT

16:52.078 --> 16:53.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PASSES THROUGH TOLL BOOTH

16:53.646 --> 16:54.881 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ESSENTIALLY WHETHER OR NOT IT IS

16:54.881 --> 16:56.482 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A TRUCK OR A CAR.

16:56.482 --> 16:59.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S THE BASIS OF THE ARGUMENT

16:59.285 --> 17:00.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY'RE RUNNING UP AGAINST

17:00.720 --> 17:02.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE.

17:02.488 --> 17:04.023 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE INDUSTRY IS BASICALLY

17:04.023 --> 17:05.925 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARGUING THAT IT'S INTERFERING

17:05.925 --> 17:09.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THEIR INTENT TO INVEST IN

THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS

17:11.130 --> 17:12.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KIND OF SILLY WHEN YOU THINK

17:12.398 --> 17:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT IT, BECAUSE THEY SPENT

17:13.866 --> 17:14.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE MORE COLOR.

20:19.185 --> 20:20.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
