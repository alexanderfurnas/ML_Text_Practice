04:10.083 --> 04:12.252 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO NOT SUPPORT TRUMP.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ACCORDING TO A "TIME

04:13.386 --> 04:14.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAGAZINE" TALLY, AMONG FEMALE

04:14.888 --> 04:15.989 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS IN OFFICE, AROUND

04:15.989 --> 04:18.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
35% DO NOT SUPPORT HIM.

04:18.625 --> 04:19.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO DISCUSS THE GAP WITHIN THE

04:19.926 --> 04:21.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
G.O.P., I AM JOINED FROM

04:21.528 --> 04:22.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WASHINGTON BY JONATHAN SWAN, A

04:22.929 --> 04:24.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER WITH

04:24.331 --> 04:24.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"THE HILL."

04:24.998 --> 04:27.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS RIFT?

04:27.634 --> 04:28.535 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT'S ABOUT AS SIGNIFICANT AS

04:28.535 --> 04:30.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT CAN-- AS IMAGINABLE.

04:30.637 --> 04:31.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST

04:31.938 --> 04:34.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FEW WEEKS, WHEN DONALD TRUMP AND

04:34.441 --> 04:36.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS COHORT MADE A STRATEGIC

04:36.176 --> 04:38.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECISION TO NO LONGER MIGRATE

04:38.945 --> 04:40.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOWARDS THE CENTER.

04:40.247 --> 04:41.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, THERE WAS SORT OF A

04:41.414 --> 04:43.016 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERIOD THERE WHERE HE WAS AT

04:43.016 --> 04:44.417 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEAST INDICATING THAT HE WAS

04:44.417 --> 04:45.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRYING TO REACH OUT TO SOME OF

04:45.886 --> 04:47.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE UNDECIDED VOTERS.

04:47.320 --> 04:48.889 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW THERE SEEMS TO BE A STRATEGY

04:48.889 --> 04:50.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO REALLY JUST DOUBLE DOWN ON

04:50.624 --> 04:52.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MOST INCENDIARY RHETORIC

04:52.492 --> 04:53.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POSSIBLE.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO YOU ALREADY HAD A WHOLE LOT

04:55.128 --> 04:56.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF REPUBLICANS WHO WERE DEEPLY

04:56.696 --> 04:57.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT SUPPORTING

04:57.898 --> 04:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP BUT WANTED TO SUPPORT HIM,

04:59.833 --> 05:01.101 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HE'S MAKING IT VERY, VERY

05:01.101 --> 05:03.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EASY FOR THEM NOW TO SAY, "NO,

05:03.770 --> 05:04.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE DON'T WANT TO BE A PART OF

05:04.638 --> 05:06.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS," AND WHAT IT'S DOING,

05:06.206 --> 05:08.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY, IS SEVERING THROUGH WHAT

05:08.942 --> 05:10.510 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS A VERY THIN THREAD

05:10.510 --> 05:12.479 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONNECTING THE PAUL RYAN WING OF

05:12.479 --> 05:13.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO THE

05:13.847 --> 05:15.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP WING OF THE

05:15.115 --> 05:16.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICAN PARTY.

05:16.116 --> 05:16.750 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: BUT WHAT

05:16.750 --> 05:17.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENS TO ALL THE PEOPLE THAT

05:17.817 --> 05:19.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPPORT TRUMP THAT NO LONGER

05:19.519 --> 05:21.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEE, PERHAPS, THE G.O.P. AS

05:21.421 --> 05:22.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR HOME?

05:22.422 --> 05:24.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THIS IS A CONVERSATION

05:24.057 --> 05:25.225 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S NOW HAPPENING WITH

05:25.225 --> 05:27.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCREASING INTENSITY ALL AROUND

05:27.194 --> 05:27.928 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WASHINGTON.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, THIS WEEK, I HAD

05:29.229 --> 05:30.630 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE CLOSE

05:30.630 --> 05:31.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO PAUL RYAN.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE

05:33.099 --> 05:34.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO WERE WORKING FOR DONALD

05:34.134 --> 05:34.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND BOTH CAMPS ARE SAYING NOW

05:37.871 --> 05:39.839 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPENLY THAT THERE MAY NEED TO BE

05:39.839 --> 05:40.740 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A THIRD PARTY.

05:40.740 --> 05:43.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THE

05:43.543 --> 05:46.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP UNIVERSE, WHICH IS

05:46.079 --> 05:47.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE VIEW OF DONALD TRUMP AND HIS

05:47.981 --> 05:50.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAMPAIGN C.E.O. STEVE BANON, IS

05:50.217 --> 05:51.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT PAUL RYAN, THE REPUBLICAN

05:51.585 --> 05:53.053 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, IS PART OF

05:53.053 --> 05:55.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A CONSPIRACY WITH FOLKS LIKE

05:55.055 --> 05:57.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GEORGE SOROS AND PAUL SINGER TO

05:57.390 --> 05:58.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRING ABOUT ONE-WORLD

05:58.325 --> 05:59.559 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNMENT, TO DESTROY

05:59.559 --> 06:01.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICA THROUGH OPEN BORDERS?

06:01.561 --> 06:02.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S LITERALLY THEIR

06:02.629 --> 06:03.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORLDVIEW.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEVE BANON HAS SAID TO HIS

06:05.065 --> 06:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COLLEAGUES AT BREITBART THAT

06:06.733 --> 06:08.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN IS THE ENEMY.

06:08.168 --> 06:09.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THAT WITH

06:09.636 --> 06:12.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN AND WITH THE ELITE

06:12.472 --> 06:13.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WING OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

06:13.873 --> 06:15.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT BELIEVES IN ALL OF THESE

06:15.041 --> 06:16.009 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORTHODOXIES THAT THEY'VE

06:16.009 --> 06:17.544 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPPORTED FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS?

06:17.544 --> 06:18.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I DON'T SEE HOW THOSE TWO THINGS

06:18.878 --> 06:20.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOIN UP.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: RYAN'S TASK

06:21.248 --> 06:22.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOESN'T GET ANY EASIER AFTER

06:22.882 --> 06:24.284 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTION DAY.

06:24.284 --> 06:25.118 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT GETS HARDER.

06:25.118 --> 06:26.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE'S GOING TO HAVE A REELECTION

06:26.486 --> 06:27.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR SPEAKER.

06:27.520 --> 06:28.288 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE'S PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE A

06:28.288 --> 06:29.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SLIMMER MAJORITY.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.224 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE HOUSE

06:31.224 --> 06:33.326 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS GOING TO FLIP, BUT THEY MAY

06:33.326 --> 06:34.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOSE SOME SEATS.

06:34.427 --> 06:35.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE QUITE A FEW VULNERABLE

06:35.362 --> 06:36.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEMBERS.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN IS GOING TO FACE A

06:38.064 --> 06:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE HOSTILE CAUCUS.

06:40.033 --> 06:43.270 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE IS GOING TO HAVE A MONTH OF

06:43.270 --> 06:45.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NUCLEAR WARFARE FROM THE PERSON

06:45.639 --> 06:47.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO HAS POSSESSION OF THE

06:47.007 --> 06:48.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIGGEST MEGAPHONE IN THE PARTY.

06:48.508 --> 06:50.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN SAVAGING

06:50.377 --> 06:51.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE'S BEEN SUGGESTING THAT

06:52.112 --> 06:53.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S SOMETHING SINISTER GOING

06:53.246 --> 06:54.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON, THAT PAUL RYAN IS

06:54.681 --> 06:56.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MASTERMINDING SOME KIND OF A

06:56.082 --> 06:57.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLOT TO UNDERMINE HIM.

06:57.550 --> 06:59.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THAT HAS RESONANCE WITH THE

06:59.052 --> 06:59.853 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICAN BASE.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.254 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I CAN TELL YOU, A LOT OF FOLKS

07:01.254 --> 07:02.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLOSE TO PAUL RYAN ARE REALLY

07:02.622 --> 07:04.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORRIED ABOUT THE EFFECT, THE

07:04.357 --> 07:06.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOXIC EFFECT THAT TRUMP'S

07:06.259 --> 07:07.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RHETORIC IS HAVING AMONG THE

07:07.861 --> 07:09.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICAN BASE AND THE WAY THAT

07:09.362 --> 07:10.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY VIEW PAUL RYAN.

07:10.664 --> 07:11.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

07:11.431 --> 07:12.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING TO KEEP AN EYE ON.
