00:07.440 --> 00:13.270
on this edition for Sunday July 28

00:13.270 --> 00:16.270
Secretary of State Kerry says there is
an enormous amount of

00:16.270 --> 00:20.619
evidence that down Malaysian airliner
with 298 people on board

00:20.619 --> 00:25.289
was brought down by a russian-made
missile a sharp escalation of fighting

00:25.289 --> 00:26.089
in Gaza

00:26.089 --> 00:29.779
13 israeli soldiers and dozens of
palestinians are killed

00:29.779 --> 00:34.200
and in our signature segment new
incentive programs they get you to do

00:34.200 --> 00:35.350
what you wanna do

00:35.350 --> 00:38.440
but can't so for instance your pro-gun
control

00:38.440 --> 00:41.449
you succeed within your means the NRA
work

00:41.449 --> 00:46.579
vice versa next on PBS Newshour weekend
from the tisch

00:46.579 --> 00:50.550
WNET studios at Lincoln Center in New
York hari Sreenivasan

00:50.550 --> 00:53.739
good evening thanks for joining us

00:53.739 --> 00:57.120
a pro-russian separatists leader said
today that critical

00:57.120 --> 01:00.800
evidence has been recovered from the
Malaysia Airlines Boeing triple seven

01:00.800 --> 01:04.580
that evidently were shot down Thursday
near the Ukrainian Russian border

01:04.580 --> 01:09.850
298 people died mushrooms cause actual I
can tell you that as a today

01:09.850 --> 01:13.490
we have found some at the technical
details of this plane which we suppose

01:13.490 --> 01:14.190
can be those

01:14.190 --> 01:18.880
so-called black boxes Secretary of State
John Kerry said today the United States

01:18.880 --> 01:21.370
has what he called an enormous amount of

01:21.370 --> 01:25.410
evidence that program Shin separatist
shot down the plane with a russian-made

01:25.410 --> 01:26.820
surface-to-air missile

01:26.820 --> 01:32.050
we have intercepted voices that have
been documented by our people through

01:32.050 --> 01:33.060
intelligence

01:33.060 --> 01:37.850
as being separatists who are talking to
each other about the shootdown

01:37.850 --> 01:41.630
and we know that we have a video now

01:41.630 --> 01:44.910
are a transporter removing

01:44.910 --> 01:48.350
an ass a 11 system back into russia

01:48.350 --> 01:52.370
and it shows a missing nestle urself so

01:52.370 --> 01:56.000
there's enormous amount about missed for
more we're joined now via Skype from

01:56.000 --> 01:57.340
Ukraine by Sabrina

01:57.340 --> 02:01.360
Taveuni southern New York time so the
evidence that secretary Kerry

02:01.360 --> 02:04.730
is pointing to is is the same as what
the Ukrainian intelligence officials

02:04.730 --> 02:05.590
have been talking about

02:05.590 --> 02:09.690
I do it appears to be the same added
we've been hearing from the ukrainians

02:09.690 --> 02:13.750
on their spend a lot of fun I you know

02:13.750 --> 02:17.069
they've been YouTube clips their bench
photographs there

02:17.069 --> 02:21.859
band a number of things that the
Americans near Greenspoint you as

02:21.859 --> 02:25.489
asserted evidence that that this a

02:25.489 --> 02:29.640
who actually shot this thing down. so
they're also lots of people interested

02:29.640 --> 02:33.819
in the black box who has it now the
black box flight recorders where does it

02:33.819 --> 02:34.329
go

02:34.329 --> 02:38.749
so yes there's been a lot of discussion
about the black box I mean

02:38.749 --> 02:41.819
I sleep this scene of the crash

02:41.819 --> 02:46.140
is done at this point kinda incredible
place i mean it's in

02:46.140 --> 02:51.469
very chaotic it has stirred different
group of volunteers and content but

02:51.469 --> 02:55.249
motley local citizens and

02:55.249 --> 02:58.810
essentially they have no babies don't
have enough

02:58.810 --> 03:02.379
I don't manpower or expertise war

03:02.379 --> 03:06.299
I'm iron people to sort it do it

03:06.299 --> 03:09.340
so it's been very slow and quite

03:09.340 --> 03:14.489
incompetence II and the fact that they
haven't found the black boxes were

03:14.489 --> 03:18.049
I suppose now that their service saying
that they have found them it's all very

03:18.049 --> 03:19.159
chaotic at home

03:19.159 --> 03:22.859
your I'm but it isn't particularly
surprising giving the

03:22.859 --> 03:26.200
IBP the absolute Scheibel

03:26.200 --> 03:29.870
recovery effort so the dutch Prime
Minister was

03:29.870 --> 03:33.260
making statements saying that he's
shocked and he's disgusted by how the

03:33.260 --> 03:34.650
bodies have been treated

03:34.650 --> 03:38.389
you went to one of the areas where a lot
of these bodies are stored now in

03:38.389 --> 03:40.040
refrigerator railcars

03:40.040 --> 03:43.349
where are those bodies going to go and
who's going to

03:43.349 --> 03:46.510
look after them you know they're they're
any setup

03:46.510 --> 03:50.609
train cars in mister very greedy

03:50.609 --> 03:54.189
fly blown city called to read
coal-mining town

03:54.189 --> 03:57.819
om what the here government says is that

03:57.819 --> 04:01.999
rebels get actually blocked their exit
said that the rebels aren't letting the

04:01.999 --> 04:03.579
train at their on Wii U

04:03.579 --> 04:08.260
arm and what the rebels say is that they
want to release the bodies to

04:08.260 --> 04:10.150
international representatives

04:10.150 --> 04:14.010
would claim their telling a telling all

04:14.010 --> 04:17.450
journalists to call the international
representatives to dance so they can

04:17.450 --> 04:18.359
find the bodies

04:18.359 --> 04:21.370
on very unclear to what extent

04:21.370 --> 04:25.000
on you know both sides are being
disingenuous and this

04:25.000 --> 04:29.540
what sort of access to the international
observers have today

04:29.540 --> 04:32.590
I V international observers spent quite
a bit of time at the crash site today

04:32.590 --> 04:34.590
they were out taking pictures

04:34.590 --> 04:38.140
I'm you know walking the perimeter kinda
on

04:38.140 --> 04:41.290
they had large security detail other
also

04:41.290 --> 04:45.460
or representatives from here the
Ukrainian government representatives

04:45.460 --> 04:49.820
taking photographs and walking around in
the site of the wreckage

04:49.820 --> 04:53.950
so there is that quite a big passer four
and he will present

04:53.950 --> 04:57.940
at the crash site that didn't appear to
be injured sorry it happened to the new

04:57.940 --> 04:59.780
york times thanks so much

04:59.780 --> 05:04.030
thank you turning now to the conflict in
the Middle East Secretary of State Kerry

05:04.030 --> 05:08.760
today also offered a robust defensive
Israel's military operations

05:08.760 --> 05:13.100
2n rocket fire from Gaza and to destroy
hidden tunnels their

05:13.100 --> 05:18.160
carry called on Hamas to negotiate we
defend Israel's right to do what it is

05:18.160 --> 05:19.970
doing in order to get those tunnels

05:19.970 --> 05:23.650
israel has accepted a unilateral
cease-fire

05:23.650 --> 05:28.490
its accepted the Egyptian plan which we
also support

05:28.490 --> 05:32.290
and it is important for how much the dow
step up

05:32.290 --> 05:36.460
and be reasonable and understand that
you accept a cease-fire

05:36.460 --> 05:40.850
you save lives and that's the way we can
proceed to have a discussion about

05:40.850 --> 05:45.320
all of the underlying issues which
president Obama has clearly indicated a

05:45.320 --> 05:46.630
willingness to do

05:46.630 --> 05:50.350
this as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu voiced regret

05:50.350 --> 05:54.570
about civilian casualties in Gaza but
said the Israeli military

05:54.570 --> 05:58.780
will press on I support you in whatever
action is necessary to

05:58.780 --> 06:02.370
stop this insane situation just imagine

06:02.370 --> 06:06.210
I mean imagine what Israel's going
through

06:06.210 --> 06:10.960
imagine that seventy-five percent of the
US population is under rocket fire

06:10.960 --> 06:15.560
and they have to be um in bomb shelters
within 60 to 90 seconds

06:15.560 --> 06:19.040
so I'm not just talking about new york
new york Washington

06:19.040 --> 06:23.190
Chicago Detroit San Francisco Miami you
name it

06:23.190 --> 06:27.450
I'll thats impossible you can't live
like that for more about all this we're

06:27.450 --> 06:30.520
joined once again tonight by Joe your
door and she is the new york times

06:30.520 --> 06:34.380
bureau chief in jerusalem we just heard
benjamin netanyahu saying

06:34.380 --> 06:37.570
pretty much any means necessary what
else is left

06:37.570 --> 06:41.810
well I mean you know they it can always
ask leading the other day

06:41.810 --> 06:46.070
forces at with the variably day there
with that very intense battle in the

06:46.070 --> 06:46.640
neighborhood

06:46.640 --> 06:49.730
she's I am in nike's Gaza City

06:49.730 --> 06:53.860
on the deadliest day at the complex so
far more than 60 palestinians and now we

06:53.860 --> 06:57.260
have 13 israeli soldiers were killed in
that battle

06:57.260 --> 07:01.440
but a it there could be more and more
urban warfare there

07:01.440 --> 07:05.090
and this is the most serious setback
that Israel's faced in this

07:05.090 --> 07:08.770
most recent conflict thirteen soldiers
at once

07:08.770 --> 07:13.570
it was the entire casualty amount from
the 2008-2009

07:13.570 --> 07:18.070
Operation Cast Lead I'm I think this is
the deadliest day for Israel in quite a

07:18.070 --> 07:19.110
while

07:19.110 --> 07:24.400
so our soldiers being evacuated are
there more soldiers on the borders

07:24.400 --> 07:28.250
I'm there are dozens that soldiers to
have been taken to israeli hospitals and

07:28.250 --> 07:31.110
are being treated including a very
senior commander

07:31.110 --> 07:34.990
about the Golani Brigade that was that
we're all 13 belong to you

07:34.990 --> 07:38.630
I don't know either whether soldiers are
retreat gaynor how they're regrouping

07:38.630 --> 07:40.400
there was a brief

07:40.400 --> 07:45.410
and shortage not fully exercise halted
happily this afternoon

07:45.410 --> 07:49.500
to let some humanitarian help getting to
the show yet neighborhoods and I

07:49.500 --> 07:51.580
ambulances and everything

07:51.580 --> 07:55.780
but I believe the fighting has and here
yesterday we reference to ban Ki moon at

07:55.780 --> 07:59.060
the united nations were supposed to come
to the region now we hear that he's in

07:59.060 --> 08:00.040
Qatar

08:00.040 --> 08:03.560
any update on any cease-fire
negotiations are any conversations that

08:03.560 --> 08:03.960
sort

08:03.960 --> 08:07.210
nothing concrete or significance but

08:07.210 --> 08:10.730
at president at what about that the
Palestinian Authority I believe is also

08:10.730 --> 08:11.850
in cut that today

08:11.850 --> 08:15.490
and maybe meeting today with Howard
mashup political cheap

08:15.490 --> 08:19.250
Hamas which is a significant that step
significant meeting and

08:19.250 --> 08:22.600
could yield something there's increasing
calls from the Americans and the

08:22.600 --> 08:24.050
Israelites to you

08:24.050 --> 08:28.400
not let present II kinda X that's and be
and get it

08:28.400 --> 08:31.610
get a grip I'm got that which is an
interesting turn around

08:31.610 --> 08:35.320
from israel's position when a bath and
how not

08:35.320 --> 08:38.729
find a reconciliation pact April and and

08:38.729 --> 08:41.969
basically is rather than calling on
President about you and I

08:41.969 --> 08:45.829
cancel that act ever sense but now that
maybe he is God thank you

08:45.829 --> 08:49.819
you can sound birthed you help I resolve
this crisis alright jodie word or in a

08:49.819 --> 08:52.980
New York Times joining us via Skype
thanks so much

08:52.980 --> 08:57.069
thank you as you just heard there's been
a sharp escalation of fighting in Gaza

08:57.069 --> 09:01.060
with those 13 israeli soldiers and
approximately a hundred Palestinians

09:01.060 --> 09:03.060
killed in clashes early today

09:03.060 --> 09:07.249
since the conflict began more than 400
Palestinians have been killed

09:07.249 --> 09:10.560
the White House said today secretary
Kerry is heading to Egypt to try to

09:10.560 --> 09:12.029
broker a cease-fire

09:12.029 --> 09:16.240
President Obama called prime minister
netanyahu to express serious concern

09:16.240 --> 09:21.149
about the growing number of casualties
today a top UN relief agency officials

09:21.149 --> 09:23.459
said at least a thousand homes in gaza

09:23.459 --> 09:27.759
have been destroyed or damaged beyond
repair and medical supplies are running

09:27.759 --> 09:28.529
low

09:28.529 --> 09:32.439
he also said there's been a surge in the
number of Palestinians seeking refuge in

09:32.439 --> 09:33.769
UN shelters

09:33.769 --> 09:38.110
we've had massive displacement and we've
had a tripling in the number of

09:38.110 --> 09:41.279
displaced in the schools that we're on
here in gaza over the course of the last

09:41.279 --> 09:42.449
couple of days

09:42.449 --> 09:45.680
I'm just received figures were now it's
seventy thousand

09:45.680 --> 09:49.180
displays moved into 55 or 57 our schools

09:49.180 --> 09:52.310
for more about the situation on the
ground there we're joined on the phone

09:52.310 --> 09:53.560
by Noah browning

09:53.560 --> 09:58.360
avoiders he is in Gaza City know it you
just very short distance away from this

09:58.360 --> 09:59.029
neighborhood

09:59.029 --> 10:02.029
that we've been hearing about all day
call should J year

10:02.029 --> 10:05.370
tell us about what happened there well i
i would say that

10:05.370 --> 10:09.610
this is by far the bloodiest day the
current thirteen-day conflict to change

10:09.610 --> 10:10.249
is really

10:10.249 --> 10:14.089
and Palestinian militants and it's one
of the bloodiest days

10:14.089 --> 10:17.279
in the modern history the
israeli-palestinian conflict

10:17.279 --> 10:21.399
very early hours of this morning in this
border town of peace in Gaza City

10:21.399 --> 10:26.110
called church I heavy israeli shelling
started raining down in the early hours

10:26.110 --> 10:30.439
causing severe damage and approaching
the scene early hours of this morning

10:30.439 --> 10:31.639
there is a really

10:31.639 --> 10:36.430
pitiful sight a thousands of people
pouring out pouring in land westward

10:36.430 --> 10:40.759
for families barefoot children very
worried people

10:40.759 --> 10:44.350
as it puts the general mood in the Gaza
Strip in a very stressed out

10:44.350 --> 10:48.490
anxious state of mind but what about the
hospitals in the area how are they

10:48.490 --> 10:50.170
coping with the injured

10:50.170 --> 10:54.680
hospitals here overwhelmed a broder's
college visiting area said that they

10:54.680 --> 10:55.410
were

10:55.410 --> 10:59.370
just gas three scenes of dead and
wounded coming in

10:59.370 --> 11:02.629
headless children burned women

11:02.629 --> 11:06.360
people had to be treated on the floor of
the hospital for lack of space

11:06.360 --> 11:10.540
and unfortunately the shelling continued
most of the day in this affected area so

11:10.540 --> 11:12.559
that paramedics could not reach the
scene

11:12.559 --> 11:16.029
actually one palestinian paramedic in a
local journalists were killed

11:16.029 --> 11:20.470
in the morning trying to approach the
area what about the border with Egypt we

11:20.470 --> 11:24.279
are hearing the Egypt turned back a
group of doctors who are trying to come

11:24.279 --> 11:25.040
in today

11:25.040 --> 11:29.059
what about the people from Gaza trying
to flee in that direction

11:29.059 --> 11:32.910
it's a very difficult situation for
local people trying to escape this

11:32.910 --> 11:33.689
violent

11:33.689 --> 11:37.959
as you know Gaza is one of the most
densely populated areas in the face of

11:37.959 --> 11:38.540
the earth

11:38.540 --> 11:42.540
faces a blockade are all its borders
northeast

11:42.540 --> 11:45.920
with Israel and the west and the
Mediterranean the South

11:45.920 --> 11:50.189
Egypt's Egypt are not allowed a free
flow of goods and people

11:50.189 --> 11:53.220
through its border crossing with Gaza
since last year

11:53.220 --> 11:58.670
whenever the military takeover from it's
not us who had been sympathetic to Hamas

11:58.670 --> 12:02.800
see you you tend to think that the new
leadership egypt is not terribly

12:02.800 --> 12:06.519
concerned with the humanitarian a
political situation going on Gaza right

12:06.519 --> 12:06.800
now

12:06.800 --> 12:10.319
alright Noah browning avoiders thanks so
much thank you

12:10.319 --> 12:14.129
back in this country those wildfires in
north central washington state which

12:14.129 --> 12:16.509
were ignited by lightning last Monday

12:16.509 --> 12:21.240
are now burning in an area spanning
approximately 250,000 acres

12:21.240 --> 12:25.129
after many days and gusty winds and high
temperatures cooler weather spread

12:25.129 --> 12:27.100
briefly over the area today

12:27.100 --> 12:30.839
that's encouraging news for the more
than 2,000 firefighters battling the

12:30.839 --> 12:32.160
huge blaze

12:32.160 --> 12:35.800
we don't often bring you sports but
worry McElroy who grew up in Northern

12:35.800 --> 12:37.749
Ireland has won the British Open

12:37.749 --> 12:42.040
defeating American Rickie Fowler and
Sergio Garcia of Spain by two strokes

12:42.040 --> 12:45.959
the reason we mention this is because
McElroy wasn't the only winner

12:45.959 --> 12:48.990
ten years ago his father and three
friends

12:48.990 --> 12:52.459
bet against five hundred to one of its
that McElroy

12:52.459 --> 12:56.920
then a teenager would win the open
before he turned 26

12:56.920 --> 13:02.550
today there four hundred-pound back paid
off to the tune of 200,000 pounds or

13:02.550 --> 13:05.589
approximately three hundred and
forty-one thousand dollars

13:05.589 --> 13:10.279
McElroy is 25

13:10.279 --> 13:14.240
and James Garner who rose to fame in the
nineteen fifties hit series maverick and

13:14.240 --> 13:16.869
later starred in the Rockford Files has
died

13:16.869 --> 13:20.170
he was eighty-six years old what

13:20.170 --> 13:23.230
you heard me where the tapes and walk as

13:23.230 --> 13:27.529
some kind of joke right he got some real
snappy Priceline you wanna lay on

13:27.529 --> 13:31.279
caps and I said and the last summer

13:31.279 --> 13:37.730
fine mind I'd like to be able to carry
around a while

13:37.730 --> 13:44.730
you must be rockford

13:47.290 --> 13:50.250
and now to our signature segment our
original in-depth reports from around

13:50.250 --> 13:50.889
the nation

13:50.889 --> 13:54.569
and around the world whether you're
saving for retirement or trying to lose

13:54.569 --> 13:55.019
weight

13:55.019 --> 13:58.699
even if you have the best intentions
it's often difficult to do what you need

13:58.699 --> 13:59.540
to do

13:59.540 --> 14:03.180
but what if you could be not judged into
making better choices

14:03.180 --> 14:07.420
new companies are using behavioral
economics to devise new incentive

14:07.420 --> 14:09.670
programs that help us follow through

14:09.670 --> 14:15.629
is our special correspondent column with
the reports like many Americans

14:15.629 --> 14:19.959
byron Dorgan a freelance editor and
writer in charlottesville virginia

14:19.959 --> 14:23.480
often procrastinate I knew that
professionally

14:23.480 --> 14:26.629
I needed a website and I had been I

14:26.629 --> 14:30.240
have the domain name I you know me
Lissabon any

14:30.240 --> 14:33.550
on it for law but in 2012

14:33.550 --> 14:37.870
she learned about an online program that
would push her to get the project done

14:37.870 --> 14:41.769
or else she would lose fifty dollars
it's an example

14:41.769 --> 14:45.850
love behavioral economics at work
according to Dean Karlan

14:45.850 --> 14:49.519
a Yale University economist about
realizing that

14:49.519 --> 14:53.750
you're going to respond to incentives
and if you don't like the way you're

14:53.750 --> 14:54.880
going to respond

14:54.880 --> 14:58.279
you can change those incentives you can
change the price if things by being a

14:58.279 --> 14:59.740
bit self-aware and thinking ahead

14:59.740 --> 15:03.880
understanding how people respond to
incentives essential to behavioral

15:03.880 --> 15:04.720
economics

15:04.720 --> 15:08.970
field which looks at the psychology
behind economic decisions

15:08.970 --> 15:12.060
this new science is being used to help
people

15:12.060 --> 15:15.569
nudge them on everything from making
better healthcare decisions

15:15.569 --> 15:19.290
to maximizing energy efficiency the
limits big issues is

15:19.290 --> 15:23.980
is an improving people's financial
choices an area in which many Americans

15:23.980 --> 15:24.860
don't excel

15:24.860 --> 15:29.399
the personal savings rate is less than
half of what it was a generation ago

15:29.399 --> 15:33.709
and an estimated $56 million Americans
have virtually no

15:33.709 --> 15:36.870
retirement savings financial education
has

15:36.870 --> 15:40.220
actually had not great results in terms
of getting people to change behavior

15:40.220 --> 15:43.680
Josh Wright is the executive director
ideas 42

15:43.680 --> 15:48.259
a nonprofit that works with companies
foundations and governments to apply

15:48.259 --> 15:50.490
lessons from behavioral economics

15:50.490 --> 15:54.420
key points to a study showed how
committing to save more

15:54.420 --> 15:59.500
not even today but in the future
dramatically increase retirement savings

15:59.500 --> 16:03.720
one of the interesting things about
people's financial lives is the usually

16:03.720 --> 16:07.449
know what they want to do where they
have an intention to save more

16:07.449 --> 16:11.660
span last I'm get greater control over
their finances and a lot of it has to do

16:11.660 --> 16:12.220
with

16:12.220 --> 16:15.589
following through on those desires and
intentions and there's a lot that the

16:15.589 --> 16:18.360
hero science can do along with
technology to help us

16:18.360 --> 16:21.529
help people help themselves really to do
what they want to do

16:21.529 --> 16:25.579
and new businesses have taken some
medicine sites to heart

16:25.579 --> 16:28.579
Washington dc-based hello wallet

16:28.579 --> 16:33.000
provides financial computer software
including budgeting and retirement tools

16:33.000 --> 16:37.009
from place a big companies across the
country so we serve

16:37.009 --> 16:41.279
manufacturers we serve the people who
are putting ketchup and Hines bottles

16:41.279 --> 16:44.480
as well as we serve investment bankers
quite the range between

16:44.480 --> 16:47.550
Steve wendell is a behavioral researcher

16:47.550 --> 16:52.399
and principal scientist at hello wyland
he got his PhD in political science

16:52.399 --> 16:56.759
studying voter behavior and he's written
a book about using behavioral economics

16:56.759 --> 16:59.309
to create products that appeal to
consumers

16:59.309 --> 17:04.189
went to scientists doing at a personal
finance software company

17:04.189 --> 17:07.819
I help identify where the behavior of
calls that people face

17:07.819 --> 17:11.280
come up with ideas on help them overcome
those obstacles

17:11.280 --> 17:14.289
and then a test test and see

17:14.289 --> 17:17.549
does this actually help people does this
actually

17:17.549 --> 17:20.929
put more money in the bank account
overtime so

17:20.929 --> 17:24.079
bottom line are we helping people one
test wendell devised

17:24.079 --> 17:27.530
look at the effect have competition on
financial behavior

17:27.530 --> 17:30.919
by creating peer comparisons we said
okay

17:30.919 --> 17:34.059
will have one version where on you get
is

17:34.059 --> 17:37.289
your current score one version where you
get nothing

17:37.289 --> 17:41.100
and another version we get this pure
comparison to you see not only your

17:41.100 --> 17:41.669
score

17:41.669 --> 17:46.230
but you see how other people like you
are doing it turns out that people who

17:46.230 --> 17:48.149
were shown to peer comparison

17:48.149 --> 17:51.659
saved hundreds more in a one-month test
so

17:51.659 --> 17:55.200
just knowing that score or what share
neighbor scoring

17:55.200 --> 17:58.809
help everyone no now now the really
there is no

17:58.809 --> 18:03.190
silver bullet in the behavior what thing
we always remember is that people are

18:03.190 --> 18:04.299
different

18:04.299 --> 18:08.020
our experiences are different and so our
goal with hella while

18:08.020 --> 18:11.100
is to adapt to the individual meet them
where they are

18:11.100 --> 18:14.610
but it's not all about providing
positive incentives are carrots

18:14.610 --> 18:18.669
when it comes to helping people make
better decisions sticks to calm

18:18.669 --> 18:23.620
is an Internet company co founded by
economist Dean Karlan in 2007

18:23.620 --> 18:27.909
it provides stick or negative incentive
to influence behavior

18:27.909 --> 18:31.790
it's one of a handful of companies
including be minor and healthy wage

18:31.790 --> 18:36.260
to provide an online platform turning
goals into what are known as commitment

18:36.260 --> 18:37.549
contracts

18:37.549 --> 18:41.030
with steak users put money on the line
for any goal

18:41.030 --> 18:44.130
from trying to lose weight to saving
more money each week

18:44.130 --> 18:47.500
and can designate a referee to oversee
their progress

18:47.500 --> 18:51.370
basically with the research showed is
that a money talks

18:51.370 --> 18:54.610
and when you've got your money on the
line a man you put your money where your

18:54.610 --> 18:56.760
mouth is too much more likely to achieve
your goal

18:56.760 --> 19:00.700
Jordan Goldberg cofounded stick with
Carlin and another professor

19:00.700 --> 19:05.389
when he was an MBA student at Yale he
says the financial stake makes long-term

19:05.389 --> 19:06.159
goals

19:06.159 --> 19:10.290
easier to reach tour literally raising
the price

19:10.290 --> 19:13.290
up your vice your poor behavior raised
the price a failure

19:13.290 --> 19:16.820
so you make the right decision today if
you fail to meet your goal

19:16.820 --> 19:20.570
you lose the money it goes to someone
you've designated

19:20.570 --> 19:24.440
an anonymous charity or you can choose
an anti charity

19:24.440 --> 19:27.600
a cost that you don't believe in so for
instance

19:27.600 --> 19:31.320
your pro-gun control you'll succeed we
can you make the NRA

19:31.320 --> 19:36.169
work vice versa far been ordained chosen
anti charity when she you stick

19:36.169 --> 19:39.669
to motivate her to build her own website
her choice

19:39.669 --> 19:44.340
a political pack she doesn't support
state harm his help me

19:44.340 --> 19:47.600
just over and over just thinking I

19:47.600 --> 19:52.290
do not want so-and-so to get my fifty
dollars

19:52.290 --> 19:56.470
Norton has become an avid stick user
creating goals for everything from

19:56.470 --> 19:58.070
keeping up with chores

19:58.070 --> 20:01.830
to writing my each day likened to do
that on your on with stopping you from

20:01.830 --> 20:03.139
doing that and had a

20:03.139 --> 20:06.320
stick you name it was always so easy to

20:06.320 --> 20:09.330
Ciara's put it off a little longer
whatever the

20:09.330 --> 20:12.480
excuse why cystic com races

20:12.480 --> 20:15.639
that kind of accountability to a for
more

20:15.639 --> 20:19.950
money on the line kinda level for you
don't have to put money on the line

20:19.950 --> 20:24.440
but my feeling is like what's the point
if there's not a real

20:24.440 --> 20:27.860
their sicko founder Dean Karlan

20:27.860 --> 20:31.340
and a fellow economist know just what
she's talking about

20:31.340 --> 20:34.870
they once agreed to each pay the other
half a year salary

20:34.870 --> 20:38.250
if they regained weight they had
previously lost so

20:38.250 --> 20:41.360
happening cometh like thousands of
dollars

20:41.360 --> 20:45.200
yeah we wanted to make it so that it was
painful and had to be otherwise

20:45.200 --> 20:48.470
the other ways if you fail there's a
risk that you feel when you just gonna

20:48.470 --> 20:49.429
strike it up to

20:49.429 --> 20:52.429
kinda the cost to an expensive dinner

20:52.429 --> 20:55.669
and nor even a vacation but it had to be
enough by the we

20:55.669 --> 21:00.250
knew that we would do it um and there
would be painful but it couldn't be so

21:00.250 --> 21:02.820
much money that we couldn't physically
write the check

21:02.820 --> 21:06.669
his friend did eventually regain the
weight and paid carlin

21:06.669 --> 21:10.460
fifteen thousand dollars and it
surprised a lot of people but he

21:10.460 --> 21:15.330
you know II made him pay and he paid so
that kinda think he should the waist etc

21:15.330 --> 21:19.559
works mean it has to be painful enough
for each individual

21:19.559 --> 21:23.880
person that that is exactly the idea the
key the key to stick really is one being

21:23.880 --> 21:24.580
self-aware

21:24.580 --> 21:28.370
what is the right amount that is enough
that you'll be

21:28.370 --> 21:32.919
honest with yourself if you fail and be
able to pay it if you failed but enough

21:32.919 --> 21:35.070
so that it'll actually motivate you to
change

21:35.070 --> 21:39.490
well carlin is no longer involved with
stick he still regularly incorporates

21:39.490 --> 21:41.429
insights from behavioral economics

21:41.429 --> 21:45.240
into his everyday life when we order
dessert I just want one by

21:45.240 --> 21:49.049
you with the rest but I want one but no
more Bilaspur second by

21:49.049 --> 21:53.059
a hundred dollars devising ways to
motivate change

21:53.059 --> 21:59.830
whether to drop more pounds or to save
more money

21:59.830 --> 22:03.409
to learn more about what some financial
companies are doing to help you save

22:03.409 --> 22:03.870
money

22:03.870 --> 22:10.019
visit newshour not pvs data work

22:10.019 --> 22:13.059
this is PBS Newshour weekend sunday

22:13.059 --> 22:19.380
in yesterday I spoke with Melanie
Eversley have USA today about the

22:19.380 --> 22:23.049
decriminalization of marijuana in
Washington DC this past week

22:23.049 --> 22:26.940
here's an excerpt of the conversation
what's the new rules specifically in DC

22:26.940 --> 22:30.110
it basically T criminalizes possession

22:30.110 --> 22:33.399
up to an out of of marijuana if you are
caught

22:33.399 --> 22:38.260
with that on your person on instead
being subject to criminal penalties

22:38.260 --> 22:41.590
what you would get is a twenty five
dollar ticket it also changes a couple

22:41.590 --> 22:42.440
of other things

22:42.440 --> 22:45.580
if police now marijuana while they're on
their be

22:45.580 --> 22:49.580
they can no longer search a person for
it if they

22:49.580 --> 22:52.710
on also find up to an ounce of marijuana

22:52.710 --> 22:56.519
on a person and they can no longer
automatically search them

22:56.519 --> 23:00.429
but federal and in DC is exempt from
that's right that's rarely affects

23:00.429 --> 23:05.090
nonfederal and is this a sign of kinda a
changing attitude across the nation

23:05.090 --> 23:07.440
about this issue this is obviously the
nation's capital yeah

23:07.440 --> 23:11.059
what i've seen is that and people
overwhelmingly

23:11.059 --> 23:14.870
on social media at least are responding
in a way that suggests that

23:14.870 --> 23:19.909
on they feel that maybe it is time to
considered decriminalization in a lot of

23:19.909 --> 23:20.559
places

23:20.559 --> 23:24.490
so I just across the river in brooklyn
the DA he resorted to your dick realize

23:24.490 --> 23:25.130
that as well

23:25.130 --> 23:29.330
yeah problem DA pointed out that the
people who tend to be

23:29.330 --> 23:33.090
affected by I'm low-level drug offenses
are young

23:33.090 --> 23:38.490
minority men and he declared that he was
no longer going to prosecute such cases

23:38.490 --> 23:42.360
because he felt when people are
convicted of these crimes

23:42.360 --> 23:45.820
it affects the rest of their lives in
terms of finding housing

23:45.820 --> 23:50.240
in terms of getting scholarships besides
what you hear on social media there are

23:50.240 --> 23:52.870
other people there are other legislators
in different states around the country

23:52.870 --> 23:54.139
they're pushing back that

23:54.139 --> 23:58.539
don't agree with this right I would say
that the strongest argument

23:58.539 --> 24:02.149
against is that and their studies that
have shown

24:02.149 --> 24:07.490
that when one uses marijuana it produces
changes in the brain that makes one

24:07.490 --> 24:14.490
want to seek out stronger trucks the
rent

24:16.480 --> 24:20.380
some late news before we leave you
tonight hamas claims to have captured an

24:20.380 --> 24:23.179
Israeli soldier during fighting in Gaza

says he made a mistake when he posted a

24:26.990 --> 24:29.779
tweet with the hashtag United for Gaza

24:29.779 --> 24:33.850
he later deleted it it's been another
