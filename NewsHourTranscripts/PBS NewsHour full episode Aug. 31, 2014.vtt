02:25.178 --> 02:29.049
THE PRESIDENT'S SPOKESMAN.

SAID UKRAINE SHOULD BEGIN TALKS

02:33.220 --> 02:35.489
ON THE POTENTIAL STATE HOOD OF

07:35.355 --> 07:37.123
FORCE.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.159
LED BY OPPOSITION POLITICIAN

07:39.159 --> 07:40.694
IMRAN KHAN AND CLERIC TAHIR-UL-

07:40.694 --> 07:42.462
QADRI, THE PROTESTS BEGAN ON,

07:42.462 --> 07:44.264
AUGUST 14-- PAKISTAN'S

07:44.264 --> 07:46.066
INDEPENDENCE DAY-- AND HAVE

07:46.066 --> 07:49.769
GAINED THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS.

07:49.769 --> 07:50.704
SHARIF, WHO WON OFFICE LAST YEAR

07:50.704 --> 07:51.738
IN PAKISTAN'S FIRST DEMOCRATIC

07:51.738 --> 07:52.839
HAND OVER OF POWER AND IS

07:52.839 --> 07:53.606
BACKED BY PARLIAMENT, HAS

07:53.606 --> 07:54.808
REFUSED TO STEP DOWN.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.476
THE SHOWBOAT CASINO IN ATLANTIC

07:56.476 --> 07:58.712
CITY CLOSES ITS DOORS TODAY, THE

07:58.712 --> 07:59.979
FIRST OF THREE SCHEDULED TO DO

07:59.979 --> 08:01.581
SO IN THE COMING WEEKS.

08:01.581 --> 08:03.183
WHEN THE REVEL AND THE TRUMP

08:03.183 --> 08:05.151
PLAZA ALSO SHUT DOWN THE

08:05.151 --> 08:06.152
CLOSINGS ARE PROJECTED TO COST

08:06.152 --> 08:07.754
THE REGION 8,000 JOBS.

08:07.754 --> 08:08.888
THE SHOWBOAT, WHILE STILL

08:08.888 --> 08:10.323
PROFITABLE, HAS BEEN FACING

08:10.323 --> 08:11.758
DECREASING REVENUE AND MORE

08:11.758 --> 08:14.294
COMPETITION.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.162
AS MANY AS 250 HOMES ARE BEING

08:16.162 --> 08:17.197
EVACUATED IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

08:17.197 --> 08:18.732
AS TWO WILDFIRES, SPARKED BY

08:18.732 --> 08:20.500
LIGHTNING THREE WEEKS AGO,

08:20.500 --> 08:21.868
CONTINUE TO GROW.

08:21.868 --> 08:23.169
THE FIRES, STOKED BY WEATHER

08:23.169 --> 08:25.105
CONDITIONS, MERGED ON SATURDAY

08:25.105 --> 08:26.373
MORNING AND BURNED MORE THAN 90

08:26.373 --> 08:27.540
SQUARE MILES.

08:27.540 --> 08:30.176
THE HOMES ARE NEAR THE RURAL

08:30.176 --> 08:31.144
TOWN OF HAPPY CAMP NEAR KLAMATH

08:31.144 --> 08:32.545
NATIONAL FOREST.

08:32.545 --> 08:33.580
AND JUST SOUTHWEST OF NAPA

08:33.580 --> 08:35.849
CALIFORNIA, A 3.2 AFTERSHOCK

08:35.849 --> 08:37.083
HAVE RATTLED THE VALLEY EARLY

08:37.083 --> 08:37.851
THIS MORNING.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.153
THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF DAMAGE.

08:40.153 --> 08:42.222
THIS AFTER LAST WEEK'S 6.0

08:42.222 --> 08:43.590
MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKE, WHICH WAS

08:43.590 --> 08:44.691
THE LARGEST IN THE REGION IN 25

08:44.691 --> 08:45.792
YEARS.

08:45.792 --> 08:46.593
THAT QUAKE INJURED MORE THAN 200

08:46.593 --> 08:49.262
PEOPLE.

08:49.262 --> 08:50.630
ICELAND'S BARDARBUNGA VOLCANO IS

08:50.630 --> 08:51.865
ACTING UP AFTER YESTERDAY'S 5.4

08:51.865 --> 08:53.700
MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKE STRUCK THAT

08:53.700 --> 08:55.835
REGION.

08:55.835 --> 08:58.705
LAVA LINES FLOWED ALONG THE

08:58.705 --> 08:59.906
VOLCANIC FISSURE TODAY,

08:59.906 --> 09:01.241
PROMPTING A HIGH ALERT LEVEL

09:01.241 --> 09:02.509
WHICH WAS LATER LOWERED.

09:02.509 --> 09:03.610
DESPITE THE VOLCANO'S ACTIVITY,

09:03.610 --> 09:04.477
THERE WAS NO ASH CLOUD AND

09:04.477 --> 09:06.146
AIRPORTS REMAIN OPEN.

09:06.146 --> 09:18.458
THE SPREAD OF THE MOST RECENT

09:18.458 --> 09:19.759
THE SPREAD OF THE MOST RECENT

09:19.759 --> 09:21.261
STRAIN OF THE EBOLA VIRUS ACROSS

09:21.261 --> 09:23.029
PARTS OF WEST AFRICA HAS

09:23.029 --> 09:25.098
HIGHLIGHTED NOT JUST THE

09:25.098 --> 09:26.766
LETHALITY OF THE DISEASE BUT

09:26.766 --> 09:27.967
ALSO THE STRAINS ON THE EXISTING

09:27.967 --> 09:30.103
MEDICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THERE.

09:30.103 --> 09:31.771
FOR FURTHER INSIGHT, YESTERDAY I

09:31.771 --> 09:32.972
SPOKE WITH STEPHEN MORSE,

09:32.972 --> 09:34.240
PROFESSOR OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AT THE

09:34.240 --> 09:35.875
MAILMAN SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH

09:35.875 --> 09:37.377
AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY AND

09:37.377 --> 09:38.912
ESTRELLA LASRY, TROPICAL

09:38.912 --> 09:39.946
MEDICINE ADVISOR AT DOCTORS

09:39.946 --> 09:42.015
WITHOUT BORDERS.

09:42.015 --> 09:44.150
>> FIRST, WHY IS THIS STRAIN SO

09:44.150 --> 09:45.885
MUCH MORE LETHAL COMPARED TO

09:45.885 --> 09:47.187
OTHERS?

09:47.187 --> 09:48.755
WE'RE TALKING 3,000 PEOPLE

09:48.755 --> 09:50.056
INFECTED, 1,500 DEAD.

09:50.056 --> 09:53.193
>> I DON'T THINK IT IS MORE

09:53.193 --> 09:55.395
LETHAL FROM OTHER STRAINS OF

09:55.395 --> 09:56.596
EBOLA ZAIRE.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.198
I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THERE ARE

09:58.198 --> 10:01.501
A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE GETTING

10:01.501 --> 10:03.036
INFECTED AND PEOPLE ARE NOT

10:03.036 --> 10:04.304
GETTING CARE AT THE APPROPRIATE

10:04.304 --> 10:05.004
TIMES.

10:05.004 --> 10:08.808
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE

10:08.808 --> 10:10.310
BIOLOGICALLY, IT IS BEHAVING

10:10.310 --> 10:11.311
FASTER THAN THE ONES WE KNOW

10:11.311 --> 10:12.712
ABOUT.

10:12.712 --> 10:14.314
>> IS THERE A SOCIAL COMPONENT

10:14.314 --> 10:15.315
OF SPREADING FASTER?

10:15.315 --> 10:18.451
>> I THINK INITIAL PLAY, THE

10:18.451 --> 10:20.787
OUT-- INITIALLY, THE OUTBREAK IN

10:20.787 --> 10:23.022
GUINEA, THERE WERE SO MANY

10:23.022 --> 10:24.257
PATIENTS IT BEGAN TO SPREAD

10:24.257 --> 10:25.892
ACROSS THE BORDERS.

10:25.892 --> 10:30.663
SO OVER TIME, THE ORGANIZATION

10:30.663 --> 10:31.865
DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS WERE

10:31.865 --> 10:33.366
ABLE TO START ON IT IN THE

10:33.366 --> 10:34.968
SPRING THERE WERE SO MANY CASES

10:34.968 --> 10:37.303
IT WAS AN UPHILL BATTLE.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.572
>> WHY HASN'T THE INTERNATIONAL

10:39.572 --> 10:42.108
KIND OF EFFORT TO TRY TO COMBAT

10:42.108 --> 10:44.143
THIS BEEN SO MUCH SLOWER THAN

10:44.143 --> 10:45.845
WHAT WE'VE HEARD IN THE PAST?

10:45.845 --> 10:47.113
YOUR ORGANIZATION IS ONE OF THE

10:47.113 --> 10:48.281
LAST ONES THERE, YOU HAVE A

10:48.281 --> 10:49.349
NUMBER OF PEOPLE THERE BUT YOU

10:49.349 --> 10:51.518
DON'T SEE THE SAME KIND OF PUSH

10:51.518 --> 10:53.486
FROM LOT OF INTERNATIONAL

10:53.486 --> 10:54.420
ORGANIZATIONS GOING IN.

10:54.420 --> 10:56.556
>> USUALLY THE OUTBREAKS ARE NOT

10:56.556 --> 10:57.724
AS BIG AS THIS ONE.

10:57.724 --> 11:01.194
WE START ED TO MONITOR IT AND

11:01.194 --> 11:02.695
FINISH IN TWO, THREE MONTHS

11:02.695 --> 11:05.365
WHICH IS WHAT WE USUALLY SEE IN

11:05.365 --> 11:07.800
AN EBOLA OUTBREAK, WHAT WE HAVE

11:07.800 --> 11:09.435
RESPONDED TO IN THE PAST, PART

11:09.435 --> 11:10.870
OF THE PROBLEM WITH THIS

11:10.870 --> 11:12.472
OUTBREAK IS IT SPREAD VERY

11:12.472 --> 11:14.407
QUICKLY IN AN URBAN AREA.

11:14.407 --> 11:15.575
WHICH MEANT THAT IT WAS MUCH

11:15.575 --> 11:17.076
MORE DIFFICULT TO CONTROL IN

11:17.076 --> 11:18.511
TERMS OF THE CONTACT TRACING,

11:18.511 --> 11:19.479
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO CONTROL

11:19.479 --> 11:21.581
IN TERMS OF HOW QUICKLY IT

11:21.581 --> 11:23.016
SPREAD.

11:23.016 --> 11:26.920
SO IT'S LASTED MUCH MORE THAN

11:26.920 --> 11:28.388
THE PREVIOUS OUTBREAKS AND IT'S

11:28.388 --> 11:29.989
AFFECTED A LOT MORE PEOPLE AND

11:29.989 --> 11:31.958
THAT'S WHY THE ABSOLUTE NEED FOR

11:31.958 --> 11:33.393
MORE ORGANIZATIONS TO GET

11:33.393 --> 11:34.460
INVOLVED IN THE RESPONSE.

11:34.460 --> 11:35.929
>> THIS IS ALSO HIGHLIGHTING

11:35.929 --> 11:38.831
KIND OF A DISPARITY IN POOR

11:38.831 --> 11:39.832
EXISTING MEDICAL INFRASTRUCTURE.

11:39.832 --> 11:41.634
I MEAN SOME OF THESE COUNTRIES

11:41.634 --> 11:43.670
ENTIRE COUNTRIES HAVE LESS

11:43.670 --> 11:45.004
DOCTORS THAN LET'S SAY A SINGLE

11:45.004 --> 11:47.473
LOSS IN A MAJOR WESTERN CITY AND

11:47.473 --> 11:49.342
THERE'S ALSO A DISPARITY BETWEEN

11:49.342 --> 11:51.711
COUNTRIES WHO HAVE DEALT WITH

11:51.711 --> 11:52.979
THIS VIRUS BEFORE VERSUS THOSE

11:52.979 --> 11:54.013
WHO HAVE NOT.

11:54.013 --> 11:55.782
>> YES ABSOLUTELY.

11:55.782 --> 11:57.383
AND THESE COUNTRIES ARE

11:57.383 --> 11:58.351
PARTICULARLY STRESSED BECAUSE

11:58.351 --> 12:00.887
THEY HAVE CIVIL STRIFE, THEY

12:00.887 --> 12:01.521
HAVE TROUBLE BETWEEN THE

12:01.521 --> 12:03.556
GOVERNMENT AND THE LOCAL PEOPLE,

12:03.556 --> 12:05.725
THERE'S SOME DISTRUST MUCH

12:05.725 --> 12:06.993
GOVERNMENT.

12:06.993 --> 12:10.096
THAT IS OVERLAID OVER AN ALREADY

12:10.096 --> 12:11.731
DIFFICULT AND STRAINED MEDICAL

12:11.731 --> 12:12.899
INFRASTRUCTURE.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.968
BUT EVEN NIGERIA WHICH IS A VERY

12:14.968 --> 12:16.769
BIG COUNTRY BY COMPARISON HAS

12:16.769 --> 12:17.870
ONLY 17,000 DOCTORS.

12:17.870 --> 12:21.074
>> YOU KNOW HOW SIGNIFICANT IS

12:21.074 --> 12:23.776
THE FEAR FACTOR, THE

12:23.776 --> 12:24.978
MIS-INFORMATION IN SPREADING THE

12:24.978 --> 12:27.113
DECEASE OR CHASING AWAY

12:27.113 --> 12:27.380
CAREGIVERS?

12:27.380 --> 12:28.381
>> IT'S HUGE.

12:28.381 --> 12:30.149
IT'S A BIG PART OF WHY THE

12:30.149 --> 12:31.017
OUTBREAK HAS BEEN SPREADING SO

12:31.017 --> 12:32.051
MUCH.

12:32.051 --> 12:33.286
SO THE FEAR IS CAUSING PEOPLE

12:33.286 --> 12:35.488
NOT TO GO TO HEALTH FACILITIES,

12:35.488 --> 12:37.557
TO HIDE THE DISEASE, TO HIDE

12:37.557 --> 12:40.393
PEOPLE WHO ARE DEAD IN THE

12:40.393 --> 12:42.962
VILLAGES WHO ARE NOT BEING

12:42.962 --> 12:44.664
ACCESS, WHO ARE NOT BEING

12:44.664 --> 12:45.765
GRANTED ACCESS TO SOME OF THE

12:45.765 --> 12:46.733
VILLAGES WHERE YOU THINK THERE

12:46.733 --> 12:48.768
MIGHT BE CASES SO DEFINITELY IT

12:48.768 --> 12:51.404
IS PLAYING A PIVOTAL ROLE WHY

12:51.404 --> 12:52.839
THE DISEASE IS SPREADING AND

12:52.839 --> 12:53.940
THIS IS SPREADING.

12:53.940 --> 12:57.410
>> WHY THE DISTRUST.

12:57.410 --> 13:00.480
WHY NOT LET THE DOCTOR COME IN

13:00.480 --> 13:01.714
THAT YOU HEAR?

13:01.714 --> 13:03.616
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE DIED, A

13:03.616 --> 13:05.718
LOT OF PEOPLE IN ISOLATION WARDS

13:05.718 --> 13:07.987
AND THEY ARE DRESSED IN THE FULL

13:07.987 --> 13:13.493
PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT,

13:13.493 --> 13:15.561
THE ASTRONAUT SUITS YOU HAVE

13:15.561 --> 13:18.131
SEEN ON TV AND IT ADDS TO THE

13:18.131 --> 13:19.132
FEAR BRINGING PEOPLE INTO THESE

13:19.132 --> 13:19.932
WARDS.

13:19.932 --> 13:21.534
ONE OF THE THINGS WE TRIED TO DO

13:21.534 --> 13:23.269
IS BRING -- MAKE SURE THAT THE

13:23.269 --> 13:25.004
FAMILY MEMBERS DO HAVE ACCESS TO

13:25.004 --> 13:26.506
SEE THEIR RELATIVES WHO ARE

13:26.506 --> 13:30.009
INSIDE THE WARD, CREATING SOME

13:30.009 --> 13:32.712
KIND OF BEING BASIS WHERE

13:32.712 --> 13:36.949
THERE'S A PHYSICAL BARRIER

13:36.949 --> 13:38.985
BETWEEN THE PATIENT AND THEIR

13:38.985 --> 13:40.286
FAMILY, TO ALLOW THEM TO SEE

13:40.286 --> 13:41.988
THEY ARE INSIDE THE WARD THEY

13:41.988 --> 13:43.990
ARE BEING TAKEN CARE OF AND

13:43.990 --> 13:44.857
WE'RE NOT HIDING THEM.

13:44.857 --> 13:48.161
>> I EVEN SAW REPORTS OF KIND OF

13:48.161 --> 13:50.129
REVERSE CAUSALITY.

13:50.129 --> 13:51.197
EVERYWHERE THESE DOCTORS GO MORE

13:51.197 --> 13:53.266
PEOPLE ARE DYING SO LET'S KEEP

13:53.266 --> 13:54.600
THE DOCTORS OUT.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.569
>> IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE THAT

13:56.569 --> 13:58.504
KIND OF FEAR WOULD BE CREATED.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.306
THE POPULATION TOSS NOT KNOW THE

14:00.306 --> 14:01.874
DISEASE AND NOT USED TO THIS

14:01.874 --> 14:03.076
KIND OF RESPONSE FOR A DISEASE

14:03.076 --> 14:03.609
LIKE THAT.

14:03.609 --> 14:05.645
>> IN ADDITION TO PERHAPS SOME

14:05.645 --> 14:07.313
MISTRUST OF AUTHORITY AND PEOPLE

14:07.313 --> 14:08.881
COMING FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO

14:08.881 --> 14:13.186
HELP, SINCE IT HAS SUCH A HIGH

14:13.186 --> 14:15.254
MORTALIT RATE IS FAIRLY HIGH

14:15.254 --> 14:18.558
MANY PEOPLE FEEL THERE IS NO

14:18.558 --> 14:21.394
USE GOING INTO THE HOSPITAL

14:21.394 --> 14:23.596
ANYWAY, IN SOME HOSPITALS OTHER

14:23.596 --> 14:25.298
PATIENTS COULD GET INFECTED SO

14:25.298 --> 14:27.233
THERE'S AN HISTORIC BASIS FOR

14:27.233 --> 14:29.335
THAT.

14:29.335 --> 14:32.739
WE CAN DO BETTER FOR THAT,

14:32.739 --> 14:34.941
DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS HAVE

14:34.941 --> 14:35.641
DEMONSTRATED THE IMPROVEMENTS

14:35.641 --> 14:37.143
THAT ARE POSSIBLE EVEN WITH

14:37.143 --> 14:39.545
GENERAL CARE BUT I THINK IT

14:39.545 --> 14:40.713
NEEDS EDUCATING THE PUBLIC ABOUT

14:40.713 --> 14:41.781
THAT.

14:41.781 --> 14:43.316
>> BY THE TIME THEY GET TO THE

14:43.316 --> 14:44.951
HOSPITALS SOMETIMES THEY HAVE

14:44.951 --> 14:46.052
ALREADY INFECTED DOZENS OF

14:46.052 --> 14:46.886
OTHERS.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.788
>> YES.

14:48.788 --> 14:54.694
AND THE CONTACT WITH THE KNOWN

14:54.694 --> 14:57.964
CASE, THE SOONER THAT PERSON IS

14:57.964 --> 14:59.031
IDENTIFIED THE SOONER THEY CAN

14:59.031 --> 15:00.366
BE MONITORED.

15:00.366 --> 15:02.001
SO WHAT IS HAPPENING FOR EVERY

15:02.001 --> 15:05.304
CASE, FOR EVERY CONFIRMED

15:05.304 --> 15:07.740
PATIENT, ALL OF THE PHYSICAL

15:07.740 --> 15:09.642
CONTACTS THEY'VE HAD IN THE LAST

15:09.642 --> 15:11.744
21 DAYS ARE MONITORED ON A DAILY

15:11.744 --> 15:12.345
BASIS.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.814
YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW HUGE THAT

15:14.814 --> 15:16.349
RESPONSE NEEDS TO BE ESPECIALLY

15:16.349 --> 15:17.817
WITH THE AMOUNT OF CASES WE'RE

15:17.817 --> 15:20.753
SEEING BUT NOT EVERYBODY IS

15:20.753 --> 15:22.021
STAYING INTO THE CONTACTS

15:22.021 --> 15:24.557
THEY'VE HAD OR NOT EVERYONE IS

15:24.557 --> 15:27.827
WILLING TO BE FOLLOWED FOR A

15:27.827 --> 15:29.061
DAILY BASIS FOR 21 DAYS.

15:29.061 --> 15:31.097
>> LOOKING AROUND THE CORNER A

15:31.097 --> 15:34.000
BIT, WE'VE HAD SOME PROMISING

15:34.000 --> 15:37.336
RESULTS WITH ZMAPP AND THE

15:37.336 --> 15:38.905
TESTS, HOW CLOSE ARE WE TO A

15:38.905 --> 15:39.806
VACCINE THAT COULD BE

15:39.806 --> 15:41.207
MANUFACTURED AT SCALE AND COULD

15:41.207 --> 15:42.008
ACTUALLY REACH THIS REGION.

15:42.008 --> 15:44.377
>> SCALE IS GOING TO BE A

15:44.377 --> 15:45.812
DIFFICULT PROBLEM EVEN WITH

15:45.812 --> 15:46.712
ZMAPP.

15:46.712 --> 15:48.347
THEY ARE WORKING HARD TO TRY TO

15:48.347 --> 15:50.883
SCALE IT UP JUST TO EXPERIMENTAL

15:50.883 --> 15:51.851
DOSES AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE A

15:51.851 --> 15:52.752
WHILE.

15:52.752 --> 15:54.654
SOME OF THE OTHER DRUGS IN THE

15:54.654 --> 15:56.022
PIPELINE WILL TAKE LONGER

15:56.022 --> 15:57.690
BECAUSE THEY NEED TO BE TESTED.

15:57.690 --> 16:00.126
AS YOU KNOW, THERE IS A VACCINE

16:00.126 --> 16:01.494
CANDIDATE GOING INTO EARLY

16:01.494 --> 16:03.663
TRIALS RIGHT NOW FOR SAFETY

16:03.663 --> 16:04.564
TESTING ESSENTIALLY BUT THEN THE

16:04.564 --> 16:05.898
QUESTION IS YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE

16:05.898 --> 16:07.366
MARKET FOR THAT VACCINE?

16:07.366 --> 16:09.802
I THINK YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WHO ARE

16:09.802 --> 16:12.371
GOING AS HEALTH CARE WORKERS, OR

16:12.371 --> 16:13.873
LAB TECHNICIANS OR OTHERS WHO

16:13.873 --> 16:16.943
WOULD BE DEALING DIRECTLY WITH

16:16.943 --> 16:18.611
PATIENTS, WOULD BE CLEARLY ABLE

16:18.611 --> 16:20.746
AND WILLING TO GET THE VACCINE.

16:20.746 --> 16:22.615
BUT THIS IS SPORADIC.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.650
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE NEXT

16:24.650 --> 16:26.352
EBOLA OUTBREAK IS GOING TO OCCUR

16:26.352 --> 16:28.087
SO YOU'RE NEVER QUITE SURE WHO

16:28.087 --> 16:29.255
TO VACCINATE UNTIL IT ACTUALLY

16:29.255 --> 16:30.289
HAPPENS.

16:30.289 --> 16:32.258
>> GIVEN THAT THERE ARE SO FEW

16:32.258 --> 16:33.492
DOCTORS AND SO MANY CASES WHAT

16:33.492 --> 16:37.897
DO YOU DO TO KEEP YOUR OWN STAFF

16:37.897 --> 16:39.765
SAFE?

16:39.765 --> 16:42.168
THEY ARE WORKING UNDER

16:42.168 --> 16:43.669
INCREDIBLE STRESS AND BAD

16:43.669 --> 16:44.904
CONDITIONS.

16:44.904 --> 16:46.639
18 HOURS A DAY, ET CETERA,

16:46.639 --> 16:47.840
ET CETERA, AND THESE MISTAKES

16:47.840 --> 16:49.275
COULD COST THEM THEIR LIVES.

16:49.275 --> 16:51.844
>> THE FIRST THING IS TO TRAIN

16:51.844 --> 16:53.813
PEOPLE BEFORE THEY GO INTO AN

16:53.813 --> 16:55.047
OUTBREAK AND THEN ONCE THEY ARE

16:55.047 --> 16:57.183
IN THE OUTBREAK WE MACK SURE

16:57.183 --> 16:59.385
THEY REALLY UNDERSTAND THE

16:59.385 --> 17:00.386
INFECTION CONTROL METHOD.

17:00.386 --> 17:02.188
ANY TIME THEY FEEL UNSAFE THEY

17:02.188 --> 17:03.389
CAN LEAVE.

17:03.389 --> 17:05.491
WHEN YOU GO ON THE WARD, YOU

17:05.491 --> 17:07.393
HAVE A BUDDY SYSTEM, NEVER GO

17:07.393 --> 17:09.028
ALONE.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.497
YOU DRESS WITH SOMEONE TO MAKE

17:11.497 --> 17:13.266
SURE NO SKIN, NOTHING IS EXPOSED

17:13.266 --> 17:15.434
AND YOU GO INTO A WARD WITH AT

17:15.434 --> 17:17.236
LEAST ONE OTHER PERSON SO THAT

17:17.236 --> 17:18.738
IN CASE YOU'RE ABOUT TO MAKE A

17:18.738 --> 17:19.939
MISTAKE THE OTHER PERSON CAN

17:19.939 --> 17:22.375
ACTUALLY WARN YOU.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.844
SO WE TRY TO KEEP EVERYONE

17:24.844 --> 17:27.713
WITHIN A VERY, VERY STRICT SET

17:27.713 --> 17:29.081
OF RULES BECAUSE THERE'S NO

17:29.081 --> 17:30.182
PLACE FOR MISTAKE.

17:30.182 --> 17:31.951
>> ALL RIGHT, ESTRELLA LASRY,

17:31.951 --> 17:35.054
STEPHEN MORSE, THANK YOU.

17:37.523 --> 17:38.624
>> Sreenivasan: HOW IS THE EBOLA

17:38.624 --> 17:39.992
VIRUS TRANSMITTED FROM HUMAN TO

17:39.992 --> 17:41.060
HUMAN?

17:41.060 --> 17:42.194
LEARN THE SCIENCE BEHIND THE

17:42.194 --> 17:45.264
EPIDEMIC AT NEWSHOUR.PBS.ORG.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.181
AS WE REPORTED YESTERDAY, AN

18:02.181 --> 18:03.416
EXPERIMENTAL HEART DRUG

18:03.416 --> 18:05.217
DEVELOPED BY THE SWISS

18:05.217 --> 18:06.719
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY NOVARTIS

18:06.719 --> 18:08.087
SHOWS PROMISING RESULTS.

18:08.087 --> 18:11.390
THE NEW DRUG, CURRENTLY REFERRED

18:11.390 --> 18:13.326
TO BY ITS CODENAME "L C Z 696"

18:13.326 --> 18:15.761
MAY CHANGE THE COURSE OF

18:15.761 --> 18:17.330
TREATMENT AND PROLONG THE LIVES

18:17.330 --> 18:18.564
OF PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM HEART

18:18.564 --> 18:20.066
FAILURE.

18:20.066 --> 18:21.267
THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY ON THE

18:21.267 --> 18:22.301
NEW DRUG ARE BEING PRESENTED

18:22.301 --> 18:23.502
THIS WEEKEND IN SPAIN AT AN

18:23.502 --> 18:24.904
INTERNATIONAL CARDIOLOGY

18:24.904 --> 18:26.005
CONFERENCE AND WERE ALSO

18:26.005 --> 18:27.106
PUBLISHED YESTERDAY BY THE NEW

18:27.106 --> 18:28.074
ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE.

18:28.074 --> 18:29.408
FOR SOME INSIGHT, WE ARE JOINED

18:29.408 --> 18:30.509
VIA SKYPE FROM WINDHAM, NEW

18:30.509 --> 18:31.610
HAMPSHIRE, BY CLYDE YANCY,

18:31.610 --> 18:32.778
PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AND CHIEF

18:32.778 --> 18:34.113
OF CARDIOLOGY AT NORTHWESTERN

18:34.113 --> 18:35.348
UNIVERSITY.

18:35.348 --> 18:36.782
SO PROFESSOR YANCY, THERE ARE

18:36.782 --> 18:38.484
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO SUFFER

18:38.484 --> 18:39.552
FROM HEART DISEASE AND HEART

18:39.552 --> 18:40.486
FAILURE.

18:40.486 --> 18:41.487
WHAT'S SO DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS

18:41.487 --> 18:42.688
DRUG AND WHY DOES IT WORK BETTER

18:42.688 --> 18:45.858
THAN WHAT'S AVAILABLE TODAY?

18:45.858 --> 18:48.094
>> THANK YOU FOR THE INTEREST.

18:48.094 --> 18:50.062
THERE IS A NEW THERAPY NOW

18:50.062 --> 18:51.497
THAT'S NOT JUST AN ADDITIONAL

18:51.497 --> 18:53.332
THERAPY BUT IT IS A SIGNIFICANT

18:53.332 --> 18:54.567
IMPROVEMENT OVER WHAT WE ALREADY

18:54.567 --> 18:57.269
HAD.

18:57.269 --> 18:58.371
THIS REALLY IS BETTER, AND

18:58.371 --> 18:59.705
BRINGS A LOT OF HOPE TO A LOT OF

18:59.705 --> 19:00.606
PEOPLE.

19:00.606 --> 19:02.408
>> AND WITHOUT GETTING TOO FAR

19:02.408 --> 19:05.044
INTO THE DETAILS OR THE SCIENCE,

19:05.044 --> 19:06.479
WHAT'S IT DOING TO THE HEART TO

19:06.479 --> 19:08.180
MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT OR LESS

19:08.180 --> 19:08.881
PRONE TO FAIL?

19:08.881 --> 19:11.350
>> SO THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

19:11.350 --> 19:13.519
IT TAKES WHAT WE WERE ORIGINALLY

19:13.519 --> 19:15.588
DOING WHICH WAS TO USE DRUGS TO

19:15.588 --> 19:19.158
HELP MAKE THE HEART SMALLER AND

19:19.158 --> 19:20.593
STRONGER BUT TAKES IT A STEP

19:20.593 --> 19:21.527
FURTHER.

19:21.527 --> 19:23.729
NOT ONLY DOES IT HELP TO MAKE

19:23.729 --> 19:25.398
THE HEART SMALLER OR STRONGER

19:25.398 --> 19:27.133
BUT IT REDUCE HE OR MINIMIZES

19:27.133 --> 19:28.234
SOME OF THE SCAR THAT HAPPENS

19:28.234 --> 19:29.435
OVER TIME.

19:29.435 --> 19:31.103
BY COMBINING THESE TWO EFFECTS

19:31.103 --> 19:34.774
TOGETHER, IT REALLY HAS A

19:34.774 --> 19:37.309
PROFOUND BENEFIT ON LIVING

19:37.309 --> 19:38.711
LONGER AND FEELING BETTER.

19:38.711 --> 19:41.881
>> WILL THESE REPLACE WHAT WE

19:41.881 --> 19:44.483
HAVE TODAY, ACE INHIBITORS OR

19:44.483 --> 19:47.386
BETA BLOCKERS?

19:47.386 --> 19:49.455
>> THIS CHANGES THE FOUNDATION

19:49.455 --> 19:53.292
WHICH MEANS IT RAISES THE BAR

19:53.292 --> 19:54.093
FOR ALL PATIENTS.

19:54.093 --> 19:55.528
WE DO THINK THAT MANY PATIENTS

19:55.528 --> 19:58.464
WILL HAVE THEIR ACE INHIBITORS

19:58.464 --> 20:02.535
REPLACE BY THIS NEW LCC DRUG

20:02.535 --> 20:04.136
ONCE IT'S DEVELOPED FURTHER.

20:04.136 --> 20:06.005
BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO

20:06.005 --> 20:07.540
REALIZE THAT THE BACKGROUND

20:07.540 --> 20:09.141
THERAPY STILL INCLUDES DRUGS

20:09.141 --> 20:11.010
THAT MAKE DIFFERENCE LIKE BETA

20:11.010 --> 20:13.746
BLOCKERS AND MRAs SO LOTS OF

20:13.746 --> 20:14.480
REASON FOR ENTHUSIASM HERE.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.782
>> SO WHILE THIS ONE COMPANY HAS

20:16.782 --> 20:18.851
A LEAD HERE HOW LONG BEFORE THIS

20:18.851 --> 20:20.386
CATEGORY OF DRUGS GETS ON THE

20:20.386 --> 20:21.954
MARKETS AND ON STORE SHELVES SO

20:21.954 --> 20:24.290
TO SPEAK WHERE DOCTORS CAN WRITE

20:24.290 --> 20:25.724
A PRESCRIPTION FOR THEM IN THE

20:25.724 --> 20:26.625
U.S.?

20:26.625 --> 20:30.129
>> GO BEYOND WHICH COMPANY HAS

20:30.129 --> 20:31.730
PROPRIETARY INTEREST HERE AND

20:31.730 --> 20:32.932
REALIZE THIS IS REALLY A BREAK

20:32.932 --> 20:33.999
THROUGH FOR PATIENTS.

20:33.999 --> 20:35.267
WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO CHANGE

20:35.267 --> 20:35.968
THE DYNAMIC HERE.

20:35.968 --> 20:38.871
WE HAVE TO LOOK TO THE FDA, WORK

20:38.871 --> 20:40.573
WITH THE FDA, HOW CAN WE BRING

20:40.573 --> 20:42.108
THIS DEVELOPMENT TO THE TABLE

20:42.108 --> 20:43.275
SOONER AND BETTER THAN WE'VE

20:43.275 --> 20:44.276
EVER DONE BEFORE.

20:44.276 --> 20:45.711
I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE

20:45.711 --> 20:47.580
POSSIBILITY OF HELPING TO

20:47.580 --> 20:49.048
GALVANIZE INTEREST AND GET THIS

20:49.048 --> 20:50.116
DRUG TO PATIENTS AS SOON AS

20:50.116 --> 20:50.950
POSSIBLE.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.084
>> YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE ARE

20:52.084 --> 20:53.152
CONCERNED THAT PERHAPS IT'S TOO

20:53.152 --> 20:53.986
QUICK.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.521
I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

20:55.521 --> 20:58.023
MEDICAL ETHICS OF IT IS WHEN YOU

20:58.023 --> 21:00.926
HAVE THIS KIND OF EFFICACY, WHEN

21:00.926 --> 21:02.628
YOU WANT TO GET THE DRUG OUT AND

21:02.628 --> 21:04.463
HELP PEOPLE, ARE THERE

21:04.463 --> 21:07.466
PARTICULAR POPULATIONS THAT

21:07.466 --> 21:09.235
HAVEN'T BEEN STUDIED ENOUGH?

21:09.235 --> 21:11.670
>> YOU KNOW HARI THE ANSWER IS

21:11.670 --> 21:12.972
YES AND YES.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.807
BUT IT DOESN'T DROP OUR INTEREST

21:14.807 --> 21:18.444
OR QUELL OUR ENTHUSIASM.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.312
WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD FOR

21:20.312 --> 21:22.081
HEART DISEASE THAT'S CLEAR.

21:22.081 --> 21:24.116
YES THERE ARE PATIENTS WE WISH

21:24.116 --> 21:26.552
WE KNEW MORE ABOUT, LIKE AFRICAN

21:26.552 --> 21:29.522
AMERICAN PATIENTS, LIKE NEW

21:29.522 --> 21:31.223
PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED HEART

21:31.223 --> 21:32.057
FAILURE.

21:32.057 --> 21:35.361
BUT THERE ARE WAYS USING

21:35.361 --> 21:38.597
CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH

21:38.597 --> 21:39.365
PHILOSOPHIES, THIS IS NOT ABOUT

21:39.365 --> 21:40.766
A COMPANY, THIS IS ABOUT A

21:40.766 --> 21:42.501
BRAND-NEW WAY TO TAKE CARE OF

21:42.501 --> 21:44.470
PEOPLE THAT HAVE A PRETTY

21:44.470 --> 21:45.404
COMPELLING DISEASE.

21:45.404 --> 21:48.107
IF THE DISEASE WASN'T SO

21:48.107 --> 21:49.475
COMPELLING SURE WE COULD SLOW

21:49.475 --> 21:50.643
DOWN TAKE MORE TIME GET MORE

21:50.643 --> 21:51.577
DATA.

21:51.577 --> 21:53.045
BUT WE'VE GOT A DISEASE WHERE

21:53.045 --> 21:55.014
PEOPLE ARE COMING UP SHORT

21:55.014 --> 21:59.385
DESPITE GETTING EVERYTHING

21:59.385 --> 22:01.453
EVERYTHING WE HAVE NOW.

22:01.453 --> 22:02.421
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR

22:02.421 --> 22:03.155
TIME.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.757
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST.

22:04.757 --> 22:07.760
APPRECIATE IT.

22:10.362 --> 22:12.598
THIS IS PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND

22:12.598 --> 22:13.999
SUNDAY.

22:18.137 --> 22:19.538
>> Sreenivasan: EARLIER THIS

22:19.538 --> 22:20.706
WEEK HIGH SCHOOLERS WHO ARE PART

22:20.706 --> 22:21.774
OF THE NEWSHOUR'S STUDENT

22:21.774 --> 22:23.008
REPORTING LABS SHARED THEIR

22:23.008 --> 22:24.743
OPINIONS ON JUSTICE AND RACE IN

22:24.743 --> 22:26.512
AMERICA FOLLOWING THE SHOOTING

22:26.512 --> 22:27.713
OF MICHAEL BROWN AND THE

22:27.713 --> 22:30.115
VIOLENCE IN FERGUSON, MISSOURI.

22:30.115 --> 22:30.883
HERE ARE MORE VOICES FROM THAT

22:30.883 --> 22:32.384
REPORT.

22:32.384 --> 22:33.886
>> I FEEL LIKE AFTER HEARING

22:33.886 --> 22:36.855
ABOUT THIS SITUATION, I REALIZE

22:36.855 --> 22:38.958
IF WE HAVE TO PROTEST THE

22:38.958 --> 22:41.527
KILLING OF UNARMED YOUTH IN OUR

22:41.527 --> 22:43.462
COUNTRY WE DON'T LIVE IN A FREE

22:43.462 --> 22:44.230
COUNTRY AT ALL.

22:44.230 --> 22:47.266
>> THE COLOR OF OUR SKIN WHETHER

22:47.266 --> 22:49.401
YOU'RE WHITE MEXICAN BLACK

22:49.401 --> 22:50.603
INDIAN, WE SHOULD HAVE THE SAME

22:50.603 --> 22:51.403
JUSTICE.

22:51.403 --> 22:52.304
IT DOESN'T ADD UP TO ME.

22:52.304 --> 22:55.174
>> I FEEL LIKE FERGUSON WAS LIKE

22:55.174 --> 22:56.875
A TRUE SHOWING OF WHAT THE

22:56.875 --> 22:59.111
NATION TRULY FEELS ABOUT

22:59.111 --> 23:00.546
EQUALITY.

23:00.546 --> 23:03.048
BETWEEN MINORITIES, AND THE

23:03.048 --> 23:04.083
MAJORITIES, IN CERTAIN

23:04.083 --> 23:04.984
COMMUNITIES.

23:04.984 --> 23:07.019
>> SOMETHING LET ME KNOW THAT

23:07.019 --> 23:09.221
JUSTICE AND RACE ARE STILL A BIG

23:09.221 --> 23:11.490
TOPIC FOCUS ON AMERICA, THAT

23:11.490 --> 23:12.891
RACISM IS STILL SOMETHING THAT

23:12.891 --> 23:16.395
EXISTS AND EQUALITY AMONGST

23:16.395 --> 23:17.930
RACES THEMSELVES AREN'T FULLY

23:17.930 --> 23:18.864
MELT YET.

23:18.864 --> 23:23.535
>> AFTER FERGUSON I FOUND A

23:23.535 --> 23:25.804
MAGAZINE FROM JULY 30, 2001.

23:25.804 --> 23:27.706
THIS MAGAZINE BROUGHT TO MY

23:27.706 --> 23:29.642
ATTENTION THAT EVEN SINCE 2001

23:29.642 --> 23:31.176
RACIAL PROFILING HAS BEEN STILL

23:31.176 --> 23:32.177
PRESENT AND OUR GOVERNMENT IS

23:32.177 --> 23:33.545
KIND OF IGNORING WHAT'S
