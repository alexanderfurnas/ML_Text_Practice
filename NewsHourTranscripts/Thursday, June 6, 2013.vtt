WHAT'S A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF

23:41.353 --> 23:43.415
FUNNY WORD.
WHAT'S A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF
HUNGER FOR YOUR KIDS, FOR

WHAT'S A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF
HUNGER FOR YOUR KIDS, FOR

23:43.784 --> 23:44.582
HUNGER FOR YOUR KIDS, FOR

HOW MANY MEALS WOULD YOU WANT

HOW MANY MEALS WOULD YOU WANT
YOUR CHILDREN NOT TO EAT IN

23:45.783 --> 23:47.680
HOW MANY MEALS WOULD YOU WANT
YOUR CHILDREN NOT TO EAT IN
ORDER TO BALANCE THE BUDGET?

23:47.682 --> 23:49.945
YOUR CHILDREN NOT TO EAT IN
ORDER TO BALANCE THE BUDGET?
I THINK THE WORD "REASONABLE" IS

23:49.947 --> 23:50.311
ORDER TO BALANCE THE BUDGET?
I THINK THE WORD "REASONABLE" IS
DECEPTIVE.

23:50.313 --> 23:51.477
I THINK THE WORD "REASONABLE" IS
DECEPTIVE.
>> YOU KNOW, THE THING IS, IT'S

23:51.480 --> 23:53.109
DECEPTIVE.
>> YOU KNOW, THE THING IS, IT'S
TRUE THAT THE RECESSION AND THE

23:53.112 --> 23:54.941
>> YOU KNOW, THE THING IS, IT'S
TRUE THAT THE RECESSION AND THE
ECONOMIC SLOW-DOWN HAS CAUSED

23:54.944 --> 23:56.208
TRUE THAT THE RECESSION AND THE
ECONOMIC SLOW-DOWN HAS CAUSED
FOOD STAMP COSTS TO INCREASE.

23:56.209 --> 23:57.841
ECONOMIC SLOW-DOWN HAS CAUSED
FOOD STAMP COSTS TO INCREASE.
BUT THE COST OF THE PROGRAM

23:57.842 --> 23:59.972
FOOD STAMP COSTS TO INCREASE.
BUT THE COST OF THE PROGRAM
ROUGHLY DOUBLED UNDER PRESIDENT

23:59.975 --> 24:01.272
BUT THE COST OF THE PROGRAM
ROUGHLY DOUBLED UNDER PRESIDENT
BUSH, EVEN BEFORE PRESIDENT

24:01.274 --> 24:02.638
ROUGHLY DOUBLED UNDER PRESIDENT
BUSH, EVEN BEFORE PRESIDENT
OBAMA CAME TO OFFICE, JUST

24:02.640 --> 24:04.337
BUSH, EVEN BEFORE PRESIDENT
OBAMA CAME TO OFFICE, JUST
BECAUSE CONGRESS AND PRESIDENT

24:04.339 --> 24:06.402
OBAMA CAME TO OFFICE, JUST
BECAUSE CONGRESS AND PRESIDENT
BUSH EXPANDED THE ELIGIBILITY SO

24:06.404 --> 24:06.702
BECAUSE CONGRESS AND PRESIDENT
BUSH EXPANDED THE ELIGIBILITY SO
MUCH.

24:06.705 --> 24:08.235
BUSH EXPANDED THE ELIGIBILITY SO
MUCH.
SO THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM.

24:08.237 --> 24:09.466
MUCH.
SO THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM.
AND EVEN NOW, THE UNEMPLOYMENT

24:09.469 --> 24:11.532
SO THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM.
AND EVEN NOW, THE UNEMPLOYMENT
RATE NOW IS LOWER THAN WHEN

24:11.535 --> 24:12.731

RATE NOW IS LOWER THAN WHEN
PRESIDENT OBAMA FIRST CAME TO

PRESIDENT OBAMA FIRST CAME TO
OFFICE, AND YET THERE'S MILLIONS

24:13.999 --> 24:15.830
PRESIDENT OBAMA FIRST CAME TO
OFFICE, AND YET THERE'S MILLIONS
MORE ON FOOD STAMPS.

24:15.831 --> 24:17.530
OFFICE, AND YET THERE'S MILLIONS
MORE ON FOOD STAMPS.
SO THE CONGRESS AND THE STATES

24:17.531 --> 24:19.828
MORE ON FOOD STAMPS.
SO THE CONGRESS AND THE STATES
HAVE CONTINUED TO LOOSEN

24:19.830 --> 24:20.228
SO THE CONGRESS AND THE STATES
HAVE CONTINUED TO LOOSEN
ELIGIBILITY.

24:20.229 --> 24:21.560
HAVE CONTINUED TO LOOSEN
ELIGIBILITY.
SO THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM NOW IS

24:21.562 --> 24:23.526
ELIGIBILITY.
SO THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM NOW IS
NOT JUST FOR THE LOWEST INCOME

24:23.528 --> 24:23.859
SO THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM NOW IS
NOT JUST FOR THE LOWEST INCOME
PEOPLE.

24:23.862 --> 24:25.592
