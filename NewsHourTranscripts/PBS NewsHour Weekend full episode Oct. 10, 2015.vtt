00:43.110 --> 00:44.478
TERRORIST BOMBINGS IN TURKEY

00:44.478 --> 00:45.312

00:45.312 --> 00:46.280
THE ATTACKS OCCURRED DURING A

00:46.280 --> 00:47.848
PEACE MARCH IN TURKEY'S CAPITAL

01:06.767 --> 01:08.769
EXPLOSIONS IN THE CENTER OF THE

01:08.769 --> 01:11.071
TURKISH CAPITAL ANKARA, THE

01:11.071 --> 01:12.739

01:12.739 --> 01:15.208

01:15.208 --> 01:16.743
THEY WAITED FOR PARAMEDICS TO

THE BLASTS HAPPENED AHEAD OF A

PEACE MARCH, A PROTEST AGAINST

01:24.952 --> 01:26.687
MILITANTS IN THE SOUTHEAST OF

01:28.221 --> 01:29.489
ONE OF THE BOMBS EXPLODED

01:29.489 --> 01:31.358
OUTSIDE THE CITY'S MAIN TRAIN

01:31.358 --> 01:32.659
STATION.

01:32.659 --> 01:34.227
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THIS WAS A

01:34.227 --> 01:35.896
TERRORIST ATTACK AND THEY'RE

01:35.896 --> 01:37.531
INVESTIGATING CLAIMS THAT A

01:37.531 --> 01:40.400
SUICIDE BOMBER WAS RESPONSIBLE.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.369
THE TURKISH PRIME MINISTER HAS

01:42.369 --> 01:44.471
BEEN HOLDING EMERGENCY TALKS

01:44.471 --> 01:46.440
WITH SENIOR OFFICIALS.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.342
SECURITY IS NOW A TOP PRIORITY

01:48.342 --> 01:49.643
FOR THE GOVERNMENT WITH

01:49.643 --> 01:51.244
PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS IN THE

01:56.116 --> 01:57.417

01:57.417 --> 01:58.785
CITY AND UNREST THROUGHOUT

01:58.785 --> 02:00.120
ISRAEL HAS PROMPTED THE ISRAELI

02:00.120 --> 02:01.855
GOVERNMENT TO STEP UP SECURITY.

02:01.855 --> 02:02.823
IN THE PAST WEEK AND A HALF,

02:02.823 --> 02:04.358
STABBINGS BY PALESTINIANS HAVE

02:04.358 --> 02:05.926
KILLED FOUR ISRAELIS AND WOUNDED

02:05.926 --> 02:07.361
AT LEAST TEN MORE.

ISRAELI POLICE RESPONDING TO THE

02:09.062 --> 02:10.530

PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS HAVE

02:12.032 --> 02:13.900

02:13.900 --> 02:15.869
IN JERUSALEM AND THE PALESTINIAN

02:15.869 --> 02:17.104
TERRITORIES OF GAZA AND THE WEST

02:17.104 --> 02:17.838
BANK.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.072
ISRAEL'S MILITARY SAID TODAY A

02:19.072 --> 02:20.807
ROCKET HAD BEEN FIRED FROM GAZA

02:20.807 --> 02:22.476
INTO SOUTHERN ISRAEL.

JOINING ME NOW VIA SKYPE FROM

02:24.778 --> 02:26.513
ESCALATING UNREST IS JOSEF

02:26.513 --> 02:27.714
FEDERMAN OF THE ASSOCIATED

02:27.714 --> 02:28.448
PRESS.

02:28.448 --> 02:29.182
JOSEPH, THANKS FOR JOINING YOU.

02:29.182 --> 02:31.051
WHAT'S THE LATEST?

02:31.051 --> 02:32.786
>> WE ARE MORE VIOLENCE TODAY.

02:32.786 --> 02:42.129
IT APPEARS STABBINGS JERUSALEM,

02:42.129 --> 02:43.730
AND VIOLENCE ON THE GAZA STRIP

02:43.730 --> 02:44.564
>> Sreenivasan: ON THE ONE

02:44.564 --> 02:45.932
HAND YOU HAVE PROTESTERS

02:45.932 --> 02:47.801
MARCHING AND ON THE OTHER HAND

02:47.801 --> 02:49.836
YOU SEEM TO HAVE RANDOM ATTACKS

02:49.836 --> 02:51.304
THAT HAVE HARD TO PREDICT IN

02:51.304 --> 02:53.673
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY

02:53.673 --> 02:54.174
NOW.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.076
>> YEAH, IT'S SOMETHING ISRAEL

02:56.076 --> 02:57.144
HADN'T DEALT WITH BEFORE, AT

02:57.144 --> 02:58.578
LEAST ON THIS LEVEL.

02:58.578 --> 03:01.181
THE ATTACKS DO NOT SEEM TO BE

03:01.181 --> 03:01.615
ORGANIZED.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.483
THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE COMING

03:03.483 --> 03:04.484
FROM ABOVE.

03:04.484 --> 03:05.986
THEY'RE SORT OF GROUND-LEVEL

03:05.986 --> 03:06.520
VENUS.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.521
IT'S VERY HARD TO DEFEND

03:07.521 --> 03:07.954
YOURSELF.

03:07.954 --> 03:09.689
WHAT YOU HAVE IS A COUNTRY THAT

03:09.689 --> 03:10.624
IS VERY JITTERY, VERY NERVOUS,

03:10.624 --> 03:11.725
AND EVERYBODY LOOKING OVER THEIR

03:11.725 --> 03:13.026
SHOULDERS.

03:13.026 --> 03:13.894
>> Sreenivasan: THIS IS

03:13.894 --> 03:16.029
PROBABLY THE 15th TIME THAT

03:16.029 --> 03:18.432
PEOPLE THOUGHT THIS IS THE NEXT

03:18.432 --> 03:20.267
INTIFADA OR UPRISING.

03:20.267 --> 03:22.069
WHAT DO PEOPLE ON THE STREET

03:22.069 --> 03:24.471
FEEL, ON BOTH SIDE OF THIS?

03:24.471 --> 03:26.940
>> LOOK, IT'S VERY EASY-- THE

03:26.940 --> 03:28.942
EASY THING TO SAY IS HERE WE ARE

03:28.942 --> 03:30.677
ENTERING A NEW INTAFADA AND

03:30.677 --> 03:33.113
THERE ARE A LOT OF SIMILARITIES.

03:33.113 --> 03:35.115
THE LEVEL OF CONVENIENCE, THE

03:35.115 --> 03:36.149
FACT THIS IS DRAGGING ON, THE

03:36.149 --> 03:37.784
FACT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE

03:37.784 --> 03:38.452
STOPPING.

03:38.452 --> 03:39.586
THERE ARE ALSO KEY DIFFERENCES.

03:39.586 --> 03:42.189
IN THE PAST, THE INTAFADA

03:42.189 --> 03:43.156
VIOLENCE ORGANIZED FROM THE TOP

03:43.156 --> 03:43.657
DOWN.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.759
A DECADE AGO, 15 YEARS AGO, WHEN

03:45.759 --> 03:47.894
IT STARTED, YOU HAD YASSER

03:47.894 --> 03:49.329
ARAFAT IN CHARGE OF THE

03:49.329 --> 03:49.996
PALESTINIANS.

03:49.996 --> 03:53.266
HE HAD ARMED FORCES WHO WERE

03:53.266 --> 03:53.934
INVOLVED.

03:53.934 --> 03:56.403
THIS TIME YOU HAVE MAHMOUD ABBAS

03:56.403 --> 03:58.004
IN CHARGE OF THE PALESTINIANS.

03:58.004 --> 03:59.339
HE IS COMMITTED TO NONVIOLENCE.

03:59.339 --> 04:00.841
HE IS NOT CALLING THE SHOTS ON

04:00.841 --> 04:01.541
THIS THING.

04:01.541 --> 04:03.543
SO, AGAIN, IT'S HARD-- YOU'RE

04:03.543 --> 04:04.611
TALKING APPLES AND OWNERS HERE,

04:04.611 --> 04:06.780
AND IT'S VERY HARD TO SAY WHERE

04:06.780 --> 04:07.714
THIS IS HEADING

04:07.714 --> 04:10.117
>> Sreenivasan: AND WHAT'S THE

04:10.117 --> 04:10.884
ISRAELI POLITICAL RESPONSE TO

04:10.884 --> 04:11.618
THIS THEN?

04:11.618 --> 04:15.989
>> WELL, YOU HAVE PRIME MINISTER

04:15.989 --> 04:17.224
NETANYAHU DEALING WITH DIFFERENT

04:17.224 --> 04:18.091
PRESSURES FROM DIFFERENT

04:18.091 --> 04:18.558
DIRECTIONS.

04:18.558 --> 04:19.559
HE'S A NATIONALIST.

04:19.559 --> 04:22.162
HE HAS A HARD-LINE CABINET, SO

04:22.162 --> 04:23.396
HE'S UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE TO

04:23.396 --> 04:24.998
RESPOND TOUGH AND YOU'LL SEE HIM

04:24.998 --> 04:26.433
WHEN HE MAKES HIS PUBLIC

04:26.433 --> 04:26.933
STATEMENTS.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.069
HE TALKS TOUGH.

04:29.069 --> 04:31.004
HE TALKS ABOUT THE NEED FOR THE

04:31.004 --> 04:32.606
COUNTRY TO BAND TOGETHER, HOW TO

04:32.606 --> 04:33.373
STOP TERRORISM.

04:33.373 --> 04:35.775
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, HE'S ALSO

04:35.775 --> 04:37.444
URGING RESTRAINT, AND MOST

04:37.444 --> 04:39.012
NOTICEABLY, A COUPLE OF DAYS

04:39.012 --> 04:40.847
AGO, HE CALLED ON LAWMAKERS TO

04:40.847 --> 04:42.916
STAY AWAY FROM THE TEMPLE MOUNT,

04:42.916 --> 04:46.386
THE AREA IN JERUSALEM THAT IS AT

04:46.386 --> 04:48.488
THE HEART OF ALL THE UNREST.

04:48.488 --> 04:49.823
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT IS THE

04:49.823 --> 04:51.024
SITUATION FLYING SOME OF THESE

04:51.024 --> 04:51.958
SPECIFIC AREAS?

04:51.958 --> 04:53.426
DO YOU SEE AN INCREASED POLICE

04:53.426 --> 04:54.094
PRESENCE?

04:54.094 --> 04:55.795
>> YEAH, I ACTUALLY WENT FOR A

04:55.795 --> 04:56.963
WALK THROUGH THE OLD CITY WHERE

04:56.963 --> 04:57.898
A LOT OF THE ATTACKS HAVE BEEN

04:57.898 --> 04:58.398
HAPPENING.

04:58.398 --> 04:59.799
I WENT THROUGH THE OLD CITY TWO

04:59.799 --> 05:02.669
DAYS AGO, AND IT WAS QUITE A

05:02.669 --> 05:03.303
CHILLING EXPERIENCE.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.639
I WALKED FROM DAMASCUS GATE,

05:05.639 --> 05:07.574
WHICH IS IN THE HEART OF THE

05:07.574 --> 05:08.575
PALESTINIAN SIDE OF THE OLD

05:08.575 --> 05:09.876
CITY, OVER TO THE WESTERN WALL,

05:09.876 --> 05:11.711
WHICH IS THE JEWISH SIDE, AND

05:11.711 --> 05:14.381
REALLY EVERY 50 YARDS, EVERY 100

05:14.381 --> 05:16.149
YARDS, THERE WERE GROUPS OF

05:16.149 --> 05:18.451
POLICEMEN, SORT OF MINIATURE

05:18.451 --> 05:19.186
CHECKPOINTS AS YOU WALKED

05:19.186 --> 05:21.221
THROUGH THE ALLEYWAYS, PATROLS

05:21.221 --> 05:21.721
EVERYWHERE.

05:21.721 --> 05:23.456
I'VE BEEN HERE OVER A DECADE.

05:23.456 --> 05:24.858
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE

05:24.858 --> 05:25.358
THAT BEFORE.

05:25.358 --> 05:26.426
>> Sreenivasan: JOSEPH

05:30.664 --> 05:31.331
JERUSALEM, THANKS SO MUCH.

05:31.331 --> 05:30.964
>> THANK YOU.

05:30.964 --> 05:31.731
>> Sreenivasan: IN NEIGHBORING

05:31.731 --> 05:33.466
SYRIA, RUSSIAN FORCES HAVE

05:33.466 --> 05:34.568
STEPPED UP THEIR ATTACKS ON

05:34.568 --> 05:35.969
OPPONENTS OF SYRIAN PRESIDENT

05:35.969 --> 05:37.137
BASHAR AL-ASSAD.

05:37.137 --> 05:38.338
RUSSIA'S MILITARY SAYS IT BOMBED

05:38.338 --> 05:40.040
MORE THAN 50 TARGETS IN THE PAST

05:40.040 --> 05:41.575
24 HOURS, SUPPORTING

05:41.575 --> 05:43.376
PRO-GOVERNMENT GROUND TROOPS

05:43.376 --> 05:44.811
FIGHTING REBEL GROUPS.

05:44.811 --> 05:45.979
JOINING ME NOW VIA SKYPE FROM

05:45.979 --> 05:47.247
BEIRUT TO DISCUSS THE SITUATION

05:47.247 --> 05:48.782
IN SYRIA IS "WALL STREET

05:48.782 --> 05:50.283
JOURNAL" REPORTER SAM DAGHER.

05:50.283 --> 05:51.985
SAM, WE HAVE HEARD IN THE PAST

05:51.985 --> 05:53.653
FEW DAYS OF THE RUSSIANS

05:53.653 --> 05:54.921
ATTACKING DIFFERENT POSITIONS IN

05:54.921 --> 05:57.824
SYRIA BY LAND, AIR, AND SEA.

05:57.824 --> 06:03.663
>> THAT IS CORRECT, HARRY.

06:03.663 --> 06:04.798
BUT THEY'VE BEEN PRIMARILY

06:04.798 --> 06:09.336
TARGETING THE NON-ISIS FIGHTERS.

06:09.336 --> 06:11.404
THESE ARE REBELS IN THE WESTERN

06:11.404 --> 06:12.305
HALF OF THE COUNTRY.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.040
THESE ARE ISLAMIST REBELS AS

06:14.040 --> 06:16.142
WELL AS RELATIVELY MODERATE

06:16.142 --> 06:17.744
REBELS LINKED TO THE SO-CALLED

06:17.744 --> 06:19.112
FREE SYRIAN ARMY WHICH HAS

06:19.112 --> 06:20.413
RECEIVED ASSISTANCE IN THE PAST

06:20.413 --> 06:22.949
FROM THE UNITED STATES,

06:22.949 --> 06:24.851
INCLUDING ANTITANK MISSILES

06:24.851 --> 06:25.852
>> Sreenivasan: SO THIS PUTS

06:25.852 --> 06:27.387
THE U.S. IN A POSITION WHERE

06:27.387 --> 06:29.256
PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE SUPPORTED

06:29.256 --> 06:31.358
ON THE GROUND AGAINST PRESIDENT

06:31.358 --> 06:32.659
BASHAR AL-ASSAD ARE NOW BEING

06:32.659 --> 06:34.427
ATTACKED BY THE RUSSIANS.

06:34.427 --> 06:38.999
>> YOU HAVE TO ALSO LOOK AT THE

06:38.999 --> 06:40.033
REPERCUSSIONS OF WHAT THE

06:40.033 --> 06:41.034
RUSSIANS ARE DOING.

06:41.034 --> 06:43.670
FIRST OF ALL, BY FOCUSING ON

06:43.670 --> 06:46.706
THESE GROUPS, THEY'RE ALLOWING

06:46.706 --> 06:48.174
ISIS TO EXPLOIT THE SITUATION,

06:48.174 --> 06:49.843
AND WE'VE SEEN THAT ALREADY

06:49.843 --> 06:51.811
HAPPEN IN ALEPPO.

06:51.811 --> 06:54.547
ISIS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT

06:54.547 --> 06:56.383
THAT, YOU KNOW, ITS RIVAL, THESE

06:56.383 --> 06:58.018
OTHER REBEL GROUPS, ARE

06:58.018 --> 06:59.519
PREOCCUPIED, FENDING OFF REGIME

06:59.519 --> 07:02.989
FORCES WHO ARE TRYING TO FIGHT

07:02.989 --> 07:04.891
THEM WITH RUSSIAN SUPPORT.

07:04.891 --> 07:08.762
SO WHAT ISIS DID IN NORTHEAST

07:08.762 --> 07:10.964
ALEPPO IS CAPTURE LEAST 10

07:10.964 --> 07:12.732
VILLAGES YESTERDAY FROM THE

07:12.732 --> 07:14.467
REBELS, AS WELL AS A VERY

07:14.467 --> 07:15.735
IMPORTANT BASE.

07:15.735 --> 07:17.570
IT'S CALLED THE INFANTRY

07:17.570 --> 07:19.039
ACADEMY, NORTHEAST OF THE CITY

07:19.039 --> 07:20.974
OF ALEPPO, AND THIS IS SOMETHING

07:20.974 --> 07:22.709
THE REBELS CAPTURED FROM THE

07:22.709 --> 07:23.877
REGIME IN 2012.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.512
SECOND OF ALL, YOU ALSO HAVE TO

07:25.512 --> 07:27.113
LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE

07:27.113 --> 07:29.482
GROUND, WHICH COULD BE

07:29.482 --> 07:31.551
EXACERBATING THE REFUGEE CRISIS.

07:31.551 --> 07:34.688
THERE ARE A A LOT OF PEOPLE

07:34.688 --> 07:36.690
FLEEING THE VILLAGES BEING HIT

07:36.690 --> 07:38.491
BY THE RUSSIANS.

07:38.491 --> 07:39.693
THESE ARE PEOPLE PRIMARILY--

07:39.693 --> 07:40.727
WE'RE SEEING REPORTS OF

07:40.727 --> 07:43.430
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LEAVING

07:43.430 --> 07:45.732
VILLAGES IN THE COUNTRYSIDE

07:45.732 --> 07:47.067
WHERE AN OFFENSIVE IS UNDER WAY

07:47.067 --> 07:49.102
BY THE ROW SCREAM AND ITS

07:49.102 --> 07:51.338
ALLIES, THE IRANIANS AND THE

07:51.338 --> 07:53.373
SHIITE FIGHTERS FROM LEBANON AND

07:53.373 --> 07:55.208
ELSEWHERE, WHO ARE BEING BACKED

07:55.208 --> 07:57.510
BY THE RUSSIANS FROM THE AIR.

07:57.510 --> 08:04.551
SO PEOPLE ARE FLEEING THESE

08:04.551 --> 08:06.920
VILLAGES.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.254
SO THAT POTENTIALLY COULD BE

08:08.254 --> 08:09.556
MAKING THE REFUGEE SITUATION

08:09.556 --> 08:10.790
MUCH WORSE, AND THESE ARE PEOPLE

08:10.790 --> 08:12.592
WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN DISPLACED

08:12.592 --> 08:13.860
FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.

08:13.860 --> 08:16.429
A THIRD CONSIDERATION AS WELL IS

08:16.429 --> 08:18.031
THE SECTARIAN OVERTONES OF

08:18.031 --> 08:19.799
WHAT'S GOING ON.

08:19.799 --> 08:23.069
THE RUSSIANS AND THEIR ALLIES

08:23.069 --> 08:26.373
ARE TARGETING PREDOMINANTLY

08:26.373 --> 08:27.640
SUNNI VILLAGES, AND THE AREA OF

08:27.640 --> 08:29.609
THE OPERATION RIGHT NOW IS THE--

08:29.609 --> 08:31.978
IS BASICALLY THE PRINCIPAL

08:31.978 --> 08:34.280
SECTARIAN FAULT LINE IN SYRIA

08:34.280 --> 08:36.449
SEPARATING SUNNIS FROM THE

08:36.449 --> 08:37.450
SHIITE-LINKED ALAWITES, TO WHICH

08:42.589 --> 08:45.191
BASHAR AL-ASSAD BELONGS.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.160
PEOPLE FROM A CERTAIN SECT,

08:47.160 --> 08:48.795
SUNNIS, LEAVING THEIR VILLAGES

08:48.795 --> 08:49.763
BECAUSE OF THE MILITARY

08:49.763 --> 08:51.164
CAMPAIGNS BEING BACKED BY THE
