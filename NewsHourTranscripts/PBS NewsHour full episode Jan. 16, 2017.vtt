JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.372 --> 00:07.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.207 --> 00:10.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour": On this day
honoring Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr.,
president-elect Trump

00:10.711 --> 00:16.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meets with King's son, despite a
war of words
with a surviving civil rights
leader, Congressman

00:16.817 --> 00:18.685 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
John Lewis.

00:18.719 --> 00:24.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: Mr. Trump makes waves
overseas, calling
NATO obsolete and signaling the
U.S. may ease

00:24.825 --> 00:27.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sanctions on Russia.

00:27.394 --> 00:33.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And one man's journey to
understand his hometown's
racist history leads to insights
into a still

00:33.834 --> 00:35.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
deeply divided America.

00:35.669 --> 00:37.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICK PHILLIPS, Author, "Blood
at the Root:
A Racial Cleansing in America":
We were raised

00:37.137 --> 00:40.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with this notion that, every
day, America
gets a little bit more just.

00:40.274 --> 00:46.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, in the research, I
learned that
some -- what that leaves out is
that sometimes

00:46.647 --> 00:49.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the gains of one generation are
given back
in the next.

00:49.650 --> 00:52.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:52.953 --> 00:57.257 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:57.291 --> 01:09.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Americans have
spent this day
honoring the life and legacy of
Dr. Martin

01:09.369 --> 01:11.171 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Luther King Jr.

01:11.204 --> 01:16.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It comes amid an open conflict
between another
iconic civil rights figure and
the nation's

01:16.610 --> 01:18.979 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
new leader.

01:19.012 --> 01:23.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President-elect Trump marked the
King holiday
by inviting the civil rights
leader's son

01:23.317 --> 01:25.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to his New York tower.

01:25.585 --> 01:31.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Martin Luther King III called it
a very constructive
meeting, and quoted the
president-elect, saying

01:31.458 --> 01:33.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he wants to reach out to all
Americans.

01:33.360 --> 01:37.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARTIN LUTHER KING III,
President &amp; CEO, Realizing
the Dream: I believe that that's
his intent.

01:37.130 --> 01:41.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think also that we have to
consistently
engage with pressure, public
pressure.

01:41.969 --> 01:43.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It doesn't happen automatically.

01:43.770 --> 01:48.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
My father and his team
understood that, did
that, and I think that Americans
are prepared

01:48.075 --> 01:49.876 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do that.

01:49.910 --> 01:53.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: King steered
clear of the Trump
feud with a civil rights hero,
Democratic

01:53.880 --> 01:55.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Representative John Lewis of
Georgia.

01:55.882 --> 02:00.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN LUTHER KING III: I think
that, in the
heat of emotion, a lot of things
get said

02:00.287 --> 02:02.089 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on both sides.

02:02.122 --> 02:07.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The war of words
began Friday,
with Lewis telling NBC that
Trump's election

02:07.694 --> 02:10.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wasn't legitimate because of
Russian meddling.

02:11.031 --> 02:12.632 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The full interview aired Sunday.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.301 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:14.334 --> 02:17.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN LEWIS (D), Georgia: I don't
see this
president-elect as a legitimate
president.

02:17.871 --> 02:22.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lewis also said
he will boycott
Friday's inauguration.

02:22.409 --> 02:27.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All told, more than two dozen
members of Congress
now say they will do the same.

02:27.447 --> 02:32.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president-elect fired back
at Lewis over
the weekend, tweeting that he
should spend

02:32.619 --> 02:39.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- quote -- "more time on
helping his district
and calling him all talk, talk,
talk, no action

02:39.693 --> 02:41.028 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or results."

02:41.061 --> 02:45.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On CBS this weekend, vice
president-elect
Pence also pushed back.

02:45.699 --> 02:48.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE PENCE (R), Vice
President-Elect: To make
a comment that he did not
consider Donald

02:48.335 --> 02:51.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Trump to be a legitimate
president, I think
is deeply disappointing.

02:51.405 --> 02:57.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I believe inaugurations are a
moment when
we should come together around
that individual

02:57.444 --> 03:01.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who has been elected to be
president of the
United States of America.

03:01.648 --> 03:07.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Today, at a King
Day breakfast
in Miami, Lewis ignored the
Trump criticism.

03:07.587 --> 03:10.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, he issued a call to
action to his
listeners.

03:10.657 --> 03:11.625 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:11.658 --> 03:12.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN LEWIS: You must have
courage.

03:12.926 --> 03:15.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You must be bold.

03:15.595 --> 03:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And never, ever give up when you
know that
you're right.

03:19.800 --> 03:26.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For his part, Mr.
Trump canceled
an early plan to spend the
holiday in Washington

03:26.073 --> 03:30.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and visit the National Museum of
African American
History and Culture.

03:30.911 --> 03:37.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the vice president-elect was
in Washington
at the Martin Luther King Jr.
Memorial.

03:37.284 --> 03:43.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama, in his last
week in office,
took part in a service event at
a D.C. family

03:43.123 --> 03:44.891 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
shelter.

03:44.925 --> 03:48.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: There
was no sign
of a letup in another
confrontation, this

03:49.029 --> 03:52.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one between Mr. Trump and the
intelligence
community.

03:52.165 --> 03:57.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It started when outgoing CIA
Director John
Brennan said Sunday that the
president-elect

03:57.404 --> 04:01.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
must do more than -- quote --
"talk and tweet
about national security."

04:01.875 --> 04:04.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS WALLACE, Host, "Â®MD-BO /FOX
News Sunday":
Do you think that Mr. Trump
understands the

04:04.478 --> 04:06.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
threat from Russia?

04:06.446 --> 04:11.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN, CIA Director: I
don't think
he has a full appreciation of
Russian capabilities,

04:11.518 --> 04:16.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia's intentions, and actions
that they
are undertaking in many parts of
the world.

04:16.156 --> 04:19.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's what the obligation
and responsibility
of the intelligence community
is.

04:19.292 --> 04:21.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Later, Mr. Trump
fired back
on Twitter.

04:21.862 --> 04:27.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He criticized the CIA's record
on conflicts
in Syria, Crimea and Ukraine.

04:27.200 --> 04:32.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, referring directly to
Brennan, he asked
-- quote -- "Was this the leaker
of fake news?"

04:32.939 --> 04:38.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president-elect also raised
hackles across
Europe with critical comments
about NATO and

04:38.111 --> 04:39.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the European Union.

04:39.346 --> 04:42.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will turn to that story right
after the
news summary.

04:42.816 --> 04:48.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the domestic front, the
incoming president
now says he means to replace
Obamacare with

04:48.155 --> 04:50.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
insurance for everybody.

04:50.190 --> 04:54.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's told The Washington Post
that his plan
is nearly complete, and that it
will offer

04:54.694 --> 04:58.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
-- quote -- "much lower
deductibles," but
he offered no details.

04:58.798 --> 05:04.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Turkey, there is word that
police have
captured the man suspected of
killing 39 in

05:04.704 --> 05:08.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an Istanbul nightclub during New
Year's celebrations.

05:08.241 --> 05:12.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Islamic State group had
claimed responsibility
for the New Year's attack.

05:12.779 --> 05:15.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It triggered an intense
nationwide manhunt.

05:15.982 --> 05:21.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkish media reports say that
the Uzbek national
was taken into custody during a
raid in an

05:21.721 --> 05:23.757 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Istanbul suburb.

05:23.790 --> 05:29.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A Turkish cargo plane crashed
today in Kyrgyzstan,
destroying out half a village
and killing

05:29.796 --> 05:31.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at least 37 people.

05:31.765 --> 05:37.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Boeing 747 was trying to
land in dense
fog near the capital city,
Bishkek.

05:37.671 --> 05:41.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was no immediate word what
caused the
crash.

05:41.741 --> 05:46.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a startling new report
about wealth
inequality around the globe.

05:46.213 --> 05:52.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The anti-poverty organization
Oxfam reports
that the eight richest men on
Earth own as

05:52.519 --> 05:57.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
much as the poorest half of the
world's population.

05:57.324 --> 06:00.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's about 3.6 billion people.

06:00.160 --> 06:04.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The report says the gap has
grown from what
it was just a year ago by a
significant amount.

06:05.031 --> 06:08.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAX LAWSON, Oxfam: We have seen
countries
in the last 10 years that have
bucked the

06:08.101 --> 06:11.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trend and that are going in the
other direction,
and are reducing the gap between
rich and

06:11.972 --> 06:13.206 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
poor.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One thing they do is, they get
the rich to
pay their tax.

06:15.075 --> 06:20.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have got a situation where
billionaires
are paying less tax often than
their cleaner

06:20.080 --> 06:21.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or their secretary.

06:21.414 --> 06:22.382 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's crazy.

06:22.415 --> 06:24.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're seeing wealth channeled
upwards.

06:24.517 --> 06:30.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The report was
released ahead
of the World Economic Forum in
Davos, Switzerland.

06:30.624 --> 06:35.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ten more long-term detainees
have left the
U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba.

06:35.729 --> 06:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Persian Gulf state of Oman
announced today
that it accepted the 10.

06:40.433 --> 06:44.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That leaves 45 prisoners
remaining at Guantanamo.

06:44.170 --> 06:47.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Obama has pushed to
close the prison.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President-elect Trump has vowed
to keep it
open.

06:49.909 --> 06:55.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Conservative commentator Monica
Crowley has
backed out of a job with the new
Trump administration,

06:55.915 --> 06:59.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
amid a plagiarism, an alleged
plagiarism scandal.

06:59.219 --> 07:04.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's widely reported that she's
decided against
serving at the National Security
Council.

07:04.724 --> 07:11.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Crowley is accused of
plagiarizing parts of
her doctoral dissertation and
her 2012 book.

07:11.865 --> 07:17.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The World Series champion
Chicago Cubs were
feted today by the White Sox fan
who calls

07:17.304 --> 07:19.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the White House home.

07:19.105 --> 07:23.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Cubs were the last
championship team that
Mr. Obama will greet while he's
in office.

07:23.810 --> 07:27.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They presented the 44th
president with two
special jerseys.

07:27.247 --> 07:33.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Cubs won the series last
November for
the first time since 1908.

07:33.720 --> 07:37.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And former astronaut Gene Cernan
died today
in Houston.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was the last of a dozen men
to walk on
the moon.

07:40.527 --> 07:42.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A handful of others still
survive.

07:43.029 --> 07:49.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cernan commanded the Apollo 17
mission to
the lunar surface in December
1972.

07:49.035 --> 07:54.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In later years, he urged
Congress to approve
a return to the moon.

07:54.140 --> 07:57.644 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Eugene Cernan was 82 years old.

Still to come on the "NewsHour":
our Politics
Monday duo previews inauguration
week; lessons

08:03.583 --> 08:16.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on race from a city that once
forced out its
black residents; and much more.

08:16.229 --> 08:24.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Beyond his social media
statements over the
weekend, the president-elect had
much more

08:24.471 --> 08:28.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to say in an interview with two
European publications.

08:28.241 --> 08:33.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He opined on the usefulness of
NATO and the
European Union, on the stability
of Germany

08:33.913 --> 08:37.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
under Chancellor Angela Merkel,
and on Brexit.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage.

08:39.786 --> 08:46.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: As hundreds of U.S.
Marines touched
down today in Norway, a move
designed to reassure

08:46.726 --> 08:52.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nations nervous about Russia,
European officials
were digesting president-elect
Trump's latest

08:52.365 --> 08:54.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
comments about NATO.

08:54.601 --> 08:59.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He told The Times of London and
the German
newspaper Bild that: "It's
obsolete because

08:59.372 --> 09:01.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it wasn't taking care of terror.

09:01.541 --> 09:05.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the other thing is, the
countries aren't
paying their fair share, which I
think is

09:05.678 --> 09:08.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very unfair to the United
States."

09:08.281 --> 09:13.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, the only time the
alliance's mutual
defense provision was invoked
was to help

09:13.653 --> 09:17.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the United States after the 9/11
terror attacks.

09:17.457 --> 09:21.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hundreds of NATO troops died
alongside Americans
in Afghanistan.

09:21.661 --> 09:26.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump had made similar
statements during
the campaign, but this latest
barb came just

09:26.433 --> 09:31.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
days after his nominee for
defense secretary
offered a starkly different
opinion.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.006 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

09:33.039 --> 09:35.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATTIS (RET.), Secretary
of Defense
Nominee: NATO, from my
perspective, having

09:35.041 --> 09:40.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
served once as the NATO supreme
allied commander,
is the most successful military
alliance probably

09:40.880 --> 09:42.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in modern world history, maybe
ever.

09:42.882 --> 09:48.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The Kremlin agreed
with the Trump
assessment and said NATO's main
goal is confrontation.

09:48.254 --> 09:53.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it said little about the
president-elect's
suggestion that he might drop
U.S. sanctions

09:53.593 --> 09:57.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on Russia in exchange for
nuclear arms reductions.

09:57.831 --> 10:02.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Mr. Trump also said he's
indifferent about
the European Union's future in
the wake of

10:02.068 --> 10:07.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Britain's vote to leave it:
"Personally, I
don't think it matters much for
the United

10:07.440 --> 10:09.242 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

10:09.275 --> 10:12.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, the E.U. was formed,
partially, to beat
the United States on trade, so I
don't really

10:12.946 --> 10:15.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
care whether it's separate or
together."

10:15.748 --> 10:20.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president-elect had special
criticism
for German Chancellor Angela
Merkel.

10:20.320 --> 10:26.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He said she had made a
catastrophic mistake
in taking in thousands of
migrants and refugees.

10:26.459 --> 10:31.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said he will start off
trusting Merkel
and Russian President Vladimir
Putin equally,

10:31.831 --> 10:34.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but said that may not last.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The chancellor answered today in
Berlin:

10:36.202 --> 10:40.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA MERKEL, German Chancellor
(through
translator): I think, for us
Europeans, we

10:40.540 --> 10:42.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have our fate in our own hands.

10:42.408 --> 10:44.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president-elect made his
points again.

10:44.711 --> 10:49.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once he is in office, which he
is not at the
moment, we will, of course, work
together

10:49.048 --> 10:50.650 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with the American government.

10:50.683 --> 10:53.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then we will see what sort of
cooperation
we can achieve.

10:53.520 --> 10:58.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Outgoing Secretary of
State John
Kerry went further in a CNN
interview.

10:58.625 --> 11:02.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: Well,
I thought, frankly, it was
inappropriate for

11:02.128 --> 11:06.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a president-elect of the United
States to
be stepping into the politics of
other countries

11:06.266 --> 11:08.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a quite direct manner.

11:08.167 --> 11:12.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The secretary said,
ultimately,
it's for Mr. Trump to explain
himself, because,

11:12.372 --> 11:17.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as of Friday, he's responsible
for that relationship.

11:17.477 --> 11:22.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We get reaction to Mr. Trump's
comments from
two people with extensive
experience managing

11:22.515 --> 11:25.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
U.S.-European relations.

11:25.051 --> 11:26.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nicholas Burns was a career
diplomat.

11:26.619 --> 11:30.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was U.S. ambassador to NATO
during the
Obama administration.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's now at Harvard University.

11:31.724 --> 11:33.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he joins us tonight from
London.

11:33.826 --> 11:38.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here in studio, Heather Conley,
she was deputy
assistant secretary of state for
European

11:38.498 --> 11:42.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Eurasian affairs during the
George W.
Bush administration.

11:42.835 --> 11:47.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's now director and senior
fellow of the
Europe Program at the Center for
Strategic

11:47.874 --> 11:51.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and International Studies, a
think tank in
Washington, D.C.

11:51.811 --> 11:53.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you both for joining us.

11:53.746 --> 11:57.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Burns, let me start with
you, former ambassador
to NATO.

11:57.984 --> 12:03.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump says that NATO is
obsolete because
it doesn't take on terror,
unfair to the United

12:03.756 --> 12:04.724 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

12:04.757 --> 12:06.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's your take?

12:06.593 --> 12:07.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS BURNS, Former U.S.
Undersecretary
of State for Political Affairs:
He's completely

12:07.093 --> 12:08.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wrong about that.

12:08.561 --> 12:12.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was ambassador to NATO for
President George
W. Bush actually on 9/11.

12:12.498 --> 12:17.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on 9/11, when we were
attacked from al-Qaida
in Afghanistan, the NATO allies
came to us

12:17.604 --> 12:19.305 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Brussels.

12:19.339 --> 12:22.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said they wanted to invoke
Article V
of the NATO treaty, an attack on
one of us

12:22.141 --> 12:23.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is an attack on all of us.

12:23.843 --> 12:26.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They came to our defense big
time.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They all went into Afghanistan.

12:28.147 --> 12:32.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They bled, died and were wounded
for us in
Afghanistan.

12:32.518 --> 12:34.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're all still fighting in
Afghanistan.

12:34.420 --> 12:39.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We fought the terrorism of
al-Qaida and the
terrorism of the Taliban and
other terrorist

12:39.158 --> 12:40.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
groups in Afghanistan.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Trump is -- Donald Trump is
exactly wrong.

12:42.862 --> 12:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I can tell you, having been
in London
today, people here are just
flabbergasted

12:47.100 --> 12:49.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by this interview in The Times
in London.

12:49.936 --> 12:55.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To basically -- to denigrate
NATO as obsolete,
to root openly for the weakening
of the European

12:55.108 --> 13:01.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Union, to castigate Angela
Merkel, our strongest
friend in Europe, we have not
seen an American

13:01.581 --> 13:06.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president be so openly critical
of our allies
in 70 years.

13:06.819 --> 13:10.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And yet he doesn't criticize our
adversary
Vladimir Putin.

13:10.690 --> 13:12.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is mystifying.

13:12.558 --> 13:15.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People here are uncertain about
American leadership.

13:15.194 --> 13:18.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a very poor and unwise way
to start his
term in office.

13:18.498 --> 13:23.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Heather Conley, the
larger point,
your take on the remarks, but
also specifically

13:23.836 --> 13:25.738 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on NATO.

13:25.772 --> 13:29.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says it's unfair because the
other countries
aren't paying their fair share,
that the financial

13:29.942 --> 13:31.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
burden falls on the United
States.

13:31.678 --> 13:33.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEATHER CONLEY, Director, Europe
Program,
Center for Strategic and
International Studies:

13:33.546 --> 13:37.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, it's certainly been a
bipartisan comment
to get European countries to
increase their

13:37.950 --> 13:39.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
defense spending.

13:39.886 --> 13:44.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's something that they
-- NATO countries
pledged two-and-a-half years ago
to substantially

13:44.891 --> 13:47.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
increase their defense spending,
and they're
doing that.

13:47.960 --> 13:54.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The challenge is, the United
States is safer
because NATO exists.

13:54.200 --> 14:00.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we join with our allies to
-- whether
it's defeating the Taliban in
Afghanistan,

14:00.840 --> 14:10.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supporting those in Iraq to beat
back ISIS,
to protect NATO when Russia
invades a neighboring

14:10.249 --> 14:12.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country, this -- it makes
America stronger.

14:12.885 --> 14:14.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a part of U.S. national
security.

14:14.687 --> 14:19.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when you're criticizing NATO
and saying
it's obsolete, you're actually
degrading U.S.

14:19.559 --> 14:20.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
national security.

14:20.993 --> 14:25.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is what has us all so
confused about
Mr. Trump's comments.

14:25.465 --> 14:29.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's OK to say Europe is not
spending enough
and we need to increase that
spending.

14:29.869 --> 14:34.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we get an enormous benefit
out of the
NATO alliance.

14:34.474 --> 14:37.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Let's drill down on
the some of
the other things that he said in
the interview.

14:37.376 --> 14:42.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ambassador Burns, what about
this idea of
lifting sanctions on Russia
which were put

14:42.148 --> 14:47.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in place for their annexation of
Crimea in
exchange for an agreement on
arms reduction?

14:47.854 --> 14:51.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICHOLAS BURNS: It's hard to see
the logic
in this agreement.

14:51.457 --> 14:55.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everyone, of course, wants to
see nuclear
stability between the United
States and Russia.

14:55.628 --> 14:57.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's the highest priority.

14:57.363 --> 15:01.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we can achieve nuclear arms
stability
and reduction based on the
interest of both

15:01.801 --> 15:03.503 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sides.

15:03.536 --> 15:06.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For Donald Trump to say, I will
do this, I
will reduce nuclear weapons with
Russia and

15:06.773 --> 15:11.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
give them sanctions relief,
Russia crossed
the brightest red line in
international law

15:11.944 --> 15:18.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by invading and annexing Crimea
and then dividing
Eastern Ukraine in the Donbass,
and, of course,

15:18.050 --> 15:21.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has been threatening our allies
the Baltic
states.

15:21.087 --> 15:26.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those sanction regimes are in
place by Europeans,
Canadians and Americans as
leverage against

15:26.926 --> 15:28.694 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Russia.

15:28.728 --> 15:32.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the sanctions cannot be
lifted until Russia
removes its forces from Eastern
Ukraine.

15:32.198 --> 15:37.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it doesn't do that, and if we
give away
on sanctions, Russia gets away
with grand

15:37.236 --> 15:39.005 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
larceny.

15:39.038 --> 15:43.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The European leadership will be
furious with
the United States, Angela Merkel
especially.

15:43.242 --> 15:47.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She negotiated these sanctions
with President
Putin directly.

15:47.079 --> 15:48.881 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so I think it's very unwise.

15:48.915 --> 15:51.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It gives away American
influence.

15:51.250 --> 15:55.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would be a weak policy by the
United States,
not a strong policy.

15:55.822 --> 16:01.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Heather Conley, is
this sort of
essentially offering to accept
this annexation

16:01.227 --> 16:03.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Crimea in exchange for
something else?

16:03.563 --> 16:05.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is this sort of like a business
deal?

16:05.231 --> 16:06.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEATHER CONLEY: Well, exactly.

16:06.365 --> 16:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're talking about two separate
things.

16:08.134 --> 16:12.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The sanctions relate to the
annexation of
Crimea and the invasion of
Eastern Ukraine.

16:12.338 --> 16:16.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A nuclear arms agreement --
let's step back
a minute.

16:16.175 --> 16:19.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia has been in violation of
the IMF Treaty
many years.

16:19.879 --> 16:22.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, steps have not been taken
to address
those violations.

16:22.915 --> 16:29.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have seen where --
announcements of moving
of Russian tactical weapons near
NATO borders,

16:29.822 --> 16:31.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
near now U.S. troops.

16:31.757 --> 16:32.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We do need to address this.

16:33.025 --> 16:36.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we're mixing apples and
oranges here.

16:36.362 --> 16:42.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, nuclear stability, I
agree, is very
important, but, right now -- and
I thought

16:42.268 --> 16:47.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president-elect Trump had
mentioned that he
wants to strengthen America's
nuclear arsenal.

16:47.139 --> 16:48.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Perhaps I misunderstood.

16:48.374 --> 16:49.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, are we reducing?

16:49.942 --> 16:51.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Are we increasing?

16:51.377 --> 16:54.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we have to watch very
carefully Russia's
military modernization.

16:54.213 --> 16:59.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are actually increasing
their strategic
nuclear deterrent.

16:59.919 --> 17:03.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They may be at a point where
they're accelerating
that program.

17:03.155 --> 17:04.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have to be extremely mindful.

17:04.991 --> 17:07.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is protecting U.S. national
security.

17:07.860 --> 17:15.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Russia, as General Mattis
noted, really
is a near-term threat, could be
an existential

17:15.635 --> 17:17.503 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
threat.

17:17.536 --> 17:20.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So let's keep our eye on the
prize here, and
not start conflating two very
different things.

17:20.873 --> 17:26.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Nicholas Burns,
talked about this
equating Vladimir Putin and
Angela Merkel.

17:26.112 --> 17:27.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's your take on that?

17:27.747 --> 17:30.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEATHER CONLEY: I -- to be
honest with you,
that was the most -- I'm sorry,
Nic.

17:30.683 --> 17:31.651 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

17:31.684 --> 17:32.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Sorry.

17:32.685 --> 17:33.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Go ahead, Mr. Ambassador.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICHOLAS BURNS: Sorry, just the
time delay.

17:36.956 --> 17:40.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just wanted to say, Angela
Merkel is our
strongest ally.

17:40.192 --> 17:42.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Vladimir Putin is our greatest
adversary.

17:42.595 --> 17:45.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
To equate them is an insult to
Angela Merkel.

17:45.932 --> 17:51.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Europe is our largest trade
partner, largest
investor into our economy and
largest ally.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Europe really matters.

17:53.272 --> 17:56.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Donald Trump says we're
indifferent to the
future of the E.U.?

17:56.075 --> 18:00.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The E.U. was formed to put aside
war between
France and Germany and unite
Europe in peace.

18:00.813 --> 18:01.847 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's done that.

18:01.881 --> 18:02.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We should support it.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: We have got less than
a minute
left.

18:04.550 --> 18:06.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Ambassador, let's start with
you.

18:06.285 --> 18:11.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What -- overall, what does this
say about
what's ahead for U.S.-European
relations?

18:12.024 --> 18:17.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICHOLAS BURNS: A very rocky
start for the
administration of Donald Trump.

18:17.129 --> 18:22.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have to believe that Rex
Tillerson, the
new secretary of state incoming,
Jim Mattis,

18:22.702 --> 18:26.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the new secretary of defense,
they understand
the value of NATO.

18:26.072 --> 18:27.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They understand that we're the
leader of the
West.

18:27.807 --> 18:32.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I hope very much that Donald
Trump will
agree with them and shift these
positions.

18:32.311 --> 18:34.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But, Heather Conley,
who's speaking
for the administration?

18:34.847 --> 18:36.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HEATHER CONLEY: That's the
question.

18:36.482 --> 18:39.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're going to need to get
some clarification
on that.

18:39.518 --> 18:45.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just to underscore it, European
solidarity,
unity -- it is an incredibly
important trade

18:45.424 --> 18:47.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and investment partner to the
U.S.

18:47.426 --> 18:52.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We cannot want Europe to be
divided, to be
-- to fall apart.

18:52.431 --> 18:54.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're too important to U.S.
national security.

18:55.001 --> 18:59.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Seventy years ago, another great
secretary
of state and defense, George C.
Marshall,

18:59.772 --> 19:02.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
made his Marshall Plan.

19:02.241 --> 19:04.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This was a massive investment in
Europe.

19:04.443 --> 19:06.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The United States has invested
in Europe.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We are the beneficiaries of it.

19:08.781 --> 19:10.449 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We cannot let this go away.

19:10.483 --> 19:11.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's too important.

19:11.917 --> 19:15.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Heather Conley,
Nicholas Burns,
thank you both very much.

19:15.354 --> 19:22.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEATHER CONLEY: Thank you.

19:22.395 --> 19:29.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That brings us to
Politics
Monday this inauguration week
with Tamara

19:29.869 --> 19:34.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Keith of NPR and Susan Page of
USA Today.

19:34.073 --> 19:35.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Great to see both of you on this
Monday.

19:35.975 --> 19:40.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tam, let me start with you as we
-- before
we get into any of the
specifics, inauguration

19:40.646 --> 19:44.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
week for this incoming
president, how does
it look at this point?

19:44.150 --> 19:45.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: It looks
like it's going to happen.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.753 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

19:47.787 --> 19:50.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: His team says that
he is still
working on the speech, still
refining it.

19:50.056 --> 19:54.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have no idea what that speech
will say,
though they promise he will talk
about bringing

19:54.760 --> 19:56.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Americans together.

19:56.762 --> 20:02.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he's also giving a speech
the night before
at sort of a pregame rally and
event for supporters.

20:02.701 --> 20:05.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, of course, there will
be protests
the following day.

20:05.571 --> 20:07.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What should we
look for, Susan?

20:07.440 --> 20:09.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau
Chief, USA Today:
I think this has been a
remarkable period

20:09.775 --> 20:17.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since the president-elect won
the election
two months ago, because,
usually, this has

20:17.850 --> 20:22.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been a time when Americans kind
of come together,
there's this era of kind of good
feeling,

20:22.288 --> 20:23.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at least for a little while.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.424 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We haven't seen that with this.

20:25.458 --> 20:28.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have seen really a
continuation of the
rhetoric we heard during the
campaign, and

20:28.527 --> 20:30.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some of the divisions have
persisted.

20:30.362 --> 20:35.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Donald Trump is going to be
inaugurated
with the lowest approval ratings
of any president

20:35.134 --> 20:37.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
since we started to take polls.

20:37.369 --> 20:41.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is going to be -- we
overuse the
word unprecedented when it comes
to Donald

20:41.207 --> 20:44.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump, but there are many ways
in which this
period of time has been
unprecedented.

20:44.110 --> 20:47.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And part of that,
as we have
been discussing and reporting
earlier in the

20:47.746 --> 20:51.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
program, Tam, is this back and
forth over
the weekend between Congressman
John Lewis,

20:51.917 --> 20:56.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who said he didn't view Donald
Trump as a
legitimately elected president
because of

20:56.088 --> 21:01.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Russian interference in the
election,
but then Mr. Trump's coming back
at him and

21:01.494 --> 21:03.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying, you should be doing more
in your own
district.

21:03.996 --> 21:05.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are we to make of all that?

21:05.798 --> 21:08.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And also saying
that he's all
talk, talk, talk, and no action,
which many

21:08.734 --> 21:15.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people took issue with, given
that John Lewis
is a civil rights hero, icon.

21:15.374 --> 21:22.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is the latest instance
of which you
could basically go every single
week for the

21:22.214 --> 21:29.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last year-and-a-half of Donald
Trump taking
a fight, you know, taking an
opportunity to

21:29.855 --> 21:34.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strike back at someone on
Twitter, getting
into a Twitter feud.

21:34.326 --> 21:35.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Last week, it was Meryl Streep.

21:35.828 --> 21:37.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This week, it's John Lewis.

21:37.696 --> 21:42.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many times, he's gotten into
feuds with people
who you would consider to be
people that you

21:42.902 --> 21:46.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wouldn't want to touch, that,
politically,
it's just not worth going there.

21:46.372 --> 21:53.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Donald Trump, you know, he
will not just
sit back and let someone insult
him.

21:53.479 --> 21:58.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the way John Lewis did
insult him really
hit him in a soft spot.

21:58.317 --> 22:04.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan, is there
evidence that
this kind of response on the
part of the president-elect

22:04.190 --> 22:05.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
helps him in some way?

22:05.958 --> 22:09.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Well, it may help
him with his
core supporters who have elected
him maybe

22:09.695 --> 22:14.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in part because he is so
combative, because
he never fails to counterpunch
if he thinks

22:14.366 --> 22:16.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
somebody has taken a punch at
him.

22:16.101 --> 22:21.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there are even some
defenders of John
Lewis who think Donald Trump is
still the

22:21.106 --> 22:24.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
legitimate president -- that's a
very serious
charge to make against someone
who is about

22:24.476 --> 22:30.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to take the oath of office --
but that he
is a figure of such respect, of
such iconic

22:30.316 --> 22:34.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
status in the United States from
the civil
rights struggle, that he was a
particularly

22:34.086 --> 22:36.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inappropriate person to have a
counterpunch.

22:36.055 --> 22:42.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now we have more than two
dozen members
of Congress saying they will
boycott the inauguration

22:42.228 --> 22:43.963 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ceremonies.

22:43.996 --> 22:45.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, sometimes, member of
Congress I think
haven't shown up, because who
would notice

22:45.197 --> 22:46.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if every member of the House was
there?

22:46.966 --> 22:52.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this has now become a
rallying cry and
another sign of the divisions
that Donald

22:52.304 --> 22:54.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump will face when he moves
into the White
House.

22:54.273 --> 22:58.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tamara, how much
should Donald
Trump, who is a Republican --
will be a Republican

22:58.077 --> 23:01.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president, be concerned about
his relationship
with the African-American
community?

23:01.614 --> 23:05.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, after all, this is not a
group of
voters who supported him.

23:05.351 --> 23:06.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Right.

23:06.619 --> 23:08.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And this continues.

23:08.454 --> 23:13.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By about a little more than
two-thirds in
a new Pew poll of
African-Americans say that

23:13.092 --> 23:17.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they do not approve of the job
that Donald
Trump has been doing in his
transition of

23:17.296 --> 23:19.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
explaining his policies or where
he's going.

23:19.665 --> 23:23.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's far worse than he ranks
with white
voters, for instance.

23:23.068 --> 23:24.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, this is a problem.

23:24.637 --> 23:29.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a problem that Donald Trump
has, at least
on some level, tried to address.

23:29.875 --> 23:33.445 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He brought Steve Harvey to Trump
Tower.

23:33.479 --> 23:35.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He talks about wanting to help.

23:35.614 --> 23:39.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But almost always, he focuses
on, well, I
want to help urban centers.

23:39.785 --> 23:44.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to help crime-ridden
urban areas, which
many in the African-American
community have

23:44.657 --> 23:50.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been hearing him say throughout
the campaign,
and hearing it as an insult and
sort of misunderstanding

23:50.262 --> 23:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fact that large numbers of
black people
live in the suburbs, for
instance, and are

23:53.899 --> 23:55.701 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
quite affluent.

23:55.734 --> 23:58.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, today, he
did meet with
the son of Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr., Susan.

23:58.170 --> 23:59.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: He did.

23:59.972 --> 24:03.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, this is -- this
would have
been, I think, the 88th of
Martin Luther King

24:03.142 --> 24:07.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jr., and so a good day to meet
with his son
and to think about some of the
issues that

24:07.980 --> 24:09.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Martin Luther King raised.

24:09.848 --> 24:13.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I want to
turn to something
else that Donald Trump said in
one of the

24:13.085 --> 24:16.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interviews he did over the
weekend with The
Washington Post -- and, Susan, I
will start

24:16.388 --> 24:20.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with you on this -- in which he
said, in so
many words, that he supports --
they were

24:20.225 --> 24:23.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talking about health insurance
and what's
going to happen to Obamacare.

24:23.929 --> 24:27.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he said -- he promised
insurance for everyone.

24:27.533 --> 24:29.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How are we to interpret this?

24:29.368 --> 24:32.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: So, a revelation, I
think, to
all of us, including
congressional Republicans

24:32.237 --> 24:34.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who work on this issue.

24:34.273 --> 24:35.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Health care, what a tough issue.

24:35.507 --> 24:38.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We saw that with the passage of
the Affordable
Care Act.

24:38.510 --> 24:43.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in this interview with The
Washington
Post, Donald Trump said he would
have insurance

24:43.282 --> 24:48.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for everybody, it wouldn't be a
single-payer
system, it would be a great
system and less

24:48.721 --> 24:49.688 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
expensive.

24:49.722 --> 24:52.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, if that's true, that would
be terrific.

24:52.057 --> 24:55.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But people who work in health
care say that
is a really tough thing to do.

24:55.594 --> 25:00.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we think that it's possible
that he is
-- we're moving toward is health
care access

25:00.466 --> 25:01.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for all, not coverage for all.

25:01.867 --> 25:03.736 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Access.

25:03.769 --> 25:05.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Access to all is
something that
Paul Ryan, the House speaker,
has talked about.

25:05.571 --> 25:10.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that would still be an
achievement, but
an easier thing to do than
coverage for all.

25:10.109 --> 25:11.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Tam, I
wanted to ask you.

25:11.944 --> 25:15.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What Susan brought up is that
how does this
square with what Republicans
have been saying

25:15.481 --> 25:17.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they want to do about health
care?

25:17.149 --> 25:18.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Right.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What she said, universal access.

25:19.585 --> 25:21.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a big difference between
coverage
for all and universal access.

25:21.954 --> 25:26.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one thing that Republicans
have talked
about a lot recently is how
President Obama

25:26.091 --> 25:29.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said, if you like your plan, you
can keep
your plan, if you like your
doctor, you can

25:30.028 --> 25:31.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
keep your doctor.

25:31.296 --> 25:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they point out that that
simply proved
not to be true.

25:34.733 --> 25:39.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Donald Trump and his team
are tiptoeing
very close to making promises
that in the

25:39.772 --> 25:44.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not-so-distant future could be
held against
them if it doesn't become a
reality.

25:44.476 --> 25:48.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think lots of people would
love to have
health insurance for everyone.

25:48.347 --> 25:51.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Many people would like to have
health insurance.

25:51.417 --> 25:57.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, Donald Trump also
said that
he had a great plan for knocking
out ISIS,

25:57.890 --> 26:00.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then he never really said
what that plan
was.

26:00.492 --> 26:02.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We will have to see.

26:02.227 --> 26:06.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says he has to wait for Tom
Price, his
health and human services agency
director,

26:06.465 --> 26:11.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be nom -- or to be confirmed,
and then
he says right away that plan
will be clear.

26:11.670 --> 26:13.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I think we have to wait to
see the plan.

26:13.605 --> 26:17.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just finally,
in a few
seconds, Susan, his incoming
health and human

26:17.309 --> 26:22.080 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
services Cabinet
secretary-designate is in
a little bit of hot water right
now.

26:22.114 --> 26:25.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: That's right, a
story that CNN
first reported that he bought
some -- when

26:25.818 --> 26:30.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was a member of Congress last
year, he
bought some stock in a bio-med
company, then

26:30.622 --> 26:35.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a week later introduced some
legislation that
would help that company, and
then got a campaign

26:35.360 --> 26:37.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
contribution from that company.

26:37.329 --> 26:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chuck Schumer , the Senate
Democratic leader,
has called for an investigation
of that.

26:41.066 --> 26:45.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it comes in the wake of a
Wall Street
Journal story last month that
reported about

26:45.337 --> 26:47.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stock trades that Tom Price had
done.

26:47.072 --> 26:48.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, watch this
space.

26:48.073 --> 26:49.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will see where that goes.

26:49.241 --> 26:56.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Susan Page, Tamara Keith, thank
you both.

26:56.281 --> 27:00.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: Thank you.

27:00.752 --> 27:05.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

27:05.290 --> 27:08.327 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

27:08.360 --> 27:13.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
difficult
political task of making Brexit
a reality;

27:13.532 --> 27:20.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plus, when for-profit colleges
leave students
with no degree and a mountain of
debt.

27:20.105 --> 27:26.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: Painful divisions
that many Americans
thought the country had moved
past were brought

27:26.378 --> 27:29.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the surface after the recent
presidential
election.

27:29.781 --> 27:35.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, the Southern Poverty
Law Center has
been keeping a running tab on a
spike in hate

27:35.087 --> 27:37.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
incidents across the country.

27:37.222 --> 27:42.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Duarte
Geraldino reports
tonight from an area outside
Atlanta where

27:42.628 --> 27:48.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lingering racial scars are still
being examined
for lessons on how to move
forward.

27:48.500 --> 27:53.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And a warning: The story
contains some graphic
and offensive language.

27:53.205 --> 27:59.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: In 1987, race
and class
divisions erupted as
African-American leaders

27:59.845 --> 28:04.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and their supporters tried to
march through
Forsyth County, Georgia, an area
just 40 miles

28:04.950 --> 28:05.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
north of Atlanta.

28:05.951 --> 28:06.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTESTERS: Nigger, go home!

28:06.952 --> 28:08.854 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Nigger, go home!

28:08.887 --> 28:12.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OPRAH WINFREY, Host, "The Oprah
Winfrey Show":
Where do the people come from
who were shouting

28:12.691 --> 28:14.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
"Nigger, go home"?

28:14.560 --> 28:18.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: A moment of
extreme division
captured in one of Oprah
Winfrey's first shows.

28:18.964 --> 28:24.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She came to Forsyth after it was
thrust into
the global spotlight because an
unspoken ban

28:24.469 --> 28:30.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on black people was, all at
once, being exposed,
challenged and proudly defended.

28:30.576 --> 28:33.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANK SHIRLEY, Committee to Keep
Forsyth and
Dawson Counties White: My name
is Frank Shirley.

28:33.078 --> 28:36.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am head of the Committee to
Keep Forsyth
Dawson County White.

28:36.114 --> 28:39.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were thousands of white
people that
came out to join our white
people's protest.

28:39.518 --> 28:40.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICK PHILLIPS, Author, "Blood
at the Root:
A Racial Cleansing in America":
First time

28:40.886 --> 28:44.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anyone, including myself, had
seen black faces
in Forsyth County.

28:44.156 --> 28:48.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Yet there were
also whites
in the area, like Patrick
Phillips, who joined

28:48.894 --> 28:51.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
African-Americans to oppose the
ban.

28:51.263 --> 28:52.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was just 17 at the time.

28:52.965 --> 28:56.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICK PHILLIPS: All around me,
all of these
people started chanting "White
power."

28:56.902 --> 29:03.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at that point, I realize
that I had stumbled
my way into the middle of the
Klan's victory

29:03.742 --> 29:05.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
celebration for having stopped
the march.

29:05.844 --> 29:09.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: At that point,
what goes
through your mind?

29:09.948 --> 29:12.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PATRICK PHILLIPS: I was
horrified and kind
of shocked.

29:12.884 --> 29:16.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Phillips says
the march
came at a time when the
community was feeling

29:16.421 --> 29:21.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pressure from what it considered
outsiders,
a time when speaking up against
the racial

29:21.493 --> 29:23.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ban could make you a target.

29:23.362 --> 29:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICK PHILLIPS: I still feel a
little bit
nervous talking about all of
this openly now.

29:28.233 --> 29:31.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: But, lately,
he's been doing
a lot of talking about his
childhood in North

29:31.937 --> 29:36.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Georgia and how his experience
can help all
Americans make sense of today.

29:36.508 --> 29:40.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PATRICK PHILLIPS: What's
happened in the last
couple of months, the ugliness
of the campaign,

29:40.479 --> 29:44.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the racial rhetoric and the
divisiveness,
and I think there are people who
want to interpret

29:44.916 --> 29:48.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that as a kind of wrong turning
in America.

29:48.654 --> 29:54.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think the other way to
interpret it is really
more of a revelation of some
currents that

29:54.226 --> 29:55.994 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have been there all along.

29:56.028 --> 29:58.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Phillips is
the author of
"Blood at the Root: A Racial
Cleansing in

29:58.930 --> 30:00.298 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
America."

30:00.332 --> 30:03.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The book is his way of making
sense of the
place where he grew up.

30:03.335 --> 30:07.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICK PHILLIPS: The story that
I was told,
the myth, was very simple: White
people rose

30:07.773 --> 30:08.740 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

30:08.774 --> 30:10.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They drove out their black
neighbors.

30:10.509 --> 30:13.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were kept out for 100
years, what I now
know as the racial cleansing in
1912.

30:13.779 --> 30:16.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: We followed
his trail of
discovery.

30:16.982 --> 30:22.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It begins here at a cemetery
beside Pleasant
Grove Baptist Church just
outside of Cumming,

30:22.054 --> 30:23.021 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Georgia.

30:23.055 --> 30:24.222 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What is this?

30:24.256 --> 30:25.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PATRICK PHILLIPS: So, this is
the grave of
Mae Crow.

30:26.024 --> 30:29.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She comes into the story of
Forsyth County's
racial cleansing because, on
September 8,

30:29.995 --> 30:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1912, she disappeared in the
woods about a
mile from her house, and all
hell broke loose

30:35.033 --> 30:37.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Forsyth County on the day of
Mae Crow's
funeral.

30:38.003 --> 30:42.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: According to
various accounts,
18-year-old Mae Crow is walking
alone in the

30:42.874 --> 30:47.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
woods when she's struck
repeatedly with a
rock, reportedly sexually
assaulted and left

30:47.979 --> 30:49.748 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for dead.

30:49.781 --> 30:52.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBBIE VERMAAT, Grand Nice of
Mae Crow: She
was hit so hard that her eye was
dislodged

30:52.350 --> 30:55.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from her skull and left hanging.

30:55.153 --> 30:58.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Debbie Vermaat
is Mae Crow's
grand niece.

30:58.990 --> 31:00.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She keeps a portrait of her in
her living
room.

31:00.826 --> 31:04.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBBIE VERMAAT: My grandmother
always said
that she was known to be the
prettiest girl

31:04.763 --> 31:05.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Forsyth County.

31:05.931 --> 31:08.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Word of the
attack spread
quickly.

31:08.500 --> 31:12.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Suspicion soon fell on a group
of young African-Americans.

31:12.237 --> 31:16.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Local media condemned them,
describing them
as the trio as -- quote -- "the
fiendish,

31:16.708 --> 31:19.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
low-browed, gorilla-type
Negroes."

31:19.211 --> 31:23.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Enraged by the news, a mob
immediately lynched
one man.

31:23.315 --> 31:27.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You believe that some of your
distant relatives
took part in this lynching?

31:27.052 --> 31:30.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEBBIE VERMAAT: Yes, some of
them, I am fairly
sure they did.

31:30.756 --> 31:36.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These were the most aggrieved
and grieving
who wanted justice for what had
happened to

31:36.895 --> 31:38.597 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their loved one.

31:38.630 --> 31:42.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Two others,
both teenagers,
were arrested, tried, and
convicted.

31:42.801 --> 31:47.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A prominent doctor volunteered
land near his
home for the court-ordered
execution.

31:47.339 --> 31:50.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An estimated 5,000 people showed
up to watch
the hangings.

31:50.876 --> 31:55.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DEBBIE VERMAAT: Well, my
grandmother would've
been 18 months old sitting in
her mother's

31:55.113 --> 31:56.148 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lap.

31:56.181 --> 31:57.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Watching
someone being lynched.

31:57.816 --> 31:59.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEBBIE VERMAAT: Watching, right.

31:59.584 --> 32:04.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: So, do you
believe that
those three people, the two
teenagers, the

32:04.122 --> 32:06.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one young man in his 20s, do you
believe they
were innocent?

32:06.358 --> 32:08.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEBBIE VERMAAT: I do believe
they were innocent.

32:08.059 --> 32:09.928 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I do believe.

32:09.961 --> 32:13.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I believe it's a huge cold
case that's
still sitting there to try to
figure out exactly

32:13.965 --> 32:15.734 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who did it.

32:15.767 --> 32:19.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Stories like
this were common
in the Jim Crow South, but what
was unique

32:19.504 --> 32:23.909 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in this case is what happened
next.

32:23.942 --> 32:28.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Newspapers of the day describe a
series of
late-night attacks on black
families, a campaign

32:28.079 --> 32:29.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of terror by whites.

32:29.347 --> 32:31.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PATRICK PHILLIPS: The Night
Riders won.

32:31.383 --> 32:32.851 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It worked.

32:32.884 --> 32:34.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They succeeded in their goal of
driving out
the entire black community.

32:34.986 --> 32:38.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: More than
1,000 African-Americans
banished.

32:38.390 --> 32:42.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICK PHILLIPS: They largely
erased all
the signs that that community
had ever been

32:42.627 --> 32:44.095 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

32:44.129 --> 32:46.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At one point, this land belonged
to the black
community of Forsyth County.

32:46.998 --> 32:50.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: But not
everything was erased.

32:50.268 --> 32:55.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Phillips has spent 10 years
looking for physical
evidence of Forsyth's black
community, remains

32:55.607 --> 32:59.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of burned-out churches and lands
from which
African-Americans were driven
off.

32:59.678 --> 33:01.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why is it so difficult to find
all this stuff?

33:01.813 --> 33:04.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PATRICK PHILLIPS: Well, I have a
land lot
number, and that's it.

33:04.850 --> 33:08.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Today, much of
this land
is high-priced real estate, but
when Phillips

33:08.620 --> 33:10.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first came, it was a different
place.

33:10.856 --> 33:14.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICK PHILLIPS: In 1977, when
my family
moved to Forsyth, the place was
changing quite

33:14.993 --> 33:16.761 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a bit.

33:16.795 --> 33:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The completion of Highway 400 in
the mid-1970s
suddenly made Forsyth viable as
a bedroom

33:21.366 --> 33:24.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
community for people, for
professional people
working in Atlanta.

33:24.402 --> 33:27.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Those
newcomers weren't
always welcome, though.

33:27.672 --> 33:32.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the time, fewer than 40,000
people lived
here, and some were willing to
use extreme

33:32.577 --> 33:35.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
measures to protect their way of
life.

33:35.547 --> 33:38.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, more than 200,000 people
live in Forsyth.

33:38.984 --> 33:43.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And thanks to a surge in new
businesses and
high-paying jobs, it's one of
the wealthiest

33:43.688 --> 33:45.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
counties in the nation.

33:45.523 --> 33:52.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PATRICK PHILLIPS: To
successfully erase this
kind of land theft, to ignore
its impact over

33:52.530 --> 33:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
generations is really damaging.

33:55.333 --> 33:57.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Come on up, Duarte.

33:57.235 --> 34:01.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Phillips'
search did turn
up one major marker.

34:01.273 --> 34:05.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remember the home of the wealthy
landowner
who volunteered his backyard for
the public

34:05.610 --> 34:07.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hangings in 1912?

34:07.979 --> 34:13.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been meticulously restored,
and now houses
the local Chamber of Commerce.

34:13.852 --> 34:15.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
James McCoy is the chamber's
CEO.

34:15.687 --> 34:18.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MCCOY, CEO, Forsyth
Chamber of Commerce:
You know, the events in --
particularly in

34:18.490 --> 34:22.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
1987, it was a soul-searching
moment for this
community.

34:22.994 --> 34:25.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Much of that was driven by the
business community.

34:25.497 --> 34:30.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Since 1987,
the Chamber's
membership has evolved, moving
from mostly

34:30.068 --> 34:35.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mom-and-pop businesses to larger
corporations
explicitly bound by the Civil
Rights Act of

34:35.707 --> 34:37.542 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
1964.

34:37.575 --> 34:41.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MCCOY: We went from
probably a little
over 90 percent being
micro-enterprises, one

34:41.279 --> 34:50.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or two employees, to companies
that are more
in the mid-range of business of
anywhere between

34:50.755 --> 34:52.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
25 and 200 employees.

34:52.991 --> 34:58.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: You can
measure just how
far Forsyth has come by the
candidacy of Democrat

34:58.863 --> 35:00.265 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Daniel Blackman.

35:00.298 --> 35:04.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He ran to represent the county
in the Georgia
State Senate.

35:04.402 --> 35:11.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL BLACKMAN, Former Georgia
State Senatorial
Candidate: I didn't win, but we
got 21 percent

35:11.109 --> 35:12.477 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the vote.

35:12.510 --> 35:15.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm almost positive to say
that some white
folks voted for me.

35:15.580 --> 35:21.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the fact that I'm in this
county, and we
were able to run, and I'm a
black candidate,

35:21.419 --> 35:26.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that really speaks
volumes, and it
shows that we are going in the
right direction.

35:26.224 --> 35:31.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Still, less
than 5 percent
of all Forsyth residents are
black.

35:31.363 --> 35:36.201 align:left position:25%,start line:80% size:75%
Yet, unlike many
African-Americans before
him, Blackman is vowing to stay.

35:36.234 --> 35:39.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He owns a strategic
communications business
and is raising his family here.

35:39.971 --> 35:43.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL BLACKMAN: I'm not going
anywhere for
a long time.

35:43.241 --> 35:49.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: But, for
Phillips and Vermaat,
the weight of their Forsyth
roots are too

35:49.080 --> 35:50.048 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
heavy.

35:50.081 --> 35:51.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Both moved up North decades ago.

35:51.883 --> 35:54.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICK PHILLIPS: We were raised
with this
notion that, every day, America
gets a little

35:54.619 --> 35:59.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bit more just, every day, the
wheels of progress
kind of move forward.

35:59.357 --> 36:05.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, in the research, I
learned that
some -- what that leaves out is
that sometimes

36:05.797 --> 36:09.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the gains of one generation are
given back
in the next.

36:09.100 --> 36:11.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEBBIE VERMAAT: Because, down
there, nobody
wanted to talk about it.

36:11.369 --> 36:15.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Vermaat now
lives in the
Philadelphia area and gives
talks to mostly

36:15.206 --> 36:19.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
white groups on the lessons of
her family's
past and what it means for
today.

36:19.844 --> 36:24.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I asked her if she feels the
country has moved
past the kinds of racial
conflict that Forsyth

36:24.949 --> 36:25.917 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
experienced.

36:25.950 --> 36:27.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DEBBIE VERMAAT: No.

36:28.019 --> 36:33.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are still so many places
that are white
enclaves.

36:33.792 --> 36:36.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are still a very segregated
country.

36:36.294 --> 36:40.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Confirming the
reasons Vermaat
was so fearful, the Southern
Poverty Law Center

36:41.032 --> 36:45.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has documented more than 1,000
incidents of
racial intimidation since the
presidential

36:45.703 --> 36:47.172 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

36:47.205 --> 36:57.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Duarte Geraldino
in Forsyth County, Georgia.

36:57.182 --> 37:07.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In London
tomorrow, British
Prime Minister Theresa May will
unveil her

37:08.026 --> 37:13.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plan to follow through with
Brexit, the U.K.'s
decision to leave the European
Union.

37:14.032 --> 37:19.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the mechanics of executing
the move to
get Britain out of the E.U. are
causing tensions

37:19.104 --> 37:23.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inside the British government
and with opponents
who would like to stop it from
happening at

37:23.975 --> 37:25.210 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
all.

37:25.243 --> 37:29.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
From London, special
correspondent Jennifer
Glasse reports.

37:29.114 --> 37:34.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: The only thing
that's really
certain about Brexit is the
uncertainty it's

37:35.019 --> 37:36.721 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
caused.

37:36.754 --> 37:39.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The British government wants to
start the
process by invoking Article 50
by the end

37:39.958 --> 37:41.626 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of March.

37:41.659 --> 37:44.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the clause in the Lisbon
Treaty that
allows states to withdraw from
the E.U.

37:45.029 --> 37:50.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would start the clock on the
two-year deadline
for the U.K. to exit the
European Union.

37:50.301 --> 37:54.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are obstacles in the
government's
way, like John Shaw and Wynne
Edwards.

37:54.339 --> 37:59.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They lead a group of British
expatriates living
in France who want to delay or
defeat Brexit

37:59.644 --> 38:01.412 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
altogether.

38:01.446 --> 38:04.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WYNNE EDWARDS, Opposes Brexit:
It affects
us profusely, because we have
made our lives

38:04.382 --> 38:05.350 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

38:05.383 --> 38:07.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have invested there.

38:07.185 --> 38:11.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if we are made to leave or
if we don't
enjoy the rights there that we
enjoy at the

38:11.289 --> 38:13.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
moment, it would severely affect
us.

38:13.625 --> 38:19.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: The U.N.
estimates 1.2 million
U.K.-born people live in other
E.U. countries,

38:19.797 --> 38:21.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which give them the same rights
as any European.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN SHAW, Opposes Brexit: I
have got a right
to work.

38:23.701 --> 38:25.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have a right to living there
forever.

38:25.503 --> 38:27.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have got a right of owning
property.

38:27.138 --> 38:32.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I got a right of transferring my
property
to my family when I die.

38:32.544 --> 38:35.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have got have a right of use
of health care.

38:35.146 --> 38:41.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of these are rights which
are conferred
on me as a result of living in
the E.U.

38:41.319 --> 38:47.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: But Brexit
would likely end
those rights, so Fair Deal for
Expats and

38:47.125 --> 38:51.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
others have taken their case to
the British
court system to argue that only
Parliament

38:51.896 --> 38:53.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can call for a break with the
E.U.

38:53.831 --> 39:02.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government says the Brexit
referendum
gives it the right to decide how
Britain exits.

39:02.073 --> 39:06.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those from other European
countries living
in the U.K. are also watching
anxiously for

39:06.444 --> 39:08.313 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the results.

39:08.346 --> 39:12.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are so many French here
that London
is called Paris on the Thames,
and is considered

39:12.517 --> 39:15.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the sixth largest city in
France.

39:15.520 --> 39:19.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Patricia Connell, founder of
France in London,
says that's why Parliament
should be the one

39:19.490 --> 39:21.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to decide if and how Brexit
happens.

39:21.893 --> 39:23.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PATRICIA CONNELL, Founder,
France in London:
There should be a discussion.

39:23.695 --> 39:29.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there should be debates in
the House of
Commons about it and how it
should be done.

39:29.100 --> 39:34.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that that is that
point that is
being argued at the moment about
the triggering

39:34.239 --> 39:36.207 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Article 50.

39:36.241 --> 39:43.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Without Parliament debating and
agreeing on
it and without a vote taking
place, then it

39:43.348 --> 39:45.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
shouldn't be triggered.

39:45.183 --> 39:48.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: In November,
the high court
ruled in the opponents' favor,
saying that

39:48.486 --> 39:50.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Parliament indeed should be
involved.

39:50.955 --> 39:54.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now the British government is
appealing to
the Supreme Court.

39:54.692 --> 39:59.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parliament member Anne-Marie
Trevelyan campaigned
in favor of Brexit and says,
just because

39:59.297 --> 40:04.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the popular vote was close, with
52 percent
in favor, doesn't mean it should
be discarded.

40:04.135 --> 40:06.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE-MARIE TREVELYAN, Member of
Parliament:
I wasn't terribly thrilled when
Tony Blair

40:06.838 --> 40:09.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got elected as prime minister,
but I didn't
suddenly call for a second
referendum and

40:09.674 --> 40:11.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
say that the people were wrong.

40:11.142 --> 40:14.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If a majority -- you know, it's
a simple equation.

40:14.145 --> 40:17.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it's a majority decision,
then that's the
decision we go with.

40:17.148 --> 40:18.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's how democracies work.

40:18.916 --> 40:22.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Trevelyan says,
no matter
how the Supreme Court rules,
she's confident

40:22.920 --> 40:26.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the outcome will be the
same, with Britain
eventually leaving the E.U.

40:26.924 --> 40:30.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE-MARIE TREVELYAN: Coming out
of the E.U.
will ensure that we're not stuck
in a very,

40:30.194 --> 40:34.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very sluggish customs union, but
we're able
to be the greatest free trade
nation on Earth

40:34.932 --> 40:36.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
again, which is what so many
people want.

40:36.801 --> 40:41.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you talk to businesses, they
want to be
freed of the regulations and of
the drag pressures

40:41.606 --> 40:44.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that being stuck within the E.U.
trading bloc
creates.

40:44.676 --> 40:49.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: But it's not at
all clear
exactly how businesses would be
affected.

40:49.314 --> 40:53.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
East London's Canary Wharf is
home to some
of the world's largest banks.

40:53.951 --> 40:58.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brexit would likely mean tighter
trading rules
with Europe, and that has some
thinking about

40:58.356 --> 41:00.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
moving out of the U.K.

41:00.792 --> 41:04.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Billions of dollars a day are
traded here,
making London the biggest
financial center

41:04.462 --> 41:05.563 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the world.

41:05.596 --> 41:07.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But Brexit could change that.

41:07.465 --> 41:12.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And cities like Frankfurt, Paris
and Dublin
are all vying for possible
business as banks

41:12.704 --> 41:16.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
consider leaving.

41:16.841 --> 41:22.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Market strategist Mike Ingram
says financial
services in Britain employ about
2.2 million

41:22.513 --> 41:26.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people, accounting for 12
percent of the country's
GDP.

41:26.384 --> 41:28.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That won't be easy to move.

41:28.152 --> 41:32.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE INGRAM, Market Strategist:
But, at the
end of the day, you cannot
deconstruct what

41:32.357 --> 41:37.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is on paper one of the most
important financial
centers in the world overnight.

41:37.729 --> 41:44.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, let's say we go to
Dublin, low tax
rate, they speak English, right
time zone,

41:44.102 --> 41:45.336 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
et cetera.

41:45.370 --> 41:47.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Physically, how do you how do
you decamp that
many people?

41:48.005 --> 41:52.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Wynne Edwards
says an even
more critical concern is the
instability to

41:52.677 --> 41:54.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Europe in general.

41:54.746 --> 41:59.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
World Wars I and II, in fact,
wars going back
to centuries, have set nation
against nation

41:59.951 --> 42:01.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the continent.

42:01.285 --> 42:04.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He worries breaking apart the
union will foster
more strife.

42:04.188 --> 42:08.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WYNNE EDWARDS: I think you need
to cast your
mind back to what's happened in
history.

42:08.459 --> 42:14.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And just, without going into it,
I cannot
believe that anyone wouldn't
want a united

42:14.866 --> 42:16.768 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Europe.

42:16.801 --> 42:19.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE-MARIE TREVELYAN: I would
disagree, that
I think a dangerous Europe is
one where nations

42:19.404 --> 42:27.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feel suffocated by the E.U.
machine, which
is trying to overcome and stop
those individual

42:27.645 --> 42:29.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nations' views of the world.

42:29.547 --> 42:32.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: The Supreme
Court is expected
to rule this month.

42:32.950 --> 42:37.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whatever it decides, Britain
will remain divided
about whether Brexit will
benefit or hurt

42:37.088 --> 42:38.856 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the country.

42:38.890 --> 42:43.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For each side, the clock is
ticking, towards
implementing Brexit, limiting
the upheaval

42:43.261 --> 42:45.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it could cause, or stopping it
altogether.

42:45.963 --> 42:54.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jennifer Glasse
in London.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Student loan debt
is an issue
facing many Americans, and can
take years

43:09.153 --> 43:10.855 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to pay off.

43:10.888 --> 43:15.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In particular, the problems some
students
face at for-profit schools are
getting closer

43:15.293 --> 43:16.661 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
scrutiny.

43:16.694 --> 43:19.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Marketplace's Lizzie O'Leary has
the story.

43:19.197 --> 43:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of our series How the
Deck Is Stacked.

43:22.266 --> 43:27.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's in partnership with
"Frontline" and Marketplace,

for Public Broadcasting.

LIZZIE O'LEARY: Before she
became a mother,
New Yorker Danielle Adorno (ph)
dreamed of

43:32.176 --> 43:34.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
working as a pastry chef.

43:34.045 --> 43:38.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When she came across ads for the
Art Institute
of New York, it seemed like a
great fit.

43:38.950 --> 43:41.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And she says school
administrators promised
her a lot.

43:41.452 --> 43:44.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIELLE LOPEZ, Student Loan
Borrower: They
were very adamant on like their
job placement

43:44.622 --> 43:51.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rates, boasting over like 90
percent job placement,
boasting about their chef
instructors working

43:51.329 --> 43:53.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at Nobu and all these high-end
restaurants.

43:53.998 --> 43:58.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You would think, oh, OK, I'm
going to get
the quality education that I'm
looking for,

43:58.870 --> 44:00.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because that's what it's about,
quality.

44:00.671 --> 44:04.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, I figure, if I'm going
to pay that
much -- that amount of money for
such a short

44:04.275 --> 44:06.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
program, I'm going to be getting
something
out of it.

44:06.644 --> 44:08.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that wasn't what happened.

44:08.279 --> 44:11.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: She claims the
school never
helped her get work in her
field.

44:11.649 --> 44:15.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she says employers don't
value the degree
in the way she thought they
would.

44:15.920 --> 44:18.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's no longer paying her loan
company her
$25,000 debt.

44:18.956 --> 44:22.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIELLE LOPEZ: They don't
deserve a single
penny out of me, because I
didn't get the

44:22.493 --> 44:23.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
education I paid for.

44:23.928 --> 44:26.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: You did sign a
contract when
you took out that money.

44:26.764 --> 44:28.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANIELLE LOPEZ: I did.

44:28.566 --> 44:33.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I also thought if -- I feel
like it stopped
being about education and
started becoming

44:33.237 --> 44:34.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about consumerism.

44:34.839 --> 44:36.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm paying you for a service.

44:36.507 --> 44:37.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I paid you for an education.

44:37.808 --> 44:39.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I paid you to train me.

44:39.510 --> 44:43.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I paid you to give me this 90
percent job
placement rate that you boasted
about.

44:43.114 --> 44:44.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You told me you were going to
place me in
a job.

44:45.016 --> 44:46.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, instead, I got a program
that was shutting
down.

44:46.784 --> 44:51.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: The Art
Institute's parent
company, Education Management
Corporation,

44:51.222 --> 44:53.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was the target of a federal
investigation.

44:53.958 --> 44:58.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Department of Justice officials
say the company
acted as a recruitment mill.

44:58.362 --> 45:02.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It reached a $95.5 million false
claims settlement.

45:02.500 --> 45:04.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there was no determination
of liability.

45:04.669 --> 45:08.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORETTA LYNCH, U.S. Attorney
General: This
kind of abuse hurts not only
taxpayers, but

45:08.639 --> 45:10.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
also the students.

45:10.608 --> 45:14.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: The Art
Institute of New York's
Web site says it is no longer
accepting students.

45:14.979 --> 45:18.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the campus has been put on
probation by
their accreditor.

45:18.816 --> 45:24.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the last few years, the Obama
administration
put many new regulations in
place to address

45:24.055 --> 45:27.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aggressive marketing and job
placement claims
by several for-profit schools.

45:27.892 --> 45:31.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Too many of these for-profit
colleges -- some

45:31.929 --> 45:37.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do a fine job, but many of them
recruit kids
in.

45:37.234 --> 45:40.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The kids don't graduate, but
they're left
with the debt.

45:40.471 --> 45:44.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: Earlier this
month, the Department
of Education released a report
saying many

45:44.742 --> 45:49.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for-profit graduates aren't
earning enough
to reasonably repay their loans.

45:49.847 --> 45:54.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One out of four career training
programs are
at risk of losing their federal
funding.

45:54.719 --> 46:01.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The University of Phoenix has
215,000 students,
the largest for-profit college
in the country.

46:01.092 --> 46:06.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stephen Trimble was 27 years old
when he decided
to take classes at the
University of Phoenix

46:06.263 --> 46:07.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
outside Philadelphia.

46:07.665 --> 46:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN TRIMBLE, Student Loan
Borrower: I
didn't have a degree.

46:09.433 --> 46:16.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I thought that getting one
would allow
me to advance in my career
better, faster.

46:16.173 --> 46:17.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It would allow me to earn more
money.

46:17.942 --> 46:22.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: Trimble took out
a private
loan for $30,000 in 2008 to
study business

46:23.014 --> 46:27.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
management, but dropped out
before finishing,
and then fell behind on his
payments.

46:27.618 --> 46:29.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He says that had a domino
effect.

46:29.553 --> 46:32.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN TRIMBLE: It's decimated
my financial
life.

46:32.990 --> 46:37.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My credit score is probably 150
to 200 points
lower than it should be.

46:37.561 --> 46:40.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I couldn't get a mortgage if I
wanted one.

46:40.898 --> 46:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My house is in my wife's name.

46:42.867 --> 46:46.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: Trimble and
Adorno are part
of the group of Americans who
turned to for-profits

46:46.904 --> 46:48.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
schools during the great
recession.

46:48.706 --> 46:52.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SANDY BAUM, Urban Institute:
There was very
rapid growth in the for-profit
sector, much

46:52.309 --> 46:53.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of it big companies.

46:53.911 --> 46:57.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The University of Phoenix is a
prime example.

46:57.615 --> 47:01.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They signed up all kinds of
people who had
no idea what they were getting
into.

47:01.352 --> 47:03.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, that's a problem.

47:03.187 --> 47:06.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: Finishing school
is a challenge
for many students enrolled in
these kinds

47:06.457 --> 47:10.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of programs, according to Sandy
Baum, a senior
fellow at the Urban Institute.

47:10.294 --> 47:14.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SANDY BAUM: On average, people
who go to for-profit
institutions are much more
likely to borrow,

47:14.365 --> 47:18.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to borrow more, and not to be
able to repay
their loans.

47:18.602 --> 47:24.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's pretty clear from the data
that the crisis
is centered around people who
start college

47:24.508 --> 47:25.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and don't finish.

47:25.576 --> 47:27.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: Trimble is not
alone.

47:27.945 --> 47:34.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The overall graduation rate for
private for-profits
is 27 percent, vs. 58 percent
for public and

47:34.752 --> 47:38.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
65 percent for private nonprofit
schools.

47:38.389 --> 47:43.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The university touts success
stories like
Gail Marquis, former Olympic
athlete and Wall

47:43.594 --> 47:46.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Street banker, profiled here in
this advertisement.

47:46.263 --> 47:51.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAIL MARQUIS, Wall Street
Banker: My schedule
is not a 9:00-to-5:00, but I was
able to balance

47:51.302 --> 47:54.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
my life, my work, and the
schooling.

47:54.472 --> 47:58.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: Like many
for-profits, the
student population at the
University of Phoenix

47:58.676 --> 48:03.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is largely first-generation
college students,
minority, and female.

48:03.447 --> 48:08.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Phoenix declined "PBS
NewsHour"'s interview
request, but suggested we speak
with Steve

48:08.219 --> 48:10.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Delahunty (ph), one of their
satisfied alumni.

48:10.855 --> 48:13.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He graduated with a masters in
technology
management.

48:13.624 --> 48:15.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE DELAHUNTY, University of
Phoenix Graduate:
When you speak about the
standards that the

48:16.026 --> 48:20.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for-profit universities are
looking at, they're
being held to some standards in
terms of return

48:20.264 --> 48:24.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on investment for the federal
dollars that
people are using to go to these
institutions

48:24.301 --> 48:27.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that a state school and a
private school are
not held to.

48:27.505 --> 48:31.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the for-profit's being
judged by the people
and whether or not they're
getting good jobs

48:31.375 --> 48:36.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of that, when, in fact, of
course, with
the tuition at like a private
college is way

48:36.113 --> 48:38.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more expensive than a for-profit
college.

48:38.649 --> 48:42.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: The University
of Phoenix
stands by their educational
model and told

48:42.887 --> 48:47.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"PBS NewsHour" in an e-mail --
quote -- "For
more than 40 years, University
of Phoenix

48:47.858 --> 48:53.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has provided high-quality,
career-relevant
higher education for working
adults, an underserved

48:53.364 --> 48:55.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
segment of Americans."

48:55.499 --> 49:00.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Phoenix also points to
Department of Education
statistics showing the school's
average annual

49:00.171 --> 49:05.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cost is below the national
average for large
private institutions.

49:05.276 --> 49:10.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The school also says the
salaries of its alumni
who had federal financial aid 10
years after

49:10.648 --> 49:14.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
graduation are -- quote --
"above the national
average."

49:14.185 --> 49:20.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the full statement from the
University
of Phoenix, go to the "PBS
NewsHour" Web site,

49:22.259 --> 49:26.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The recent closure of schools
like ITT and
Corinthian means many former
students have

49:26.363 --> 49:29.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been left with debt and few job
prospects.

49:29.600 --> 49:34.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Obama administration
implemented a debt
forgiveness program for students
who believe

49:34.038 --> 49:37.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they were defrauded or that
their schools
violated state law.

49:37.641 --> 49:43.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So far, the Department of
Education has approved
loan discharges of at least
28,000 former

49:43.614 --> 49:45.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Corinthian students.

49:45.583 --> 49:51.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are many other former
for-profit
school students in limbo, like
Danielle Adorno.

49:51.455 --> 49:55.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She applied for loan forgiveness
multiple
times, with no resolution so
far.

49:55.693 --> 49:57.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to have a new
president January
20.

49:58.028 --> 49:59.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you think about that at all?

49:59.530 --> 50:01.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DANIELLE LOPEZ: I don't
anticipate anything
beneficial coming out of it.

50:01.665 --> 50:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He ran a for-profit school
himself.

50:02.967 --> 50:06.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He got sued for his for-profit
school.

50:06.136 --> 50:08.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think he has our best
interests at
heart.

50:08.772 --> 50:12.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIZZIE O'LEARY: President-elect
Trump has
not yet made clear where he
stands on the

50:12.176 --> 50:16.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
matter of for-profit schools or
whether he
would roll back the Obama
administration's

50:16.680 --> 50:18.315 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
policies.

50:18.349 --> 50:21.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That leaves lots of questions
about what may
happen to Adorno and many
others.

50:21.418 --> 50:28.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Lizzie O'Leary
in New York.

50:28.125 --> 50:40.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight:
What we can
learn about life from those
facing death?

50:40.304 --> 50:45.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chaplain Kerry Egan's new book
is called "On
Living" and is the latest
edition in our essay

50:45.576 --> 50:47.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
series In My Humble Opinion.

50:47.711 --> 50:52.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KERRY EGAN, Author, "On Living":
When people
learn that I'm a hospice
chaplain, they usually

50:52.650 --> 50:55.219 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have one of two reactions.

50:55.252 --> 51:00.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They either say they could never
do that job
and change the subject
completely, or they

51:00.524 --> 51:03.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have questions, lots of
questions.

51:03.627 --> 51:07.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the questions I hear more
often than
I would have thought is about
people's last

51:07.498 --> 51:09.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
words.

51:09.266 --> 51:14.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People are enormously curious
about what people
who are actively dying talk
about.

51:14.038 --> 51:16.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Have you ever heard anything
really amazing?

51:16.941 --> 51:20.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's the craziest deathbed
confession you
have ever heard?

51:20.311 --> 51:23.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Should I plan out my last words?

51:23.347 --> 51:28.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That last question seemed really
odd to me
the first time someone asked,
but I have been

51:28.118 --> 51:33.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
asked it at least a dozen times,
so it's obviously
on some people's minds.

51:33.457 --> 51:38.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The questions don't actually
match up with
what typically happens when
someone is dying.

51:38.062 --> 51:44.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, I suspect they're
coming from a sort
of Hollywood movie or television
idea of what

51:44.501 --> 51:52.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dying should be like, clean,
calm, bizarrely
romantic, always with the good
sense to close

51:52.376 --> 51:59.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your eyes before taking a long
sigh and limply
tossing your head to the side,
and beautiful,

51:59.817 --> 52:02.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
urgent, life-altering
utterances.

52:02.553 --> 52:09.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if this is what you think
happens in death,
I can see how you would feel a
lot of pressure

52:09.360 --> 52:12.096 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to get it right.

52:12.129 --> 52:17.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When someone asks me if they
should plan their
last words, the short answer is:
No.

52:17.968 --> 52:21.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People who are dying are often
unconscious
for days before they die.

52:21.205 --> 52:22.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Sometimes, they're in pain.

52:22.906 --> 52:24.808 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're often highly medicated.

52:24.842 --> 52:32.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Honestly, most of the last words
I have heard
are so mundane, I can't even
give an example.

52:32.316 --> 52:36.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When you know you have a
terminal diagnosis,
death often takes a person by
surprise.

52:36.987 --> 52:42.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You might not even know that
your last words
are your last words.

52:42.159 --> 52:46.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there's a longer, more
complex answer
too.

52:46.063 --> 52:50.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If you had something so
important to tell
your loved ones that you feel
the need to

52:50.401 --> 52:55.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plan out what to say, then why
would you wait
to say it?

52:55.773 --> 53:02.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it's so important that you're
worried about
it now, then say it now.

53:02.146 --> 53:04.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Ask for forgiveness now.

53:04.748 --> 53:07.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Say you love someone now.

53:07.151 --> 53:11.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Share whatever wisdom you have
with the world
right now.

53:11.822 --> 53:13.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's the thing.

53:13.957 --> 53:20.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When people ask me about dying
words, what
they're really asking is, what
is so important

53:20.998 --> 53:26.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this life that it should be
the very last
thing we talk about?

53:26.136 --> 53:33.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, instead of asking, what do
other people
talk about, ask yourself, what
do I really

53:33.410 --> 53:37.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
want to talk about now?

53:37.181 --> 53:40.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's a really good
question.

53:40.084 --> 53:42.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's a really good thing to
ponder.

53:42.252 --> 53:45.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A lot to think
about there.

media site Instagram is trying
out a new tool

53:55.466 --> 54:00.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to help users at risk of
self-harm and eating
disorders.

54:00.270 --> 54:03.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Will it influence the future of
mental health
treatment?
