JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally
tonight: an inside look at the
relationship and the political

00:03.933 --> 00:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
partnership between President
Trump and his controversial
adviser Steve Bannon.

00:10.800 --> 00:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Joshua Green's new book,
"Devil's Bargain: Steve Bannon,
Donald Trump, and the Storming

00:16.233 --> 00:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the Presidency," he examines
how Bannon became a prominent
nationalist conservative

00:22.133 --> 00:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voice that helped create
one of the biggest upsets
in American politics.

00:27.600 --> 00:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Green is also a senior national
correspondent for Bloomberg
Businessweek, and he joins me

00:30.633 --> 00:31.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

00:31.633 --> 00:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to the "NewsHour."

00:33.733 --> 00:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSHUA GREEN, Author, "Devil's
Bargain: Steve Bannon, Donald
Trump, and the Storming of

00:34.700 --> 00:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Presidency": Thank you.

00:37.333 --> 00:38.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Josh
Green, you start the book
out saying Donald Trump
wouldn't be president

00:38.300 --> 00:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
if it weren't for Steve Bannon.

00:39.566 --> 00:41.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In a nutshell, who
is Steve Bannon?

00:41.733 --> 00:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSHUA GREEN: Bannon is
a guy who is very much an
outsider like Donald Trump is.

00:45.433 --> 00:49.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And although he doesn't come
from money -- he was raised in
a blue-collar Navy family in

00:49.966 --> 00:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Richmond, Virginia -- he has
the same basic outlook toward
life and toward elites that

00:55.733 --> 00:57.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump developed.

00:57.500 --> 01:01.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Bannon has a very
unusual background.

01:01.166 --> 01:02.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He joined the Navy.

01:02.933 --> 01:05.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He went from the Navy to
Harvard Business School.

01:05.533 --> 01:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He talked his way into a
job with Goldman Sachs as an
investment banker in the 1980s,

01:13.033 --> 01:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and moved from there to
Hollywood film financing,
and eventually became a
conservative documentarian,

01:18.966 --> 01:23.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
met the late conservative
provocateur Andrew
Breitbart, and wound up
in charge of Breitbart

01:23.833 --> 01:25.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
News, the right-wing news site.

01:25.666 --> 01:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what
brings these two men together?

01:29.133 --> 01:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are they the ideological,
philosophically similar
people some might think?

01:37.166 --> 01:39.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What is the magic that
brings them together?

01:39.200 --> 01:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSHUA GREEN: I think the magic
that brings them together is
that they have the same basic

01:42.766 --> 01:44.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
political outlook.

01:44.900 --> 01:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you look at Trump and what
he said about politics going
all the way back to the 1980s,

01:48.233 --> 01:50.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there have been several
clear populist themes.

01:50.733 --> 01:52.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He is against free trade.

01:52.800 --> 01:56.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He thinks the U.S. is
getting taken advantage
of by foreign governments.

01:56.966 --> 02:01.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Bannon's populism is
very much the same, but
he adds the element of
immigration, hostility

02:04.266 --> 02:06.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to immigrants, both
legal and illegal.

02:06.333 --> 02:11.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when Bannon met Trump in
2011 and began tutoring him
on politics, that was the idea

02:12.400 --> 02:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that he really put forward.

02:14.500 --> 02:18.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And if you look at the
politician Donald Trump
became, it's very much
a reflection of Steve

02:19.766 --> 02:21.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Bannon's politics.

02:21.800 --> 02:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is this -- so,
is this something that's driven
by being against outsiders?

02:25.433 --> 02:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOSHUA GREEN: It really is.

02:27.933 --> 02:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's driven by the idea that
the country is in decline and
needs to fundamentally return

02:34.933 --> 02:38.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to an earlier time, when people
like Steve Bannon were at the
heart of the American economy

02:41.133 --> 02:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and American story, so the
1950s, when you had a strong
manufacturing base, when there

02:48.100 --> 02:52.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were -- it was clear, the
forces of good and evil in the
world, communism vs. democracy.

02:54.066 --> 02:57.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both Trump and Bannon don't
like the rise of the younger,
multiethnic generations of

03:01.100 --> 03:05.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Americans that the Obama
coalition reflected,
and are doing everything
they can to fight

03:05.100 --> 03:07.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
against it.

03:07.133 --> 03:10.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, speaking
of that, what we have read
about Steve Bannon, Breitbart,

03:10.366 --> 03:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
elements of racism, the
so-called alt-right movement,
even anti-Semitism, how much of

03:18.500 --> 03:19.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that is a strain here?

03:19.866 --> 03:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOSHUA GREEN: It's a big strain.

03:21.966 --> 03:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one of the effects that
Bannon had on politics was to
open up a kind of sluice gate

03:28.233 --> 03:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of people who existed really
only on the fringes of American
and far-right talk radio and on

03:35.200 --> 03:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Internet boards and try and
bring them into the political
conversation, the mainstream

03:39.866 --> 03:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
political conversation,
by giving them a voice on
places like Breitbart News.

03:44.533 --> 03:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what Bannon thought he
was doing was marshaling
these hidden political
forces to go up against

03:52.766 --> 03:57.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
not Democrats, but the
establishment Republican
leaders, people like
Mitch McConnell, Paul

04:00.266 --> 04:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ryan and, before him,
House Speaker John Boehner,
who was Bannon's original
target and was forced

04:05.733 --> 04:09.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to resign in 2015, in
part because of the
energies that Bannon and
Breitbart News unleashed

04:11.100 --> 04:13.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Washington politics.

04:13.566 --> 04:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: OK,
on just as straight a
measurement as you can, how
successful has Steve Bannon

04:18.500 --> 04:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been in getting his ideas
across in this administration?

04:20.933 --> 04:25.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOSHUA GREEN: Well, it
would be hard to argue
that Bannon hasn't been
shockingly successful

04:26.400 --> 04:28.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
overall.

04:28.500 --> 04:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you go back three years --
and I tell this story in the
book -- Steve Bannon was very

04:31.633 --> 04:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
closely allied with Jeff
Sessions, who, at the time, was
the populist Republican senator

04:37.233 --> 04:39.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from Alabama.

04:39.766 --> 04:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Bannon tried to talk
Sessions into running for
president, not because
he thought he could

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
win, but because he
thought Sessions could
elevate the issues of
immigration and antipathy

04:50.100 --> 04:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to free trade to the top
of the Republican agenda.

04:53.633 --> 04:56.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Sessions ultimately
decided not to do that.

04:56.366 --> 05:01.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But by linking up with Donald
Trump, Bannon was able to not
only get that on top of the

05:03.366 --> 05:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican agenda, but make
it all the way into the White
House and have real power to

05:06.433 --> 05:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
enact some of these policies,
in a way that he never did
as a conservative publisher.

05:10.933 --> 05:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is Bannon
involved in the Russian probe?

05:13.900 --> 05:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOSHUA GREEN: So far, he seems
not to be directly implicated.

05:17.733 --> 05:22.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I know he hasn't hired
a lawyer, as many people
in the Trump family and
the Trump administration

05:22.133 --> 05:25.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have to defend them against
potential investigation.

05:25.400 --> 05:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, as far as we know,
Bannon is not yet implicated
in the Russia scandal.

05:29.733 --> 05:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you have
reported, I know, in, I guess,
language that we can't use here,

05:33.733 --> 05:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Bannon is interested
in smearing Robert
Mueller as much as he can.

05:40.666 --> 05:43.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSHUA GREEN: Well, if you look
at what Steve Bannon really
does for Donald Trump, going

05:43.566 --> 05:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all the way back to
the beginning of their
relationship, it isn't
that he's a Machiavellian

05:47.733 --> 05:49.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
figure, as he's been portrayed.

05:49.766 --> 05:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's that Steve Bannon is the
guy who goes out and attacks
Trump's critics and his enemies,

05:56.200 --> 05:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether that's someone like
Megyn Kelly at FOX News, or the
mainstream media after Trump's

06:01.166 --> 06:04.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
"Access Hollywood" tape
was released on the
eve of the debates.

06:04.100 --> 06:09.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Right now, Trump feels
like he needs someone
aggressively defending
him in the Russia probe.

06:11.166 --> 06:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he wasn't happy with the
way that his own White House
spokespeople were doing the

06:14.366 --> 06:16.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
job.

06:16.433 --> 06:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: If you look at
the polls right now, in -- I
guess, in large part, Donald

06:19.666 --> 06:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump seems to be holding
on to his base, but there is
some evidence of slippage.

06:23.566 --> 06:28.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And you have got, what,
40 percent of Americans
with a strong opposition
to Donald Trump.

06:30.033 --> 06:32.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If it continues this way, does
Steve Bannon stay where he is?

06:32.466 --> 06:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSHUA GREEN: I think it does,
because Bannon and Trump both
seem to believe that it is

06:37.233 --> 06:42.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
absolutely vital to keep
Trump's base angry and
riled up and active.

06:44.600 --> 06:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there is some pretty
interesting polling data to
indicate that that's working.

06:48.633 --> 06:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Washington Post/ABC had a
poll that came out this week
saying that only 9 percent of

06:55.566 --> 06:58.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans thought that
the Russia collusion
posed any sort of problem.

06:58.200 --> 07:02.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, to me, that's an
indication that Bannon's
methods are working.

07:02.533 --> 07:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And while he hasn't gotten
Trump anywhere near a majority
of popular support, he has

07:07.333 --> 07:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
managed to maintain that
critical 40 percent base that
Trump is going to rely on.

07:14.266 --> 07:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Josh Green,
nobody else has gotten this
deep a look at Steve Bannon.

07:18.166 --> 07:20.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, thank you very much.

07:20.266 --> 07:24.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Devil's Bargain" is the book,
"Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, and
the Storming of the Presidency."

07:24.200 --> 07:25.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

07:25.433 --> 07:25.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOSHUA GREEN: Thanks
so much for having me.
