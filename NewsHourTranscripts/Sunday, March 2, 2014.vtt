09:29.500 --> 09:31.067
>> SO WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS FOR

09:31.067 --> 09:32.133
THE U.S. HERE?

09:32.133 --> 09:33.500
>> ZERO.

09:33.500 --> 09:33.700
ZERO

09:33.700 --> 09:36.067
UNLESS WE WANT TO GO TO WAR.

09:36.067 --> 09:37.900
PUTIN HOLDS ALL THE CARDS, FOR

09:37.900 --> 09:39.333
BETTER OR FOR WORSE.

09:39.333 --> 09:41.300
HE HOLDS THE MILITARY CARD

09:41.300 --> 09:43.067
BECAUSE IT'S HIS TERRITORY

09:43.067 --> 09:45.333
HE HOLDS POLITICAL CARDS BECAUSE

09:45.333 --> 09:47.133
A VERY LARGE PART OF UKRAINE

09:47.133 --> 09:49.333
SUPPORTS PUTIN, NOT THE WEST

09:49.333 --> 09:50.600
HE HOLDS ECONOMIC CARDS BECAUS

09:50.600 --> 09:54.233
UKRAINE IS PART OF THE RUSSIAN

09:54.233 --> 09:54.833
ECONOMY.

09:54.833 --> 09:56.033
LEGALLY, YOU'LL HAVE TO ASK

09:56.033 --> 09:57.233
LAWYER, THERE IS A QUESTIO

09:57.233 --> 09:59.767
WHETHER THE RUSSIANS ARE RIGHT

09:59.767 --> 10:02.667
IS THE GOVERNMENT IN KIEV, WHICH

10:02.667 --> 10:05.333
OVERTHREW TEN DAYS AGO THE

10:05.333 --> 10:07.733
CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER IN KIEV AND

10:07.733 --> 10:10.500
THREW OUT THE ELECTED PRESIDENT.

10:10.500 --> 10:13.700
IS IT A LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT?

10:13.700 --> 10:16.367
PUTIN SAYS IT'S LEGITIMATE

10:16.367 --> 10:18.900
WE HAVEN'T RECOGNIZED IT YET BUT

10:18.900 --> 10:19.900
HE SAYS LEGITIMATE

10:19.900 --> 10:20.667
ONI DON'T KNOW WHAT A LAWYER

10:20.667 --> 10:21.133
WOULD SAY.

10:21.133 --> 10:23.167
>> ARE WE FOLLOWING THE PATH I

10:23.167 --> 10:24.267
2008, RUSSIA AND GEORGIA, WHER

10:24.267 --> 10:26.467
THIS ESCALATED INTO AN ALL-OUT

10:26.467 --> 10:27.533
WAR FOR A FEW DAYS

10:27.533 --> 10:28.633
>> THERE IS A SIMILARITY

10:28.633 --> 10:30.500
IN THE SENSE THAT, TOO, IS A RED

10:30.500 --> 10:32.900
LINE, THE FORMER SOVIET REPUBLIC

10:32.900 --> 10:33.567
OF GEORGIA

10:33.567 --> 10:34.700
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THERE

10:34.700 --> 10:36.767
FIRST OF ALL, IT WAS OF MUCH

10:36.767 --> 10:38.767
LESSER IMPORTANCE TO RUSSIA THAN

10:38.767 --> 10:39.933
UKRAINE, BECAUSE OF ITS LOCATION

10:39.933 --> 10:41.300
AND ITS SIZE

10:41.300 --> 10:43.133
SECONDLY, EVEN THOUGH WE ALWAY

10:43.133 --> 10:48.000
SAY THAT RUSSIA, PUTIN INVAD

10:48.000 --> 10:50.700
GEORGIA, THE FACT IS THE WAR WAS

10:50.700 --> 10:52.867
BEGUN BY THE AMERICAN BACKED

10:52.867 --> 10:55.000
MILITARY FORCES IN GEORGIA

10:55.000 --> 10:57.067
BECAUSE THEY ATTACKED RUSSIA

10:57.067 --> 10:58.167
ENCLAVES IN GEORGIA.

10:58.167 --> 10:59.833
TODAY NOBODY IS FIRING A SHOT.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.233
IF NOBODY FIRES A SHOT, THERE'

11:01.233 --> 11:01.800
A WAY OUT.

11:01.800 --> 11:04.267
THERE IS A WORSE SCENARIO.

11:04.267 --> 11:06.500
THAT IS THE RUSSIANS THINK THE

11:06.500 --> 11:08.567
HAVE TO MOVE THEIR TROOPS NO

11:08.567 --> 11:10.633
ONLY INTO CRIMEA, PENINSULA WITH

11:10.633 --> 11:12.233
NAVAL BASES AND HISTORICALLY

11:12.233 --> 11:15.000
PART OF RUSSIA BUT EASTERN AND

11:15.000 --> 11:16.833
SOUTHERN UKRAINE GENERALLY, IN

11:16.833 --> 11:19.433
WHICH CASE ENORMOUS PRESSURE FOR

11:19.433 --> 11:20.867
NATO TO MOVE INTO WESTER

11:20.867 --> 11:23.000
UKRAINE AND THEN ALL BETS AR

11:23.000 --> 11:23.567
OFF.

11:23.567 --> 11:27.867
>> WOULD THE CAPABILITY OR

11:27.867 --> 11:31.633
CAPACITY OF UKRAINIAN ARM, WHERE

11:31.633 --> 11:33.033
DO THEY LIE?

11:33.033 --> 11:35.700
>> THE ARMY, AS MUCH AS IT IS,

11:35.700 --> 11:37.733
30,000 TROOPS, IS ETHNICALLY

11:37.733 --> 11:38.100
RUSSIAN.

11:38.100 --> 11:39.900
WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY WOUL

11:39.900 --> 11:41.533
FOLLOW KIEV'S ORDERS F THERE WAS

11:41.533 --> 11:43.367
A WAR, LITERALLY EVEN IF WE'RE

11:43.367 --> 11:45.233
NOT RELIGIOUS, WE NEED TO PRAY

11:45.233 --> 11:46.667
THERE'S NOT A WAR.

11:46.667 --> 11:48.300
THIS WOULD BE A TURNING POINT IN

11:48.300 --> 11:50.033
HISTORY.

11:50.033 --> 11:51.900
IF THERE'S A WAR, UKRAINIANS

11:51.900 --> 11:53.900
WOULD SUPPORT KIEV AND WES

11:53.900 --> 11:55.333
WOULD BECOME PART OF THE

11:55.333 --> 11:55.600
FIGHTERS

11:55.600 --> 11:57.267
THEY DON'T HAVE AN ARMY THAT CAN

11:57.267 --> 11:57.467
FIGHT.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.067
THAT WOULD BE AS BLOODY AS

11:59.067 --> 11:59.300
ANYTHING

11:59.300 --> 12:01.567
IT WILL BE A CIVIL WAR

12:01.567 --> 12:03.433
ANCIENT HATE REDS, TOMBSTONE

12:03.433 --> 12:07.733
WILL BE KICKED OVER AS THEY SAY.

12:07.733 --> 12:11.000
ANCIENT HATE REDS WOULD ROME THE

12:11.000 --> 12:14.233
LAND FOR YEARS AND YEARS

12:14.233 --> 12:15.433
>> YOU'VE STUDIED RUSSIA

12:15.433 --> 12:15.533
RELATIONS.

12:15.533 --> 12:18.600
HOW BAD IS THIS NOW?

12:18.600 --> 12:24.500
>> I THINK WE HAVE SEEN TH

12:24.500 --> 12:25.967
DECENT OF RUSSIA DIVIDE, THE

12:25.967 --> 12:26.700
RUSSIAN BOERSD

12:26.700 --> 12:27.933
CAN IT END THERE

12:27.933 --> 12:28.900
I THINK IT DEPENDS WHETHER THE

12:28.900 --> 12:31.167
WEST NOW RISES TO LEADERSHIP AND

12:31.167 --> 12:32.467
GIVES PUTIN GUARANTEES HE NEED

12:32.467 --> 12:33.300
TO BACK OFF.

12:33.300 --> 12:34.700
NOW IN AMERICA THERE'S A

12:34.700 --> 12:35.567
DIFFERENT VIEW

12:35.567 --> 12:36.967
HAS HE TO BACK OFF FIRST

12:36.967 --> 12:38.867

16:08.267 --> 16:09.567
BEEN HANGING OUT THERE

IT DOESN'T GET AS MUCH ATTENTION

16:10.967 --> 16:12.567
IN THE PRESS AS IT USED TO BUT

16:12.567 --> 16:13.467
STILL THERE.

16:13.467 --> 16:14.933
BASICALLY BY THE END OF APRIL,

16:14.933 --> 16:16.433
APRIL 30th WAS THE ORIGINA

HE WAS JUST DESCRIBING WHAT WA

17:19.200 --> 17:19.900
GOING ON

17:19.900 --> 17:21.600
HE WASN'T THREATENING.

17:21.600 --> 17:24.633
BUT THERE WAS REAL PUSHBACK BY

17:24.633 --> 17:25.967
THE PRIME MINISTER AND A NUMBE

17:25.967 --> 17:28.733
OF VERY CONSERVATIVE POLITICIANS

17:28.733 --> 17:29.167
IN ISRAEL.

17:29.167 --> 17:31.267
SO I THINK IT JUST SHOWS HOW
