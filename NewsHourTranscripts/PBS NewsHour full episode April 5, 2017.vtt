JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.239 --> 00:06.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.108 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.141 --> 00:11.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
My attitude toward Syria and
Assad has changed

00:11.812 --> 00:13.580 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very much.

00:13.614 --> 00:17.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As the death toll
in Syria's
chemical attack rises, President
Trump appears

00:17.784 --> 00:21.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to take a harder line against
the Assad regime.

00:21.188 --> 00:28.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: a closer look at the FBI's
investigation
into 2016 presidential
election-related links

00:28.896 --> 00:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Russia, and what they mean
for the new
administration.

00:33.467 --> 00:39.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And how ticks on rampant deer
populations
are contributing to the spread
of Lyme disease,

00:39.473 --> 00:44.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and leaving communities with few
options to
combat a growing ecological
threat.

00:44.378 --> 00:48.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAM TELFORD, Tufts University:
If I were to
be here 20 years ago at the
check station,

00:48.615 --> 00:53.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at this check station, I could
look all day
and maybe find two or three
ticks.

00:53.053 --> 00:58.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, in the course of two hours,
we have gotten
probably 50 ticks off a deer.

00:58.592 --> 01:06.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:06.233 --> 01:09.002 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:09.036 --> 01:19.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This week's
chemical attack
in Northern Syria has now
claimed 75 lives,

01:19.846 --> 01:22.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and it may trigger a shift in
U.S. policy.

01:22.849 --> 01:27.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president today voiced his
outrage and
threatened a tougher approach.

01:27.254 --> 01:29.022 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage.

01:29.056 --> 01:34.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
These heinous actions by the
Assad regime

01:34.061 --> 01:35.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cannot be tolerated.

01:35.862 --> 01:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: At a Rose Garden news
conference
with King Abdullah of Jordan,
President Trump

01:39.967 --> 01:42.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
condemned the attack as an
affront to humanity.

01:42.703 --> 01:51.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: When you kill
innocent children,
innocent babies, babies, little
babies, with

01:51.912 --> 01:59.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a chemical gas that is so
lethal, and people
were shocked to hear what gas it
was, that

01:59.186 --> 02:03.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crosses many, many lines, beyond
a red lines,
many, many lines.

02:03.223 --> 02:09.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I will tell you, it's
already happened,
that my attitude toward Syria
and Assad has

02:09.296 --> 02:11.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
changed very much.

02:11.131 --> 02:15.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Administration
officials had been
saying that removing Syrian
President Bashar

02:15.102 --> 02:18.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
al-Assad was no longer a
fundamental option.

02:18.872 --> 02:23.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, today, Mr. Trump didn't
seem to rule
anything out.

02:23.143 --> 02:28.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, you seemed to be
reluctant to get
involved or to intervene in
Syria directly.

02:28.915 --> 02:31.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that one thing that's changed
after yesterday?

02:31.184 --> 02:36.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Militarily, I
don't like to
say where I'm going and what I'm
doing.

02:36.423 --> 02:38.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I'm not saying I'm doing
anything, one way
or the other.

02:38.992 --> 02:43.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The U.N. Security
Council held
an emergency session, but took
no action.

02:43.730 --> 02:48.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley
warned that the
United States will act if no one
else does.

02:48.969 --> 02:52.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NIKKI HALEY, U.S. Ambassador to
the United
Nations: When the United Nations
consistently

02:52.072 --> 02:59.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
fails in its duty to act
collectively, there
are times in the life of states
that we are

02:59.179 --> 03:02.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
compelled to take our own
action.

03:02.482 --> 03:08.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The Syrians continued
to deny they
launch any chemical attack, and
its ally Russia

03:08.422 --> 03:11.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
called the reports fake
information.

03:11.091 --> 03:14.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Haley charged that Moscow
especially has made
an unconscionable choice.

03:14.961 --> 03:18.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NIKKI HALEY: They chose to close
their eyes
to the barbarity.

03:18.465 --> 03:21.268 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They defied the conscience of
the world.

03:21.301 --> 03:26.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How many more children have to
die before
Russia cares?

03:26.206 --> 03:30.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Meanwhile, victims of
the attack
continued to pour into hospitals
in Syria's

03:30.944 --> 03:33.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Idlib province and in nearby
Turkey.

03:33.580 --> 03:38.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
There was a lot
of smoke, and there was a smell.

03:38.351 --> 03:40.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was very difficult to breath.

03:40.353 --> 03:41.922 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We couldn't breathe anymore.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We just couldn't breathe
anymore.

03:43.857 --> 03:49.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The World Health
Organization said
the symptoms are consistent with
a nerve agent.

03:49.196 --> 03:53.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Doctors Without Borders said it
could have
been sarin, the same agent used
in a deadly

03:53.900 --> 03:58.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
2013 attack outside Damascus.

03:58.438 --> 04:02.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both today and yesterday,
President Trump
was highly critical of Barack
Obama, saying

04:02.809 --> 04:08.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he failed to deal with
Assad by backing
off the threat of military
force.

04:08.415 --> 04:13.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now President Trump says the
responsibility
of dealing with Assad is his --
Judy.

04:13.753 --> 04:16.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you, John,
at the White
House.

04:16.323 --> 04:21.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the day's other news:
President Trump
removed his chief strategist,
Steve Bannon,

04:21.194 --> 04:23.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
from his position on the
National Security
Council.

04:23.363 --> 04:29.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The appointment of the former
head of Breitbart
News after the inauguration had
drawn criticism.

04:29.503 --> 04:36.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Bannon said his job was
to -- quote
-- "de-operationalize the NSC"
after the Obama

04:36.810 --> 04:38.512 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

04:38.545 --> 04:42.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He said the new national
security adviser,
H.R. McMaster, has returned the
council to

04:42.115 --> 04:44.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
its proper function.

04:44.351 --> 04:49.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president now says former
National Security
Adviser Susan Rice may have
committed a crime.

04:49.656 --> 04:55.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has been reported that Rice
sought and
leaked identities of Trump
transition aides

04:55.428 --> 04:57.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
caught up in surveillance.

04:57.364 --> 04:59.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She denies any wrongdoing.

04:59.366 --> 05:03.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the president told The New
York Times
that he thinks Rice broke the
law.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He provided no evidence.

05:05.872 --> 05:12.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also defended FOX News' Bill
O'Reilly against
allegations of sexual
harassment, and said

05:12.112 --> 05:16.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- quote -- "I don't think Bill
did anything
wrong."

05:16.216 --> 05:21.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Korea test-fired another
missile early
today, and U.S. defense
officials say it ended

05:21.821 --> 05:28.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a fiery crash at sea, this
one day before
President Trump and China's
president meet.

05:28.261 --> 05:32.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It also followed Mr. Trump's
warning that
-- quote -- "If China is not
going to solve

05:32.832 --> 05:34.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
North Korea, we will."

05:35.001 --> 05:39.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Chinese Foreign Ministry had
this response
today to the North's latest
launch:

05:39.339 --> 05:42.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HUA CHUNYING, Spokeswoman,
Chinese Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (through
translator): China

05:43.009 --> 05:45.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has noticed the relevant report.

05:45.145 --> 05:50.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We believe that under the
current situation,
all relevant parties should
maintain restraint

05:50.217 --> 05:52.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and not do anything that will
add to tensions
in the region.

05:52.919 --> 05:57.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. response
came from
Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson.

05:57.791 --> 06:02.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a terse statement, he said:
"The United
States has spoken enough about
North Korea.

06:02.996 --> 06:05.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have no further comment."

06:05.465 --> 06:10.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Iraq, Islamic State attackers
killed at
least 31 people overnight in the
northern

06:10.337 --> 06:11.738 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
city of Tikrit.

06:11.771 --> 06:15.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The militants wore police
uniforms and targeted
police forces.

06:15.842 --> 06:18.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When they ran out of bullets,
they blew themselves
up.

06:18.545 --> 06:21.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
More than 40 people were
wounded.

06:21.348 --> 06:27.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lawmakers in Malaysia today
approved a law
on sex crimes against children,
but balked

06:27.354 --> 06:29.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at banning child marriage.

06:29.723 --> 06:35.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
During the debate, one
legislator declared
that girls as young as 9 are --
quote -- "physically

06:35.228 --> 06:37.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and spiritually ready to marry."

06:37.964 --> 06:44.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The mostly-Muslim nation allows
girls younger
than 16 to marry if their
parents and Islamic

06:44.571 --> 06:46.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
courts permit it.

06:46.539 --> 06:51.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, Secretary
of Homeland
Security John Kelly softened his
stance today

06:51.945 --> 06:57.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on separating parents and
children who cross
the border from Mexico
illegally.

06:57.284 --> 07:02.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had said previously that he
was considering
that step as a deterrent, but at
a Senate

07:02.756 --> 07:07.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hearing today, North Dakota
Democrat Heidi
Heitkamp pressed Kelly on the
issue.

07:07.394 --> 07:09.162 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

07:09.195 --> 07:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEIDI HEITKAMP (D), North
Dakota: There's
been reports that you're
considering separating

07:13.566 --> 07:15.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mothers and children at the
border?

07:15.468 --> 07:20.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KELLY, U.S. Homeland
Security Secretary:
Only if the situation at that
point in time

07:20.440 --> 07:27.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
requires it, you know, if the
mother is sick
or addicted to drugs or
whatever.

07:27.247 --> 07:29.049 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

07:29.082 --> 07:32.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEIDI HEITKAMP: So if you
thought the child
was in danger, that's the only
circumstance

07:32.619 --> 07:33.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in which you would separate?

07:33.620 --> 07:35.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN KELLY: Can't imagine doing
it otherwise.

07:35.655 --> 07:41.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kelly also
reported that apprehensions
at the border fell sharply in
March, to the

07:41.161 --> 07:43.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lowest number in 17 years.

07:44.030 --> 07:50.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street today, the
Dow Jones industrial
average lost 41 points to close
at 20648.

07:50.503 --> 07:55.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 34, and the S&amp;P
500 slipped
seven.

07:55.542 --> 08:00.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
President
Trump's next possible moves in
Syria; how

08:00.347 --> 08:07.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the FBI has historically handled
politically
charged cases such as the Russia
investigation;

08:07.454 --> 08:16.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
senators debate the Supreme
Court nominee;
and much more.

08:16.830 --> 08:27.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As we reported earlier,
President Trump said
that the chemical weapons attack
yesterday

08:27.207 --> 08:30.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Syria has crossed many lines
for him.

08:30.910 --> 08:35.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what options could the
president pursue
in the six-year civil war?

08:35.648 --> 08:41.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm joined now by two experts
with deep experience
in military strategy and
planning.

08:41.354 --> 08:47.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Andrew Exum was a deputy
assistant secretary
of defense for Middle East
policy in the Obama

08:47.260 --> 08:48.528 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration.

08:48.561 --> 08:51.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's now a contributing editor
at "The Atlantic"
magazine.

08:51.064 --> 08:55.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Kori Schake, she was the
director for
defense strategy at the National
Security

08:55.602 --> 08:59.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Council during the George W.
Bush administration.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

09:01.608 --> 09:02.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Kori Schake, to you first.

09:02.909 --> 09:06.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When the president said today --
it was a
striking comment.

09:06.112 --> 09:11.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said what happened with this
chemical attack
this week had caused him to
completely rethink

09:11.751 --> 09:15.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his attitude towards Syria,
toward President
Assad.

09:15.822 --> 09:20.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For those of you who know, who
have been watching
Syria, watching Assad, should
this have been

09:20.960 --> 09:22.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
such a shocking move?

09:22.896 --> 09:26.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KORI SCHAKE, Stanford University
Hoover Institute:
It shouldn't have been such a
big surprise,

09:26.099 --> 09:31.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because there have been dozens
and dozens
of chemical weapons attacks by
the Syrian

09:31.070 --> 09:33.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government against its own
population.

09:33.940 --> 09:39.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Still, it's a welcome
development that the
president is paying attention to
the war crimes

09:39.579 --> 09:45.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are being committed by the
Assad regime
and by their supporters in Iran
and in Russia.

09:45.318 --> 09:49.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Andrew Exum, when
you left
the Defense Department just a
few months ago,

09:49.389 --> 09:55.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were you and others aware that
the Assad regime
still had this capability of
using banned

09:55.361 --> 09:57.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
chemical weapons?

09:57.163 --> 09:58.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW EXUM, Former U.S. Deputy
Assistant
Secretary of Defense: Well, we
were certainly

09:58.998 --> 10:03.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worried about the deployment of
chemical weapons
across Syria by all parties,
frankly, by the

10:03.069 --> 10:04.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Islamic State as well.

10:04.537 --> 10:06.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So it was a concern.

10:06.439 --> 10:12.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the diplomatic efforts
in 2013 accomplished
a lot, but it certainly appears
as if the

10:12.212 --> 10:16.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Assad regime kept the remainder
of those weapons
back and is employing them
today.

10:16.549 --> 10:20.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does that square
with your
understanding, Kori Schake?

10:20.386 --> 10:27.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I guess my question is, the
administration
has been saying that they were
not prepared

10:27.093 --> 10:30.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to go in to Syria to remove
President Assad.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those are the signals we have
been getting.

10:32.966 --> 10:37.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if they were to change that
approach,
that would be a significant
change, wouldn't

10:37.770 --> 10:38.771 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it?

10:38.805 --> 10:40.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KORI SCHAKE: It would be a
significant change.

10:40.640 --> 10:47.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the president's comments
today certainly
sound 180 degrees out from his
policy, stated

10:47.514 --> 10:52.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just two days ago by Secretary
of State Tillerson,
that they supported keeping the
Assad regime

10:52.719 --> 10:53.686 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in power.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think that's changed,
though.

10:55.555 --> 11:00.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My guess is that what they are
likely to do
is retaliate with punitive
strikes.

11:01.027 --> 11:05.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the long shadow of the
Iraq War is
that they are going to want to
leave Assad

11:05.765 --> 11:10.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in place because they're fearful
of the squalor
of regime change, but that they
are going

11:10.770 --> 11:18.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to try and constrain his
behavior by penalizing
him for the kinds of actions
that the Syrian

11:18.144 --> 11:20.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government undertook against its
own population
today -- yesterday.

11:20.914 --> 11:24.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Andrew Exum,
we're obviously
in speculation territory here,
because we

11:24.984 --> 11:26.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't know what the Trump
administration is
going to do.

11:26.653 --> 11:27.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW EXUM: Sure.

11:27.654 --> 11:29.422 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sure.

11:29.455 --> 11:31.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But if there was
a decision
to follow through on what the
president said

11:31.324 --> 11:36.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today, when he said I have got
-- I have changed
my mind about my attitude toward
President

11:36.329 --> 11:37.864 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Assad, what could they do?

11:37.897 --> 11:38.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What conceivably could they do?

11:39.032 --> 11:40.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW EXUM: Yes.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, the president, first off,
strikes me
as somebody who listens to the
last person

11:43.369 --> 11:47.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he spoke with, and is
probably just as
shocked viscerally by the images
that he saw

11:47.874 --> 11:50.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on television as all Americans
and people
worldwide.

11:50.977 --> 11:54.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, after he gathers his
team -- I actually
disagree with Kori here.

11:54.814 --> 11:57.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think he's likely not to act,
for a couple
different reasons.

11:57.984 --> 12:00.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First off, he has got to ask,
what are his
priorities?

12:00.620 --> 12:04.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think this president has
communicated
his priority is the fight
against the Islamic

12:04.390 --> 12:06.159 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
State.

12:06.192 --> 12:09.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he were to strike the Assad
regime, it's
worth bearing in mind that, for
the past two

12:09.562 --> 12:14.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years, the U.S. aircraft and
coalition aircraft
have flown through a pretty
robust integrated

12:14.200 --> 12:19.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
air and defense system over
Syria without
being harassed.

12:19.672 --> 12:23.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they were to strike the Assad
regime, they
could then interfere with the
U.S. campaign

12:23.743 --> 12:26.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against Raqqa, against the
Islamic State elsewhere.

12:26.179 --> 12:30.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Additionally, you have got to
ask yourself,
how willing are you to kill some
Russians?

12:30.950 --> 12:35.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because, especially since the
fall of 2015,
when you have seen a lot more
Russians in

12:36.022 --> 12:41.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syria, if you strike any site in
Syria, you
may end up killing some Russian
advisers.

12:41.327 --> 12:44.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I wonder if that's a risk
the Trump administration
is prepared to take.

12:44.631 --> 12:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about these
arguments,
Kori Schake?

12:47.100 --> 12:52.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Could these be reasons why this
administration
is going to think twice, think
three times

12:52.972 --> 12:57.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or more before they were to take
any aggressive
steps against Assad?

12:57.210 --> 12:59.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KORI SCHAKE: Yes, I think Andrew
is right.

12:59.946 --> 13:03.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think those are both sensible
concerns to
have.

13:03.049 --> 13:08.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My guess though, is that the
more thoughtful
people in the Trump
administration, after

13:08.121 --> 13:14.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president's comments today,
are going
to be looking for ways to
penalize the Assad

13:14.227 --> 13:18.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regime without triggering either
of those
problems.

13:18.598 --> 13:21.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Deconflicting the activity with
the Russians
is certainly a possibility.

13:21.768 --> 13:29.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think they will continue to
leave Assad
in place because they're
thinking about, what

13:29.342 --> 13:31.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happens after the defeat of the
Islamic State?

13:31.978 --> 13:36.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they don't want to take on
the responsibility
for governing Syria.

13:36.683 --> 13:44.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do think there are options
available
to them, especially if you can
find ways to

13:44.490 --> 13:50.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
target Assad forces that were
involved particularly
in the attack against civilians
and the follow-up

13:50.963 --> 13:52.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
destruction of hospitals that
was undertaken.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean
specifically this
attack that took place this
week?

13:56.002 --> 13:57.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KORI SCHAKE: Yes.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, I wanted to
ask you to
expand on what you mean.

13:59.539 --> 14:06.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, what are the options, if
they're going
to take limited steps, if you
will, in response?

14:06.679 --> 14:12.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KORI SCHAKE: Yes, it looks to me
like their
general strategy for fighting
the Islamic

14:12.285 --> 14:18.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State is to step up the pace of
operations,
to increase arming and training
of the Free

14:18.991 --> 14:25.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syrian forces, to coordinate
much more closely
with the Saudis, the UAE, the
Israelis.

14:25.631 --> 14:29.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They seem to be having some
problems still
bringing Turkey into effect.

14:29.102 --> 14:34.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But given that they are
tightening the noose
around ISIS, that will give them
much greater

14:34.273 --> 14:39.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leverage for dealing with the
Assad regime
subsequently, because Assad's
justification

14:39.345 --> 14:43.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
right now is that he is
protecting Syria against
terrorists.

14:43.583 --> 14:49.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you take that excuse away
from him, it
actually gives them a lot more
leverage for

14:49.455 --> 14:51.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reining in Assad's behavior.

14:51.324 --> 14:55.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are these the
kinds of steps,
Andrew Exum, that President
Assad, his regime

14:55.795 --> 15:01.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
would see as a kind of
punishment or retaliation
for what they have done?

15:01.100 --> 15:04.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW EXUM: I think if you take
-- end up
taking direct strikes against,
for instance,

15:04.470 --> 15:08.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chemical weapons facilities,
places where
you know that chemical weapons
may be manufactured

15:08.775 --> 15:11.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or stored, I think they would
certainly see
that as punitive.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They would get that message.

15:13.546 --> 15:16.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm still not sure that the
Trump administration
is going to want to be able to
-- is going

15:16.549 --> 15:18.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to want to do that.

15:18.251 --> 15:21.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think I disagree with Kori
just a little
bit in terms of, I'm not sure we
actually

15:21.654 --> 15:23.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gain leverage by defeating the
Islamic State.

15:23.856 --> 15:30.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I actually think that, once you
get past Raqqa,
the need to coordinate even more
with the

15:30.062 --> 15:35.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russians, perhaps even with the
regime, grows
more important as you get closer
to Deir el-Zour,

15:35.034 --> 15:38.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where the regime actually has a
pretty strong
toehold and where I think the
Islamic State

15:38.971 --> 15:41.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is going to go after they flee
Raqqa.

15:41.574 --> 15:47.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, unfortunately, I see a bit
of a contradiction
between the fight against the
Islamic State

15:47.313 --> 15:50.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the desire to remove the
Assad regime.

15:50.550 --> 15:55.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even if you work with
Russia, I'm just
not sold that working with
Russia is an effective

15:55.087 --> 15:59.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way to hasten the end of the
Assad regime
or to enact any type of punitive
measures.

15:59.725 --> 16:01.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just about
half-a-minute.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kori Schake, do you want to
respond to that?

16:03.930 --> 16:07.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KORI SCHAKE: Well, I agree with
much of what
Andrew says.

16:07.867 --> 16:12.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think deconfliction with the
Russians is
probably the maximum that we can
do.

16:12.772 --> 16:17.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But deconfliction is enough to
prevent us
killing Russian soldiers when we
are attacking

16:17.677 --> 16:19.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Assad regime.

16:20.012 --> 16:24.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think there's so much more
that can
and should be done, because this
isn't just

16:24.851 --> 16:28.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a problem internal to Syria,
terrible as that
is.

16:28.654 --> 16:33.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the norm against chemical
weapons use
is extraordinarily important
internationally.

16:33.426 --> 16:38.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I agree with Andrew that the
president's all
over the map on this, and I
don't think that's

16:38.264 --> 16:39.632 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going to change.

16:39.665 --> 16:42.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think administration
policy is going
to smooth out over time.

16:42.869 --> 16:47.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kori Schake,
Andrew Exum, thank
you both.

16:47.907 --> 16:57.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW EXUM: Sure thing.

16:57.250 --> 17:06.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We turn next to
the American
investigations into Russia, its
meddling in

17:06.726 --> 17:11.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the 2016 election, and whether
Trump associates
were involved in at all.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The congressional probes have
been the focus
of late.

17:13.733 --> 17:18.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the federal bureau of
investigation is
looking into the matter as well,
putting that

17:18.471 --> 17:24.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bureau under scrutiny again for
its handling
of yet another politically
sensitive case.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham begins there.

17:26.445 --> 17:31.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: He leads the
country's most
prominent law enforcement
agency, the FBI,

17:31.317 --> 17:36.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
making Director James Comey the
very public
face of a bureau suddenly in the
spotlight.

17:36.122 --> 17:41.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY, FBI Director: And
that includes
investigating the nature of any
links between

17:41.294 --> 17:45.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
individuals associated with the
Trump campaign
and the Russian government.

17:45.331 --> 17:49.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It's not
standard procedure
to reveal, let alone publicly
discuss, an

17:49.835 --> 17:55.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ongoing FBI investigation, but
last July,
Comey also came forward to
discuss a politically

17:55.675 --> 17:58.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sensitive probe that he said was
wrapping
up.

17:58.711 --> 18:04.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It was the bureau's
investigation into Hillary
Clinton's e-mail practices when
she was secretary

18:04.250 --> 18:06.052 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of state.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: I want to tell you
what we did,
I want to tell you what we
found, and I want

18:08.788 --> 18:11.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to tell you what we're
recommending to the
Department of Justice.

18:11.057 --> 18:13.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That
recommendation?

18:13.192 --> 18:18.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not to bring criminal charges, a
decision
panned by some top Republicans,
like House

18:18.164 --> 18:22.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Speaker Paul Ryan, who said the
recommendation
defied explanation.

18:22.902 --> 18:28.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Then, there was also his
revelation about
a week-and-a-half before the
election, this

18:28.207 --> 18:33.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
letter from Comey to Congress
saying the bureau
had subsequently learned about
e-mails that

18:33.546 --> 18:36.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
may have been pertinent to the
Clinton probe.

18:36.916 --> 18:40.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Former Attorney General Eric
Holder criticized
this revelation.

18:40.152 --> 18:43.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So did other former Justice
Department officials
from both parties.

18:43.923 --> 18:47.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even today, a Justice
Department watchdog
is reviewing whether Comey's
public statements

18:48.027 --> 18:52.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the Clinton case flouted FBI
or DOJ policy.

18:52.732 --> 18:56.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For his part, Comey is defending
his, and
the bureau's, handling of these
politically

18:56.802 --> 18:59.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sensitive matters, as he did
last week.

18:59.171 --> 19:02.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: I know that, when I
make a hard
decision, a storm is going to
follow.

19:02.742 --> 19:05.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But, honestly, I don't care.

19:05.211 --> 19:09.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we ever start to think about
who will be
affected in what way by our
decisions in a

19:09.815 --> 19:11.617 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
political sense, we're done.

19:11.650 --> 19:15.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As for the
ongoing probe
into what role the Russians
played in our

19:15.988 --> 19:20.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election, and whether members of
the Trump
campaign participated in that
meddling, Comey

19:20.359 --> 19:25.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
told Congress he had no sense
how much longer
that may take.

19:25.297 --> 19:29.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For a deeper dive into just how
the FBI handles
these kinds of investigations,
I'm joined

19:29.969 --> 19:32.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now by Stephanie Douglas.

19:32.104 --> 19:37.877 align:left position:0%,start line:66.67% size:100%
She's a 23-year veteran of the
FBI, where
she specialized in national
security and
counterintelligence.

19:37.910 --> 19:42.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And John Carlin, he ran the
National Security
Division of the Department of
Justice under

19:42.214 --> 19:43.816 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
President Obama.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

19:45.284 --> 19:47.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Stephanie Douglas, I would like
to start with
you first.

19:47.053 --> 19:51.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wonder if you would just take
on -- before
we get to the investigation,
take on this

19:51.290 --> 19:52.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
criticism of Comey.

19:52.992 --> 19:57.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a lot of Democrats who
are very
upset with how the FBI handled
the Hillary

19:57.663 --> 19:59.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Clinton e-mail investigation.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What would you say to those
critics?

20:01.267 --> 20:03.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHANIE DOUGLAS, Former FBI
Official: Well,
I think -- you know, I have
never worked with

20:03.769 --> 20:07.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Director Comey personally, but I
have a great
deal of respect for him.

20:07.773 --> 20:11.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, at the end of the
day, the director
felt like he was making the best
decision

20:11.944 --> 20:13.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he could, given the
circumstances.

20:13.979 --> 20:20.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think he considered it a very
sensitive
matter that he felt that the
U.S. public had

20:20.853 --> 20:23.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a right to know and understand.

20:23.122 --> 20:27.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, based on that, he
made a decision
to come forward with the
disclosures.

20:27.259 --> 20:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think that, given that, it
has put the
FBI in the middle of a political
firestorm,

20:33.499 --> 20:35.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which is an uncomfortable place
to be.

20:35.801 --> 20:44.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think, at the end of the
day, the director
is very -- he didn't make this
decision hastily,

20:44.110 --> 20:46.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I think he believes that he
did the right
thing.

20:46.545 --> 20:49.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: John Carlin,
is there anything
you would add to that?

20:49.248 --> 20:53.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CARLIN, Former Justice
Department Official:
Well, I think it's important
right now to

20:53.853 --> 20:59.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take stock of where we are and
what the national
security threat is.

21:00.025 --> 21:06.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I thought what was stunning,
and has not
been receiving the attention
that it deserves,

21:06.532 --> 21:11.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was the director of the FBI's
statement at
a congressional hearing last
week and the

21:11.504 --> 21:17.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
head of the National Security
Agency, and
what they said was, not only did
Russia attempt

21:17.843 --> 21:24.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to undermine confidence in the
integrity of
our election, in this election
cycle, not

21:24.083 --> 21:27.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only did they do that, but
they're going to
do it again.

21:27.486 --> 21:31.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said that it is their
assessment that
the Russians believe it's a
success, and they're

21:31.223 --> 21:37.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to come back at us in
2020, perhaps
as soon as 2018, and that
they're going to

21:37.630 --> 21:44.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take similar efforts undermining
democracy
in Europe, European elections
that are upcoming

21:44.503 --> 21:45.471 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
shortly.

21:45.504 --> 21:47.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So the problem is urgent.

21:47.339 --> 21:52.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I hope that we can start
focusing on what
we can do to prevent them from
being successful

21:52.411 --> 21:53.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in those attempts.

21:54.013 --> 21:56.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Stephanie
Douglas, you heard
what John is just saying there.

21:56.815 --> 22:02.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The current FBI investigation
seems to be
a two-pronged one, what meddling
did the Russians

22:02.154 --> 22:07.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do in our prior election and
whether the Trump
campaign had any collusion in
that activity.

22:07.793 --> 22:08.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is the goal here?

22:08.761 --> 22:09.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is it disruption?

22:09.762 --> 22:11.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is it putting people in
handcuffs?

22:11.063 --> 22:12.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, what's the end goal
here?

22:12.798 --> 22:16.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHANIE DOUGLAS: Well, the FBI
has been
doing counterintelligence
investigations for

22:16.202 --> 22:17.970 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
decades.

22:18.003 --> 22:21.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's a part of their core
mission and
it's part of one of their most
significant

22:21.207 --> 22:23.242 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
priorities.

22:23.275 --> 22:28.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:66.67% size:87.5%
So the purpose of
counterintelligence
investigations
is to provide intelligence to
policy-makers

22:28.214 --> 22:33.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and to other intelligence
community partners,
so we are better educated to
make decisions

22:33.986 --> 22:35.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
relative to policy.

22:35.688 --> 22:39.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As you said, there are two parts
of this investigation.

22:39.425 --> 22:44.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will not be a surprise to
Russia that there's
a counterintelligence
investigation into their

22:44.196 --> 22:48.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intelligence activities ongoing
within the
United States.

22:48.667 --> 22:55.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's also, as part of
that investigation,
an attempt to understand the
roles and the

22:55.107 --> 23:00.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
relationships of U.S. persons
with the Russian
intelligence service, and if
there was anything

23:00.446 --> 23:03.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inappropriate as part of those
relationships.

23:03.215 --> 23:09.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the bureau has a big job
ahead of itself
to fully vet out and to put the
pieces together

23:09.688 --> 23:13.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in any logical investigation to
make sure
the facts are clear.

23:13.826 --> 23:18.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: John Carlin,
how -- investigating
the president of the United
States, who is

23:18.864 --> 23:24.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ostensibly the boss of the FBI,
has got to
be an incredibly fraught
political thing to

23:24.770 --> 23:26.505 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do.

23:26.538 --> 23:30.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How does the agency, how does
the bureau insulate
itself from that kind of
pressure?

23:30.042 --> 23:35.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CARLIN: Well, I have had
the privilege
of working with some of the
professionals,

23:35.781 --> 23:41.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
both at the FBI and the career
prosecutors
who are at the Department of
Justice that

23:41.086 --> 23:45.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
handle this highly specialized
type of investigation.

23:45.524 --> 23:50.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one thing that assures me
and that I can
assure others, having worked
with them, is

23:50.896 --> 23:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these are people that they don't
care about
politics.

23:54.767 --> 23:58.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They often are not even tracking
what's going
on in the political world.

23:58.070 --> 24:05.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But they're trained
investigators who believe
-- swear an oath to protect our
Constitution,

24:05.144 --> 24:08.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recognize the threats that
they're facing
from abroad from people who
fundamentally

24:08.881 --> 24:16.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do not share our values, and
work day in and
day out to protect us from those
threats.

24:16.822 --> 24:22.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're going to follow the
facts and evidence
where they lead under the law,
and then make

24:22.194 --> 24:28.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a decision if there were
criminal charges
to bring, that's based on
longstanding Justice

24:28.801 --> 24:29.768 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
precedent.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Those are the prosecutors.

24:31.670 --> 24:38.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when -- if the target of the
investigation
were to be the president, there
are protocols

24:38.444 --> 24:42.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- and I'm not saying that it
is, but that
there are protocols in place at
the Department

24:42.881 --> 24:49.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Justice to ensure that,
ultimately, the
career prosecutors' decisions,
the investigative

24:49.955 --> 24:54.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
steps of the career agents are
respected,
and the investigation is allowed
to proceed.

24:54.426 --> 24:59.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one thing I have absolutely
no doubt is
that Director Comey will do what
he needs

24:59.298 --> 25:06.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do to preserve the integrity
of those investigations,
and that the career officials at
the National

25:06.105 --> 25:11.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Security Division and in U.S.
attorney's offices
will similarly not allow
political interference

25:11.944 --> 25:13.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with their investigation.

25:13.712 --> 25:16.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Stephanie
Douglas, we have
seen a lot of controversy, a lot
of attacks

25:17.015 --> 25:19.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the intelligence agencies
recently.

25:19.585 --> 25:24.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are you confident that this
investigation
can get to the bottom of this
issue and that

25:24.456 --> 25:28.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those findings, when they're
presented, will
be accepted by the public?

25:28.260 --> 25:29.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STEPHANIE DOUGLAS: Yes.

25:29.395 --> 25:32.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just want to echo what
John was just
saying.

25:32.197 --> 25:39.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, the men and the women
of the FBI
do sensitive investigations
every day.

25:39.671 --> 25:45.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not many of them come to light
or are briefed
as publicly as this one has
been.

25:45.310 --> 25:49.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But they have very strict
protocols.

25:49.148 --> 25:51.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They understand the rule of law.

25:51.483 --> 26:01.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're very process-oriented in
how they
go about a very methodical
investigation.

26:01.093 --> 26:04.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They gather evidence in
conformance with the
law.

26:04.863 --> 26:06.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They do interviews.

26:06.398 --> 26:10.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They take advantage of
investigative tools
that are made available to them.

26:10.736 --> 26:17.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the only thing that will
enhance this
investigation is the fact that
it will be

26:17.042 --> 26:21.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even more highly scrutinized
because of the
potential impact of it.

26:22.014 --> 26:25.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I have -- I have very firm
confidence
that the FBI is up to this task.

26:25.717 --> 26:29.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Stephanie Douglas,
John Carlin, thank you both very
much.

26:29.321 --> 26:32.124 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEPHANIE DOUGLAS: Thank you.

26:32.157 --> 26:40.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN CARLIN: Thank you.

26:40.098 --> 26:44.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

26:44.937 --> 26:51.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": an
uptick in
ticks and the diseases they
carry.

26:51.076 --> 26:56.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: Are auto insurance
companies treating
drivers of color differently by
charging them

26:56.315 --> 26:57.583 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more money?

26:57.616 --> 27:01.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A new analysis finds that is the
case in a
number of states.

27:01.420 --> 27:05.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has the latest
in our Race
Matters series.

27:05.090 --> 27:06.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's in New York.

27:06.959 --> 27:10.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Consumer
groups have long
contended that drivers in
predominantly minority

27:10.162 --> 27:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
neighborhoods are charged more
for insurance
premiums than drivers in
predominantly white

27:14.867 --> 27:16.568 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
neighborhoods.

27:16.602 --> 27:19.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Insurers had said that was due
to a higher
risk of accidents in those
communities.

27:20.005 --> 27:23.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a new analysis by ProPublica
and Consumers
Union found the disparities in
premiums are

27:24.009 --> 27:29.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
higher, sometimes much higher,
even when the
risk of an accident is
essentially the same.

27:29.147 --> 27:34.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The team looked at data and more
than 100,000
premiums in four states,
California, Texas,

27:34.987 --> 27:36.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Illinois and Missouri.

27:36.288 --> 27:38.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Julia Angwin of the ProPublica
team joins
me now.

27:38.357 --> 27:39.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, what did you do?

27:39.591 --> 27:41.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What did you find?

27:41.426 --> 27:43.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA ANGWIN, ProPublica: So,
what we did
was, we basically tried to take
a predominantly

27:43.462 --> 27:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
minority neighborhood and a
non-minority neighborhood
with the exact same insurance
risk.

27:47.966 --> 27:51.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is measured by how much
insurance
have had to pay out in claims.

27:51.570 --> 27:55.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we looked at the prices of
the premiums
in those neighborhoods and said,
are they

27:55.173 --> 27:56.942 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the same?

27:56.975 --> 27:59.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, oftentimes, what we found
was, despite
the fact that the payouts were
the same and

27:59.511 --> 28:03.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we had the same safe driver,
that the minority
neighborhood was being charged
quite a bit

28:03.181 --> 28:05.017 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

28:05.050 --> 28:06.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, when we
say the payouts,
that means the amount of money
that insurance

28:06.852 --> 28:09.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has paid in those communities
for whatever
accidents might have been
happened.

28:09.955 --> 28:11.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JULIA ANGWIN: Right.

28:11.657 --> 28:13.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over a five-year period, all
insurers have
paid, on average, this amount
per car.

28:13.592 --> 28:17.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And what is
the underlying
reason for this?

28:17.095 --> 28:20.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA ANGWIN: Well, I don't know
actually
why this disparity is taking
place, but what

28:20.766 --> 28:26.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the -- what we -- it raises the
question about
whether this pricing is fair,
because insurance

28:26.104 --> 28:28.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is supposed to be based on risk,
and that's
what the industry has always
said.

28:28.740 --> 28:31.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when you look at the risk
that they truly
bear, which is the cost that
they have to

28:31.577 --> 28:36.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pay out for claims, you see
these price disparities
that can't be explained by that
risk.

28:36.248 --> 28:40.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is there
enough information
out there to be able to make
this assessment?

28:40.852 --> 28:43.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JULIA ANGWIN: We were
hard-pressed to get
this data.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We only got data from four
states.

28:45.190 --> 28:47.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We requested it from all 50
states.

28:47.526 --> 28:50.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Only four said they collected it
and would
release it to us.

28:50.128 --> 28:52.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so we could only do this
analysis there.

28:52.130 --> 28:55.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And these four
states, are
they representative of a
cross-section?

28:55.567 --> 28:58.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because different states have
different types
of insurance rules, obviously
different types

28:58.971 --> 28:59.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of driving conditions.

28:59.972 --> 29:01.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIA ANGWIN: Yes, they do.

29:01.907 --> 29:05.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, basically, we have a nice
range, because
California is considered one of
the most regulated

29:05.777 --> 29:07.746 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
states for insurance.

29:07.779 --> 29:11.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The industries have to submit
their rates
to the regulators before they
can issue them.

29:11.683 --> 29:15.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Illinois, the least regulated,
they don't
have to submit their rates to
anybody for

29:15.654 --> 29:18.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
approval before they issue them,
and it's
considered a very competitive
target.

29:18.657 --> 29:22.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we have two states in
the middle,
Missouri and Texas, with kind of
basic level

29:22.427 --> 29:24.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of regulation that is considered
normal in
the industry.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We spoke to James Lynch of the
insurance industry,
and this is what he had to say.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAMES LYNCH, Insurance
Information Institute:
They kind of started off on the
wrong foot,

29:30.669 --> 29:32.537 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
actually.

29:32.571 --> 29:37.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, I kind of feel sorry
for them, because
they spent a good year-plus, as
I understand

29:37.109 --> 29:38.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it, putting this study together.

29:38.944 --> 29:42.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what they failed to do was,
they failed
to take into account that people
in different

29:42.581 --> 29:45.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
neighborhoods drive differently.

29:45.684 --> 29:50.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And because that's the case, you
have to compare
those drives with a set of
drivers on the

29:50.088 --> 29:52.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
premium side that drive
differently.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, they really aren't comparing
like to like.

29:54.092 --> 29:55.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're not making an
apples-to-apples comparison.

29:55.927 --> 29:59.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But a
30-year-old driver
woman that is a safe driver
across zip codes,

29:59.698 --> 30:02.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
across state lines, why is that
not a fair
comparison?

30:02.200 --> 30:06.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES LYNCH: Well, when they do
that, what
they are saying is that the only
reason rates

30:06.171 --> 30:11.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vary from one territory to
another is because
of the territory itself.

30:11.576 --> 30:15.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the truth is that, in any
neighborhood,
some drivers are driving more
miles than others.

30:15.914 --> 30:19.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some drivers are getting in more
accidents
than people in other
neighborhoods.

30:19.051 --> 30:22.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you need to take that into
account when
you're setting rates.

30:22.120 --> 30:25.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as far as we can tell, they
haven't done
that.

30:25.490 --> 30:30.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have actually hired a
firm to peer-review
their work, and it looks like
they're coming

30:30.128 --> 30:32.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to a very similar conclusion to
ours.

30:32.431 --> 30:38.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is there any
reasoning that
you can come up with for why
these disparities

30:38.136 --> 30:39.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
exist from zip code to zip code?

30:39.971 --> 30:44.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES LYNCH: Well, as I said, if
you took
these on a like-to-like basis,
if you looked

30:44.476 --> 30:50.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at all of the characteristics of
drivers in
an area, race not being one of
them, because

30:50.348 --> 30:52.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
insurance companies do not ask
questions about
race.

30:53.018 --> 30:55.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In many places, it's illegal for
them to ask
them about race.

30:55.721 --> 30:57.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they go one further.

30:57.489 --> 31:01.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They just don't ask, because
there's actually
nothing to be gained from the
exercise.

31:01.493 --> 31:06.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what they do ask about
is, they ask
about things like the kind of
car you drive,

31:06.865 --> 31:10.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the number of miles that you
drive, what your
driving record is.

31:10.502 --> 31:14.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, based upon those
concrete variables,
your rate is set.

31:14.573 --> 31:18.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, he takes
aim at your
methodology and says the
conclusion is flawed.

31:18.910 --> 31:23.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA ANGWIN: You know, as of
yet, we have
not heard from anyone about any
errors that

31:23.482 --> 31:27.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are correctable that we need to
correct in
this, and we're always open to
hearing that.

31:27.219 --> 31:31.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We approached the industry and
actually lots
of academics and experts to
review our methodology

31:31.690 --> 31:33.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for months in advance.

31:33.492 --> 31:37.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, as of right now, I don't
have any
corrections to make to it.

31:37.462 --> 31:40.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I await the response that
the industry
said they're going to publish
soon.

31:40.766 --> 31:43.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, the
insurance industry
says, you know, it's not apples
to apples

31:43.802 --> 31:47.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to compare the same person at
the same age
with the same driving record
because different

31:47.239 --> 31:49.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people in different communities
drive differently.

31:49.074 --> 31:51.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's just a much larger pool
to compare.

31:51.143 --> 31:56.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA ANGWIN: So, the insurance
industry has
a way of dealing with the
problem you're describing,

31:56.148 --> 32:00.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is that they assign
territories different
risk ratings.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And those are what these
insurance quotes
are based on.

32:02.821 --> 32:07.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when we're analyzing the
quotes that they
give to each person, that's
based on their

32:07.559 --> 32:09.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
own assessment of the riskiness
of that neighborhood.

32:09.628 --> 32:12.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And what we're doing is
comparing that to
the payouts that they made in
that neighborhood.

32:12.631 --> 32:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Why does this
all matter
at the end of the day?

32:15.000 --> 32:20.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA ANGWIN: Why this matters
is that this
is just one of many areas of
life where you

32:20.438 --> 32:23.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see minority neighborhoods being
treated disparately.

32:23.608 --> 32:28.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's an explanation out
there that
says, oh, it's because it's so
risky, and,

32:28.713 --> 32:30.816 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
basically, it's deserved, right?

32:30.849 --> 32:34.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're paying higher prices,
but it's because
it's a dangerous neighborhood.

32:34.152 --> 32:37.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And this just raises the
question, which is,
once again, that the facts don't
support that

32:37.322 --> 32:39.124 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
analysis.

32:39.157 --> 32:40.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The facts don't show that these
neighborhoods
are riskier than the ones that
are getting

32:40.859 --> 32:42.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cheaper prices, in most cases.

32:42.561 --> 32:45.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Julia Angwin
of ProPublica, thanks for
joining us.

32:45.931 --> 32:53.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIA ANGWIN: Thank you so much.

32:53.371 --> 33:00.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The arrival of
spring is a
most welcome sight to many of
us, but it also

33:00.178 --> 33:03.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
brings a serious health problem,
ticks.

33:03.248 --> 33:08.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They can lead to Lyme disease in
humans, which
can be a serious chronic
condition.

33:08.153 --> 33:12.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many suburban areas are trying
to figure out
just how to deal with an
increasing number

33:12.791 --> 33:18.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of ticks, which some blame on
the growing
population of deer in the U.S.

33:18.063 --> 33:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Researchers are enlisted in this
battle as
well.

33:21.199 --> 33:25.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Miles O'Brien has the story for
our weekly
segment on the Leading Edge of
science.

33:25.704 --> 33:29.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a warning: Some of the
images in this
story might disturb some
viewers.

33:29.541 --> 33:35.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: This English
manor in the woods
near Boston is Denny Swenson and
Wynn (ph)

33:35.413 --> 33:38.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Swenson's dream house.

33:38.750 --> 33:42.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When they moved here 10 years
ago, they were
thrilled to see a lot of deer.

33:42.988 --> 33:47.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DENISE SWENSON®MD-BO /,
Massachusetts: And
it was so exciting, because
they're such beautiful

33:47.058 --> 33:48.026 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
animals.

33:48.059 --> 33:49.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They seemed harmless.

33:49.060 --> 33:50.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Wow, we felt like we had
arrived.

33:50.996 --> 33:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But, today, she
is a more than
a little wary of the deer.

33:54.799 --> 34:00.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In fact, she believes
controlling their numbers
is the only practical way to
stem the spread

34:00.539 --> 34:02.941 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Lyme disease.

34:02.974 --> 34:07.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Humans are infected with Lyme
from tick bites,
and ticks like to feed on deer.

34:07.746 --> 34:10.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENISE SWENSON: ®MD-BO / There's
a trail
there that the deer love.

34:10.515 --> 34:11.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: This is deer
country here?

34:12.017 --> 34:12.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DENISE SWENSON: ®MD-BO / Yes,
yes.

34:13.018 --> 34:14.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have tons of deer.

34:14.853 --> 34:20.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The state says
that there are
about 85 deer per square mile in
the adjacent

34:20.458 --> 34:25.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
7,000-acre Blue Hills
Reservation; 10 per
square mile is considered a
density that could

34:25.664 --> 34:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reduce the spread of Lyme.

34:28.300 --> 34:32.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Deer were hunted nearly to
extinction a century
ago in the U.S.

34:32.304 --> 34:38.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Today, thanks to legal
protection and regulated
harvests, the deer herd
nationwide has exploded

34:38.843 --> 34:41.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to more than 30 million.

34:41.212 --> 34:46.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This creates a host of problems,
including
more than a million deer-car
collisions each

34:46.251 --> 34:49.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
year in the United States.

34:49.354 --> 34:55.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Suburbia offers the perfect
habitat for deer
to flourish, no human hunters or
animal predators

34:55.593 --> 34:57.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and a bounty of food.

34:57.262 --> 34:59.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENISE SWENSON: ®MD-BO / They're
coming all
the way up to the front door to
eat.

34:59.864 --> 35:05.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're really hungry, so they
kind of need
the rhododendrons as much as I
do.

35:05.503 --> 35:07.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes.

35:07.072 --> 35:08.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This is kind of like the
drive-through of
a deer, right?

35:08.974 --> 35:09.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DENISE SWENSON: ®MD-BO / Yes.

35:09.975 --> 35:11.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is the drive-through for
them, yes.

35:11.843 --> 35:16.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Lyme is an
infectious disease
caused by a bacterium
transmitted to humans

35:16.715 --> 35:21.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by the bite of infected
blacklegged ticks.

35:21.219 --> 35:27.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Symptoms often begin with a
distinctive bullseye
rash and evolve into various
neurological

35:27.058 --> 35:33.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problems, including facial
palsy, severe headaches,
muscular aches, and sensitivity
to light.

35:33.999 --> 35:39.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Without antibiotic treatment,
Lyme disease
can lead to permanent motor,
sensory and cognitive

35:39.604 --> 35:40.939 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
impairment.

35:40.972 --> 35:44.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is the most common tick-borne
disease in
the Northern Hemisphere.

35:44.542 --> 35:49.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are an estimated 300,000
cases a year
all across the U.S.

35:49.748 --> 35:53.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both Denny and Wynn have had
multiple cases
of Lyme disease.

35:53.885 --> 35:57.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENISE SWENSON: ®MD-BO / Oh, I
will never
forget those headaches.

35:57.222 --> 36:00.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will never forget the pain
sort of sweeping
around my body.

36:00.592 --> 36:04.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I felt like I was being invaded
by some crazy
thing.

36:04.362 --> 36:07.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The more she
asked around,
the more she got scared.

36:07.265 --> 36:12.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENISE SWENSON: ®MD-BO / We did a
neighborhood
survey, and 30 households
responded, and we

36:12.871 --> 36:14.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
found 30 cases of Lyme disease.

36:14.773 --> 36:17.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: You basically
have a public
health crisis here.

36:17.108 --> 36:19.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENISE SWENSON: ®MD-BO / Yes,
these are epidemic
level numbers.

36:19.444 --> 36:23.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: A former
journalist, Denny
Swenson started researching.

36:23.982 --> 36:30.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Lyme disease bacterium lives
inside white-footed
mice, the so-called reservoir.

36:30.388 --> 36:35.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ticks that bite the mice become
infected propagators,
or vectors, of Lyme.

36:35.760 --> 36:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She quickly, concluded reducing
the population
of mice, or the ticks
themselves, using chemicals,

36:41.499 --> 36:45.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is neither practical nor prudent
for the environment.

36:45.270 --> 36:47.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But what about targeting deer?

36:47.072 --> 36:52.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAM TELFORD, Tufts University:
There's no
animal as abundant as deer in
these habitats,

36:52.377 --> 36:55.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and these ticks do seem to like
deer.

36:55.780 --> 37:00.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Sam Telford is a
professor
of infectious disease and global
health at

37:01.019 --> 37:05.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tufts University's Cummings
School of Veterinary
Medicine.

37:05.156 --> 37:11.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We met at a hunter inspection
station during
deer season in Webster,
Massachusetts, 60

37:11.930 --> 37:13.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
miles southwest of Boston.

37:13.131 --> 37:16.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAM TELFORD: Do you mind if I
check for ticks?

37:16.234 --> 37:20.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If I were to be here 20 years
ago at the check
station, at this check station,
I could look

37:20.805 --> 37:23.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all day and maybe find two or
three ticks.

37:23.541 --> 37:28.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, in the course of two hours,
we have gotten
probably 50 ticks off a deer.

37:28.880 --> 37:34.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Fortunately for
the deer, they
are not susceptible to Lyme
disease.

37:34.152 --> 37:37.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Telford's fieldwork might make
you squirm
a little bit.

37:37.122 --> 37:41.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He harvests thousands of ticks
to study later
in his laboratory.

37:41.826 --> 37:47.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lyme is just one of more than a
dozen human
diseases and infections spread
by ticks.

37:47.432 --> 37:52.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are, by far, the biggest
disease vector
in the U.S.

37:52.070 --> 37:57.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Telford showed me a tube filled
with two fully
engorged female deer ticks.

37:57.442 --> 37:58.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Those are fully fed?

37:58.443 --> 37:59.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAM TELFORD: These are fully
fed.

37:59.544 --> 38:00.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: That's all blood
in there,
right?

38:00.879 --> 38:03.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAM TELFORD: That's the end
result of feeding
for seven days.

38:03.982 --> 38:06.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Each one of those will lay 2,000
eggs.

38:06.684 --> 38:12.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So even though
mice might be
the Lyme disease bacterium
reservoir, Telford

38:12.724 --> 38:16.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
believes controlling the deer
population is
the key.

38:16.294 --> 38:20.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAM TELFORD: If you were trying
to intervene
to try to control the force of
transmission

38:20.965 --> 38:25.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the agent of Lyme disease,
what do you
go after, something small or
something that's

38:25.670 --> 38:28.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
far more limited in numbers, but
produce the
ticks?

38:28.773 --> 38:33.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In the late
1980s, he ran an
experiment to test his theory on
a small,

38:33.912 --> 38:35.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
isolated Cape Cod peninsula.

38:35.547 --> 38:43.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A sharpshooter reduced the deer
population
from about 50 to fewer than
eight.

38:43.121 --> 38:47.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The numbers of ticks dropped
precipitously,
by 80 percent.

38:47.859 --> 38:52.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ever since then, he has tried to
convince
people who live in suburban
communities overrun

38:52.497 --> 38:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by deer to take similar action.

38:54.999 --> 39:00.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAM TELFORD: The reality is,
some communities
won't tolerate hunting, and so
there have

39:00.738 --> 39:02.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be alternatives.

39:02.540 --> 39:06.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: At the National
Institute of
Standards and Technology in
Gaithersburg,

39:06.411 --> 39:08.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maryland, they're trying birth
control.

39:08.746 --> 39:13.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The 600-acre campus is home to
180 deer.

39:13.251 --> 39:15.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are everywhere.

39:15.053 --> 39:15.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTHONY DENICOLA, White Buffalo
Inc.: National
Institute of Standards and
Technology: We

39:15.620 --> 39:16.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have created a monster.

39:16.421 --> 39:18.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's no doubt.

39:18.223 --> 39:21.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's just whether or not we
contain it
in a realistic timeline, based
on the growth

39:21.192 --> 39:25.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of these deer populations and
the ever-increasing
conflicts with people.

39:25.463 --> 39:31.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Wildlife
ecologist Tony DeNicola
runs a nonprofit organization
focused on managing

39:31.436 --> 39:36.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
white-tailed deer herds in
suburban environments.

39:36.507 --> 39:42.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After they were tranquilized at
NIST, the
deer were surgically sterilized
by veterinarians,

39:42.046 --> 39:44.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
61 does over 10 days.

39:44.349 --> 39:49.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTHONY DENICOLA: Sterilization
has the benefit
of the social support of much of
the public,

39:49.587 --> 39:52.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
eliminates a lot of the
controversy around
lethal programs.

39:52.156 --> 39:56.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as you would expect, it is
far more work
in order to handle these
animals, and you

39:56.628 --> 39:58.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
don't get the immediate
population impact.

39:58.563 --> 40:03.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The Humane
Society of the United
States is a big advocate of
alternatives to

40:03.468 --> 40:05.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
conventional hunting.

40:05.670 --> 40:10.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what they're doing 20
miles north of
New York City in the village of
Hastings-on-Hudson.

40:10.208 --> 40:13.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KALI PEREIRA, Humane Society:
This is our
third capture season for this
project.

40:13.311 --> 40:18.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Kali Pereira is
the senior
deer program manager at the
Humane Society.

40:18.082 --> 40:26.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KALI PEREIRA: We're using a
product called
PZP-22 to address population
control in an

40:26.958 --> 40:30.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
urban environment that hunting
is not an option
for.

40:30.094 --> 40:36.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: PZP-22 is a birth
control vaccine
that lasts for 22 months.

40:36.801 --> 40:42.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
About 70 females in the herd
here are on this
birth control drug.

40:42.040 --> 40:47.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a first-in-the-nation
experiment that
is a labor-intensive, ongoing
effort.

40:47.245 --> 40:49.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It requires patience.

40:49.047 --> 40:53.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KALI PEREIRA: Usually, these
projects take
you a minimum of five to 10
years before you

40:53.384 --> 40:57.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see true population plateau and
reduction.

40:57.088 --> 41:05.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Slow as the
approach is, it
doesn't draw controversy, which
is what happens

41:05.396 --> 41:09.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when the state of Massachusetts
allows deer
hunting with shotguns in the
park near the

41:09.901 --> 41:11.969 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Swenson house.

41:12.003 --> 41:18.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In two seasons, they have killed
122 out of
an estimated 850 deer.

41:18.176 --> 41:23.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sam Telford says the ideal size
of the Blue
Hills herd is about 100.

41:23.147 --> 41:26.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But is that a realistic goal?

STEPHANIE BOYLES GRIFFIN, Humane
Society:
Attempting to reduce deer
populations to reduce

41:37.895 --> 41:43.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the transmission of Lyme disease
has not been
shown to really be effective.

41:43.167 --> 41:49.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You would have to cull deer
populations so
low, and that's really just not
achievable

41:49.307 --> 41:51.075 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a lot of these urban systems.

41:51.109 --> 41:55.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: In Denny
Swenson's neighborhood,
most people are committed to
thinning the

41:55.146 --> 41:57.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
herd, but there is some
ambivalence.

41:57.548 --> 42:02.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENISE SWENSON: ®MD-BO / Killing
them wasn't
my first goal at all, and I'm so
heartbroken

42:02.920 --> 42:04.856 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that we have to.

42:04.889 --> 42:09.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for the health of the deer
and the health
of the forest and the health of
the people

42:09.527 --> 42:12.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that visit the forest, we need
to manage this
problem.

42:12.730 --> 42:18.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The explosion of
the deer population
in suburbia and the rapid rise
of Lyme disease

42:18.870 --> 42:22.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are warning signs of an
ecosystem out of balance.

42:22.907 --> 42:28.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The hunt for solutions won't be
cheap, easy
or fast.

NewsHour," Milton,
Massachusetts.

JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. Senate
spent all night
and day today debating the
nomination of Judge

42:48.099 --> 42:52.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Neil Gorsuch to be the next
associate justice
of the Supreme Court.

42:52.370 --> 42:58.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lawmakers took turns trading
barbs and discussing
the so-called nuclear option,
which could

42:58.242 --> 43:04.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change longstanding Senate
rules, so that
confirmation requires only a
majority vote,

43:04.081 --> 43:05.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
instead of the usual 60.

43:05.116 --> 43:06.484 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

43:06.517 --> 43:07.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN CARDIN (D), Maryland: Judge
Gorsuch, to
me, is not mainstream.

43:07.919 --> 43:10.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He will put corporate interests
above individual
interests.

43:10.655 --> 43:17.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for all those reasons, it
seems appropriate
to me that this is why we have a
60-vote threshold,

43:17.995 --> 43:24.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make sure we don't -- that we
don't take
extreme nominees and allow them
to be confirmed

43:24.202 --> 43:25.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by a partisan vote.

43:25.403 --> 43:27.271 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

43:27.305 --> 43:30.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CORNYN (R), Texas: Every
excuse they
have come up with to engage in
this unprecedented

43:30.541 --> 43:34.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
filibuster is completely without
merit.

43:34.378 --> 43:39.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What they're really upset about
is what happened
on November the 8th.

43:39.050 --> 43:43.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't believe, if they
will -- if won't
confirm Judge Gorsuch, they will
never vote

43:43.921 --> 43:46.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to confirm any nominee of this
president,
period.

43:46.858 --> 43:48.659 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

43:48.693 --> 43:52.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATTY MURRAY (D), Washington:
Invoking the
nuclear option is a dangerous
path to go down.

43:52.096 --> 43:57.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. President, I have been in
the majority,
I have been in the minority,
and, either way,

43:57.802 --> 44:06.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I believe, when it comes to a
lifetime appointment
to the Supreme Court, the Senate
must adhere

44:06.177 --> 44:09.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to a higher standard and the
60-vote threshold.

44:09.447 --> 44:13.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you can't get that many votes
for a Supreme
Court nominee, you don't need to
change the

44:13.951 --> 44:14.919 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rules.

44:14.952 --> 44:15.920 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You need to change the nominee.

44:15.953 --> 44:17.054 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

44:17.088 --> 44:19.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN MCCAIN (R), Arizona: I'm
left with no
choice.

44:19.357 --> 44:24.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will vote to change the rules
and allow
Judge Gorsuch to be confirmed by
a simple

44:25.029 --> 44:26.797 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
majority.

44:26.831 --> 44:32.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I will do so with great
reluctance, not because
I have any doubts that Judge
Gorsuch will

44:32.937 --> 44:39.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be an excellent justice, but
because of the
further and perhaps irreparable
damage that

44:39.310 --> 44:42.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it will do the United States
Senate.

44:42.146 --> 44:46.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For more now on
the continuing
fight over the Supreme Court
nominee, the

44:46.450 --> 44:51.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
negotiations between the White
House and Congress
to repeal and replace Obamacare,
and President

44:51.923 --> 44:56.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump's effort to roll back
parts of the Obama
legacy, we turn to Matt Schlapp.

44:56.594 --> 44:59.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's chairman of the American
Conservative
Union.

44:59.997 --> 45:05.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We had hoped to have Karine
Jean-Pierre -- she's
a senior adviser for MoveOn.org
-- join us

45:05.069 --> 45:08.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as well, but she is stuck in
traffic here
in Washington.

45:08.706 --> 45:10.074 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She may join us in progress.

45:10.107 --> 45:12.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, meantime, Matt, you and I
are going to
have this conversation.

45:12.843 --> 45:16.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what do you make of the
determination
now of Democrats...

45:16.380 --> 45:18.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP, Former White House
Director
of Political Affairs: Right.

45:18.282 --> 45:19.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... that there
are just -- there
are going to be at least three
of them who

45:19.850 --> 45:26.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vote for Neil Gorsuch, but not
enough to give
him the 60 that he would need.

45:26.157 --> 45:29.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: You know, what I'm
struck with
-- obviously, I'm a partisan.

45:29.060 --> 45:30.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm a Republican.

45:30.561 --> 45:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what I'm struck with is that
Neil Gorsuch
really passed all the gates.

45:35.099 --> 45:41.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He seemed very steady during his
hearings,
really didn't have a misanswer
throughout

45:41.172 --> 45:44.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all of that process, has a
stellar record.

45:44.609 --> 45:50.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it just shows you, in our
hyperpartisan
age, it's very hard anymore to
get these crossover

45:50.247 --> 45:57.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
votes for Supreme Court nominees
especially,
because the court has kind of
inserted itself

45:57.321 --> 45:59.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in every major question in
society.

45:59.523 --> 46:01.359 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they are a flash point.

46:01.392 --> 46:04.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Of course, the
Democrats would
say, well, he didn't answer as
many questions

46:04.362 --> 46:05.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as we would have liked.

46:05.363 --> 46:06.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Yes.

46:06.364 --> 46:07.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But I...

46:07.598 --> 46:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: But they all
admitted that he
did a good job.

46:09.200 --> 46:11.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They would have liked him to
step in something,
and he really did avoid that.

46:11.268 --> 46:16.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there anything
else either
the White House, President
Trump, or Judge

46:16.407 --> 46:20.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gorsuch could have done, do you
think, to
get Democrats to 60?

46:20.211 --> 46:24.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or do you think this was cooked
coming in
because of what happened last
year?

46:24.281 --> 46:28.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: I think -- yes, I
think Democrats
are very upset at the treatment
of Merrick

46:28.185 --> 46:29.487 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Garland.

46:29.520 --> 46:31.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They thought he deserved to have
a vote, a
hearing and a vote.

46:31.889 --> 46:36.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, Republicans saw
this Supreme
Court opening, this kind of
really important

46:36.861 --> 46:41.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
swing pick just too close to the
election,
and they wanted to wait.

46:41.232 --> 46:43.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I do think Republicans could
cut a deal.

46:43.300 --> 46:47.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president could cut some
kind of a deal
to get enough Democrats to come
over.

46:47.271 --> 46:49.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you mean?

46:49.073 --> 46:52.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Well, he would
have to cut some
deals on future Supreme Court
picks, maybe

46:52.743 --> 46:55.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
watering down the types of picks
he would
like to make.

46:56.013 --> 46:58.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, for Republicans,
that's just
anathema.

46:58.416 --> 47:01.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They think that Neil Gorsuch
deserves an up-or-down
vote.

47:01.752 --> 47:06.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean the
Democrats would,
in essence, take his word that
he was going

47:06.457 --> 47:08.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to follow up with a more
moderate choice?

47:08.592 --> 47:10.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Yes, yes, that's
right.

47:10.494 --> 47:16.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think for -- look, for
Republicans and
for conservatives, that's a
bridge too far.

47:16.400 --> 47:18.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They believe they won this
election.

47:18.402 --> 47:24.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have picked a nominee who
has gotten
huge majorities in the Senate
previously,

47:24.308 --> 47:26.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who's well-qualified by the
American Bar Association.

47:26.977 --> 47:31.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they really felt like they
put a nominee
up that deserves an up-or-down
vote.

47:31.148 --> 47:33.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, let's
turn to health
care.

47:33.818 --> 47:39.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We keep hearing, we keep seeing
that the White
House s trying to get something
resurrected

47:39.990 --> 47:46.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with House Republicans that will
effectively
repeal and replace Obamacare,
the Affordable

47:46.530 --> 47:47.498 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Care Act.

47:47.531 --> 47:48.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Right.

47:48.532 --> 47:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But they're
struggling.

47:49.533 --> 47:51.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: They are.

47:51.335 --> 47:51.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we saw, just
this afternoon,
Speaker Ryan was seen going into
the White

47:51.736 --> 47:52.503 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
House again.

47:52.536 --> 47:53.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Right.

47:53.971 --> 47:55.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Where does that
stand?

47:55.339 --> 47:57.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And what do you see the
prospects as?

47:57.174 --> 48:00.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Well, I have had
conversations
with the speaker and with the
White House,

48:00.177 --> 48:03.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they are trying very hard to
get to a
bill.

48:03.914 --> 48:09.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, just like in every
political party,
we have our hard-core
conservatives, and we

48:09.386 --> 48:12.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have our more moderate members
that come from
more swing districts.

48:12.623 --> 48:15.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're trying to strike a
balance to
get to the 218.

48:15.192 --> 48:16.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they're simply not there.

48:16.894 --> 48:22.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think where they want to go on
the bill
is to allow more state opt-outs
of the Obama

48:22.333 --> 48:25.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mandates, and they're trying to
figure out
if they can get to that 218.

48:25.136 --> 48:27.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, Karine
Jean-Pierre
has joined us.

48:27.738 --> 48:30.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm so sorry you were stuck in
Washington
traffic.

48:30.674 --> 48:33.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, Democratic
Strategist:
That's OK.

48:34.011 --> 48:34.979 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

48:35.012 --> 48:36.046 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:36.080 --> 48:37.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's a whole
different subject.

48:37.081 --> 48:37.982 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're not going to talk about
that right now.

48:38.015 --> 48:39.917 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Next time.

48:39.950 --> 48:44.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Karine, on this question of
the Republicans
still trying really hard to come
up with something

48:44.488 --> 48:50.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where they can get enough votes
to repeal
and replace Obamacare, is this
something that

48:50.194 --> 48:53.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats are prepared to work
with the White
House in any way?

48:53.597 --> 48:55.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: No.

48:55.099 --> 48:58.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The only way that would happen
is Republicans
said, hey, you know what?

48:58.569 --> 49:02.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know Obamacare is a place to
start, and
there are some fixes.

49:02.640 --> 49:05.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both sides have said that
Obamacare needs
some fixes.

49:05.242 --> 49:09.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
If they were to come to
Democrats and say
let's fix Obamacare.

49:09.380 --> 49:13.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if it's repeal and replace,
I don't see
that happening.

49:13.350 --> 49:17.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the thing, too, you would
think that Republicans
would have learned from their
mistake, which

49:17.721 --> 49:22.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was they tried to jam down this
Trumpcare
in 17 days.

49:22.293 --> 49:26.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now to come back and say,
hey, you know,
we're going to introduce
something that is

49:26.497 --> 49:31.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not on paper and, by the end of
the week,
pass it or vote on it, which we
know that's

49:31.268 --> 49:34.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no longer going to happen,
that's also -- they
haven't learned their lesson.

49:34.839 --> 49:39.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama took 13 months to push ACA
in a public
way.

49:39.877 --> 49:41.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

49:41.278 --> 49:42.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: And it was
very difficult
for him to do that.

49:42.680 --> 49:44.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Any way to make
this work with
Democratic support?

49:44.682 --> 49:46.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: I think you make
very fair points.

49:46.851 --> 49:49.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think the Democrats are
going to solve
the Republicans' problem.

49:49.753 --> 49:52.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think this is a problem that
Republicans
need to solve.

49:52.323 --> 49:55.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking --
I was going
to say, speaking of rolling back
Obamacare,

49:55.426 --> 50:01.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are a number of other
things, to both
of you, that this president is
saying, is

50:01.565 --> 50:05.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
signaling and moving on to roll
back, from
the environment, labor rules...

50:05.269 --> 50:06.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Right.

50:06.270 --> 50:07.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... Internet
privacy.

50:07.504 --> 50:08.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You go down the list.

50:08.806 --> 50:11.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are several, it seems,
that emerge every
single day.

50:11.642 --> 50:17.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Matt Schlapp, is this designed
-- we know
the president does believe in
doing this,

50:17.448 --> 50:19.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but is this designed to shore up
the base?

50:19.483 --> 50:22.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is it designed to win over
people in the middle?

50:22.253 --> 50:24.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, how do you see the
political calculus?

50:24.088 --> 50:29.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: You know, I looked
over this
list, executive orders and
congressional review

50:29.093 --> 50:30.895 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
acts.

50:30.928 --> 50:35.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, by and large, there
are two themes
of the Trump presidency,
economic growth and

50:35.566 --> 50:36.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
security.

50:36.567 --> 50:38.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think most of these issues
involve that.

50:38.869 --> 50:43.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think Donald Trump
understands, if the economy
doesn't get growing and doesn't
-- and we

50:43.340 --> 50:46.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't start adding jobs, and
people don't
start feeling better about their
take-home

50:46.944 --> 50:50.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
pay and their economic
situation, his political
standing will be harmed by that.

50:50.881 --> 50:56.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think they want to take
everything they
can off the ability of
businesspeople, entrepreneurs

50:56.720 --> 50:58.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to invest and grow their
companies.

50:58.455 --> 51:03.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we have seen,
Karine, in
the last weeks that his approval
rating in

51:03.327 --> 51:05.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so many of the national polls
has been sliding.

51:05.930 --> 51:07.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
In some, it's down in the 30s.

51:07.131 --> 51:08.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Yes.

51:08.432 --> 51:11.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Who knows, you
know, how long-lasting
that is.

51:11.302 --> 51:12.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But how do you see this?

51:13.003 --> 51:16.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this something -- if he's
able to do what
Matt says, can he win support?

51:16.707 --> 51:21.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: But the
problem is, Judy,
is he's rolling back issues,
policies that

51:21.178 --> 51:23.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are actually very popular.

51:23.547 --> 51:28.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have to remember Donald
Trump didn't
win with the popular -- the
popular vote.

51:28.319 --> 51:29.853 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He doesn't have a mandate.

51:29.887 --> 51:35.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Only 26 percent, 27 percent of
eligible voters
actually voted for Donald Trump.

51:35.526 --> 51:37.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's troubling to see what
he's doing.

51:37.728 --> 51:41.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are people on your
side who are
very concerned by some of the
rollbacks that

51:41.231 --> 51:43.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's doing, especially when it
comes to privacy.

51:43.567 --> 51:48.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it's certainly -- it's
certainly a
problem that we should be
concerned about.

51:48.639 --> 51:51.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I just don't see how this
is going
to be popular.

51:51.608 --> 51:53.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It certainly doesn't show that
he's a president
for everyone.

51:53.877 --> 51:56.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just him doubling down,
tripling down
on his base.

51:56.246 --> 52:01.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Can I simply say,
on these congressional
review acts, of which we have
only seen one

52:01.251 --> 52:06.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in our history, and to see over
a dozen come
to the president's desk, there's
just a lot

52:06.523 --> 52:08.292 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of action here.

52:08.325 --> 52:11.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think, for him
politically, one of the
downsides for him is, there's so
much action,

52:11.362 --> 52:15.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but also one of the upsides is,
is that we're
not focusing on one because
there are so many.

52:15.165 --> 52:18.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But also, for
some of these,
there may be folks who like
them, but there

52:18.102 --> 52:19.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are also folks who don't like
them.

52:19.436 --> 52:20.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: That's
right.

52:20.404 --> 52:21.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Sure.

52:21.405 --> 52:23.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And he stirs...

52:23.273 --> 52:24.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: All that matters
for President
Trump is, he's got to get that
economy humming.

52:24.842 --> 52:26.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If he doesn't, you know, there's
consequences.

52:26.710 --> 52:30.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: The funny
thing is, his
favorite poll, Rasmussen, even
shows him down

52:30.581 --> 52:31.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by 16 points at 43.

52:31.715 --> 52:32.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: I don't think it's
his favorite
poll.

52:32.983 --> 52:34.251 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:34.284 --> 52:35.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Well, that's
the one he
keeps focusing on.

52:35.753 --> 52:37.021 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, there's a problem there.

52:37.054 --> 52:38.989 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
His numbers are softening.

52:39.023 --> 52:41.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we're glad
the infrastructure
helped get you here today,
Karine Jean-Pierre.

52:41.458 --> 52:42.426 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:42.459 --> 52:43.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you so
much, Judy.

52:43.460 --> 52:44.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I'm so sorry about that.

52:44.461 --> 52:45.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's all right.

52:45.462 --> 52:46.430 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Matt Schlapp.

52:46.463 --> 52:47.931 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you both.

52:47.965 --> 52:48.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: You know, if we
drain the swamp,
we will have less traffic.

52:48.465 --> 52:49.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:49.466 --> 52:50.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Is that
right?

52:50.467 --> 52:51.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's the problem.

52:51.835 --> 52:54.538 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:54.571 --> 53:05.449 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

53:05.482 --> 53:07.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:07.217 --> 53:11.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Thursday, a look at the
rising costs of
protecting President Trump, his
family and

53:11.789 --> 53:13.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their residences.

53:13.257 --> 53:14.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:14.425 --> 53:15.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening.

53:16.026 --> 53:26.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and we will see you soon.

53:26.070 --> 53:38.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and we will see you soon.
