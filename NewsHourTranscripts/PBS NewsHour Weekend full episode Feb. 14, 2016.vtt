WHEN HE DIED YESTERDAY, SCALIA

04:09.800 --> 04:11.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS THE LONGEST-SERVING OF THE

04:11.167 --> 04:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NINE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES.

04:13.900 --> 04:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Brangham: FOR MORE ON

04:15.400 --> 04:16.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUSTICE SCALIA'S ROLE AND HIS

04:16.867 --> 04:18.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFLUENCE ON THE COURT, I AM

04:18.467 --> 04:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOINED FROM WASHINGTON D.C. BY

04:19.833 --> 04:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, THE CHIEF

04:21.133 --> 04:22.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT FOR

"THE NATIONAL LAW JOURNAL," AND

04:23.800 --> 04:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMAL GREEN, A PROFESSOR AND A

04:24.900 --> 04:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VICE DEAN AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY

04:25.800 --> 04:27.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAW SCHOOL HERE IN NEW YORK.

04:27.567 --> 04:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE.

04:32.333 --> 04:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA, I WOULD LIKE TO START

04:34.033 --> 04:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH YOU.

04:34.833 --> 04:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST GIVE ME YOUR

04:35.500 --> 04:36.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKE ON

04:36.267 --> 04:39.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCALIA'S LASTING LEGACY.

04:39.533 --> 04:41.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, WILLIAM, I THINK HIS

04:41.867 --> 04:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEGACY WILL BE IN SEVERAL AREAS.

04:44.400 --> 04:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIRST OF ALL, AND PERHAPS MOST

04:47.200 --> 04:51.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPORTANTLY, IS HIS APPROACH TO

04:51.200 --> 04:52.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION AS

04:52.633 --> 04:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELL AS OF STATUTES.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WAS WHAT HE SAID, CALLED

04:59.767 --> 05:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIMSELF AN ORIGINALIST IN THAT

05:01.700 --> 05:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN HE INTERPRETED THE

05:04.200 --> 05:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSTITUTION, HE WOULD LOOK AT

05:05.600 --> 05:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW THE WORDS OF THE

05:06.800 --> 05:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSTITUTION WERE UNDERSTOOD AT

05:07.900 --> 05:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TIME OF THE FRAMERS.

05:09.833 --> 05:13.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE ALSO WAS A TEXTUALIST

05:13.867 --> 05:14.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEANING HE WOULD LOOK AT THE

05:14.867 --> 05:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORDS IN THE STATUTE AND IF THE

05:16.400 --> 05:18.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEANING WAS CLEAR, THAT WAS THE

05:18.267 --> 05:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
END FOR HIM.

05:20.233 --> 05:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK BOTH APPROACHES REALLY

05:22.833 --> 05:24.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO HEART BY A

05:24.967 --> 05:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHOLE GENERATION OF YOUNG LEGAL

05:29.200 --> 05:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCHOLARS.

05:30.133 --> 05:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND OTHERS AS WELL.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRACTITIONERS, EVEN POLITICIANS.

05:35.467 --> 05:38.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WAS A FORCE IN CONSERVATIVE

05:38.200 --> 05:39.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEGAL THOUGHT.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN ALSO I THINK HIS LEGACY

05:40.900 --> 05:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL BE FELT IN CERTAIN AREAS

05:43.833 --> 05:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE HE LEAD THE COURT.

05:45.800 --> 05:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR EXAMPLE, TWO AREAS, ONE, HE

05:49.800 --> 05:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REINVIGORATED THE MEANING OF THE

05:52.533 --> 05:53.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONFRONTATION CLAUSE IN THE

05:53.567 --> 05:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
6th AMENDMENT.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS THE CLAUSE THAT SAYS A

05:56.533 --> 05:57.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRIMINAL DEFENDANT HAS THE RIGHT

05:57.867 --> 06:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO CONFRONT HIS OR HER ACCUSERS.

06:01.333 --> 06:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WOULD ACCEPT NO SUR GATS.

06:04.133 --> 06:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ACCUSER, WHOEVER FOR EXAMPLE

06:07.000 --> 06:09.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TESTED THE DNA BLOOD IN A CASE

06:09.467 --> 06:11.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAD TO BE THERE ON THE WITNESS

06:11.400 --> 06:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STAND.

06:11.800 --> 06:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SECONDLY HE ALSO

06:14.400 --> 06:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REINVIGORATED THE ROLE OF JURIES

06:16.000 --> 06:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN TRIALS, CRIMINAL TRIALS.

06:18.033 --> 06:20.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WERE THE FACT FINDERS.

06:20.067 --> 06:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WERE THE ONES WHO HAD

06:22.800 --> 06:24.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO-- THE PROSECUTION HAD TO

06:24.200 --> 06:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROVE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT

06:25.800 --> 06:29.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANY FACTS THAT WOULD INCREASE A

06:29.667 --> 06:30.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SENTENCE.

06:30.600 --> 06:31.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> JAMAL GREEN, I KNOW YOU HAVE

06:31.800 --> 06:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID THIS IN THE PAST, THAT

06:33.900 --> 06:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCALIA'S INFLUENCE WAS REALLY

06:34.833 --> 06:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERHAPS GREATEST OUTSIDE OF THE

06:36.433 --> 06:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COURT AND LESS SO ON THE ACTUAL

06:38.233 --> 06:39.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RULINGS THEMSELVES.

06:39.167 --> 06:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY THAT'S THE

06:41.200 --> 06:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASE?

06:41.800 --> 06:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, HE DID HAVE A NUMBER OF

06:43.300 --> 06:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAJORITY OPINIONS THAT HE WROTE

06:44.233 --> 06:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WERE SIGNIFICANT, AS MARCIA

06:45.800 --> 06:47.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MENTIONED, SO IN THE AREA OF THE

06:47.467 --> 06:50.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECOND AMENDMENT, IN THE AREA OF

06:50.600 --> 06:51.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE-- CLAUSE AND SO FORTH.

06:51.367 --> 06:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT I THINK WHERE JUSTICE

06:52.733 --> 06:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCALIA'S LEGACY REALLY LIES IS

06:53.933 --> 06:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN KIND OF POPULARIZING

06:56.133 --> 06:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

06:58.500 --> 07:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORIGINALISM, WE DON'T JUST TALK

07:01.200 --> 07:03.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT IT AMONG LAW PROFESSORS OR

07:03.067 --> 07:05.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST AMONG JUDGES.

07:05.233 --> 07:07.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE, TALK SHOW HOSTS,

07:07.567 --> 07:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOURNALISTS, POLITICIANS ARE

07:09.100 --> 07:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TALKING THE LANGUAGE OF

07:10.433 --> 07:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> AND THIS WAS NOT A POPULAR

07:13.567 --> 07:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEORY WHEN HE FIRST CAME IN.

07:15.600 --> 07:16.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> NO, I THINK WITHIN THE

07:16.567 --> 07:18.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACADEMY WE ALL THOUGHT IT WAS

07:18.000 --> 07:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEAD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 1980s

07:19.800 --> 07:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT HE REALLY PLAYED A MAJOR

07:21.233 --> 07:23.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROLE OF REINVIGORATING

07:23.567 --> 07:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORIGINALISM, BOTH WITHIN THE

07:24.700 --> 07:26.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACADEMIES, SO THERE ARE LOTS OF

07:26.367 --> 07:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCHOLARS NOW WHO CALL THEMSELVES

07:27.933 --> 07:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORIGINALISTS INCLUDING LIBERAL

07:29.700 --> 07:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCHOLARS LIKE JACK BALKAN AT

07:32.900 --> 07:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YALE LAW SCHOOL WHO IS MOST

07:33.933 --> 07:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FAMOUS FOR THIS.

07:34.600 --> 07:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND OUTSIDE OF THE ACADEMY SO

07:35.933 --> 07:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY,

07:38.833 --> 07:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICIANS TALK ABOUT

07:40.433 --> 07:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORIGINALISM AS A KIND OF

07:41.800 --> 07:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STARTING POINT IN CONSTITUTIONAL

07:43.533 --> 07:44.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERPRETATION.

07:44.367 --> 07:45.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> MARCIA, I KNOW ONE OF THE

07:45.467 --> 07:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINGS THAT WILL BE ETCHED ON

07:47.500 --> 07:51.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS STONE IS HIS INCREDIBLE WIT

07:51.467 --> 07:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ERUDITION AND THE RELISH HE

07:54.733 --> 07:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEMED TO TAKE IN THE

07:56.733 --> 07:57.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTELLECTUAL JOUSTING BACK AND

07:57.967 --> 07:58.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORTH.

07:58.267 --> 07:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU MUST HAVE SEEN HIM ARGUE

07:59.733 --> 08:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANY A TIME.

08:00.300 --> 08:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WAS IT LIKE?

08:01.633 --> 08:05.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> OH, IT WAS ALWAYS FUN.

08:05.467 --> 08:08.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETIMES SURPRISING, STARTLING.

08:08.267 --> 08:10.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU'LL FIND THAT LAWYERS WHO

08:10.567 --> 08:11.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REGULARLY ARGUE BEFORE THE COURT

08:11.833 --> 08:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE SAID THAT HE REALLY CREATED

08:13.933 --> 08:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MODEL FOR ORAL ARGUMENT.

08:16.333 --> 08:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WAS VERY VIGOROUS, FAST

08:19.700 --> 08:20.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTIONING.

08:20.967 --> 08:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SOMETIMES HIS COMMENTS OR

08:24.800 --> 08:26.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTIONS COULD BE QUITE BAR

08:26.867 --> 08:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BED.

08:28.100 --> 08:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE COULD CORRECT THOSE BARS TO

08:30.900 --> 08:31.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS COLLEAGUES AS WELL.

08:31.800 --> 08:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I NO HE THAT ONE OF HIS, JUSTICE

08:35.233 --> 08:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRIER, FOR EXAMPLE, MENTIONED

08:37.533 --> 08:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY AND

08:38.133 --> 08:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERPRETING A LAW BASED ON ITS

08:40.300 --> 08:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY WHICH

08:41.233 --> 08:43.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUSTICE SCALIA DID NOT BELIEVE

08:43.467 --> 08:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN.

08:44.233 --> 08:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCALIA WOULD SEND A BARB OVER TO

08:47.800 --> 08:49.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRIER BUT HE WOULD JUST ROLL HIS

08:49.467 --> 08:50.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EYES LIKE HERE WE GO AGAIN.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HIS WRITING STYLE TOO.

08:52.533 --> 08:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR.

08:53.633 --> 08:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE REALLY TOOK GREAT CARE IN HOW

08:56.033 --> 08:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE CRAFTED HIS OPINIONS,

08:59.833 --> 09:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTICULARLY HIS DISSENTS WHICH

09:01.833 --> 09:03.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE FELT VERY STRONGLY HE WAS

09:03.367 --> 09:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WRITING FOR THE FUTURE.

09:05.400 --> 09:07.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> JAMAL GREEN, THIS, IF

09:07.267 --> 09:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND IT IS STILL

09:08.800 --> 09:11.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A BIG IF, IF OBAMA GETS TO

09:11.167 --> 09:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SELECT THE NEXT JUSTICE, THIS

09:12.533 --> 09:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD BE A POTENTIALLY SEISMIC

09:14.833 --> 09:16.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHIFT IN THE COURT, RIGHT?

09:16.367 --> 09:18.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> MAYBE AS BIG A SHIFT AS HAS

09:18.567 --> 09:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVER BEEN IN THE COURT IN TERMS

09:19.900 --> 09:21.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF A SINGLE JUSTICE BEING

09:21.267 --> 09:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPLACED.

09:22.100 --> 09:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SENATE REPUBLICANS WILL DO

09:23.333 --> 09:24.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR BEST TO MAKE SURE THAT

09:24.633 --> 09:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOESN'T HAPPEN BUT IF YOU WERE

09:25.933 --> 09:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO HAVE PRESIDENT OBAMA PICK A

09:27.433 --> 09:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUSTICE WHO WAS CONGENIAL

09:29.233 --> 09:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO PRESIDENT OBAMA'S VIEWS OF

09:31.033 --> 09:32.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CONSTITUTION AND VIEWS ABOUT

09:32.467 --> 09:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAW, HE WOULD HAVE ONE OF THE

09:33.800 --> 09:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT MOST JUSTICES IN THE

09:35.233 --> 09:36.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HISTORY OF THE COURT BEING

09:36.467 --> 09:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPLACED BY SOMEONE ON THE LEFT.

09:38.033 --> 09:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT WOULD CHANGE ANY NUMBER

09:39.333 --> 09:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF AREAS.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME OF WHICH ARE DEAR TO

09:42.567 --> 09:43.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUSTICE SCALIA'S HEART.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU THINK ABOUT THE SECOND

09:45.033 --> 09:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMENDMENT, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT

09:46.733 --> 09:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD BE HIS RULING IN DISTRICT

09:47.600 --> 09:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF COLUMBIA VERSUS HELLER WITH

09:49.433 --> 09:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE IN JEOPARDY WERE HE TO BE

09:51.333 --> 09:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPLACED BY SWUB ON THE LEFT

09:53.200 --> 09:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIDE OF THE COURT.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RULINGS LIKE CITIZENS UNITED

09:55.133 --> 09:56.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD POTENTIALLY BE IN JEOPARDY

09:56.867 --> 09:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS WELL.

09:57.333 --> 09:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD YOU HAVE AN ENORMOUS

09:58.833 --> 09:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHIFT.

09:59.533 --> 10:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF COURSE EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT

10:00.700 --> 10:01.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE STAKES ARE.

10:01.567 --> 10:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE REPUBLICANS WILL TRY

10:02.800 --> 10:04.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR BEST TO MAKE SURE THAT

10:04.167 --> 10:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOESN'T HAPPEN.

10:05.133 --> 10:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> MARCIA, WHAT ABOUT, I

10:06.533 --> 10:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THE

10:07.233 --> 10:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASES IN THE SUPREME COURT'S

10:09.000 --> 10:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CURRENT TERM ARE AS DIVISIVE AS

10:11.133 --> 10:11.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU CAN GET.

10:11.967 --> 10:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS ABORTION, CONTRACEPTION

10:14.200 --> 10:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNIONS, IMMIGRATION.

10:16.800 --> 10:19.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT DOES HIS ABSENCE NOW MEAN

10:19.267 --> 10:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THOSE CASES GOING FORWARD?

10:20.800 --> 10:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, IT DOES CREATE SOME

10:22.133 --> 10:24.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFICULT PROBLEMS FOR THE

10:24.167 --> 10:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COURT.

10:25.100 --> 10:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT STAGE

10:27.133 --> 10:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME OF THOSE CASES WERE IN.

10:29.933 --> 10:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GENERALLY THE JUSTICES SIT DOWN

10:32.400 --> 10:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFTER ORAL ARGUMENT RATHER

10:34.800 --> 10:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUICKLY TO TAKE AT LEAST A

10:36.633 --> 10:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRELIMINARY VOTE ON THE OUTCOME.

10:39.133 --> 10:41.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF THEY-- JUSTICE SCALIA VOTED

10:41.667 --> 10:43.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON A CASE AND THAT CASE HAS NOT

10:43.600 --> 10:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YET BEEN PUBLICLY DECIDED, HIS

10:46.500 --> 10:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTE WILL BE VOID.

10:47.833 --> 10:52.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF IT SHOULD LEAVE A 4-4 SPLIT

10:52.267 --> 10:54.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THE COURT AND THE COURT DOES

10:54.067 --> 10:56.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISSUE A 4-4 DECISION, THEN THE

10:56.767 --> 10:59.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOWER COURTS RULING WILL STAND.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT WILL SET NO PRECEDENT FOR

11:01.433 --> 11:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REST OF THE NATION.

11:03.100 --> 11:04.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WILL ONLY BE A PRECEDENT IN

11:04.967 --> 11:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT PARTICULAR COURT CIRCUIT.

11:07.833 --> 11:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE JUSTICES ALSO HAVE THE

11:12.100 --> 11:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPTION OF ASKING FOR A

11:14.400 --> 11:16.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REARGUMENT IN CERTAIN CASES.

11:16.867 --> 11:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE IN THE

11:19.400 --> 11:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAST.

11:21.333 --> 11:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEPENDING ON, FOR EXAMPLE, THERE

11:23.200 --> 11:24.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE THREE CASES THAT I'M GOING

11:24.967 --> 11:26.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE WATCHING THAT HAVE NOT

11:26.867 --> 11:28.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN YET BEEN ARGUED BUT ALSO

11:28.867 --> 11:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE VERY HIGH PROFILE, THE

11:30.800 --> 11:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABORTION CASE IS SCHEDULED FOR

11:32.533 --> 11:34.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCH 2nd.

11:34.067 --> 11:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANOTHER CHALLENGE TO

11:36.533 --> 11:38.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTRACEPTIVE HEALTH INSURANCE

11:38.067 --> 11:40.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS SCHEDULED FOR THE END OF

11:40.567 --> 11:41.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCH.

11:41.267 --> 11:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN THERE'S THE CHALLENGE

11:43.533 --> 11:46.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO PRESIDENT OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE

11:46.000 --> 11:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTION ON IMMIGRATION WHICH

11:47.500 --> 11:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBABLY WILL BE ARGUED IN

11:48.133 --> 11:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APRIL. ALL THOSE, THOSE THREE

11:49.900 --> 11:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASES ALSO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO

11:54.733 --> 11:56.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIVIDE 4-4.

11:56.967 --> 11:59.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME

11:59.367 --> 12:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEFICIT FOR THE COURT.

12:01.133 --> 12:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COURT MAY FIND NARROWER WAYS

12:04.000 --> 12:06.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO DECIDE SOME OF THOSE CASES IN

12:06.267 --> 12:09.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORDER TO HAVE A MAJORITY VOTE.

12:09.067 --> 12:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT

12:10.833 --> 12:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO SEE.

12:11.300 --> 12:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

OF A SHOWDOWN DO YOU THINK THIS

IT'S GOING TO AFFECT CONGRESS,

13:20.900 --> 13:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT IS GOING TO AFFECT THE

13:22.000 --> 13:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.

13:22.800 --> 13:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT IS REALLY A GREAT TREMOR IN

13:24.700 --> 13:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICAN POLITICS.

13:25.633 --> 13:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE COURT

13:26.933 --> 13:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASES THAT I KNOW YOUR

13:29.233 --> 13:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERVIEWERS ARE FAMILIAR WITH,

13:30.333 --> 13:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT BECAUSE OF THE DIVIDE IN

13:31.400 --> 13:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONGRESS ITSELF, AND I THINK

13:33.433 --> 13:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL COMING DOWN SO

13:35.033 --> 13:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUICKLY AS YOU SAID INDICATING

13:37.100 --> 13:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HE ASK NOT EVEN GOING TO

13:38.633 --> 13:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RECEIVE A NOMINATION FROM A

13:40.233 --> 13:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SITTING PRESIDENT, IS REALLY A

13:41.800 --> 13:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECLARATION OF POLITICAL WAR.

13:43.200 --> 13:44.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND NOW THE WHITE HOUSE HAS TO

13:44.567 --> 13:45.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSIDER HOW IT'S GOING TO

13:45.767 --> 13:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESPOND.

13:46.433 --> 13:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I MEAN CAN THE REPUBLICANS IF

13:47.933 --> 13:50.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY SO CHOOSE REALLY BLOCK A

13:50.567 --> 13:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOMINEE.

13:51.233 --> 13:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF OBAMA PUTS SOMEONE FORWARD,

13:52.733 --> 13:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN THEY REALLY BLOCK THAT

13:53.800 --> 13:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOMINEE FOR VIRTUALLY AN ENTIRE

13:55.233 --> 13:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEAR?

13:56.033 --> 13:57.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THEY ABSOLUTELY CAN.

13:57.967 --> 13:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDER SENATE PROCEDURE, UNDER

13:59.733 --> 14:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SENATE RULES IT REQUIRES FIRST

14:01.000 --> 14:03.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF ALL NOW THREE FIFTHS OR 60

14:03.567 --> 14:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTES OR NOMINATIONS OF SUPREME

14:05.133 --> 14:06.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COURT JUDGES TO MOVE FORWARD.

14:06.867 --> 14:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THEN TO EVEN GET PAST THAT

14:08.633 --> 14:10.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT REQUIRES A BASIC MAJORITY

14:10.267 --> 14:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTE OF THE SENATE TO APPROVE

14:12.133 --> 14:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANY SUPREME COURT NOMINEE, SINCE

14:13.800 --> 14:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY HAVE A FEW VOTES MORE THAN

14:15.333 --> 14:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A MAJORITY, SENATE REPUBLICANS

14:17.100 --> 14:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE THE POWER TO BLOCK ANY

14:18.633 --> 14:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOMINEE THEY SO CHOOSE.

14:20.433 --> 14:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHAT I THINK HAS HAPPENED IN

14:21.933 --> 14:23.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PAST HERE, WILLIAM, IS THERE

14:23.967 --> 14:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE BEEN COMPROMISE CHOICES

14:25.533 --> 14:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEHIND THE NEGOTIATIONS BUT IN

14:27.533 --> 14:28.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AN ELECTION YEAR WHAT

14:28.467 --> 14:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS THINK THEY HAVE A

14:29.633 --> 14:31.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY STRONG SHOT AT WINNING THE

14:31.800 --> 14:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENCY AND THEN MOREOVER,

14:34.133 --> 14:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM, AS POTENTIALLY LOSING

14:35.800 --> 14:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SENATE, THEY REALIZE THAT

14:37.100 --> 14:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY THINK THEIR BEST SHOT TO

14:38.533 --> 14:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GET ANOTHER SEAT ON THE SUPREME

14:39.933 --> 14:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COURT IS TO WAIT AND DELAY THIS

14:41.933 --> 14:43.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

14:43.033 --> 14:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PRESIDENT NOW HAS A SORT OF

14:45.000 --> 14:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRICKY POLITICAL GAME TO PLAY.

14:47.400 --> 14:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOES HE COME UP WITH THE NOMINEE

14:49.500 --> 14:52.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT SEEMS COMPLETELY UNFAIR FOR

14:52.467 --> 14:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS TO NOT EVEN CONSIDER

14:53.833 --> 14:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR DOES HE DO SOME-- DOES HE

14:55.733 --> 14:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COME UP WITH A NOMINEE WHO HE

14:57.400 --> 14:58.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY WANTS.

14:58.500 --> 14:59.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE'S GOT A NUMBER OF OPTIONS

14:59.967 --> 15:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE AND IT'S REALLY NOT CLEAR

15:01.233 --> 15:03.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW THIS GETS RESOLVED ANY TIME

15:03.300 --> 15:03.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOON.

15:03.800 --> 15:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> HAVE WE HEARD WHAT HILLARY

15:05.133 --> 15:06.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON AND BERNIE SANDERS HAVE

15:06.567 --> 15:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID ABOUT THIS YET?

15:07.500 --> 15:08.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> NO SURPRISE.

15:08.267 --> 15:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TWO DEMOCRATS WANT THE

15:09.933 --> 15:12.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT TO PICK A

15:12.467 --> 15:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE AND WANT

15:13.800 --> 15:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT APPROVED.

15:14.600 --> 15:15.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS SAYS THE

15:15.967 --> 15:16.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSTITUTION CLEARLY GIVES THE

15:16.900 --> 15:17.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT THIS POWER.

15:17.900 --> 15:19.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HILLARY CLINTON SAYS THE

15:19.500 --> 15:20.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS ARE OUTRAGE US IN

15:20.467 --> 15:22.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HER WORDS, THEY'RE PUSHING BACK

15:22.067 --> 15:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY HARD.

15:22.633 --> 15:24.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IS THERE A PRESS DENSE FOR

15:24.367 --> 15:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS FOR A SUPREME COURT FIGHT

15:25.933 --> 15:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BREAK OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF AN

15:27.433 --> 15:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTION YEAR?

15:28.333 --> 15:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THIS IS WHAT IS FASCINATING.

15:29.833 --> 15:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO MODERN

15:31.233 --> 15:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT GOING BACK TO THE

15:32.833 --> 15:33.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEGINNING OF THE 20th

15:33.667 --> 15:34.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CENTURY FOR A SUPREME COURT

15:34.867 --> 15:36.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUSTICE DYING IN AN ELECTION

15:36.467 --> 15:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEAR, IN WHICH A PRESIDENT, A

15:38.800 --> 15:39.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TWO-TERM PRESIDENT IS RETIRING.

15:39.967 --> 15:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO YOU HAVE THE SITUATION HERE

15:41.500 --> 15:43.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS UNPRECEDENTED.

15:43.167 --> 15:45.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE DO HAVE A COUPLE OF

15:45.067 --> 15:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRECEDENTS IN TERMS OF VACANCIES

15:47.133 --> 15:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN ELECTION YEARS.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAD ONE WITH

15:50.033 --> 15:51.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT JOHNSON WHERE HE WAS

15:51.467 --> 15:55.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRYING TO CONFIRM ABE FORTAS TO

15:55.767 --> 15:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE

15:58.033 --> 15:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COURT THAT WAS BLOCKED UNTIL

15:59.033 --> 16:00.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RICHARD NIXON BECAME PRESIDENT.

16:00.567 --> 16:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE SENATE HAS ACTED TO BLOCK

16:01.833 --> 16:03.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A NOMINEE BUT IN THAT CASE,

16:03.867 --> 16:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, THE

16:04.700 --> 16:06.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPREME COURT DID NOT LOSE A

16:06.567 --> 16:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEMBER BECAUSE THE SITTING CHIEF

16:08.100 --> 16:10.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUSTICE STAYED, KEPT THE SEAT.

16:10.567 --> 16:11.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THERE REALLY IS NOT A

16:11.900 --> 16:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRECEDENT HERE FOR A POTENTIALLY

16:13.533 --> 16:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPEN SEAT FOR ALMOST A YEAR IN

16:15.633 --> 16:16.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETWEEN PRESIDENTS.

16:16.667 --> 16:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING

16:17.600 --> 16:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPLETELY NEW.

16:18.533 --> 16:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> ALL RIGHT.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NEWSHOUR'S POLITICAL

16:21.167 --> 16:22.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

21:26.500 --> 21:28.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HE PUTS SOMEBODY ON THE

21:28.267 --> 21:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPREME COURT.

21:29.233 --> 21:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT REALLY IS QUITE RECENT.

21:33.033 --> 21:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN RELATIVE TERMS.

21:34.033 --> 21:37.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO RUBIO IS MOSTLY FALSE ON

21:37.167 --> 21:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS ONE.

21:38.100 --> 21:38.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> MOSTLY FALSE.

21:38.900 --> 21:39.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OKAY.

21:39.667 --> 21:41.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN A FOREIGN POLICY SECTION OF

21:41.000 --> 21:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT NEW

21:42.933 --> 21:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY WINNER DONALD

21:44.233 --> 21:46.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP WHO HAS NEVER HELD PUBLIC

21:46.100 --> 21:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFFICE SAID AS HE HAS BEFORE,

21:47.800 --> 21:50.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HE OPPOSED THE 2003 U.S.

21:50.667 --> 21:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INVASION OF IRAQ.

21:51.233 --> 21:52.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE IS WHAT HE SAID.

21:52.467 --> 21:53.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I'M THE ONLY ONE ON THIS

21:53.567 --> 21:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STAGE THAT SAID DO NOT GO INTO

21:54.800 --> 21:55.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IRAQ.

21:55.767 --> 21:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO NOT ATTACK IRAQ.

21:57.200 --> 21:58.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOBODY ELSE ON THE STAGE SAID

21:58.567 --> 21:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT AND I SAID IT LOUD AND

21:59.433 --> 22:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRONG.

22:00.433 --> 22:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I WAS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR.

22:01.933 --> 22:02.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WASN'T A POLITICIAN.

22:02.967 --> 22:04.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> JOHN, IS THAT RIGHT?

22:04.167 --> 22:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THERE ANY PROOF THAT TRUMP

22:06.433 --> 22:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID THAT BACK IN 2003?

22:08.533 --> 22:10.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> NO, HE DID NOT SAY IT, SO FAR

22:10.167 --> 22:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS WE KNOW, GOING THROUGH

22:12.133 --> 22:14.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRANSCRIPTS AND RECORDS.

22:14.567 --> 22:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HE SAID IT BEFORE THE WAR.

22:15.800 --> 22:17.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THREE MONTHS BEFORE WE

22:17.900 --> 22:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY INVADED, SO REALLY

22:19.233 --> 22:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WAS A BIG RUN-UP THERE

22:20.500 --> 22:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN THERE WERE PROTESTS AND SO

22:22.033 --> 22:22.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORTH.

22:22.867 --> 22:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WAS INTERVIEWED ON FOX NEWS.

22:24.400 --> 22:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WAS ASKED, OH, WELL, WHAT IS

22:27.400 --> 22:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UP WITH PRESIDENT BUSH, SHOULD

22:29.800 --> 22:31.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE FOCUS MORE ON IRAQ, FOCUS

22:31.800 --> 22:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE ON THE ECONOMY.

22:32.700 --> 22:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE MOST THAT TRUMP SAID

22:34.800 --> 22:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELL, YOU KNOW, PERHAPS MAYBE WE

22:36.533 --> 22:38.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOULD WAIT FOR THE U.N. TO GET

22:38.167 --> 22:39.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON BOARD HERE.

22:39.100 --> 22:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT REALLY, THE ECONOMY IS WHERE

22:40.833 --> 22:42.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE SHOULD FOCUS HIS ATTENTION.

22:42.967 --> 22:45.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT WASN'T UNTIL A WEEK AFTER

22:45.867 --> 22:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE INVASION THAT HE SAID IN

22:48.400 --> 22:50.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME BRIEF INTERVIEW THAT IT WAS

22:50.367 --> 22:50.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A MESS.

22:50.967 --> 22:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT WAS ABOUT A YEAR AFTER

22:52.400 --> 22:54.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE INVASION THAT IT REALLY-- HE

22:54.367 --> 22:55.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY CAME DOWN HARD.

22:55.967 --> 22:58.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IN TERMS OF HOW FORCEFULLY HE

22:58.767 --> 23:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUT IT, TRUMP REALLY DID RATE

23:01.533 --> 23:02.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FALSE.

23:02.467 --> 23:03.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WAS NOT LOUD AND CLEAR BEFORE

23:03.933 --> 23:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE INVASION ABOUT ALL THE BAD

23:05.800 --> 23:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINGS THAT WOULD HAPPEN.

23:07.133 --> 23:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT LEAST IN TERMS OF ANY RECORD

23:08.600 --> 23:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WE CAN FIND.

23:10.100 --> 23:10.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> ALL RIGHT.

23:10.867 --> 23:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAST ONE, JOHN KASICH IN HIS

23:12.800 --> 23:14.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECOND TERM AS OHIO'S GOVERNOR

23:14.967 --> 23:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOUTED HIS ECONOMIC RECORD,

23:16.300 --> 23:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CUTTING TAXES, GROWING JOBS AND

23:18.533 --> 23:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BALANCING THE BUDGET HERE'S

23:19.533 --> 23:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT HE SAID.

23:20.300 --> 23:21.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WHAT I WOULD TELL YOU IS WE

23:21.467 --> 23:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE GONE FROM AN $8 BILLION

23:22.833 --> 23:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLE TO A $2 BILLION SURPLUS.

23:25.200 --> 23:27.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO JOHN, HOW DID THAT CHECK

23:27.567 --> 23:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT.

23:27.933 --> 23:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DID HE TURN OHIO DEFICIT INTO A

23:30.200 --> 23:30.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SURPLUS.

23:30.700 --> 23:31.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT YOU

23:31.667 --> 23:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY CAN'T GIVE JOHN KASICH

23:33.533 --> 23:35.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CREDIT FOR ANYTHING.

23:35.067 --> 23:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIG ECONOMIC TRENDS PLAY A BIG

23:36.833 --> 23:38.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROLE HERE, STILL THE NUMBERS

23:38.600 --> 23:40.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASICALLY DO WORK OUT.

23:40.567 --> 23:44.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THERE WAS A PROJECTED $8

23:44.100 --> 23:46.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BILLION DEFICIT.

23:46.167 --> 23:50.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN BY 2015, THE STATE'S

23:50.800 --> 23:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RAINY DAY FUND SAID HEY, WE'VE

23:52.700 --> 23:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOT $2 BILLION TO TIDE US OVER.

23:55.833 --> 23:57.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT CERTAINLY COUNTS AS A

23:57.067 --> 23:57.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SURPLUS.

23:57.733 --> 24:00.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO YEAH, MR. KASICH GETS IT

24:00.267 --> 24:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT.

24:01.333 --> 24:04.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
