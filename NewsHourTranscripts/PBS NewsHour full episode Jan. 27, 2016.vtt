GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill.

00:05.539 --> 00:07.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

00:07.374 --> 00:11.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: gunfire
after a traffic stop. One
militant is dead

00:11.745 --> 00:17.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and eight others arrested, while
the FBI surrounds
an Oregon wildlife reserve where
activists

00:17.417 --> 00:19.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
continue a three-week standoff.

00:19.887 --> 00:25.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Wednesday:
on-the-ground takes from Iowa
and New Hampshire,

00:25.492 --> 00:27.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just days now from the first
voting.

00:27.761 --> 00:31.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And a new memorial
to honor those
who served in World War I.

00:32.065 --> 00:34.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWIN FOUNTAIN, U.S. World War I
Centennial
Commission: You can't understand
the country

00:34.635 --> 00:37.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we live in today, you can't
understand
that the world that we live in
today, without

00:37.971 --> 00:42.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
understanding World War I, and
this is our
opportunity to try to do
something with that.

00:42.542 --> 00:45.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:45.946 --> 00:50.150 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:50.250 --> 01:03.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It began on
January 2, when
an armed anti-government group
took over a

01:03.330 --> 01:09.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
national wildlife refuge in
Eastern Oregon.
Then, late yesterday, the
standoff suddenly

01:09.169 --> 01:11.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lurched into violent conflict.

01:11.471 --> 01:17.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, today, questions swirled
about what happened
and what happens next.

01:18.078 --> 01:22.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After weeks of waiting, federal
and state
officers corralled the militia
leaders during

01:22.950 --> 01:24.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a traffic stop.

01:24.851 --> 01:28.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Looked like they were
making some arrests
and clogging up the highway. I
am glad to

01:28.655 --> 01:30.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see an end to this. Hopefully,
it is an end
to this.

01:30.991 --> 01:35.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: They were
captured as they
drove to a community meeting in
John Day,

01:35.829 --> 01:42.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Oregon, 70 miles north of Burns,
near the
wildlife refuge. Gunfire erupted
during the

01:42.135 --> 01:48.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
confrontation, and the group's
unofficial
spokesman, LaVoy Finicum, was
shot and killed.

01:48.608 --> 01:53.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Arizona rancher had said
he'd rather die
than be arrested.

01:53.413 --> 01:56.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jason Patrick is one of those
still occupying
the refuge.

01:56.450 --> 02:01.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JASON PATRICK, Militia Member:
They told us
that we could safely leave.
Well, the group

02:01.755 --> 02:05.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that was leaving has a dead man
in it. There's
another man who left and was in
Arizona, and

02:05.926 --> 02:10.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's in custody. They have said
peaceful resolution
the whole time, so it depends on
what you

02:10.330 --> 02:12.132 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
believe.

02:12.232 --> 02:16.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: FBI officials
refused today
to give details of how the
shooting happened,

02:16.136 --> 02:19.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
while insisting the whole
situation could
have been avoided.

02:19.373 --> 02:23.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREGORY BRETZING, FBI Special
Agent in Charge:
The armed occupiers have been
given ample

02:23.210 --> 02:30.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opportunity to leave the refuge
peacefully.
They have been given
opportunities to negotiate.

02:30.951 --> 02:38.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, these individuals have
chosen to
threaten and intimidate the
America they profess

02:38.725 --> 02:45.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to love and, through criminal
actions, bring
these consequences upon
themselves.

02:45.899 --> 02:50.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amanda Peacher is
with Oregon
Public Broadcasting, and has
been covering

02:50.971 --> 02:52.773 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the standoff.

02:52.873 --> 02:56.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMANDA PEACHER, Oregon Public
Broadcasting:
It is very tense and a very
anxious place

02:56.143 --> 03:02.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here in Burns, Oregon, today. I
think a lot
of people in this community have
been suffering

03:02.349 --> 03:07.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for weeks now, wondering how
this is going
to end. And while some people in
this community

03:07.320 --> 03:11.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sympathize with the militants'
message that
federal lands would be in better
hands under

03:11.792 --> 03:14.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
local control. No one here
wanted violence.

03:14.494 --> 03:19.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I'm seeing a lot of grief
and a lot of
anxiety and uncertainty as to
what could happen

03:19.366 --> 03:24.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
next with the remaining
occupiers still at
the refuge and with the hefty
law enforcement

03:24.805 --> 03:26.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
presence here in Burns.

03:26.840 --> 03:31.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Authorities
arrested the group's
leader, Ammon Bundy, at the
traffic stop along

03:32.012 --> 03:39.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with his brother, Ryan, and
three others,
Brian Cavalier, Shawna Cox, and
Ryan Payne.

03:39.519 --> 03:46.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two other occupiers, Joseph
Donald O'Shaughnessy
and Peter Santilli, were taken
into custody

03:46.393 --> 03:54.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
separately back in Burns. Hours
later, an
eighth militia, Jon Eric
Ritzheimer, surrendered

03:54.234 --> 04:01.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to police in Arizona. Each will
face felony
charges of conspiring to impede
federal officers.

04:01.775 --> 04:08.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The group has occupied the
Malheur National
Wildlife Refuge since January 2
to protest

04:08.582 --> 04:10.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
federal control of public lands.

04:10.450 --> 04:13.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN BUNDY, Militia Member: We
want to make
sure that they remain open to
the public,

04:14.054 --> 04:20.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where people can hunt and fish
and hike and
camp and watch the birds. We
also want to

04:20.760 --> 04:26.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make sure that those who own the
rights on
these lands can use it without
inhibition

04:26.399 --> 04:28.135 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from government.

04:28.235 --> 04:31.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But the local
sheriff, Dave
Ward, warned today that it's
time for the

04:31.605 --> 04:33.373 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
standoff to end.

04:33.473 --> 04:38.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVE WARD, Harney County
Sheriff: It's time
for everybody in this illegal
occupation to

04:38.345 --> 04:48.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
move on. There doesn't have to
be bloodshed
in our community.

04:48.188 --> 04:56.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we have issues with the way
things are
going in our government, we have
a responsibility

04:56.563 --> 05:02.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as citizens to act on those in
an appropriate
manner. We don't arm up.

05:02.435 --> 05:04.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Again, Amanda
Peacher.

05:04.304 --> 05:08.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMANDA PEACHER: Those remaining
have decided
to stay, no matter what it
takes. Many have

05:08.575 --> 05:13.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
told reporters that they are
willing to die
there. And they seem to be
making preparations

05:14.014 --> 05:16.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to sort of hunker down.

05:16.216 --> 05:22.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have heard reports that
they're building
trenches, and that they are
armed, although

05:22.155 --> 05:27.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we don't know to what extent.
And they seem
ready to stay and potentially
fight.

05:28.028 --> 05:32.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Checkpoints have
now been set
up along key routes in and out
of the refuge

05:32.933 --> 05:39.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to secure the area. One of the
occupation
leaders says five or six militia
members are

05:39.272 --> 05:41.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
still holding out there.

05:41.241 --> 05:46.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the day's other
news, the Federal
Reserve kept a key short-term
interest rate

05:46.646 --> 05:52.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unchanged. Fed policy-makers had
raised rates
in December for the first time
in nearly a

05:52.919 --> 05:58.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decade, but, today, they said
they need to
assess slumping markets and
plunging oil prices.

05:58.992 --> 06:03.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That could mean additional rate
hikes will
be coming -- will be slower in
coming.

06:03.730 --> 06:08.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wall Street had
wanted an even
stronger signal that the Fed
will delay further

06:08.668 --> 06:15.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rate increases, and stocks fell
as a result.
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 222

06:15.675 --> 06:23.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
points to drop below 15950. The
Nasdaq fell
nearly 100 points. And the S&amp;P
500 slid 20.

06:23.850 --> 06:30.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The focus of the
Democratic presidential
contest shifted, at least for a
while today,

06:30.156 --> 06:34.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the White House. Vermont
Senator Bernie
Sanders met privately with
President Obama

06:35.095 --> 06:38.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on foreign policy, the economy
and politics.

06:38.131 --> 06:43.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Afterwards, Sanders brushed
aside talk that
the president's recent praise of
Hillary Clinton

06:43.370 --> 06:45.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
shows he favors her.

06:45.338 --> 06:47.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
I know there was some discussion
the other

06:47.207 --> 06:52.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
day about a Politico interview
where he was
tipping the scale towards
Secretary Clinton.

06:52.178 --> 06:53.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't believe that at all.

06:54.080 --> 06:59.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think he and the vice
president have tried
to be fair and even-handed in
the process,

06:59.452 --> 07:01.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I expect they will continue
to be that
way.

07:01.521 --> 07:06.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also today, Clinton
called for
adding another Democratic debate
before the

07:06.559 --> 07:11.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
New Hampshire primary on
February 9. But the
Democratic National Committee
said it's sticking

07:11.331 --> 07:13.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to its sanctioned schedule.

07:13.199 --> 07:18.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Germany, the
ruling Cabinet
has approved new deportation
measures for

07:18.271 --> 07:23.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
foreigners who commit crimes.
Now the German
Parliament has to sign off. The
government

07:24.077 --> 07:29.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is undergoing pressure to act
since a wave
of New Year's Eve violence in
Cologne and

07:29.649 --> 07:32.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other cities. Much of it was
blamed on migrants.

07:32.452 --> 07:37.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The United Nations
launched an
appeal today for nearly $400
million in humanitarian

07:38.091 --> 07:43.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aid to Afghanistan. U.N. relief
officials
said it's vitally needed to help
a surge of

07:43.863 --> 07:49.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
refugees. More than 300,000
Afghans fled their
homes last year, as fighting
rose sharply.

07:49.869 --> 07:55.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The United States
and China
dug in today over how to punish
North Korea

07:55.175 --> 08:01.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for its latest nuclear test. In
Beijing, Secretary
of State John Kerry and his
Chinese counterpart

08:01.514 --> 08:08.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agreed on the need for a U.N.
resolution,
but not on a U.S. call for
significant new

08:08.321 --> 08:10.156 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sanctions.

08:10.256 --> 08:13.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: It's
good to agree on the goal, but
it's not enough

08:13.193 --> 08:19.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to agree on the goal. We believe
we need to
agree on the meaningful steps
necessary to

08:19.632 --> 08:25.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get to the achievement of the
goal, to the
negotiations that result in
denuclearization.

08:25.839 --> 08:29.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WANG YI, Chinese Foreign
Minister (through
translator): In order to
maintain peace and

08:29.809 --> 08:34.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
stability on the Korean
Peninsula, we have
to first achieve
denuclearization there. And

08:34.614 --> 08:39.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only through negotiations will
we eventually
achieve denuclearization on the
peninsula.

08:39.452 --> 08:42.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sanctions are not the goal. The
key is to
resolve problems.

08:42.188 --> 08:47.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: China is North
Korea's lone
major ally, but the U.S. has
complained that

08:47.494 --> 08:51.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Beijing is not using all the
leverage it has
to influence the country.

08:51.798 --> 08:56.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Back in this
country, the governor
of Michigan is defending his
response to the

08:56.870 --> 09:02.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lead contamination crisis in
Flint. Republican
Rick Snyder visited the city and
announced

09:02.642 --> 09:07.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an advisory group to recommend
long-term fixes
for the water system.

09:07.247 --> 09:11.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But at a news conference, Snyder
deflected
criticism that he isn't doing
enough to reach

09:11.751 --> 09:13.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out to the people of Flint.

09:13.686 --> 09:15.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. RICK SNYDER (R), Michigan:
I'm looking
to do tele-town halls where I
can get on the

09:15.922 --> 09:19.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
phone with people and have them
ask their
questions, the citizens of
Flint, because

09:19.426 --> 09:21.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I do care about the citizens.

09:21.261 --> 09:24.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: So, will that be
happening in the
short-term, hear directly from
the people?

09:24.297 --> 09:27.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. RICK SNYDER: Yes. Yes. And
it's already
starting and that's going to
continue. And

09:27.967 --> 09:31.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's why I'm here today, and I
will be back
on a regular basis in Flint.

09:31.538 --> 09:36.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Also today,
environmental and
civil rights groups filed a
federal lawsuit

09:36.476 --> 09:40.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to force replacement of all lead
pipes in
Flint. Governor Snyder said that
might be

09:41.047 --> 09:46.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an option down the road, but,
for now, the
state is focused on recoating
the pipes.

09:46.119 --> 09:50.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Ferguson,
Missouri, has
reached a tentative deal with
the U.S. Justice

09:50.924 --> 09:56.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Department, stemming from the
police shooting
of Michael Brown. The proposed
consent decree

09:56.129 --> 10:02.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was announced late today. It
calls for better
training of police officers and
changes in

10:02.101 --> 10:07.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the rules governing use of
force. The deal
goes to the city council for its
approval

10:07.140 --> 10:09.142 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on February 9.

10:09.242 --> 10:14.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
campaigns
down to the wire in Iowa and New
Hampshire;

10:14.848 --> 10:20.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
greed and sacrifice in the
battle to protect
Kenya's rhinos; women working in
what has

10:20.987 --> 10:29.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
historically been a man's world;
and much
more.

10:29.229 --> 10:44.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now to the race for
the White
House, with only five days left
until Iowa

10:44.477 --> 10:50.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters head out to caucus, with
New Hampshire's
first-in-the-nation primary not
far behind.

10:50.116 --> 10:55.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One candidate continues to grab
headlines
even when he exits the stage.

10:55.221 --> 10:56.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Political director Lisa
Desjardins reports.

10:57.056 --> 10:59.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I probably won't bother doing
the debate.

10:59.926 --> 11:04.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And with that,
the campaign
spotlight made it's near daily
turn to Donald

11:04.631 --> 11:06.332 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

11:06.432 --> 11:08.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Let's see how much
money FOX
is going to make on the debate
without me.

11:09.068 --> 11:10.904 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

11:11.004 --> 11:14.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The previously
center stage
debate star said last night he
will shun the

11:14.741 --> 11:17.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
next one set for Thursday night.

11:17.243 --> 11:23.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His reason? FOX News wouldn't
remove moderator
Megyn Kelly. Trump has said
she's biased,

11:23.616 --> 11:25.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going back to the last debate on
FOX.

11:25.351 --> 11:28.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MEGYN KELLY, FOX News: That you
are part of
the war on women?

11:28.454 --> 11:33.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Trump's latest
shots at FOX
News quickly ricocheted,
becoming ammunition

11:33.126 --> 11:34.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for his rivals, like Ted Cruz.

11:34.961 --> 11:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: I would like to
invite Donald
right now to engage in a
one-on-one debate

11:40.500 --> 11:43.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with me any time between now and
the Iowa
caucuses.

11:43.937 --> 11:48.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Major
candidates have missed
primary debates before,
including former Presidents

11:48.575 --> 11:53.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ronald Reagan and George W.
Bush. Of course,
both of them ended up winning
the GOP nomination

11:53.613 --> 11:57.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anyway. So, is there really any
risk for Trump?
Maybe.

11:57.850 --> 12:01.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A study out of the University of
Missouri
looked at all the debates this
century, and

12:01.955 --> 12:08.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
found that primary debates do
have a big impact,
that they are particularly
useful to undecided

12:08.461 --> 12:14.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters, and that there's a lot
of candidate-switching
by voters after primary debates.
But, of course,

12:15.034 --> 12:17.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump has defied conventional
traditional
wisdom before.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We will make our
country great
again.

12:19.973 --> 12:24.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And, this time,
he's drawing
from his own script. Back in
September, the

12:24.410 --> 12:29.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican front-runner defused
questions
about using a battleship as a
prop by turning

12:29.549 --> 12:34.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this rally into a fund-raiser
for wounded
warriors. He says whatever he
does during

12:34.387 --> 12:37.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tomorrow's debate will also
benefit that group.

12:37.991 --> 12:40.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

12:40.293 --> 12:44.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And for more on
what's happening
on that debate stage tomorrow
night and how

12:44.530 --> 12:49.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters are preparing for the
actual voting,
we are joined by local reporters
watching

12:49.135 --> 12:51.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
developments up close up in New
Hampshire
and Iowa.

12:51.971 --> 12:57.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Paul Steinhauser is political
director of
NH1 News Network, and joins us
from Manchester,

12:57.210 --> 13:02.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
New Hampshire. And O. Kay
Henderson is news
director at Radio Iowa. She's in
Des Moines.

13:02.415 --> 13:07.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kay, I better start with you,
because we're
five days out, so you actually
get the first

13:07.353 --> 13:10.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
word here. How are things
roiling here on
these last few days?

13:10.690 --> 13:13.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
O. KAY HENDERSON, News Director,
Radio Iowa:
That's a great word.

13:13.693 --> 13:19.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fingernails are being bitten
down to the core.
People are worried. It is a
two-person race,

13:19.632 --> 13:25.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it looks like, on the Republican
side between
Trump and Cruz. And on the
Democratic side,

13:25.238 --> 13:32.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's a debate about whether
enthusiasm or
organization will win on caucus
night, the

13:32.478 --> 13:36.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
organization of Hillary Clinton
hoping that
they can surmount the surging
Bernie Sanders

13:36.949 --> 13:38.685 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

13:38.785 --> 13:41.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Does this threaten
-- and what
appears to be real -- debate
walkout that

13:41.688 --> 13:46.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump is talking about
for tomorrow
night, is that having any
effect, or is that

13:46.492 --> 13:48.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
much -- just conversation for
all of us?

13:48.761 --> 13:57.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
O. KAY HENDERSON: Well, what it
has done is,
it has made Donald Trump
dominate the discussion

13:57.336 --> 13:59.105 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
again.

13:59.205 --> 14:01.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what everybody is talking
about. What
is he going to do? He announced
late today

14:01.641 --> 14:08.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he is going to hold an event at
Drake University
on the same stage where Hillary
Clinton, Bernie

14:08.681 --> 14:14.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders and Martin O'Malley
appeared earlier
there week. It will occur at
exactly the same

14:14.687 --> 14:19.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
time that the FOX News debate
will happen.

14:19.459 --> 14:25.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, you heard just
moments ago
that Ted Cruz is talking about
Donald Trump

14:25.164 --> 14:30.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and challenging him to a debate.
So, it is
really hard for those candidates
who are hoping

14:30.169 --> 14:34.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that maybe they can have an
opening here on
the Republican side to break
through, when

14:34.307 --> 14:37.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you have two of the candidates
at the front
of the pack firing at one
another.

14:37.810 --> 14:41.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's kick over to
New Hampshire,
Paul Steinhauser, where there is
also a debate

14:41.180 --> 14:42.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going on over debates.

14:42.548 --> 14:45.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL STEINHAUSER, NH1 News
Network: There
certainly is.

14:45.218 --> 14:49.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We didn't have a debate next
week, the week
before the primary. We had -- on
the Democratic

14:49.622 --> 14:54.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
side, we have had that for,
gosh, 20 or 30
years. So NBC News now proposing
a debate,

14:54.594 --> 14:59.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Hillary Clinton kind of
about-face here,
right? She wasn't in favor of
more debates

14:59.432 --> 15:01.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for quite some time.

15:01.467 --> 15:04.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now she's down double digits
here in New Hampshire,
so the idea of an extra debate,
even if it's

15:04.537 --> 15:08.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unsanctioned, sounds good to
her. Democratic
National Committee so far not
going to sanction

15:08.841 --> 15:12.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that debate. Bernie Sanders, as
of now, saying,
no, I'm not going to do it
unless it's sanctioned.

15:12.912 --> 15:17.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Sanders, of course, the
front-runner up here,
so maybe he doesn't want debates
anymore.

15:17.183 --> 15:21.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wanted more debates just a
few weeks ago.
But, boy, the role reversal we
have seen here

15:21.587 --> 15:25.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in New Hampshire pretty dramatic
on the Democratic
side just in the last couple
months.

15:25.591 --> 15:29.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, Kay, I got to say, hey, I'm
lonely here.
All the candidates are out your
way. This

15:29.262 --> 15:32.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the first day since Christmas
week that
I haven't had a candidate here
in New Hampshire.

15:32.732 --> 15:33.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You took all the action.

15:33.533 --> 15:34.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
O. KAY HENDERSON: You're
welcome.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Paul, believe me,
they are headed
your way.

15:36.736 --> 15:41.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there have been other things
happening
in New Hampshire. It's
interesting to watch

15:41.174 --> 15:44.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the newspaper endorsements all
of a sudden
piling up for John Kasich.

15:44.777 --> 15:48.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL STEINHAUSER: John Kasich
hasn't been
doing it pretty quietly, right?
He hasn't

15:48.447 --> 15:50.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been getting a lot of attention
in the media.

15:50.783 --> 15:54.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, yes, successful town halls,
a lot of
town halls, and he's getting a
lot of newspaper

15:54.987 --> 16:00.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
endorsements lately. John Kasich
now number
two in the polls here, and with
just a week-and-a-half

16:00.927 --> 16:04.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to go, he is right now the guy
winning the
battle for second place. It's
pretty clear

16:04.831 --> 16:08.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump is the front-runner
here by double
digits. Right now, it's a battle
for second,

16:08.701 --> 16:11.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
third and fourth, trying to get
those tickets
out of New Hampshire -- Gwen.

16:11.170 --> 16:13.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: If it makes you feel
any better,
Paul, I read today that Hillary
Clinton is

16:14.006 --> 16:19.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
planning to be in New Hampshire
next Tuesday.
The morning after the Monday
night caucuses,

16:19.278 --> 16:21.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
believe me, you will have more
than you can
handle.

16:21.314 --> 16:25.985 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, Kay, let's talk about
closing messages.
What are these candidates saying
as they go

16:26.085 --> 16:29.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around? Who are they trying line
up and what
difference is it making?

16:29.989 --> 16:36.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
O. KAY HENDERSON: Trump's
message is consistent.
Cruz is out there trying to make
sure that

16:36.829 --> 16:41.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the people that he has lined up
to support
him over the past couple of
years, notably

16:41.334 --> 16:43.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the evangelical community, are
with him.

16:43.903 --> 16:50.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Democratic side, Bernie
Sanders is
really pressing the issue in
terms of striking

16:50.176 --> 16:55.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a contrast with Secretary
Clinton on some
key issues. He visited a union
hall yesterday

16:55.414 --> 17:00.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and talked about the TPP. He is
accusing her
of being sort of late to the
dance on a number

17:00.419 --> 17:04.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of key issues that are important
to progressive
Democrats.

17:04.257 --> 17:09.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary Clinton today was in a
bowling alley
in Adel, Iowa. And her closing
message has

17:09.161 --> 17:13.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really pivoted. Last week, she
was really
throwing some elbows at Senator
Sanders. Today,

17:14.066 --> 17:20.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she was talking about how she,
Senator Sanders
and Governor O'Malley agree on a
number of

17:20.539 --> 17:22.375 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issues.

17:22.475 --> 17:25.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She really didn't mention their
names very
much. She was more focused on a
general election

17:25.211 --> 17:29.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
message and a closing message,
telling people
that being in Iowa had really
changed her

17:30.049 --> 17:31.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and informed her on a number of
issues.

17:31.984 --> 17:36.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Kay, give us the
understanding
geographically where these
candidates are

17:36.355 --> 17:42.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
focusing. You talked about it
being a three-person
Republican race in Iowa.

17:42.161 --> 17:48.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where is Ted Cruz going, where
is Donald Trump
going, where is Ben Carson
going, and after

17:48.367 --> 17:50.069 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
whom?

17:50.169 --> 17:57.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
O. KAY HENDERSON: Ben Carson has
held steady.
He has been going to evangelical
churches.

17:57.143 --> 18:01.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He reminds me a lot of Alan
Keyes, who did
quite well in the 2000 caucuses
here by a

18:01.580 --> 18:07.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
core of supporters who never
really left his
side. Donald Trump is going all
over the state,

18:07.687 --> 18:12.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as is Secretary Clinton,
although Democrats
tend to be focusing on the
eastern half of

18:12.825 --> 18:18.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the state, whereas you have
Republicans who
are sort of rushing into that
northwest quadrant

18:18.130 --> 18:22.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the state, hoping to nail
down the more
conservative Republicans.

18:22.234 --> 18:26.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The way the votes are counted
here is much
different. Democrats really have
to run a

18:26.572 --> 18:31.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
statewide campaign, whereas
Republicans can
truly run up the score in some
of the more

18:31.677 --> 18:35.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conservative areas of the state
and strike
a win on caucus night.

18:36.048 --> 18:40.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Paul Steinhauser,
that is an important
point how different Iowa is from
New Hampshire.

18:40.853 --> 18:45.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you haven't made up your mind
in Iowa now,
you probably don't plan on
showing up to caucus.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, in New Hampshire, it's not
the same thing.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, what are the closing
messages there?

18:49.295 --> 18:51.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL STEINHAUSER: Yes, you're
right.

18:51.297 --> 18:54.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
New Hampshire voters
traditionally make up
their minds late. A lot of
voters probably

18:54.767 --> 18:57.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still haven't made up their
minds. New Hampshire
voters like to go out and see
the candidates

18:57.670 --> 19:01.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two, three, four times, ask them
the questions,
and then they will decide.

19:01.540 --> 19:05.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for the candidates right now
on the Republican
side for that big battle for
second, third

19:05.177 --> 19:10.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and fourth, it is a more of an
-- it's a very
different feel than in Iowa.
You're seeing

19:10.416 --> 19:14.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot more outpouring towards
independent
voters.

19:14.387 --> 19:17.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are about 40 percent of the
electorate
here. They vote in either
primary. You're

19:18.090 --> 19:21.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seeing a lot of pitches right
now to the independent
voters by some of these
Republican candidates

19:22.028 --> 19:26.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and on the Democratic side as
well. The independents,
where do they go? Do they vote
on the Republican

19:26.332 --> 19:29.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
primary or do they vote in the
Democratic
primary? That is the key
question right here

19:29.602 --> 19:31.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in New Hampshire right now,
Gwen.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But, Paul, for all
that discussion
about where independents are
going to go,

19:34.073 --> 19:39.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
undecideds are going to go,
Donald Trump has
been remarkably steady with his
third of the

19:39.478 --> 19:41.213 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Republican vote, hasn't he?

19:41.313 --> 19:44.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL STEINHAUSER: He has. He has
been in the
upper 20s or low 30s. You pick
your poll.

19:44.717 --> 19:49.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen that basically
since late July,
early August, hasn't changed
here in New Hampshire.

19:49.688 --> 19:53.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump is coming back
Friday. The hours
after that debate, he will be
right here in

19:53.426 --> 19:55.227 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
New Hampshire.

19:55.327 --> 19:57.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you mentioned John Kasich
earlier. It's
interesting. John Kasich is
coming back to

19:57.396 --> 20:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New Hampshire on Saturday. He's
going to campaign
straight through here. John
Kasich will be

20:01.033 --> 20:05.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the only candidate in New
Hampshire on caucus
day. Everybody else will be in
Iowa. For Kasich,

20:05.671 --> 20:07.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's all about the Granite
State, Gwen.

20:07.606 --> 20:11.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Does Bernie Sanders
change in
New Hampshire? Does he change
his approach

20:11.410 --> 20:16.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at all, or is he so far ahead
now that it's
just a question of cruising to
the end?

20:16.715 --> 20:21.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL STEINHAUSER: No, they're
not taking anything
for granted, and so he may
change his mind

20:21.887 --> 20:23.589 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on this debate.

20:23.689 --> 20:26.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We may have a presidential
debate here in
New Hampshire on the Democratic
side next

20:26.358 --> 20:29.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
week. Stay tuned for that. His
lead, you pick
the poll, it could be anywhere
from about

20:29.929 --> 20:34.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
nine to 12 points. Bernie
Sanders is not taking
a darn thing for granted here.
Hillary Clinton

20:34.166 --> 20:36.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't want to get blown out by
double digits
here.

20:36.469 --> 20:39.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, this race is going to
continue on. It's
not over on the Democratic side.

20:39.505 --> 20:44.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Kay, there is so
much discussion
and anticipation for this
weekend's final

20:44.143 --> 20:48.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Des Moines Register poll that
everyone is
waiting to see where it leads.

20:48.781 --> 20:53.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tell us a little bit about why
this is considered
to be an important poll and how
it's played

20:53.519 --> 20:55.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out in past years.

20:55.421 --> 21:02.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
O. KAY HENDERSON: This is the
poll that showed
the Santorum surge in 2012. This
is the poll

21:02.595 --> 21:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that showed Barack Obama was
likely to win
in 2008.

21:07.366 --> 21:13.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is considered, it's been said
often, that
this is the gold standard.
People have been

21:13.506 --> 21:18.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
getting lots of calls from
pollsters. And
the woman who runs this poll,
Ann Selzer,

21:18.744 --> 21:24.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says when we call and when we
identify ourselves
as the Iowa poll, we hope that
encourages

21:24.383 --> 21:28.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iowans to be a little bit more
willing to
chat with us.

21:28.354 --> 21:34.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this poll, I can't stress
enough, I have
heard stories about people
actually going

21:34.560 --> 21:38.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the printing plant to try to
see if they
can get the first copies off the
press to

21:38.931 --> 21:40.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
see what it says.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You don't think the
interwebs
have changed that a little bit
now?

21:42.801 --> 21:43.736 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

21:43.836 --> 21:46.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
O. KAY HENDERSON: They have a
little bit.

21:46.605 --> 21:51.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, actually, the chair of the
Iowa Democratic
Party tells a compelling story
about how she

21:51.977 --> 21:56.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
went to the printing press one
night to try
to get the first papers off the
press.

21:56.515 --> 22:01.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: OK. Well, we will be
watching
that both in New Hampshire and
in Iowa.

22:01.954 --> 22:05.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thank you both for joining us.
Next time when
we talk, at least we will have
some, actually,

22:05.891 --> 22:07.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
votes in the can to discuss.

22:07.793 --> 22:12.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thank you both very much, Paul
Steinhauser
at NH1 in New Hampshire and O.
Kay Henderson

22:12.631 --> 22:17.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at Iowa Radio Network in Iowa.
Thank you.

22:17.369 --> 22:25.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
O. KAY HENDERSON: Thank you.

22:26.045 --> 22:41.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

22:41.360 --> 22:47.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
what a board
game has to do with advancing
artificial intelligence;

behind a new World War I
memorial.
poaching

22:58.444 --> 23:04.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, rhino and elephant
poaching has
reached unprecedented levels, as
the black

23:04.316 --> 23:09.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
market price of rhino horn and
ivory tusk
has skyrocketed.

University of California
Berkeley students
Daphne Matziaraki and James
Pace-Cornsilk

23:16.795 --> 23:21.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
traveled to Kenya and found that
the trafficking
networks are often connected to
international

23:22.034 --> 23:26.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terrorist groups and, on the
ground, the situation
resembles war.

23:26.505 --> 23:32.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Ol Jogi Conservancy in
Northern
Kenya is home to 46 eastern
black rhinos.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are 500 left in the world.

23:34.747 --> 23:38.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE GAYMER, Rhino Sanctuary
Manager: We
had two rhinos, I believe, to
have been shot

23:38.183 --> 23:42.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with a firearm, and one of those
rhinos had
its horns cut off.

23:42.588 --> 23:47.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Jamie Gaymer manages
this rhino
sanctuary and protects the
surrounding 58,000

23:47.293 --> 23:49.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
acres of land from a major
threat, poachers.

23:49.962 --> 23:57.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE GAYMER: The enemy who are
trying to
come and poach our rhinos are
becoming more

23:57.503 --> 24:06.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
advanced, investing in
higher-tech equipment,
automatic weapons. Perhaps their
own intelligence

24:06.645 --> 24:12.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is quite well-established, and
we have to
evolve our security in order to
combat that.

24:12.651 --> 24:16.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Black market buyers
from Asia and
the United States have driven
the price of

24:16.755 --> 24:22.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ivory to $1,000 per pound, and
rhino horn
used in traditional Chinese
medicine and seen

24:22.728 --> 24:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as a status symbol to $45,000
per pound, making
it more expensive than gold.

24:28.400 --> 24:34.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE GAYMER: I don't know the
definition
of war, but certainly there is a
very advanced

24:34.173 --> 24:37.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
enemy who are putting us under
considerable
threat.

24:37.443 --> 24:41.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: And this threat may be
linked to
terrorism. The Elephant Action
League has

24:41.780 --> 24:48.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been investigating wildlife
trafficking for
years. In 2011 and 2012,
co-founder Andrea

24:48.320 --> 24:53.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Crosta spent 18 months in Kenya,
concealing
his identity and meeting with
ivory traffickers

24:53.759 --> 24:56.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whom he says were brokers for
the terrorist
group Al-Shabaab.

24:56.328 --> 24:59.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREA CROSTA, Elephant Action
League: Then,
actually, the traffickers
described to us

25:00.099 --> 25:05.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how they organized the pickup in
this no man's
land. Al-Shabaab or Al-Shabaab
emissaries

25:05.471 --> 25:12.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
were coming over with the
technical, you know,
the pickups with their own
scale, paying cash,

25:12.111 --> 25:16.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
always punctual, to the point
that some of
the traffickers told us that
Al-Shabaab back

25:16.348 --> 25:23.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then was a preferred customer,
because no
tricks, no games, paying cash,
and then disappear.

25:23.489 --> 25:28.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Government sources
confirm a connection
between wildlife trafficking and
terrorist

25:28.293 --> 25:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
groups. A 2013 white paper from
the U.S. government's
Directorate of National
Intelligence describes

25:34.166 --> 25:36.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how poaching threatens security
in Africa.

25:36.802 --> 25:42.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Demand for rhino horn and ivory
so outpaces
supply, and is so lucrative,
that criminal

25:42.241 --> 25:47.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
elements of all kinds, including
some terrorist
entities and rogue military
officers, are

25:47.513 --> 25:53.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
becoming involved in countries
across East,
Central, and Southern Africa."

25:53.252 --> 25:57.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The U.S. government and
organizations such
as the Clinton Global Initiative
have tried

25:57.589 --> 26:01.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to address the problem of
wildlife poaching
by reducing demand for ivory and
strengthening

26:01.927 --> 26:06.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trafficking enforcement, but
Andrea Crosta
says those efforts are not
targeting the source

26:06.999 --> 26:08.667 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the problem.

26:08.767 --> 26:12.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREA CROSTA: They thought that
the best
way to deal with this problem is
to put more

26:13.071 --> 26:19.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
boots on the ground, to send a
lot of weapons,
to train rangers. You don't
address this part

26:19.144 --> 26:24.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the problem with boots on the
ground. OK?
You address it with intelligence
work, with

26:24.850 --> 26:26.652 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investigations.

26:26.752 --> 26:31.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Back in Kenya, Gaymer

wildlife at Ol Jogi with a fleet
of aircraft,

26:31.256 --> 26:34.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attack dogs, and more than 100
armed men.

26:34.560 --> 26:38.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMIE GAYMER: To fight poaching
is like you
are in war.

26:38.230 --> 26:42.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: As rangers head out
for their nightly
patrol, they're never sure how
dangerous their

26:42.935 --> 26:45.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
12-hour shift will be.

26:45.704 --> 26:57.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE GAYMER: Unfortunately,
it's got to the
level now where human lives are
being lost.

26:57.216 --> 27:01.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: After reports of
overnight gunshots,
Gaymer is out early one morning
conducting

27:02.087 --> 27:05.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an aerial surveillance, counting
the rhinos
to make sure none were poached.

27:05.991 --> 27:11.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE GAYMER: The first layer on
the ground
are the ones who have to face
the bullets,

27:11.497 --> 27:13.332 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unfortunately.

27:13.432 --> 27:16.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: This time, all the
rhinos, and all
the rangers, were accounted for.
But the threat

27:16.969 --> 27:21.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comes not only from poachers,
but also from
the lure of big money. Poachers
earn a lot

27:21.907 --> 27:24.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more than rangers, according to
ranger John
Kabachia.

27:24.676 --> 27:29.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KABACHIA, Ranger: There's
that issue
that the rangers, they are being
paid in peanuts.

27:29.681 --> 27:32.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why they're being -- some
of them,
they are being turned into being
poachers.

27:32.584 --> 27:39.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's easy for you, even me as a
ranger, it's
easy for me to be dragged in
that syndicate.

27:39.725 --> 27:45.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NARRATOR: Another ranger,
Lakini, was a poacher
until two years ago, when he
switched sides

27:45.397 --> 27:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and decided to protect wildlife,
instead of
hunting them.

27:48.133 --> 27:51.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LAKINI, Ranger (through
translator): I have
been killing elephants since I
was 14 years

27:51.904 --> 27:57.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
old. I started hunting illegally
when I was
a very young boy. I learned how
to use a gun

27:57.109 --> 28:02.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a long time ago. If I was still
poaching,
I probably would have been
killed by rangers

28:02.915 --> 28:04.716 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
by now.

28:04.816 --> 28:07.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE GAYMER: I don't think the
problem is
going to get any better anytime
in the near

28:07.252 --> 28:09.154 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
future.

28:09.254 --> 28:12.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: For now, Jamie and his
rangers continue
their battle against an
increasingly well-armed

28:12.457 --> 28:19.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and well-funded enemy, with no
end in sight.

28:19.865 --> 28:33.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's not the first
time a computer
program has defeated a human in
a big match,

28:33.946 --> 28:38.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but researchers say today they
have made a
breakthrough in the quest to
develop artificial

28:38.584 --> 28:39.885 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
intelligence.

28:39.985 --> 28:43.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has the story
from our New
York studios.

28:43.422 --> 28:48.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Scientists
have developed
a program to beat the Chinese
board game Go.

28:48.493 --> 28:53.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The object of the game is to
surround and
control more area of the board
with markers

28:53.165 --> 28:55.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than your opponent.

28:55.133 --> 28:59.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It sounds simple enough, but Go
is considered
an extremely complicated game.
Google developed

28:59.638 --> 29:06.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a program known as AlphaGo to
defeat the top
human player. The results were
published in

29:06.178 --> 29:07.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the scientific journal "Nature."

29:08.080 --> 29:12.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here's an excerpt of a video
about why the
team at Google chose Go. It was
produced by

29:13.085 --> 29:14.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nature and Google.

29:14.987 --> 29:19.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: It's a very ancient game.
It's probably
the most complex game humans
play. There's

29:19.458 --> 29:22.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more configurations of the board
than there
are atoms in the universe.

29:22.461 --> 29:27.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: In the game of Go, we need
this amazingly
complex, intuitive machinery,
which people

29:27.699 --> 29:31.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
previously thought was only
possible within
the human brain, to even have an
idea of who's

29:31.436 --> 29:33.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ahead and what the right move is
that we should
play there.

29:33.405 --> 29:37.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEMIS HASSABIS, Google DeepMind:
So, our program
combines lots of different
techniques together.

29:37.209 --> 29:43.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for the first time ever,
AlphaGo, our
program, beat a professional
player on Go

29:43.415 --> 29:52.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on even stones, so no handicap,
on a full-size
Go board.

29:52.724 --> 30:03.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I played chess from very
young. And that
was my first game that I fell in
love with.

30:03.235 --> 30:06.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then when I got to Cambridge
and doing
my undergrad club there, there
was a very

30:06.938 --> 30:11.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strong Go club at Cambridge with
very active
players, lots of mathematicians.
It seems

30:11.943 --> 30:13.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to appeal to mathematicians, the
game.

30:13.979 --> 30:18.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Demis was a very, very
strong game player.
He's a child prodigy and one of
the strongest

30:18.517 --> 30:20.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
chess players in the world.

30:20.419 --> 30:24.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was very important to
some people in
the company that we could
actually beat Demis

30:24.790 --> 30:28.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at something. And I decided that
the game
of Go was my only chance,
because Demis didn't

30:28.326 --> 30:30.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really know the game at that
time.

30:30.228 --> 30:34.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEMIS HASSABIS: From then on, I
fell in love
with the game. And since then, I
have always

30:34.332 --> 30:39.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thought it would be a great
challenge for
computers to be able to play
such an aesthetic

30:39.538 --> 30:43.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
game, an intuitive game like Go,
a much greater
challenge than it was to play
chess.

30:43.775 --> 30:47.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: You look at the book, there
are hundreds
of different places that this
stone can be

30:47.679 --> 30:51.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
placed down and hundreds of
different ways
that white can respond to each
one of those

30:51.683 --> 30:55.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moves, hundreds of different
ways that black
can respond in turn to white's
moves.

30:55.487 --> 31:00.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you get this enormous search
tree with
hundreds times hundreds times
hundreds of

31:00.392 --> 31:05.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
possibilities. And, in fact, the
search base
of Go is too enormous and too
vast for brute

31:05.897 --> 31:10.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
force approaches to have any
chance of succeeding.
And as a result, A.I.
researchers have to

31:10.235 --> 31:14.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
turn to more interesting
approaches than brute
force search, which are perhaps
more human-like

31:14.139 --> 31:15.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a way that they deal with the
position.

31:16.007 --> 31:20.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEMIS HASSABIS: It's a very
intuitive game,
so you ask a great Go player how
it is that

31:20.679 --> 31:24.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they decided on a move, they
will often tell
you it felt right.

31:24.116 --> 31:27.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Our science
correspondent,
Miles O'Brien, joins me now from
Boston to

31:27.119 --> 31:28.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
help us understand more.

31:28.920 --> 31:34.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Miles, we have heard of
computers beating
human at chess. we have heard of
computers

31:34.326 --> 31:39.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beating video games. Why is it
so significant
that a computer is getting
better and better

31:39.731 --> 31:42.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and beating us at this
particular game?

31:42.234 --> 31:44.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Because it is so
hard.

31:45.036 --> 31:49.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is one of those games that
if you saw
somebody playing it, you would
say, well,

31:49.107 --> 31:55.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's not a lot more than
glorified checkers.
But it has literally trillions
of possibilities

31:55.514 --> 32:01.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when you start trying to play
out the game.
If you go back to 1997, when the
IBM Deep

32:01.319 --> 32:06.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Blue machine beat Gary Kasparov,
a significant
event in the world of artificial
intelligence,

32:06.625 --> 32:08.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that actually was brute force,
Hari.

32:08.894 --> 32:13.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Each and every move, the machine
would play
out every countermove subsequent
to that,

32:13.832 --> 32:17.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all the way until the end of the
game. It
had the ability to do that
because, in chess,

32:17.569 --> 32:21.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's a limited number of
choices. In the
case of Go, even though it's
just white stones

32:21.940 --> 32:27.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and black stones, there are just
way too many
potential choices, hundreds upon
hundreds

32:27.212 --> 32:28.980 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
each turn.

32:29.080 --> 32:31.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, that builds, and
eventually
that will choke the computer,
actually very

32:31.983 --> 32:36.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quickly. What they did was they
figured a
way to kind of break down the
problem and

32:36.855 --> 32:39.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
make the computer smart enough
to beat a top
Go player.

32:39.558 --> 32:44.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK. This is
coming from
Google. Just a couple of days
ago, we heard

32:44.663 --> 32:46.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an announcement from Facebook.

32:46.431 --> 32:51.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Google, Facebook, Alibaba, these
are all big
tech companies. Why do they have
teams of

32:51.403 --> 32:55.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people working on artificial
intelligence?
Why does this matter to them?

32:55.106 --> 32:57.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, you know
what they say.
Always follow the money, Hari.

32:57.809 --> 33:03.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first and foremost thing,
the short term
here is to make sure you see the
ad which

33:03.515 --> 33:09.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in sometimes creepy ways is
exactly what you're
looking for when you are
browsing online.

33:09.154 --> 33:12.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That is built on pattern
recognition, artificial
intelligence.

33:12.891 --> 33:18.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's why the Netflix
suggestions are so
apt, and that's why what you see
on Amazon

33:18.463 --> 33:22.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seems to fit your needs for the
moment. The
better they get at that, the
better their

33:22.801 --> 33:25.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
business model is for the
present.

33:25.170 --> 33:30.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Medium term -- and this is where
we can talk
about IBM's Watson machine,
which was so successful

33:30.976 --> 33:37.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
playing "Jeopardy" in 2011 --
you could get
to a situation where doctors
could lean on

33:37.782 --> 33:42.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
computers with artificial
intelligence using
this pattern recognition,
machine learning

33:42.888 --> 33:44.689 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do diagnoses.

33:44.789 --> 33:50.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Long term, what Google is
talking about today
is the idea that we would have
essentially

33:50.295 --> 33:56.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
computer scientists with enough
intelligence
to be side by side with human
scientists,

33:56.801 --> 33:58.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
pushing breakthroughs.

33:58.270 --> 34:00.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then it gets into a very
interesting world.

34:00.672 --> 34:05.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You have said
that that's
long term and that that
long-term future is

34:05.610 --> 34:11.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what also scares some very smart
people about
artificial intelligence, of what
its place

34:11.383 --> 34:14.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is in society and whether we
will become subservient
to it.

34:14.786 --> 34:19.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: All of those
things you see
in the movies are, frankly,
possibilities,

34:19.391 --> 34:21.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
if we don't watch it.

34:21.293 --> 34:25.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was talking to one of the
leaders in the
field today, Ray Kurzweil, and
he was talking

34:25.597 --> 34:32.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about the possibility, he
thinks, around 2029,
when machines will pass the
so-called Turing

34:32.938 --> 34:37.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
test, which means you will be
able to engage
in a conversation, a human
conversation with

34:37.542 --> 34:40.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the machine, not knowing that
it's a machine
at all.

34:40.512 --> 34:46.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When machines get to that point,
when they
can read and comprehend language
like we do,

34:46.318 --> 34:52.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then it turns into a whole new
realm of sophistication
and intelligence and ability to
think in a

34:52.257 --> 34:54.092 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
machine context.

34:54.192 --> 34:58.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is important -- and this has
been raised
in the likes of Bill Gates and
Elon Musk and

34:58.563 --> 35:04.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Stephen Hawking -- it's
important that we
make sure, as this technology
grows, and it

35:04.903 --> 35:10.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grows quickly, as we're seeing,
that we keep
control of it somehow, because,
ultimately,

35:10.108 --> 35:13.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these machines are going to be
smarter than
we are.

35:13.311 --> 35:17.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
conversation about artificial
intelligence especially right
now couldn't

35:17.282 --> 35:21.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happen without mentioning Marvin
Minsky, one
of the leaders in this field who
just passed

35:21.686 --> 35:23.555 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
away.

35:23.655 --> 35:26.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm assuming that there are [by
proteges of
his at every one of these big
tech companies.

35:26.591 --> 35:28.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he probably knew that this
happened.

35:28.626 --> 35:34.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes, he was one
of the fathers
of this world, and helped coin
the term artificial

35:34.332 --> 35:38.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
intelligence, legendary thinker
in this regard.

35:38.370 --> 35:43.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I remember interviewing him,
Hari, back
in 2010 for a piece we were
doing on robotics

35:43.241 --> 35:47.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and artificial intelligence. And
what really
struck me was this one
statement. He said

35:47.445 --> 35:53.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the things that are simple for
us are hard
for computers. And what's hard
for us is easy

35:53.418 --> 35:55.286 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for computers.

35:55.387 --> 36:01.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This idea, he thought, that was
so, you know,
really unpredictable in some
ways, until you

36:01.860 --> 36:06.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think about it, is that stuff
that a 3-year-old,
commonsense things that a
3-year-old knows

36:07.032 --> 36:12.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intuitively is very difficult to
teach to
a computer and vice versa.

36:12.504 --> 36:19.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that -- that interesting
kind of paradox
is what drives a lot of the
thinking in artificial

36:19.811 --> 36:23.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intelligence to this day. He was
a great man
and a great visionary.

36:23.181 --> 36:27.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Miles O'Brien,
thanks so much for joining us.

36:27.685 --> 36:36.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: You're welcome,
Hari.

36:36.795 --> 36:44.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ten days ago,
Washington Post
reporter Jason Rezaian was
released from an

36:44.602 --> 36:51.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iranian prison after more than
500 days' detention.
He and three other Americans
were part of

36:51.142 --> 36:56.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a prisoner exchange between the
U.S. and Iran.
A fifth American was also
released separately.

36:56.448 --> 37:01.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Rezaian visited the
offices of The
Washington Post, where executive
editor Marty

37:01.986 --> 37:06.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Baron said he was greeted with a
standing
ovation. He said Rezaian offered
thanks for

37:06.758 --> 37:11.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
efforts on his behalf and sat in
on a meeting
of the newspaper's foreign
reporting team,

37:12.030 --> 37:13.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with his wife at his side.

37:13.932 --> 37:18.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A few days ago, I interviewed
Baron about
Rezaian's lengthy captivity and
what may lie

37:18.937 --> 37:21.439 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ahead for him.

37:21.539 --> 37:24.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Marty Baron, thank you very much
for joining
us.

37:24.309 --> 37:26.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How is Jason Rezaian doing now?

37:26.544 --> 37:29.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTY BARON, Executive Editor,
The Washington
Post: I think Jason is doing
well.

37:29.514 --> 37:35.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Physically, he seems in pretty
good shape.
And he's very happy to be back.
He's in a

37:35.987 --> 37:40.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
position now where he is really
just trying
to reclaim his life, a life that
had been

37:40.925 --> 37:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of taken from him for 545
days. He's
spending time with his wife,
resting and doing

37:48.433 --> 37:52.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really whatever he'd like to do
now, because,
as a free man, he can do that.

37:52.737 --> 37:57.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How much is known
about how
he was treated while he was in
prison? And

37:57.509 --> 38:02.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
is it fair to say he's
recovering from what
happened to him?

38:02.413 --> 38:08.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTY BARON: Well, I think it's
important
to keep in mind that he was in
solitary for

38:08.119 --> 38:15.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
49 days. And, even after that,
he was in a
small cell with an individual
who was from

38:15.326 --> 38:20.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
another country, a third
country. They didn't
share a language. He couldn't
communicate

38:20.231 --> 38:21.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with him regularly.

38:22.066 --> 38:28.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so he was largely without
human contact
during those 545 days, with the
exception

38:28.173 --> 38:33.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the occasions when his wife
and his mother
could visit him, perhaps once a
week or something

38:33.578 --> 38:40.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like that, toward the latter
period of his
time in prison. So, it was a
circumstance

38:41.052 --> 38:44.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that nobody would want to deal
with.

38:44.622 --> 38:47.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And is he
recovered from that
experience?

38:47.992 --> 38:51.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTY BARON: Well, look, it's
hard for me
to say.

38:51.129 --> 38:56.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, that's where his -- for
medical professionals
to say, for his family to say.
I'm not in

38:56.434 --> 39:04.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a position to diagnose his
condition or anything
like that. He seems -- he seemed
in good spirits,

39:04.609 --> 39:10.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and he seems physically OK. But,
obviously,
anybody who's been through
something like

39:10.648 --> 39:13.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that has a lot to deal with and
a lot to process.

39:13.685 --> 39:17.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it
certainly sounds as
if it was touch and go right
until to the

39:17.388 --> 39:19.190 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
end.

39:19.290 --> 39:23.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We now know the Iranians held
his mother and
held his wife even after he was
already on

39:23.628 --> 39:24.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a plane ready to leave.

39:25.029 --> 39:29.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTY BARON: Yes, it was a hairy
situation
there.

39:29.534 --> 39:36.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In fact, the Iranians had
separated his mother
and his wife from him. They had
been able

39:36.407 --> 39:42.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to see each other at the airport
briefly.
And then they put his wife and
his mother

39:42.280 --> 39:47.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a separate room, sort of
locked them up,
and kept them there for a while,
and then

39:47.619 --> 39:52.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after several hours indicated
that the plane
had already left and that they
should go home.

39:52.457 --> 39:56.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, the plane had not
left at all.
They were supposed to be on the
plane. And

39:56.628 --> 40:01.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so this went on for quite some
time, a lot
of confusion. Everybody was
searching for

40:01.332 --> 40:08.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his wife and his mother. Their
cell phones
had been taken from them, and so
nobody knew

40:08.740 --> 40:10.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
really what was going on.

40:10.675 --> 40:14.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the Iranians were really
playing with
them, I think, and playing with
their minds.

40:14.679 --> 40:19.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I interviewed
last week the
lead negotiator for the United
States on this

40:20.051 --> 40:26.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
release, Brett McGurk, who is
the president's
envoy. And he talked about what
a tough process

40:26.324 --> 40:30.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was over 14 months. They were
dealing with
people who -- some of whom had
never even

40:30.762 --> 40:32.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
met an American before.

40:32.363 --> 40:38.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think the U.S. government
did all it
could to get Jason Rezaian out?

40:38.369 --> 40:41.906 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARTY BARON: Well, obviously,
they did a lot.

40:42.006 --> 40:46.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They negotiated with the
Iranians alongside
the nuclear talks for quite some
time, and

40:46.978 --> 40:51.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then kept talking with the
Iranians after
those nuclear talks concluded.
We are very

40:51.849 --> 40:57.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grateful for the efforts of the
U.S. government,
for all of them, actually, from
John Kerry

40:57.689 --> 41:00.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Brett McGurk to all the way
on down.

41:00.158 --> 41:06.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we -- it's hard for us to
assess those
efforts, really. We weren't
party to those

41:06.497 --> 41:11.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
discussions. And so we're just
grateful that
it was a positive outcome
eventually.

41:11.569 --> 41:16.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you know,
Marty Baron,
about Jason Rezaian's future?
What are his

41:16.274 --> 41:18.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
plans professionally?

41:18.142 --> 41:21.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTY BARON: I think that's
something for
him to decide right now. I'm not
sure he has

41:22.046 --> 41:24.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
made any decisions along those
lines.

41:24.682 --> 41:30.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have not wanted to bombard
him with a lot
of decisions right after
emerging from prison

41:30.388 --> 41:37.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after all this time. He is
really spending
time now with his wife,
relaxing. They're

41:37.362 --> 41:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just like any other couple, just
trying to
spend time with each other.

41:41.866 --> 41:45.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't think that he's
really prepared
to make a lot of decisions at
this stage.

41:45.570 --> 41:49.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He will in due time, and those
decisions will
be his to make, not ours.

41:49.540 --> 41:54.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I gather that The
Washington
Post doesn't now have a reporter
in Iran.

41:54.612 --> 42:02.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is that right? And either way,
what are the
plans for the future? Will you
be having someone

42:02.387 --> 42:04.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
covering Iran for The Post?

42:04.288 --> 42:08.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTY BARON: Well, obviously,
Iran is a very
important story, one that we
want to cover

42:08.760 --> 42:10.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in every way possible.

42:10.728 --> 42:15.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's really premature to say
whether we
are going to have a
correspondent there. Obviously,

42:15.867 --> 42:21.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're terribly upset and angry
over how our
correspondent was treated. This
should never

42:22.039 --> 42:26.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been done. It was a grave
injustice.
He did no wrong. And the Iranian
government

42:26.144 --> 42:28.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
produced no evidence of any
wrongdoing.

42:28.479 --> 42:33.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, we would need some
assurances from the
Iranian government that this
wouldn't happen

42:33.918 --> 42:38.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
again. But we're really not in a
position
to decide unilaterally, first of
all, because

42:38.923 --> 42:43.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Iranian government has to
allow us in,
in the first place. And we will
just have

42:43.161 --> 42:46.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to wait and see. I think that
that is a decision
that will be made in due course.

42:46.597 --> 42:50.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Martin Baron, the
executive
editor of The Washington Post,
we thank you.

42:50.968 --> 42:52.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARTY BARON: Thank you.

42:52.870 --> 42:57.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, tomorrow
night, we will
talk with Matthew Trevithick.
He's the fifth

42:57.375 --> 43:03.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
American recently released by
Iran.

43:03.514 --> 43:17.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It wasn't, in the
end, the war
to end all wars, but World War I
did have

43:17.395 --> 43:21.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a profound impact on so much
that came after.

43:21.232 --> 43:26.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now there's a plan for a
memorial to honor
the service of Americans who
fought in that

43:26.704 --> 43:27.371 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
war.

43:27.472 --> 43:31.042 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our look.

43:31.142 --> 43:42.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Pershing Park in
downtown Washington,
D.C., was buried in snow this
week. The two-acre

43:42.153 --> 43:46.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
park is a block from the
Treasury Department
and White House and just down
Pennsylvania

43:46.524 --> 43:49.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Avenue from the Capitol.

43:49.193 --> 43:54.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The statue of the man it's named
for, General
John Pershing, commander of U.S.
forces in

43:54.198 --> 44:00.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
World War I, stood tall above
the white carpet.
If all goes as hoped for by a
group called

44:00.438 --> 44:05.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.S. World War I Centennial
Commission,
this will be the site of the
first national

44:05.877 --> 44:10.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
memorial to commemorate this
country's involvement
in the war.

44:10.314 --> 44:13.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Edwin Fountain is the group's
vice chairman.

44:13.818 --> 44:15.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWIN FOUNTAIN, U.S. World War I
Centennial
Commission: World War I is very
much lost

44:15.920 --> 44:22.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in our national consciousness.
It was subsumed
by the depression and by World
War II. It

44:22.493 --> 44:27.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
didn't have the wealth of
newsreel and nightly
news coverage and Hollywood
production and

44:27.999 --> 44:32.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other media and popular culture
that later
wars did.

44:32.169 --> 44:36.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We're now two or three
generations beyond
the people who fought it. It's
quickly receding

44:36.541 --> 44:41.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in our national memory. And it
shouldn't.

44:41.145 --> 44:48.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: World War I, the
so-called
Great War, began in July 1914
and ended with

44:48.252 --> 44:51.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the armistice on November 11,
1918.

44:51.889 --> 44:58.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Overall, some 38 million
soldiers and civilians
were killed or wounded in one of
history's

44:58.129 --> 45:06.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bloodiest conflicts, mostly
waged in Europe.
The U.S. joined the fighting in
1917, deploying

45:06.470 --> 45:16.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two million soldiers overseas;
116,516 were
killed, more than in Korea and
Vietnam combined.

45:16.981 --> 45:18.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sandra Pershing's husband was
the general's
grandson.

45:19.050 --> 45:22.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SANDRA PERSHING, U.S. World War
I Centennial
Commission: The general loved
his troops,

45:22.553 --> 45:31.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and he really would have wanted
to be surrounded
by images of everybody that
helped during

45:31.963 --> 45:33.664 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the war.

45:33.764 --> 45:41.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it can be a very
nice tribute
to everyone who fought and
served, and to

45:41.539 --> 45:49.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of people now who can be
here and enjoy
it, and look around and say,
thank you. We're

45:49.280 --> 45:51.182 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
free.

45:51.282 --> 45:56.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The commission,
authorized
by Congress in 2013, received
360 design submissions

45:56.754 --> 46:02.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from around the world, and an
independent
jury winnowed those to five,
titled World

46:02.226 --> 46:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
War I Grotto of Remembrance,
Heroes Green,
an American Family Portrait Wall
in the Park,

46:09.600 --> 46:14.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plaza to a Forgotten War, and
the winning
design concept, announced
yesterday, called

46:14.972 --> 46:16.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Weight of Sacrifice.

46:16.874 --> 46:23.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was created by 25-year-old
Joe Weishaar,
just two years out of an
architecture program

46:23.214 --> 46:28.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the University of Arkansas
and yet to have
his official license. He will
work on the

46:28.419 --> 46:32.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
memorial with sculptor Sabin
Howard and a
Baltimore architecture firm.

46:32.289 --> 46:37.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE WEISHAAR, Architect: There's
no way that
I would have imagined that, at
25, I would

46:37.728 --> 46:39.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be doing something like this.

46:39.363 --> 46:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Weishaar lives in
Chicago,
where I reached him earlier
today.

46:42.533 --> 46:46.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE WEISHAAR: What drew me into
the competition
was kind of the realization, as
soon as I

46:46.971 --> 46:54.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saw the competition, that there
wasn't a World
War I memorial in D.C., and I
wanted to participate

46:54.845 --> 47:00.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in that process. I wanted to
help create something
for the people of the war.

47:00.718 --> 47:05.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Weishaar's design
includes
two distinct spaces, including
figurative

47:05.356 --> 47:08.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sculptures and a small park, all
ringed by
maple trees.

47:09.060 --> 47:14.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOE WEISHAAR: The upper plaza
space is really
supported by the walls.

47:14.598 --> 47:21.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The idea, at least in some great
metaphor,
is that public space in this
country is a

47:21.739 --> 47:27.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
granted right because of
freedom. And the
people of the war fought for
that freedom

47:27.545 --> 47:34.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in -- both domestically and
abroad. And so,
again, the great narrative, the
upper plaza

47:34.118 --> 47:44.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is really being supported by the
protection
of freedom, and then the lower
plaza is really

47:44.228 --> 47:47.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a reflection of the past and a
record of the
past.

47:48.032 --> 47:53.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: If the Pershing
statue represents
the great man older style of
memorials, the

47:53.738 --> 47:58.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
commission was clearly looking
to the more
contemporary abstract style that
began with

47:58.209 --> 48:01.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans
Memorial.

48:01.378 --> 48:06.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since then, monuments to the
Korean and Second
World War have also been built
on the National

48:06.150 --> 48:07.918 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Mall.

48:08.018 --> 48:09.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHILIP KENNICOTT, The Washington
Post: The
best thing about this design is
the simplicity

48:10.054 --> 48:15.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of it and the fact the designer
has been sensitive
to the existing parks' sense of
an oasis in

48:15.893 --> 48:17.661 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the city.

48:17.762 --> 48:19.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: But Philip
Kennicott, Pulitzer
Prize-winning architecture
critic for The

48:19.530 --> 48:24.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Washington Post, raised a larger
question
as to whether a national
memorial is needed.

48:24.335 --> 48:27.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHILIP KENNICOTT: We have to
remember that
the first World War is already
very, very

48:27.538 --> 48:32.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well-memorialized, many, many
cities, towns,
squares, villages, they have a
World War I

48:32.309 --> 48:34.145 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
memorial.

48:34.245 --> 48:37.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if we think about memory,
the problem
here is not the lack of places
to go and think

48:37.114 --> 48:41.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the war. It's a lack of
willingness
and understanding of the war in
the first

48:41.152 --> 48:45.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
place. So, we could actually
create a new
way of memorializing that
returned us to these

48:45.723 --> 48:52.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
existing memorials and
reconnected us with
the history and the honor that
is built into

48:52.163 --> 48:53.898 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
them already.

48:53.998 --> 48:57.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Edwin Fountain
says honoring
the war requires a national
spotlight.

48:57.501 --> 49:02.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWIN FOUNTAIN: I think most
Americans don't
realize that scale of that
sacrifice and what

49:02.907 --> 49:06.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it represents in terms of what
our soldiers
and sailors and Marines
accomplished over

49:06.911 --> 49:13.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there. That, to the commission,
needs to be
commemorated with the same
weight as we have

49:13.584 --> 49:16.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
remembered the other wars of the
20th century
on the National Mall.

49:16.120 --> 49:20.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In any case, this
week's announcement
is not the end of the process.
Money must

49:21.091 --> 49:26.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be raised, an estimated $30
million to $35
million, all to come from
private donors.

49:26.697 --> 49:32.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the design, construction,
and everything
else about the project must go
through myriad

49:32.403 --> 49:38.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reviews. Still, the commission
hopes to break
ground in 2017, and dedicate the
memorial

49:38.642 --> 49:43.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a year later, on Veterans Day,
the 100-year
anniversary of the armistice.

49:43.113 --> 49:49.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, yes, they say, the statue
of General
Pershing will remain in whatever
shape the

49:49.386 --> 49:51.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
memorial finally takes.

49:51.822 --> 49:58.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm Jeffrey Brown for the "PBS
NewsHour."

49:58.162 --> 50:12.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally, we
bring you
a profile of Kalei Kipp, a young
female welder

50:12.443 --> 50:17.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from Lebanon, Pennsylvania,
taking on a historically
male-dominated industry.

50:18.048 --> 50:23.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the third installation
of our Student
Reporting Labs series called
Outside the Box.

50:23.320 --> 50:28.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is produced by the aspiring
journalists
at Cedar Crest High School.

50:28.559 --> 50:33.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: According to NBC News,
only 3 percent
of the professional welders in
the United

50:33.998 --> 50:35.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
States are women.

50:35.866 --> 50:38.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KALEI KIPP, Cedar Crest High
School Student:
I think welding has, like,
shaped me as a

50:38.235 --> 50:43.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
person, because it helped me to
be myself,
and it helps me express my
creativity.

50:43.641 --> 50:47.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NARRATOR: Kalei Kipp is a
student at Cedar
Crest High School and is
considering pursuing

50:47.144 --> 50:48.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a career in welding.

50:49.046 --> 50:51.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KALEI KIPP: It's different from
every other
class that is offered at this
school, and

50:52.016 --> 50:54.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's kind of like dangerous and
neat.

50:54.251 --> 50:58.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: She recently met a
professional
welder named Caitlin Rude, and
they discussed

50:58.322 --> 51:00.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what it's like to be a female
welder.

51:00.157 --> 51:02.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAITLIN RUDE, Professional
Welder: I don't
think that there's a big
difference between

51:02.626 --> 51:06.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
men's and women's work. I think
that there's
a big difference between those
who are dedicated

51:06.830 --> 51:09.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and passionate about welding and
those who
aren't.

51:09.199 --> 51:14.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KALEI KIPP: I have been
considering maybe
pursuing welding as a career. I
have been

51:14.705 --> 51:19.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looking into it a lot. And I
think it's really
neat. And, like, you get paid a
lot. And it

51:19.410 --> 51:21.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would just be something really
different to
do.

51:21.378 --> 51:26.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAITLIN RUDE: I think the bigger
picture is,
why aren't there more women
going into welding,

51:26.951 --> 51:31.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or why aren't there more women
going into
manufacturing? And I think that,
from day

51:31.288 --> 51:41.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one, women are fed the story of
pink and princess
and highly emotionally,
sensitive creatures.

51:41.765 --> 51:47.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's this drug that, you
know, we're passing
around, and boys are supposed to
be masculine

51:47.404 --> 51:53.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and hard and strong. And it's
definitely a
false representation of
individuality.

51:53.344 --> 51:56.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KALEI KIPP: Not a lot of people
get to experience
welding. And I think that it's a
really good

51:56.180 --> 52:00.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
experience and thing to have and
know how
to do.

52:01.018 --> 52:04.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CAITLIN RUDE: We are all
different. We're
all interested in different
things. And it

52:04.521 --> 52:08.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't matter, our gender or
our sex, what
we want to do with our lives.

52:09.059 --> 52:11.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Pink and princess.

52:11.362 --> 52:17.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
To see more teen-produced
stories about how
Generation Z refuses to let

52:24.908 --> 52:29.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also online right now: People
have known for
thousands of years that the
Earth is round.

52:29.713 --> 52:35.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that didn't stop recording
artist B.o.B
from starting a battle with
astrophysicist

52:35.519 --> 52:40.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Neil deGrasse Tyson about it. On
our Science
page, we offer seven experiments
that you

52:40.858 --> 52:45.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can use -- you can do just in
case you still
want proof.

52:45.529 --> 52:49.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And tomorrow marks the 30th
anniversary of
the Challenger space shuttle
disaster, which

52:49.666 --> 52:55.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
took the lives of seven crew
members, including
teacher Christa McAuliffe.
Today, a fifth-grade

52:55.539 --> 53:00.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
science teacher shares his
memories of that
event and how he uses space
exploration to

53:00.944 --> 53:05.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
teach his students about math,
science and
the power of imagination. You
can find his

essay on our home page.

53:07.684 --> 53:10.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web

53:10.754 --> 53:14.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Again, the major
developments
of the day.

53:14.758 --> 53:20.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ammon Bundy, the leader of an
armed militia
occupying a wildlife refuge in
Eastern Oregon,

53:20.330 --> 53:26.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was ordered held without bail,
along with
six other militia members
arrested late yesterday.

53:26.303 --> 53:31.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They will each face federal
felony charges
of conspiring to impede
officers. Members

53:31.942 --> 53:38.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Federal Reserve Board
announced a key
short-term interest rate would
remain unchanged.

53:38.482 --> 53:43.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Ferguson, Missouri, reached
a tentative
deal with the U.S. Justice
Department following

53:43.320 --> 53:48.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the police shooting of Michael
Brown. The
proposed agreement calls for
better training

53:48.158 --> 53:53.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of police officers, new rules
governing the
use of force and other issues.
