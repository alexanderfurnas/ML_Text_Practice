CERTIFICATION.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.767
IT ALSO REQUIRES HIGH-TECH

WITH THE SLOW PROCESS IN GETTING

18:14.267 --> 18:16.067
THEM OFF THE GROUND.

BUT DRONES PRESENT COMPLEX

THE PUBLIC HEALTH PEOPLE I

20:49.600 --> 20:49.900
UNDERSTANDABLE

20:49.900 --> 20:51.467
IT'S BEEN YEARS, DECADES, EVEN

20:51.467 --> 20:53.133
WITH VERY LITTLE ACTION ON THI

20:53.133 --> 20:53.433
PROBLEM.

20:53.433 --> 20:56.300
WE'VE GOTTEN TO THE POINT IN

20:56.300 --> 20:57.867
HUMAN HEALTH WHERE INFECTIOU

20:57.867 --> 20:59.200
DISEASE DOCTORS AN

20:59.200 --> 21:03.400
PEDIATRICIANS ARE JUST EXTREMELY

21:03.400 --> 21:04.267
WORRIED ABOUT THIS

21:04.267 --> 21:06.400
BUT, YOU KNOW, ESSENTIALLY THE

21:06.400 --> 21:08.533
FDA'S RESPONSE IS, WELL, THERE

21:08.533 --> 21:09.967
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO B

PRESCRIPTIONS FROM

21:12.633 --> 21:12.933
VETERINARIANS.

21:12.933 --> 21:15.067
SO IT WON'T JUST BE LIKE IT IS

21:15.067 --> 21:16.900
NOW WHERE FARMERS AND RANCHERS

21:16.900 --> 21:19.033
CAN SIMPLY GO TO A FEED STOR

21:19.033 --> 21:21.733
AND BUY AS MUCH OF THIS STUFF AS

21:21.733 --> 21:22.467
THEY LIKE.

21:22.467 --> 21:24.467
FOR HUMAN HEALTH, WE HAVE TO GET

21:24.467 --> 21:26.167
PRESCRIPTIONS FOR ANTIBIOTIC

21:26.333 --> 21:28.433
BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE FOR
