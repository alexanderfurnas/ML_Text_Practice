JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
President Trump takes to Twitter
to defend

00:10.944 --> 00:17.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his immigration order amid
upheaval that brought
thousands across the country to
protest at

00:17.217 --> 00:18.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
airports and on the street.

the chaos,

00:23.357 --> 00:25.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
refugee reaction to the ban.

00:25.125 --> 00:29.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

are these
people who are now banned from
entering the

00:29.429 --> 00:31.365 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

00:31.398 --> 00:36.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are students like me,
graduate students
who are doing their Ph.D.s,
doing their masters.

00:36.637 --> 00:42.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus, Madeleine
Albright, Kansas

tumultuous

00:48.282 --> 00:50.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
first days of the Trump
administration.

00:50.083 --> 00:57.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: All that and more
on tonight's

JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

01:07.067 --> 01:11.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're having guests join me here
at the "NewsHour"
anchor desk in the coming weeks.

01:11.204 --> 01:14.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, it's a familiar face,
our science
correspondent, Miles O'Brien.

01:14.574 --> 01:15.676 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome, Miles.

01:15.709 --> 01:16.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Judy, it's a
pleasure to be
here.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's great to
have you.

01:18.578 --> 01:25.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, now we begin with the
ongoing uproar over
President Trump's order on
refugees and immigrants.

01:25.052 --> 01:27.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Yang reports on this day's
events.

01:27.888 --> 01:34.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: After a weekend of
mass protests
and chaos at airports, White
House Press Secretary

01:34.761 --> 01:37.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sean Spicer insists it's all an
overreaction.

01:37.364 --> 01:41.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
We have got to keep this in
proportion, folks.

01:41.335 --> 01:47.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was 109 people being
stopped out of 325
over a 24-hour period.

01:47.674 --> 01:52.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I know that everyone likes
to get where
they want to get to as quick as
possible,

01:52.612 --> 01:56.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I think the government did a
phenomenal
job of making sure that we
process people

01:56.984 --> 01:58.318 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
through.

01:58.352 --> 02:01.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In any event, Spicer
said, it's
a small price to pay.

02:01.088 --> 02:05.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: We don't know when
that individual
crosses into our border to do us
harm.

02:05.392 --> 02:09.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the idea of waiting when
you don't
know could it be that night,
could it be the

02:09.663 --> 02:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
next day, could it be the next
week, and the
president's view is, I'm not
going to wait.

02:13.166 --> 02:18.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: President Trump
sparked the uproar
with the stroke of a pen,
signing an executive

02:18.305 --> 02:22.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
order banning people from seven
Muslim-majority
countries from entering the
United States

02:22.709 --> 02:24.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for 90 days, effective
immediately.

02:24.411 --> 02:32.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Across the country, there were
protests on
college campuses and at
airports.

02:32.352 --> 02:37.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A federal judge in New York
blocked the ban
for people who were either
already in transit

02:37.290 --> 02:39.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or had arrived in the United
States.

02:39.359 --> 02:44.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Seattle today, Washington
State Attorney
General Bob Ferguson announced a
new lawsuit,

02:44.398 --> 02:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and said he's got the support of
Amazon and
Expedia.

02:47.234 --> 02:52.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB FERGUSON, Washington State
Attorney General:
In our view, the president is
not adhering

02:52.439 --> 02:57.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the Constitution when it
comes to his executive
action.

02:57.244 --> 03:01.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's my responsibility as
attorney general
to defend the rule of law, the
uphold the

03:01.181 --> 03:03.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Constitution on behalf of the
people of this
state.

03:03.683 --> 03:08.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: State Department
employees circulated
a dissent channel memo.

03:08.055 --> 03:12.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It warned the policy will not
achieve its
aim of making our country safer
and that it

03:12.893 --> 03:16.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
runs counter to core American
values.

03:16.196 --> 03:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Spicer said, if they oppose the
policy, they
could quit.

03:19.866 --> 03:24.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Federal judges intervened to
protect foreign
holders of green cards, legal
permanent residents

03:24.905 --> 03:26.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the United States.

03:26.673 --> 03:31.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Overnight, Homeland Security
Secretary John
Kelly waived the travel ban for
green card

03:31.545 --> 03:33.313 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
holders.

03:33.346 --> 03:36.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At breakfast with small business
leaders today,
President Trump said his
immigration order

03:36.750 --> 03:38.585 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was a success.

03:38.618 --> 03:41.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), President of
the United
States: We actually had a very
good day yesterday

03:41.988 --> 03:43.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in terms of homeland security.

03:43.457 --> 03:47.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And some day, we had to make the
move, and
we decided to make the move.

03:48.028 --> 03:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He blamed chaos at
airports on
a Delta Air Lines' computer
problem and on

03:53.066 --> 03:54.501 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Democrats.

03:54.534 --> 03:57.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I noticed that
Chuck Schumer
yesterday with fake tears.

03:57.370 --> 04:01.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm going to ask him, who was
his acting coach
because I know him very well.

04:01.975 --> 04:04.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't see him as a crier.

04:04.344 --> 04:08.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: On Twitter, the
president said
he didn't give advance notice of
the order

04:08.448 --> 04:11.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because he didn't want to tip
off would-be
terrorists.

04:11.918 --> 04:16.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said: "If the ban were
announced with a
one-week notice, the bad would
rush into our

04:16.323 --> 04:18.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
country during that week."

04:18.191 --> 04:23.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A number of Republican senators,
including
Marco Rubio, Susan Collins,
Lindsey Graham

04:23.296 --> 04:27.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and John McCain, criticized the
order and
the way it was rolled out.

04:27.834 --> 04:32.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former President Obama weighed
in with a statement
today, saying he "fundamentally
disagrees

04:32.672 --> 04:34.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with targeting people based on
religion."

04:34.941 --> 04:39.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also seemed to encourage the
protests,
saying, "It's exactly what we
expect to see

04:39.746 --> 04:42.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when American values are at
stake."

04:42.549 --> 04:47.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Mr. Trump signed a
new executive
action today significantly
cutting federal

04:47.354 --> 04:48.321 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
regulations.

04:48.355 --> 04:50.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: There will be
regulation.

04:50.190 --> 04:54.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There will be control, but it
will be a normalized
control, where you can open your
business

04:54.861 --> 04:57.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and expand your business very
easily.

04:57.664 --> 04:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is what our country has
been all
about.

04:59.666 --> 05:04.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The order requires
that, for every
new regulation proposed, two
regulations must

05:04.738 --> 05:06.106 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be repealed.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it says the net economic
cost of new regulations
must be zero.

05:09.709 --> 05:15.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president also announced
that Lockheed
Martin has cut $600 million from
its next

05:15.549 --> 05:21.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
batch of F-35 Joint Strike
fighter planes
after he criticized the cost.

05:21.721 --> 05:23.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That Obama statement is not
worthy.

05:23.557 --> 05:28.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On his way out, aides suggested
that the former
president would give the new
president what

05:28.395 --> 05:33.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he said he was grateful to
former President
Bush for giving him, silence.

05:33.133 --> 05:37.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But in his final press
conference, he said
he was tempted to speak out if
he saw core

05:37.470 --> 05:40.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
American values being
threatened.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Turns out he didn't wait very
long -- Miles.

05:42.275 --> 05:46.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: John, a couple of
other interesting
bits at the briefing.

05:46.646 --> 05:52.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reorganization of the
National Security
Council, the permanent or
principal seats,

05:52.786 --> 05:57.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
putting a political strategist
in one of those,
Steve Bannon, did Mr. Spicer
address that?

05:57.424 --> 06:00.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, a lot of
eyebrows being
raised about that.

06:00.393 --> 06:05.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Spicer defended it, noted that
Bannon had
been a Naval officer, even
though that was

06:05.565 --> 06:07.801 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more than four decades ago.

06:07.834 --> 06:13.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also pointed out that David
Axelrod, the
political adviser to President
Obama, occasionally

06:13.840 --> 06:20.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sat in on some NSC meetings and
said that
by putting Bannon and giving him
a seat permanently

06:20.780 --> 06:23.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the NSC, it was their bow to
transparency.

06:23.850 --> 06:28.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Speaking of
seats, empty seat
on the Supreme Court, big
announcement on

06:28.655 --> 06:29.623 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

06:29.656 --> 06:31.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tell us about it.

06:31.524 --> 06:33.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Tomorrow night in
prime time, just
like "The Apprentice," he is
going to announce

06:33.059 --> 06:35.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it live on television.

06:35.095 --> 06:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You may remember he tweeted last
week that
the announcement would be coming
on Thursday.

06:40.433 --> 06:41.668 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Why the change?

06:41.701 --> 06:45.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Spicer said because he wanted to
-- Miles.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: John Yang at the
White House,
thank you.

06:47.540 --> 06:51.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in the day's
other news:
The president's immigration
order provoked

06:51.878 --> 06:54.347 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a growing backlash overseas.

06:54.381 --> 06:58.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Iraq, members of parliament
voted to demand
retaliation.

06:58.385 --> 07:01.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Under the order, Iraqis are now
banned from
entering the U.S.

07:01.755 --> 07:06.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in London, Britain's
foreign secretary
said Mr. Trump's planned state
visit will

07:06.593 --> 07:09.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
go ahead, despite the
immigration order.

07:09.229 --> 07:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BORIS JOHNSON, British Foreign
Minister: I
have said that it's divisive, I
have said

07:13.166 --> 07:16.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that it's wrong, and I have said
that it stigmatizes
people on grounds of their
nationality.

07:16.670 --> 07:25.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what I will not do is
disengage from conversations
with our American friends and
partners in

07:25.178 --> 07:31.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
such a way as to do material
damage to the
interests of U.K. citizens.

07:31.184 --> 07:35.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: More than a
million British
citizens have petitioned against
the Trump

07:35.422 --> 07:37.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
visit set for later this year.

07:37.290 --> 07:40.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: President Trump's
pick to be
secretary of state survived a
key procedural

07:41.027 --> 07:43.029 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
vote in the Senate tonight.

07:43.063 --> 07:48.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Republicans resisted a
Democratic push to
delay action on Rex Tillerson, a
former ExxonMobil

07:48.735 --> 07:49.936 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
CEO.

07:49.969 --> 07:52.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That clears the way for a

JUDY WOODRUFF: In Yemen,
security officials
say a suspected U.S. drone
strike killed two

07:58.244 --> 07:59.879 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
al-Qaida militants today.

07:59.913 --> 08:05.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It came a day after U.S.
commandos killed
three alleged leaders of
al-Qaida's branch

08:05.251 --> 08:06.586 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Yemen.

08:06.619 --> 08:10.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thirty other people and one U.S.
Navy SEAL
died in the Sunday raid.

08:11.024 --> 08:14.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was the first U.S. combat
death under President
Trump.

08:14.427 --> 08:18.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Police in Quebec
City, Canada,
are looking for a motive after a
shooting

08:18.064 --> 08:20.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at a mosque left six dead last
night.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
A suspect is in custody.

08:22.836 --> 08:26.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 50 people were in the
mosque at
the time of the attack.

08:26.840 --> 08:30.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officials say it was an act of
terror, and
they're calling for unity.

08:30.777 --> 08:36.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Normal in times of crisis
that everyone
will speak with the same voice
of tolerance,

08:36.182 --> 08:37.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
integration and inclusion.

08:37.917 --> 08:45.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The real challenge will be two
weeks from
now to continue saying this, to
refuse any

08:45.825 --> 08:48.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
compromise towards intolerance
or exclusion.

08:48.895 --> 08:53.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Later in
Parliament, Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau spoke
directly to

08:53.233 --> 08:59.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the more than one million in
Canada and he
said to them, "We are with you."

08:59.272 --> 09:03.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Philippines'
national police
forces will no longer take part
in a sweeping

09:04.010 --> 09:06.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anti-drug campaign in that
country.

09:06.546 --> 09:10.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The crackdown began in July,
when President
Rodrigo Duterte took office.

09:11.017 --> 09:14.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Since then, about 7,000 people
have been killed.

09:14.421 --> 09:19.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the national police chief
said he's calling
a halt after rogue officers
kidnapped and

09:19.692 --> 09:22.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
killed a South Korean
businessman for money.

09:22.729 --> 09:27.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The man accused
of killing
five people and wounding six at
the Fort Lauderdale

09:27.200 --> 09:29.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Airport pleaded not guilty
today.

09:29.469 --> 09:34.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Esteban Santiago appeared in
federal court
on 22 charges from the shooting
this month.

09:35.008 --> 09:40.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Authorities say he opened fire
in the baggage
claim area with a handgun he'd
stowed in a

09:40.146 --> 09:41.314 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
checked bag.

09:41.347 --> 09:43.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He'd flown in from Anchorage,
Alaska.

09:43.149 --> 09:48.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wall Street had a
rough day
as the president's immigration
order depressed

09:48.154 --> 09:49.556 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
airline stocks.

09:49.589 --> 09:54.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 122
points to fall back below 20000.

09:54.661 --> 09:59.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 47, and the S&amp;P
500 gave up
12.

09:59.199 --> 10:04.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And doctors in
Houston released
former President George H.W.
Bush from a Houston

10:04.070 --> 10:05.472 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
hospital today.

10:05.505 --> 10:08.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He'd been there for two weeks
with pneumonia.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.776 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mr. Bush is 92.

10:09.809 --> 10:14.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His wife, Barbara, now 91, was
released last
week from the same hospital.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She was treated for bronchitis.

10:16.983 --> 10:21.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
we did in
to reactions to the travel ban,
including

10:21.287 --> 10:27.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from former Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright
and Kansas Secretary of State
Kris Kobach;

10:27.160 --> 10:30.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
plus, are you addicted to your
smartphone?

10:30.196 --> 10:33.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A former Google employee worries
we all are.

10:33.066 --> 10:39.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will tell you how he's trying
to change
that.

10:39.072 --> 10:50.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As we reported
earlier, President
Trump's executive order barring
people coming

10:50.717 --> 10:55.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to the U.S. from certain
countries sparked
widespread protests and
confusion over the

10:55.688 --> 10:57.557 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weekend.

10:57.590 --> 11:01.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The "NewsHour"'s William
Brangham spent much
of yesterday tracking that
response, and talking

11:01.694 --> 11:04.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with people who've been affected
by the order.

11:04.230 --> 11:09.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The arrivals
gate at any
airport, not just here at Dulles
outside of

11:09.035 --> 11:15.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Washington, is normally a quiet
scene of warm
greetings and family reunions,
but not this

11:15.208 --> 11:19.479 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weekend.

11:19.512 --> 11:24.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Protests erupted within hours
Friday and continued
all weekend, after President
Trump issued

11:24.284 --> 11:31.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his sweeping executive order
temporarily barring
all refugees and travelers from
seven majority-Muslim

11:31.524 --> 11:32.492 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
nations.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Syrian refugees were blocked
indefinitely.

11:34.894 --> 11:38.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president said it was
crucial to keeping
America safe.

11:38.665 --> 11:42.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), President of
the United
States: Protection of the nation
from foreign

11:42.735 --> 11:45.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
terrorist entry into the United
States.

11:45.772 --> 11:47.807 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We all know what that means.

11:47.840 --> 11:51.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Trump
administration
insisted again today that
coverage of the

11:51.945 --> 11:53.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
problems has been overblown.

11:53.780 --> 11:58.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But the orders did cause
widespread confusion
at the nation's airports.

11:58.151 --> 11:59.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Who was turned away?

11:59.519 --> 12:01.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Who had been detained?

12:01.187 --> 12:03.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Did having a green card mean you
could enter?

12:03.456 --> 12:08.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to media reports,
customs and immigration
officials had little advance
warning of the

12:08.428 --> 12:11.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
order, a claim the White House
denied.

12:11.631 --> 12:16.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An army of volunteer lawyers
gathered to help
families of those detained.

12:16.102 --> 12:18.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mariam Masumi is an immigration
attorney in
Northern Virginia.

12:18.504 --> 12:19.472 align:left position:37.5%,start line:80% size:62.5%
®MD-BO /
MARIAM MASUMI, Immigration
Attorney: There

12:19.505 --> 12:21.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was no communication between any
of the agencies.

12:21.874 --> 12:26.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that this order was just
issued without
any cooperation, collaboration.

12:26.813 --> 12:30.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it's caused a lot of
confusion on the
part of so many agencies.

12:30.383 --> 12:32.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Without the knowledge and
whether those people
are back there, we can't help.

12:32.785 --> 12:35.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Even members
of Congress
said they were in the dark.

12:36.022 --> 12:40.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Representative Don Beyer, a
Virginia Democrat,
was at Dulles trying to find out
if people

12:40.793 --> 12:45.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being detained had access to
lawyers, as a
federal judge had ordered.

12:45.198 --> 12:48.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Beyer said he couldn't even find
out how many
people were being held.

12:48.635 --> 12:52.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, you, as a member of
Congress, cannot get
an answer as to how many people
our government

12:52.872 --> 12:53.840 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is holding here?

12:53.873 --> 12:55.074 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DON BEYER (D), Virginia: That's
exactly correct
right now.

12:56.976 --> 13:01.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This notion of cooperation
between the executive
branch and the legislative
branch seems to

13:01.314 --> 13:02.281 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have totally broken down.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And it wasn't
just Democrats.

13:04.384 --> 13:08.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congresswoman Barbara Comstock
is a Republican
who's long advocated for
stricter vetting

13:08.888 --> 13:10.089 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of immigrants.

13:10.123 --> 13:13.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But she said this move was too
broad and poorly
executed.

13:13.993 --> 13:15.628 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

13:15.662 --> 13:22.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARBARA COMSTOCK (R), Virginia:
We need to
go back to the drawing board on
this.

13:22.468 --> 13:23.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As I have consistently said, we
shouldn't
have a ban on people coming to
this country

13:23.469 --> 13:25.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
based on religion.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The executive
order caused
problems outside the U.S. as
well.

13:26.572 --> 13:29.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With the policy issued so
swiftly, Ali Abdi
didn't know what to do.

13:29.942 --> 13:35.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Abdi is a Yale Ph.D. student
originally from
Iran who was studying abroad.

13:35.214 --> 13:38.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He lives in the U.S. and has a
green card.

13:38.051 --> 13:43.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even though officials have
clarified that
means he can come home, he was
worried about

13:43.256 --> 13:44.323 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
trying.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke with him via Skype from
Dubai this
morning.

13:46.159 --> 13:49.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALI ABDI, Green Card Holder:
There has been
even changes in the way the
order has been

13:49.929 --> 13:52.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interpreted over the last 48
hours.

13:52.498 --> 13:58.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I am very, very hopeful that
the other
side of the U.S., which is not
bigotry and

13:58.337 --> 14:00.807 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
racism, changes the status quo.

14:00.840 --> 14:05.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: He says people
like him
are not the ones to be feared.

14:05.211 --> 14:09.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALI ABDI: Let's see who are
these people who
are now banned from entering the
country.

14:09.449 --> 14:16.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are students like me,
graduate students
who are doing their Ph.D.s,
doing their master's.

14:16.989 --> 14:22.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they were later meant to
serve the American
public by teaching there, by
producing knowledge

14:22.895 --> 14:24.664 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

14:24.697 --> 14:29.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Another Ph.D.
student and
green card holder tried her luck
getting back

14:29.569 --> 14:31.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
home on Friday night.

14:31.137 --> 14:35.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nisrin Elamin is Sudanese, but
she's lived
in the U.S. for 20 years.

14:35.942 --> 14:40.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's getting her Ph.D. at
Stanford, but was
in Sudan doing research.

14:40.346 --> 14:42.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Her return was a homecoming like
no other.

14:42.949 --> 14:47.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NISRIN ELAMIN, Green Card
Holder: I was taken
to a room and I was patted down,
which was

14:48.020 --> 14:52.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
quite uncomfortable because I
was touched
in my chest and groin area.

14:52.925 --> 14:58.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then I was handcuffed very
briefly, at
which point I started to cry,
not so much

14:58.865 --> 15:04.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because of the handcuffs, but
because, at
that point, I felt like I was
probably going

15:05.004 --> 15:06.873 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to get deported.

15:06.906 --> 15:10.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: After more
than five hours
at JFK Airport in New York,
Elamin was released

15:10.910 --> 15:16.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and told it would be best for
her not to leave
the U.S. again, leaving her
potentially separated

15:16.649 --> 15:18.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from her family indefinitely.

15:18.518 --> 15:24.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NISRIN ELAMIN: But the order, as
it stands
right now, my parents aren't
green card holders,

15:24.056 --> 15:32.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they, at this point, will
not be able
to apply for a visa to enter the
United States

15:32.765 --> 15:34.534 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
if they wanted to visit me.

15:34.567 --> 15:38.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Similarly, my sister, who lives
in Australia
and is a dual citizen, cannot
apply for a

15:38.971 --> 15:40.907 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
visa.

15:40.940 --> 15:44.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, at present, we're in three
different continents,
and we can't see each other
because I'm also

15:44.510 --> 15:47.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not comfortable traveling.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that makes me very sad.

15:49.048 --> 15:50.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It also scares me a little bit.

15:50.850 --> 15:52.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZAINAB CHAUDRY, Council on
American-Islamic
Relations: With just a stroke of
a pen, people's

15:52.084 --> 15:53.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lives have changed completely.

15:53.820 --> 15:58.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Zainab Chaudry
is with the
Council on American-Islamic
relations.

15:58.057 --> 16:02.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She arranged for some speakers
to come to
this Muslim center in Maryland
to help answer

16:02.528 --> 16:04.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people's questions.

16:04.530 --> 16:09.335 align:left position:0%,start line:66.67% size:100%
Her group, CAIR, filed a federal
lawsuit today
challenging the
constitutionality of the
president's

16:09.368 --> 16:10.803 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
order.

16:10.837 --> 16:12.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZAINAB CHAUDRY: I received a
phone call from
a man who's not a citizen.

16:12.939 --> 16:16.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a legal permanent citizen,
LPR, and his
mother passed away in Iran.

16:16.943 --> 16:21.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he was advised by his
attorney to not
travel to Iran to bury his
mother because

16:21.848 --> 16:25.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he wouldn't be able -- chances
are he wouldn't
be able to return to the United
States.

16:25.618 --> 16:33.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Last night at
his mosque
in Washington, D.C., Imam Talib
Shareef said

16:33.092 --> 16:36.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even American citizens in his
congregation
are afraid.

16:36.395 --> 16:38.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TALIB SHAREEF, Imam: They're
afraid because
they don't know.

16:38.764 --> 16:42.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obviously, there's a sense of
anger right
now that this is happening.

16:42.935 --> 16:46.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're saying, how could this
have been allowed
to happen?

16:46.539 --> 16:49.108 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're contributing citizens.

16:49.141 --> 16:50.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They haven't done anything
wrong.

16:50.543 --> 16:52.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have no intentions of doing
anything
wrong.

16:52.445 --> 16:56.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: He's worried
these fears
could fester into anger, and
stir the pot

16:56.482 --> 16:58.384 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of resentment.

16:58.417 --> 17:01.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TALIB SHAREEF: We're now going
to create enemies
and we're going to divide the
country further.

17:01.554 --> 17:06.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are hearing significant
people from the
administration saying, we're
just getting

17:06.092 --> 17:07.059 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
started.

17:07.093 --> 17:08.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, what does that mean?

17:08.928 --> 17:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What does that mean for the
citizens who share
a religious label that has been
targeted?

17:13.933 --> 17:15.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What does that mean?

17:15.768 --> 17:19.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Trump
administration
says that, in time, people will
see the value

17:19.038 --> 17:22.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of this action and it will
improve the nation's
security.

17:22.541 --> 17:28.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, meanwhile, protesters,
lawyers and religious
groups alike continue to watch,
warily.

17:28.915 --> 17:32.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour" I'm
William Brangham
in Washington, D.C.

17:32.785 --> 17:38.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, for more on
the executive
order on refugees and visa
holders and changes

17:38.658 --> 17:42.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president to the makeup of
the National
Security Council, we turn first
to former

17:42.662 --> 17:44.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.

17:44.330 --> 17:48.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She served as the United States'
top diplomat
during the Clinton
administration.

17:48.367 --> 17:52.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we spoke a short time ago,
I began by
asking her reaction to the Trump
White House

17:52.838 --> 17:55.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ban on immigrants from seven
countries.

17:55.207 --> 17:58.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT, Former U.S.
Secretary
of State: Judy, I'm appalled,
because it's

17:58.744 --> 18:01.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
done everything except keep
America safer.

18:01.247 --> 18:07.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And let me just say, I kind of
have looked
at things thinking that they
made this executive

18:07.853 --> 18:11.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
action without really
understanding what it's
all about.

18:11.724 --> 18:18.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it was unprepared, I would
say, because
they didn't really see how the
government

18:18.230 --> 18:20.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
works.

18:20.199 --> 18:25.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They didn't really contact the
various departments
that are part of this homeland
security, trying

18:25.604 --> 18:31.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to figure out what would happen
once you do
something like this from the
Oval Office.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.845 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, unprepared.

18:32.878 --> 18:37.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then I think, also, part of
the problem
was, they didn't understand what
I say the

18:37.483 --> 18:42.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unintended consequences of this,
because the
truth is that the countries that
have been

18:42.254 --> 18:49.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
designated are now reacting,
creating more
problems for us, and then
banning people -- our

18:49.261 --> 18:50.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people from going there.

18:50.763 --> 18:55.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For instance, in Iraq, how do we
protect our
troops?

18:55.801 --> 18:58.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What about the people that are
interpreting?

18:58.904 --> 19:02.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then I think all of it is
based on untrue
facts.

19:02.708 --> 19:07.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think it is a very
serious problem
in terms of how the whole system
works.

19:07.346 --> 19:09.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me take
a couple
of those, one at a time.

19:09.782 --> 19:13.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What they're saying is if --
they're saying,
if they had let the rest of the
government

19:13.119 --> 19:15.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know what they were doing, that
it would have
leaked, and they said there
would have been

19:15.721 --> 19:17.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a flood of people trying to get
in.

19:17.990 --> 19:23.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they also say that they're
basically only
following what the Obama
administration had

19:23.763 --> 19:28.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
done a few years ago in listing
countries
that were the most for the
United States to

19:28.968 --> 19:30.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fear in terms of terrorism.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Well, the
latter is true.

19:32.605 --> 19:35.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What was happened was, there was
an incident
where something was coming out
of Iraq.

19:36.008 --> 19:40.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were concerned about what
the facts really
were.

19:40.679 --> 19:43.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They wanted to re-vet some
people.

19:43.249 --> 19:47.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They didn't have enough manpower
to do that,
so things slowed down.

19:47.486 --> 19:51.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there is nothing like that
that happened
in the Obama administration.

19:51.157 --> 19:56.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the excuse about not
letting others
know, first of all, they need to
understand

19:56.529 --> 20:02.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the government, in fact,
when people
trust each other, doesn't leak
out when it's

20:02.435 --> 20:04.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an important issue.

20:04.303 --> 20:09.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But how can you not let the
departments that
have something to do with
executing the order

20:09.408 --> 20:11.343 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not know?

20:11.377 --> 20:17.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because I think that they were
genuinely surprised
by, you know, how slow it was,
what happened

20:17.383 --> 20:21.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when they detained people, what
happened then
when there were demonstrations
against it.

20:21.921 --> 20:27.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I'm willing to say they were
surprised
at the reaction to it, but
that's a sign of

20:27.426 --> 20:29.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the fact they didn't understand
what they
were doing.

20:29.395 --> 20:34.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The other
argument they make,
Secretary Albright, is this will
all settle

20:34.300 --> 20:39.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out, it's just the hurly-burly
of the first
few days, that it's only 109
people, they

20:39.872 --> 20:45.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said, out of over 300,000
travelers over the
weekend, and that we're all
making too much

20:45.644 --> 20:47.413 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of this.

20:47.446 --> 20:50.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: No, we're
not, because
what it's shown is that the
United States

20:50.082 --> 20:55.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not prepared to deal with
something that
the president has decided he
wants to do,

20:55.321 --> 20:58.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so it puts real question as to
how the system
works.

20:58.791 --> 21:04.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It also has undermined other
countries' trust
in what we do, trying to figure
out who in

21:04.830 --> 21:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the department is responsible
for what.

21:07.266 --> 21:13.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then I actually think it's a
gift to those
that hate us, because now what
has happened

21:13.339 --> 21:19.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is ISIS is really kind of
saying, yes, right,
this is what America is like,
you can't trust

21:19.044 --> 21:20.813 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

21:20.846 --> 21:27.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think they basically
were completely
unprepared for what they kind of
unwrapped,

21:27.319 --> 21:30.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
without really considering the
unintended
consequences, and I don't think
it makes us

21:30.856 --> 21:32.591 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
any safer.

21:32.625 --> 21:35.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the other
moves the
Trump administration made over
the weekend

21:35.895 --> 21:43.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was to announce a reorganization
of the National
Security Council, which, in
effect, appears

21:43.502 --> 21:48.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to downgrade the role of the
director of national
intelligence, and also the
chairman of the

21:48.941 --> 21:51.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Joint Chiefs of Staff.

21:51.410 --> 21:56.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They had also downgraded the
role of the CIA
director, but they now in the
last -- today

21:56.515 --> 21:58.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have restored that.

21:58.751 --> 22:01.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you read that move on the
part of President
Trump?

22:02.021 --> 22:05.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Well, I
teach about decision-making,
so I have been thinking about
this.

22:05.958 --> 22:12.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it also wasn't
thought out, and
partially because -- we have
heard a lot of

22:12.264 --> 22:15.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stories about how the transition
really wasn't
done very well.

22:15.634 --> 22:19.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have been transitioned into
and I have done
the transitioning.

22:19.205 --> 22:23.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a fascinating process of
turning over
the crown jewels when it's done
properly.

22:23.909 --> 22:25.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That didn't happen.

22:25.678 --> 22:32.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think they didn't
understand how
the system works, and, in fact,
downgrading

22:32.384 --> 22:34.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the role of the chairman of the
Joint Chiefs.

22:34.186 --> 22:39.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe they think they already
have too many
generals, but the bottom line is
that it's

22:39.191 --> 22:43.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
important for that person to be
in the meetings
no matter what.

22:43.696 --> 22:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what they have done is say
only when it's
really necessary, decided by the
national

22:47.600 --> 22:52.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
security adviser, and the same
for the director
of national intelligence.

22:52.738 --> 22:56.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's important to know the
intelligence and
the response of the military.

22:56.642 --> 23:01.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The other change
they made
was to add Steve Bannon, who is
a senior adviser

23:01.213 --> 23:08.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the president, to the -- the
campaign adviser
-- add him to the National
Security Council

23:08.520 --> 23:12.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attendees, principals -- I guess
you call
it principals list.

23:12.291 --> 23:17.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their argument is, well, the
Obama administration
had people like David Axelrod
and others who

23:17.930 --> 23:19.732 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sat in on national security
meeting.

23:19.765 --> 23:23.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: That -- you
know, frankly,
that is the most outrageous
thing that they

23:23.335 --> 23:28.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have done, is to add somebody
with an extreme
ideology to those that are
supposed to be

23:28.040 --> 23:32.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
making decisions based on U.S.
national interests,
not on ideology.

23:33.012 --> 23:38.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's one thing to have one
of the advisers
come in on occasion when the
issue is some

23:38.350 --> 23:43.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
combination of domestic and
foreign policy,
but not to have somebody with
the views of

23:43.889 --> 23:47.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bannon that we now hear to be
there all the
time.

23:47.293 --> 23:52.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the troublesome part about
all this is,
what is the circle around the
president?

23:52.097 --> 23:53.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Who does he listen to?

23:53.932 --> 23:59.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the examples that we have
had, whether
it's now with the immigration
executive action

23:59.538 --> 24:02.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or just generally, is the
decision-making
process.

24:02.941 --> 24:04.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're not a new country.

24:04.510 --> 24:06.779 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have had a decision-making
process.

24:06.812 --> 24:09.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And they have, in fact,
developed something
different.

24:09.348 --> 24:11.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, Judy, I thought the
following.

24:11.517 --> 24:14.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Disruption is not a bad thing
for bureaucracy.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Destruction, however, is very
dangerous.

24:17.823 --> 24:21.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so what we have seen in the
last week,
I think, is dangerous.

24:21.593 --> 24:23.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly,
last question.

24:23.729 --> 24:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Impression of Rex Tillerson, who
is the president's
designee to be the next
secretary of state?

24:27.766 --> 24:29.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Well, I have
met him.

24:29.101 --> 24:31.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think he's a very fine person.

24:31.136 --> 24:34.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's been a very good CEO of
Exxon.

24:34.340 --> 24:39.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question is how he's going
to operate
within this particular setup,
how he's going

24:39.044 --> 24:43.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to work with the State
Department, where a
top group of people have left
who are some

24:44.016 --> 24:50.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the operational people, and
then how is
he going to define what the
roles of the State

24:50.089 --> 24:51.790 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Department is?

24:51.824 --> 24:55.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Madeleine
Albright, former
secretary of state, thank you
very much for

24:55.060 --> 24:56.028 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
talking with us.

24:56.061 --> 24:57.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Great to be
with you.

24:57.062 --> 24:58.764 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

24:58.797 --> 25:01.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: And for a
different point of
view, I spoke a short while ago
to Kansas

25:01.767 --> 25:06.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of State Kris Kobach,
was a top
adviser to Mr. Trump during his
presidential

25:06.672 --> 25:08.907 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
campaign and transition process.

25:08.941 --> 25:13.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I began by asking him whether
the U.S. is
safer now as a result of the
White House ban.

25:14.012 --> 25:18.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KRIS KOBACH (R), Kansas
Secretary of State:
These seven countries are the
hotbeds of terrorism.

25:18.217 --> 25:21.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They include places where ISIS
controls foreign
territory.

25:21.754 --> 25:25.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are places where people
are coming
in to receive terrorist training
and then

25:25.991 --> 25:30.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being pushed out to carry out
acts of terrorism
across Europe, perhaps in the
United States

25:30.696 --> 25:32.531 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and elsewhere.

25:32.564 --> 25:38.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, absolutely, it makes
sense to put
a temporary bar on people
holding those passports

25:38.404 --> 25:40.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from coming into the United
States.

25:40.806 --> 25:44.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also another really important
part of this
executive order was the
reviewing our refugee

25:44.209 --> 25:49.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
program, also putting that on
hold, because
we have huge problems with
terrorists abusing

25:49.181 --> 25:50.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our refugee program.

25:50.449 --> 25:52.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I might just give you a quick
statistic there.

25:52.117 --> 25:58.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since the 1990s, there have been
18 major
terrorists who have either
committed acts

25:58.891 --> 26:03.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of terror or names you would
recognize who
got into our refugee program.

26:03.195 --> 26:06.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The blind sheik, Omar
Abdel-Rahman, came in
through the refugee program.

26:06.832 --> 26:09.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The two Boston Marathon bombers
originally
came into the United States
through the refugee

26:10.002 --> 26:11.203 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
program.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Bowling Green, Kentucky,
terrorists, refugee
program.

26:13.839 --> 26:16.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it makes sense to say, hey,
we're a very
generous nation.

26:16.775 --> 26:18.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We give out more asylum.

26:18.677 --> 26:22.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We allow in more refugees than
any other country
on the planet, but we are going
to reassess

26:22.781 --> 26:27.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how we screen people because way
too many
terrorists are fraudulently
coming into the

26:27.486 --> 26:29.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
United States as refugees.

26:29.421 --> 26:33.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The one problem
with all that
argument is that, of the seven
countries singled

26:33.292 --> 26:38.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out, no refugees from those
particular countries
are implicated in any attacks.

26:38.964 --> 26:40.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Were the wrong countries picked?

26:40.165 --> 26:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KRIS KOBACH: No, I don't think
so.

26:41.467 --> 26:46.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Bowling Green, Kentucky, I
believe those
were from Iraq.

26:46.071 --> 26:52.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The geographical locus -- focus
of where the
terrorists are active changes
with time, right?

26:52.277 --> 26:58.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, al-Qaida wasn't necessarily
active in
the exact same countries now.

26:58.116 --> 27:03.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Somalia has become much more
active as a place
where terrorist training and
terrorist activity

27:03.055 --> 27:04.823 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
occurs.

27:04.857 --> 27:08.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it only makes sense that the
seven countries
or 10 countries or however many
we're most

27:08.527 --> 27:11.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interested in might change over
time as the
facts on the ground change.

27:11.930 --> 27:13.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: A practical
question here.

27:13.565 --> 27:15.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You mentioned Somalia.

27:15.334 --> 27:19.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're trying to do extreme
vetting of
someone who comes from Somalia,
how on earth

27:19.705 --> 27:20.939 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do you do that?

27:20.973 --> 27:22.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Somalia doesn't even really have
a functioning
government.

27:22.741 --> 27:26.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What does extreme vetting look
like when a
person comes out of a country
like that?

27:26.578 --> 27:31.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRIS KOBACH: That's a great
question, because
what happens when someone comes
in, let's

27:31.350 --> 27:34.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take, for example, someone
coming in as a
refugee.

27:34.620 --> 27:39.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they say that they have a
credible fear
of persecution -- that's the
legal standard

27:39.258 --> 27:41.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- in their home country.

27:41.126 --> 27:44.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, if the home country
doesn't even have
a functioning government, you
don't have any

27:44.396 --> 27:50.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
police departments, you don't
have any centralized
database of records, you may not
have any

27:50.702 --> 27:54.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way of verifying anything that
this person
is saying.

27:54.473 --> 28:00.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, right now, in the refugee
program for
the past, you know, 10 years or
so, there

28:00.112 --> 28:05.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been a sort of get-to-yes
mentality, take
the refugee's, the intending
refugee's word

28:05.317 --> 28:06.285 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for it.

28:06.318 --> 28:08.120 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think we have to be much
stricter.

28:08.153 --> 28:13.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have to say, look, we
need some proof,
we need some evidence that your
story is true,

28:13.292 --> 28:17.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because there are so many cases
that we learn
about after the fact where the
refugee's story

28:17.362 --> 28:19.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was completely untrue.

28:19.364 --> 28:23.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Seems like that
would be very
difficult to come up with any
kind of documentation

28:23.035 --> 28:23.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in that situation.

28:24.002 --> 28:24.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KRIS KOBACH: It would.

28:25.003 --> 28:26.238 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It may be.

28:26.271 --> 28:28.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Let's talk about
politics for
just a -- yes.

28:28.073 --> 28:32.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some Republicans on the Hill are
even expressing
concerns about this, Senator
McCain among

28:32.544 --> 28:37.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them, saying that it basically
fits in -- I'm
paraphrasing -- fits into the
ISIS narrative,

28:37.849 --> 28:44.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in essence, that their -- the
propaganda that
they spew out is that America is
anti-Muslim,

28:44.790 --> 28:47.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and this fits into that
narrative well.

28:47.059 --> 28:54.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the real concern, the real
threat is homegrown
terrorism, incited by the
Internet, by Twitter,

28:54.132 --> 28:59.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by Facebook, if that's the real
threat, haven't
we made ourselves less safer by
adding to

28:59.805 --> 29:00.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this ISIS narrative?

29:00.939 --> 29:02.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KRIS KOBACH: I don't think so at
all.

29:02.441 --> 29:05.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, we as a nation can walk
and chew gum
at the same time.

29:05.644 --> 29:07.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You're absolutely right.

29:07.412 --> 29:10.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Homegrown terrorism is a threat,
but so is
imported terrorism where the
terrorists are

29:10.349 --> 29:13.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trained overseas and they are
sent to the
United States to kill Americans.

29:13.685 --> 29:15.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So we have to do both.

29:15.287 --> 29:17.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there's no reason why we
can't do both.

29:17.289 --> 29:22.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this is the best way to put
enhanced screening
on people seeking entry to the
United States,

29:22.160 --> 29:24.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the best way to protect the
American public.

29:24.863 --> 29:28.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, remember, that's the first
and highest
purpose of the United States
government is

29:28.900 --> 29:30.902 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to protect American citizens.

29:30.936 --> 29:36.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are not facing an invasion
from a conventional
army anytime soon, but we are
facing individual

29:36.241 --> 29:37.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
acts of terrorism.

29:37.943 --> 29:41.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And many of those individuals
come in across
our border through a port of
entry.

29:41.647 --> 29:43.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we owe it to the American
people.

29:43.482 --> 29:49.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. government owes it to
the American
people to be very cautious in
allowing someone

29:49.121 --> 29:54.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in from these regions of the
world where we
know ISIS is active and there is
active terrorist

29:54.559 --> 29:56.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
activity and training going on.

29:56.762 --> 30:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Is it possible,
though, we
have given ISIS a case in point
for their

30:01.166 --> 30:03.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
argument that the U.S. is
anti-Muslim?

30:03.502 --> 30:05.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KRIS KOBACH: I don't think so.

30:05.337 --> 30:09.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, I hear the argument
made that this
executive order is anti-Muslim,
and it seems

30:09.875 --> 30:12.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to me that that's clearly false.

30:12.110 --> 30:14.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, the -- it's based on the
country of
origin.

30:14.579 --> 30:19.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you're an atheist, if
you're a Christian,
if you're a Jew coming from one
of these countries,

30:19.851 --> 30:24.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you will be subject to the same
bar on entry
as a Muslim coming from these
countries.

30:24.189 --> 30:28.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Furthermore, you have got about
40 additional
countries in the world that are
majority Muslim

30:28.860 --> 30:31.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they are not affected by
this executive
order.

30:31.396 --> 30:33.732 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, clearly, on its face, it is
not anti-Muslim.

30:33.765 --> 30:39.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is a geographic-based action
to secure
America from people coming from
dangerous

30:39.638 --> 30:40.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
places in the world.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is a geographic ban.

30:42.908 --> 30:45.143 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not in any way a religious
ban.

30:45.177 --> 30:48.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: OK, but there is
a religious
component to this.

30:48.447 --> 30:52.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Christians, of course, are
specifically singled
out for priority.

30:52.250 --> 30:53.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let me ask you this.

30:53.251 --> 30:56.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You teach or have taught
constitutional law.

30:56.788 --> 30:59.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How does this square with the
Constitution?

31:00.025 --> 31:01.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, I'm your student for a
moment.

31:01.793 --> 31:05.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Teach me about the Constitution
and how this
jibes with what the founding
fathers were

31:05.897 --> 31:06.865 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thinking.

31:06.898 --> 31:08.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
KRIS KOBACH: OK.

31:08.834 --> 31:12.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, first of all, the -- no
one who is outside
of the United States and is not
a United States

31:12.938 --> 31:16.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
citizen has a constitutional
right to enter
the United States.

31:16.675 --> 31:20.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have heard some people who are
critics of
the president's executive order
argue that

31:20.045 --> 31:21.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it's unconstitutional.

31:21.079 --> 31:22.280 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's absolutely incorrect.

31:22.314 --> 31:25.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is no constitutional right
to enter
the United States.

31:25.650 --> 31:28.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even if you have already been in
the United
States in the past, you have no
constitutional

31:28.520 --> 31:30.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
right to come back in.

31:31.022 --> 31:36.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Second thing is, the Congress
has the authority
to -- it has what's called
plenary authority

31:36.628 --> 31:38.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to pass laws relating to
immigration.

31:38.497 --> 31:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has the first and highest
authority to
pass those laws.

31:41.099 --> 31:47.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's a statute, Title 8,
Section 1182F,
which gives the president a
discretion that

31:47.372 --> 31:51.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if he feels that the entry of
any alien or
class of aliens would be
detrimental to the

31:51.843 --> 31:55.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
national interests of the United
States, he
can exclude those individuals.

31:55.647 --> 31:59.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are similar statutes
going all the
way back to the beginning in
1789 with the

31:59.651 --> 32:01.419 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Alien Acts.

32:01.453 --> 32:05.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
George Washington, after they
were passed,
had authority to exclude or
remove anyone

32:05.524 --> 32:08.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who was a national security
threat way back
then.

32:08.560 --> 32:13.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, legally speaking, the
president is on
absolutely secure ground.

32:13.498 --> 32:16.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People may quibble about the
politics of it
all, but I think, in terms of
the national

32:17.002 --> 32:20.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
security of the United States,
these executive
orders are a win.

32:20.672 --> 32:24.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that you will find
that, in the
end, the vast majority of
Americans will be

32:24.242 --> 32:26.044 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
supportive.

32:26.077 --> 32:28.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Kansas Secretary
of State and
former Trump adviser Kris
Kobach, thank you

32:28.413 --> 32:30.282 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very much.

32:30.315 --> 32:37.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KRIS KOBACH: My pleasure.

32:37.389 --> 32:45.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In Iraq, the ban
hit one group
of people particularly hard,
interpreters

32:45.363 --> 32:51.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and other staff who assisted
American forces
over the last 14 years of
conflict there.

32:51.203 --> 32:55.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are eligible to apply for a
special visa
program to emigrate here.

32:55.240 --> 33:00.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But one former interpreter and
his family
find their plans to move here
are now in doubt.

33:00.178 --> 33:02.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Jane
Ferguson reports
from Northern Iraq.

33:02.581 --> 33:07.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: After seven years
working with
the U.S. military, Abdul Hamid
Abdul Ghani

33:07.185 --> 33:08.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has plenty of souvenirs.

33:08.720 --> 33:12.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He proudly shows us military
coins given to
him by U.S. commanders in Iraq.

33:12.624 --> 33:16.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABDUL HAMID, Former Iraqi
Interpreter: And
this was what I got from General
Petraeus.

33:16.962 --> 33:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: As an Iraqi
fluent in English,
he was thrilled to get a job
working with

33:21.566 --> 33:22.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
American troops in 2003 as a
translator.

33:22.901 --> 33:24.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He dreamt of living in the U.S.
one day.

33:24.870 --> 33:27.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After lengthy vetting, including
background
checks, fingerprinting and
extensive interviews,

33:27.472 --> 33:29.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that day was almost at hand.

33:29.741 --> 33:40.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ghani, his wife and three
children were supposed
to start a new life in San Diego
next week.

33:40.051 --> 33:46.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They would be admitted to the
U.S. on a special
immigrant visa, recognizing the
work he had

33:46.391 --> 33:47.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
done for American soldiers.

33:47.792 --> 33:51.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, yesterday, he got an e-mail
saying those
plans had been canceled.

33:51.496 --> 33:53.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABDUL HAMID: My bags are ready.

33:53.398 --> 33:56.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are all packed.

33:56.534 --> 33:59.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I almost have nothing here now.

33:59.671 --> 34:00.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My life is destroyed.

34:00.839 --> 34:02.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I can put it that way.

34:02.707 --> 34:04.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's totally destroyed.

34:04.509 --> 34:09.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: President Trump's
executive
order placed a 90-day block on
visas for Iraqis

34:09.748 --> 34:11.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to visit the U.S.

34:11.549 --> 34:17.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even if that changes thereafter,
Abdul Hamid's
visa requires he enter the U.S.
before the

34:17.255 --> 34:18.657 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
end of February.

34:18.690 --> 34:22.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ABDUL HAMID: How can the
president of the
United States do such a thing?

34:22.294 --> 34:27.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: The work Abdul
Hamid did for
the military has placed him in
danger.

34:27.832 --> 34:33.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In today's Iraq, having helped
Americans chase
down suspected terrorists is a
risky reputation

34:33.204 --> 34:34.172 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to have.

34:34.205 --> 34:36.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
His wife is frightened.

34:36.074 --> 34:41.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAFA ABDUL GHANI, Iraq: We are
not safe here,
especially his work from -- with
the Americans,

34:41.212 --> 34:42.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and he -- threatened...

34:42.347 --> 34:43.848 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABDUL HAMID: Threatened, yes.

34:43.882 --> 34:46.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAFA ABDUL GHANI: Threatened,
yes, from terrorists.

34:46.518 --> 34:50.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: She is also
concerned for their
eldest child.

34:50.322 --> 34:52.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Tariq is 12 and has Down
syndrome.

34:52.958 --> 34:58.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His parents had hoped to find
better specialist
care for him in the U.S.

34:58.763 --> 35:05.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not just ordinary Iraqis
who are devastated
by the news of a visa ban.

35:05.236 --> 35:09.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parliamentarians in Baghdad are
angry, and
calling for a strong response,
escalating

35:09.574 --> 35:10.976 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the diplomatic crisis.

35:11.009 --> 35:14.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iraqi lawmakers voted today to
ban visas for
Americans for 90 days.

35:14.446 --> 35:19.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While the measure has not yet
been approved
by the entire government, it
would affect

35:19.584 --> 35:24.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the large numbers of American
contract support
staff aiding the American
military in Iraq

35:24.422 --> 35:26.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right now, who are fighting a
crucial battle
against ISIS.

35:26.291 --> 35:29.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Ghanis are still not sure
whether their
plans to move to the U.S. are
impossible now.

35:29.728 --> 35:31.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Have you told the kids?

35:31.496 --> 35:32.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do they understand?

35:32.764 --> 35:37.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ABDUL HAMID: I haven't told them
that we are
not going yet.

35:37.369 --> 35:44.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can't really look at them in
the eye and
tell them, hey, we are not
going, because

35:44.042 --> 35:45.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they have really high hopes, you
know?

35:45.877 --> 35:50.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: So, their bags
remain packed,
ready for a future that now
seems much less

35:50.081 --> 35:51.216 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
certain.

35:51.249 --> 35:54.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Jane
Ferguson
in Dohuk, Iraq.

35:54.419 --> 35:59.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, President
Trump's immigration
order has drawn deep divisions
among lawmakers.

35:59.858 --> 36:07.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Elected officials have voiced
both support
and condemnation, while a number
are yet to

36:07.932 --> 36:09.634 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
weigh in.

36:09.667 --> 36:16.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here to help us understand the
lay of the
land on this and other issues of
the week,

36:16.474 --> 36:21.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our Politics Monday team, Amy
Walter of The
Cook Political Report and Tamara
Keith of

36:21.980 --> 36:22.947 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
NPR.

36:22.981 --> 36:24.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to both of you.

36:24.749 --> 36:27.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's been such a quiet week.

36:27.519 --> 36:28.720 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

36:28.753 --> 36:30.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But I thought we
would come
together anyway.

36:30.822 --> 36:35.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this immigration order we
have been talking
about all night, it's a policy
move, serious

36:35.860 --> 36:40.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
consequences, but it also, Amy,
is something
that President Trump talked
about during the

36:40.198 --> 36:41.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said he was going to move on
immigration.

36:43.668 --> 36:44.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Right.

36:44.736 --> 36:46.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The public
reaction is interesting.

36:46.504 --> 36:52.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A Pew poll out earlier this
month showed,
what, by 48 to 42 percent,
people supported

36:52.444 --> 36:54.112 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

36:54.145 --> 36:58.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Yes, this is
actually -- this
is a Quinnipiac poll that came
out earlier

36:58.149 --> 36:59.984 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this month.

37:00.018 --> 37:04.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they said very specifically
support or
oppose suspending immigration
from terror-prone

37:04.089 --> 37:09.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
areas, right, sounds very
familiar, even if
it means turning away refugees.

37:09.127 --> 37:11.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, they put that in there as
well -- 48 percent
approved.

37:11.763 --> 37:16.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as you know, Judy, the
world that we
live in right now, not
surprisingly, 72 percent

37:16.968 --> 37:18.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of Republicans supported it.

37:18.736 --> 37:22.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Only 24 percent of Democrats
said they supported
it, and independents closely
divided.

37:22.440 --> 37:27.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And such we have the world that
we're going
to inhabit, it looks like, for
the foreseeable

37:27.745 --> 37:29.647 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
future.

37:29.681 --> 37:33.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Tam, what
we're watching
is a very divided political
reaction, Democrats

37:33.051 --> 37:36.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
almost universally saying this
is a terrible
idea, Republicans divided.

37:36.254 --> 37:39.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Yes,
Democrats rallying at the
Supreme Court tonight,

37:39.124 --> 37:42.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
introducing legislation that
will go nowhere
or not even be able to be
brought up on the

37:42.060 --> 37:44.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
floor, but Democratic lawmakers
are protesting.

37:44.896 --> 37:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the Republican side, there
are sort of
a range of reactions.

37:48.733 --> 37:52.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are people who strongly
support what
President Trump has signed and
what he is

37:52.871 --> 37:54.639 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
doing.

37:54.672 --> 37:58.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are others who are
expressing concerns,
and that sort of falls into two
categories.

37:59.010 --> 38:04.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are people who express a
moral concern
or a concern that action like
this could actually

38:04.949 --> 38:09.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make us less safe, rather than
more safe,
could give a propaganda
advantage to organizations

38:09.120 --> 38:10.088 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like ISIS.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's John McCain, Lindsey
Graham.

38:11.222 --> 38:13.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Not very many Republican
senators going that
far.

38:13.291 --> 38:17.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most of them are talking more
about like logistical
challenges, about the rollout
could have been

38:17.662 --> 38:18.663 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a better.

38:18.696 --> 38:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, the rollout could have
been a lot better.

38:21.499 --> 38:26.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But one senator said, this
extreme vetting
proposal needed more extreme
vetting itself.

38:26.070 --> 38:30.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy, is there --
we're so early
into this next term.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's right.

38:31.809 --> 38:34.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there a
political calculation
for these Republicans?

38:34.045 --> 38:35.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

38:35.713 --> 38:41.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think a lot of them are still
waiting to
find out how people are reacting
to it.

38:41.085 --> 38:42.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we pointed to the poll,
which was theoretical.

38:43.021 --> 38:45.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you think about the
theory behind
this?

38:45.890 --> 38:47.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
-- 48 percent support.

38:47.725 --> 38:53.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now that we have seen it, the
rollout clearly
varying, not very good, once we
see the sort

38:53.097 --> 38:57.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of human cost of it, is this
going to change
people's minds, or are they
going to get just

38:57.969 --> 38:59.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
even more hunkered down in this?

38:59.737 --> 39:04.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as we all know, politicians
like to wait
and watch for where the folks
are going.

39:04.842 --> 39:10.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's really important,
to Tam's point,
that even those Democrats who
sit in red states,

39:10.715 --> 39:12.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really red states, have come out
unambiguously
against Donald Trump.

39:12.684 --> 39:16.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even Republicans who sit in
sort of squishy,
tentatively Republican
districts, most of

39:16.221 --> 39:18.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them have held back and not said
much.

39:18.356 --> 39:22.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some have come out, but mostly
they have held
back.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think you are going to see
those battle
lines.

39:24.929 --> 39:29.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we saw in that poll, if
you're a Democrat,
you are going to support Trump
-- you're going

39:29.634 --> 39:30.735 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to oppose him.

39:30.768 --> 39:34.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you're a Republican, you are
going to support
him.

39:34.072 --> 39:40.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And yet, Tam, we
see, looking
at a news organization, or at
least an editorial

39:40.878 --> 39:45.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
page that normally is very
friendly to Donald
Trump, The Wall Street Journal,
writing today,

39:45.283 --> 39:55.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very critical, saying the way --
critical
of the way it was done, saying
he needlessly

39:55.326 --> 40:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very critical, saying the way --
critical
of the way it was done, saying
he needlessly

40:02.467 --> 40:07.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
alienated people, but then goes
on to say,
"The danger is, he will alienate
the friends

40:07.705 --> 40:09.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and allies at home and abroad he
needs to
succeed."

40:09.874 --> 40:11.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, The Journal taking a longer
look at this.

40:12.010 --> 40:13.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Right.

40:13.878 --> 40:17.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that gets to some of the
national security
concerns, that national security
experts and

40:17.415 --> 40:23.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
veterans of national security
argue that this
could actually put us in more
danger, that

40:23.721 --> 40:29.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are -- the best allies
that America
has in fighting organizations
like ISIS are

40:29.594 --> 40:31.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Muslims themselves.

40:31.396 --> 40:34.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that that's getting
at that, but
it also gets at a little -- it's
almost like

40:34.632 --> 40:41.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a more liberal editorial board
saying to the
Obama administration, oh, my
gosh, you really

40:41.239 --> 40:45.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could have done the rollout of
Obamacare better
several years ago.

40:45.109 --> 40:46.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sure.

40:46.311 --> 40:49.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, it reminds us, Amy, these
issues are
complicated.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: They are.

40:51.149 --> 40:55.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think I will go back to
the point that
you brought up earlier, which
is, elections

40:55.720 --> 40:56.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have consequences.

40:56.954 --> 40:59.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump the candidate said
he was going
to do this.

40:59.223 --> 41:01.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
A lot of people voted.

41:01.392 --> 41:04.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Millions and millions of people
voted for
Donald Trump the candidate.

41:04.996 --> 41:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's now the president, and he's
going through
and he's doing this.

41:09.000 --> 41:14.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the sort of outrage that
we're seeing
around the country, while it's
not surprising,

41:14.572 --> 41:20.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's also has to -- you have to
remember that
this is something that he
promised that he

41:20.611 --> 41:26.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was going to do on the campaign
trail and
that he's putting out in
reality.

41:26.217 --> 41:32.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we need to do -- and we
talked about
this last week -- is to wait and
watch for

41:32.790 --> 41:33.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the longer-term implications.

41:33.791 --> 41:35.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

41:35.226 --> 41:39.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Is it going to have
an impact
on our national security?

41:39.731 --> 41:40.698 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We don't know.

41:40.732 --> 41:42.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There may be something linked to
that.

41:42.967 --> 41:46.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it going to have something to
do with our
diplomacy?

41:46.904 --> 41:50.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Is it going to have a
detrimental impact on
our diplomacy?

41:50.742 --> 41:51.709 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Maybe.

41:51.743 --> 41:53.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We don't know yet.

41:53.578 --> 41:59.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's clear that this is
something he said
he was going to do, and he's
implementing

41:59.050 --> 42:00.885 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

42:00.918 --> 42:05.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly to
both of you,
another thing we saw is the
influence of Steve

42:05.256 --> 42:07.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bannon, senior adviser to the
president.

42:07.892 --> 42:13.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw the president in the last
few days
say that he wants to add Steve
Bannon, Tam,

42:13.231 --> 42:16.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the National Security Council
principals,
the people who sit in on these
very important

42:16.734 --> 42:19.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
private sessions on what the
country does.

42:19.470 --> 42:22.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Steve Bannon is turning out to
be a major
player there.

42:22.507 --> 42:27.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And when the
senior stuff was
announced, he was announced at
the same time

42:28.012 --> 42:30.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as the chief of staff as sort of
a co-equal.

42:30.715 --> 42:34.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's very clear -- it was
clear in the
inaugural address.

42:34.519 --> 42:40.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been clear in many of these
memoranda
and orders that his voice is
there, his words

42:40.892 --> 42:42.693 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are there.

42:42.727 --> 42:46.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And people
watching because
of this alt-right narrative
around Breitbart.

42:46.664 --> 42:51.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Right, and that he
is going to
be a very influential voice.

42:51.736 --> 43:01.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the end of the day, it's
Donald Trump's
name on all the legislation and
all the executive

43:01.879 --> 43:04.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
orders, and the buck stops with
him.

43:04.749 --> 43:08.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter,
Tamara Keith, Politics
Monday, thank you both.

43:08.252 --> 43:09.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

43:09.520 --> 43:10.788 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

43:10.822 --> 43:12.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Appreciate it.

43:12.089 --> 43:13.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And a postscript.

43:13.991 --> 43:18.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I told you on Friday that I
would be interviewing
Vice President Mike Pence
tomorrow, but I

43:18.863 --> 43:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will now be sitting down with
him this Wednesday
at the White House.

43:23.134 --> 43:24.869 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Tune in.

43:24.902 --> 43:27.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: One billion of us
own a smartphone,
and we know how addicting it can
be.

43:27.205 --> 43:29.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One former Google employee says
this is no
accident.

43:29.340 --> 43:31.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Indeed, it is by design.

43:31.209 --> 43:35.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he became troubled by the
relentless efforts
of app developers to keep us
glued to the

43:35.480 --> 43:36.848 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
gadgets.

43:36.881 --> 43:39.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Tristan Harris founded an
organization
called Time Well Spent.

43:39.283 --> 43:44.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is asking the tech industry
to bring what
he calls ethical design to its
products.

43:44.822 --> 43:48.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"NewsHour" special correspondent
Cat Wise
has more, part of our ongoing
collaboration

43:48.960 --> 43:50.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with "The Atlantic."

43:50.761 --> 43:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRISTAN HARRIS, Founder, Time
Well Spent:
I noticed when I was at
Stanford, there was

43:55.199 --> 44:02.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a class called the persuasive
technology design
class, and it was a whole lab at
Stanford

44:02.173 --> 44:07.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that teaches students how to
apply persuasive
psychology principles into
technology to persuade

44:07.345 --> 44:10.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people to use products in a
certain way.

44:10.414 --> 44:15.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it's not about giving you
all this freedom.

44:15.486 --> 44:20.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's about sucking you in to
take your time.

44:20.558 --> 44:24.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: So, the goal is to
keep us on our
devices longer.

44:24.562 --> 44:26.264 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

44:26.297 --> 44:29.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRISTAN HARRIS: For any company
whose business
model is advertising, or
engagement-based

44:29.967 --> 44:34.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
advertising, meaning they care
about the amount
of time someone spends on the
product, they

44:34.238 --> 44:37.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
make more money the more time
people spend.

44:37.208 --> 44:41.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the game becomes, how can I
throw different
persuasive techniques to get
people to stay,

44:41.746 --> 44:45.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to spend as long as possible,
and to come
back tomorrow?

44:45.883 --> 44:47.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAT WISE: And it's clearly
working.

44:47.852 --> 44:49.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, wherever we go, we're
inevitably surrounded
by fellow citizens staring into
their phones,

44:49.921 --> 44:51.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as we usually are too.

44:51.722 --> 44:57.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you think about when
you're out in
public and see people on their
cell phones?

44:57.128 --> 45:03.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRISTAN HARRIS: You know, have
you ever been
in a moment where you're sitting
there, and

45:03.534 --> 45:08.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you just start using your phone
to do something
productive?

45:08.806 --> 45:13.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe you're in the back of a
car, a taxi,
or you're on public
transportation.

45:13.177 --> 45:17.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Your phone is always giving you
a way to spend
time that can be more
productive, more entertaining,

45:17.915 --> 45:19.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or more stimulating than
reality.

45:19.584 --> 45:22.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I often say that this puts a new
choice on
life's menu that's sweeter than
reality.

45:22.954 --> 45:26.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so we're turning to it more
and more often.

45:26.190 --> 45:29.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We check our phones about 150
times a day.

45:29.260 --> 45:32.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: And what are the costs
of that sort
of constant interaction with
technology, both

45:32.830 --> 45:34.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on an individual level and as a
society?

45:34.532 --> 45:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRISTAN HARRIS: Well, I think
each of us have
to tune in for our own
experience.

45:35.833 --> 45:37.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What does it feel like when we
check our phones
150 times a day?

45:37.602 --> 45:38.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or what does it feel like if we
have been
scrolling, and had our face
down, and not

45:38.903 --> 45:39.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
breathing very much when we're
scrolling for,
say, 20 minutes?

45:39.704 --> 45:40.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And how do we feel on the
inside?

45:40.571 --> 45:41.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAT WISE: How do you feel on the
inside?

45:41.872 --> 45:42.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRISTAN HARRIS: I feel like I
don't feel very
good after that.

45:42.573 --> 45:44.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I feel like my anxiety goes up.

45:44.408 --> 45:44.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I feel more concerned about what
I'm missing,
what I'm missing out on, who I
haven't gotten

45:44.709 --> 45:45.810 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
back to.

45:45.843 --> 45:47.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Oh, people think I'm bad at
getting back to
them.

45:47.545 --> 45:49.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of this sort of psychology
emerges all
because of this one thing in my
pocket.

45:49.380 --> 45:51.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have never had a media
device that
literally a billion people are
kind of being

45:51.215 --> 45:51.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
programmed in the same way,
where so much
influence is in the hands of a
few technology

45:51.582 --> 45:53.317 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
designers.

45:53.351 --> 45:53.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: At Google, Harris was
a so-called
product philosopher and helped
design the

45:53.784 --> 45:55.519 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Gmail inbox app.

45:55.553 --> 45:56.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRISTAN HARRIS: First of all,
there was no
one in the Gmail team who said,
how can we

45:56.120 --> 45:56.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
addict people to e-mail?

45:56.821 --> 45:57.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There was no one who said that.

45:57.388 --> 45:59.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That was never a goal.

45:59.190 --> 45:59.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you did hear conversations
like, should
we make it buzz your phone every
single time

45:59.690 --> 46:00.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you get an e-mail?

46:00.324 --> 46:02.059 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was a design question.

46:02.093 --> 46:03.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the outcome of that one
choice would be
a billion people getting buzzed
at dinners

46:03.394 --> 46:05.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with their dates, and with their
friends,
and with their family.

46:05.196 --> 46:05.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of these billions of phones,
by the product
of this one choice, would be
affected and

46:05.830 --> 46:07.198 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
interrupted all the time.

46:07.231 --> 46:09.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: And that was a
conversation that
you weren't having?

46:09.033 --> 46:10.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRISTAN HARRIS: I was getting a
little bit
disenchanted with whether or not
we were having,

46:10.901 --> 46:11.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I thought, the bigger
conversation about when
e-mail or any product that we
make actually

46:11.836 --> 46:13.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
makes a positive impact on
people's lives.

46:13.671 --> 46:15.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I made kind of a slide deck
manifesto,
and it basically said, never
before in history

46:15.573 --> 46:16.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have 50, mostly male,
20-to-35-year-old designers,
living in California, working at
three tech

46:16.907 --> 46:18.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
companies, influenced how a
billion people
spend their time.

46:18.743 --> 46:19.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: This is coffee bar in
San Francisco,
a popular hangout for
high-powered techies

46:20.011 --> 46:21.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like Harris, the ones whose
choices can influence
so many.

46:21.379 --> 46:22.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This idea of missing something,
I think that
drives a lot of us.

46:22.380 --> 46:23.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRISTAN HARRIS: Tony Robbins has
a great quote.

46:23.748 --> 46:25.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says: I run eight companies,
and I have
thousands of employees.

46:25.650 --> 46:26.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you think the chances
are that, at
any given moment, if I check my
e-mail, something

46:26.083 --> 46:27.718 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has gone wrong?

46:27.752 --> 46:29.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: With his organization,
Time Well
Spent, Harris is urging peers in
the tech

46:29.220 --> 46:30.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
world to have new conversations
about the
best interests of consumers.

46:30.287 --> 46:32.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRISTAN HARRIS: We need to
change the incentive.

46:32.089 --> 46:32.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I think, so long as the
business model
of technology companies is
advertising, we

46:32.757 --> 46:34.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are going to have a problem.

46:34.525 --> 46:36.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's what we're trying to
do with Time
Well Spent, is to change the
conversation

46:36.327 --> 46:36.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from being about maximizing
engagement and
time, to being about maximizing
net positive

46:37.028 --> 46:38.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
improvements to people's lives.

46:38.896 --> 46:40.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: What are some examples
of, you know,
apps that people use on a pretty
regular basis,

46:40.064 --> 46:41.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and the ways that these
companies are drawing
us in?

46:41.832 --> 46:43.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TRISTAN HARRIS: Have you
noticed, if you ever
log into Twitter, as an example,
so there's

46:43.634 --> 46:45.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an extra delay that you don't
know how long
it's going to take, between two
and three

46:45.202 --> 46:45.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seconds, where that -- the
number of new notifications
on Twitter you have?

46:45.770 --> 46:47.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, why is that there?

46:47.138 --> 46:47.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, it makes that into -- it's
called a
variable schedule reward.

46:47.772 --> 46:49.073 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's like a slot machine.

46:49.106 --> 46:50.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So you're playing the slot
machine, and there's
a time delay.

46:51.008 --> 46:51.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you're -- in that time
delay, your anticipation
is building, and then you get to
see how many

46:51.542 --> 46:52.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
notifications I get.

46:52.943 --> 46:54.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so you become more addicted
to checking
it again the next time.

46:54.578 --> 46:56.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: It sounds like there's
just a lot
of sort of trickery going on
here.

46:56.280 --> 46:56.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRISTAN HARRIS: I call it the
race to the
bottom of the brain stem, to get
people's

46:56.847 --> 46:58.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
attention at all costs.

46:58.449 --> 46:59.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's say I'm YouTube, and I
have got a certain
amount of people's attention.

46:59.283 --> 46:59.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What's YouTube's biggest
competitor?

46:59.784 --> 47:01.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Probably Facebook.

47:01.619 --> 47:02.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or take -- the CEO of Netflix
recently said
that the biggest competitors to
Netflix are

47:02.687 --> 47:03.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
probably YouTube, Facebook, and
sleep, meaning...

47:03.120 --> 47:04.855 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CAT WISE: Sleep?

47:04.889 --> 47:05.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRISTAN HARRIS: Sleep, because,
at the end
of the day, there's a finite
amount of time

47:05.289 --> 47:07.258 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
people have.

47:07.291 --> 47:08.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you're not getting
people's time, someone
else, some other app, or some
other part of

47:08.125 --> 47:09.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
someone's life is going to get
it.

47:09.860 --> 47:10.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So these services are in
competition with
where we would want to spend our
time, whether

47:10.695 --> 47:11.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's our sleep or with our
friends.

47:12.029 --> 47:13.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's this war going on to get
as much attention
as possible.

47:13.264 --> 47:14.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Tristan, tell me about
how you use
your phone.

47:14.732 --> 47:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRISTAN HARRIS: Well, I mean, I
try to use
it as consciously as I can.

47:16.534 --> 47:17.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One thing, for example, is, I
set it up so
that I just have my in-and-out
tools and my

47:17.868 --> 47:18.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aspirational ways I want to
spend my time
on my home screen.

47:18.936 --> 47:19.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAT WISE: What do you mean by
in-and-out tools?

47:19.470 --> 47:21.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What does that mean?

47:21.305 --> 47:22.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRISTAN HARRIS: A tool is
something that you
use and you never use it longer
or more than

47:22.173 --> 47:23.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you want to, for example, Google
Maps.

47:24.008 --> 47:24.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, if I need directions, I
don't end up
scrolling through Google Maps
for half-an-hour

47:24.442 --> 47:25.743 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
randomly, right?

47:25.776 --> 47:27.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just go in, and I find where I
need to go,
and then I go out.

47:27.545 --> 47:29.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: And these are things
that really
don't draw you in for long
periods of time?

47:29.313 --> 47:30.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRISTAN HARRIS: There's nothing
on my home
screen that is -- explicitly
makes money from

47:30.448 --> 47:31.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or wants to maximize how much
time I spend
on it.

47:31.816 --> 47:33.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I put all those other things
inside of
folders that are hidden.

47:33.651 --> 47:35.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Are people still
texting you, or
are sort of your friends and
colleagues, maybe

47:35.453 --> 47:37.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're not texting you or
trying to reach
out in a way that would distract
you so often?

47:37.288 --> 47:38.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRISTAN HARRIS: At the end of
the day, the
thing that dictates what -- how
someone reaches

47:39.023 --> 47:43.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out to you, and whether they use
Facebook
messenger or WhatsApp or
iMessage, isn't because

47:43.227 --> 47:44.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're thinking deeply about
it.

47:44.762 --> 47:47.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's because it's just the
fastest and easiest
thing to reach for.

47:47.498 --> 47:51.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think we have to
recognize that,
as human beings, there's just a
certain set

47:51.702 --> 47:54.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of things we're vulnerable to
that do influence
us.

47:54.371 --> 47:58.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if it buzzes right now, I
would probably,
without even thinking about it,
with you here,

47:58.109 --> 47:59.510 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
check it.

47:59.543 --> 48:02.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, if I don't want that to
happen, I
just have to put it away.

48:02.780 --> 48:04.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In fact, my phone just buzzed
right now.

48:04.815 --> 48:06.383 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:06.417 --> 48:10.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRISTAN HARRIS: And I just
looked.

48:10.121 --> 48:11.422 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
There you go.

48:11.455 --> 48:13.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Even knowing what you
know, you
still picked it up.

48:13.224 --> 48:14.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRISTAN HARRIS: And this is the
thing, that
even the people in the world of
persuasion

48:14.992 --> 48:19.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we were talking about earlier,
you know all
about these tricks of how to get
people to

48:19.663 --> 48:23.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
use products and to use a slot
machine dynamic,
whatever it is.

48:23.768 --> 48:28.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They will tell you that they
themselves are
no less vulnerable than the
regular person,

48:28.839 --> 48:30.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because these techniques work on
everybody.

48:30.941 --> 48:37.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's just part of being human.

48:37.815 --> 48:45.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And that's the
"NewsHour" for
tonight.

48:45.289 --> 48:46.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Miles O'Brien.

48:46.290 --> 48:47.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

48:47.591 --> 48:49.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening.

48:49.794 --> 48:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.

48:56.033 --> 48:59.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
