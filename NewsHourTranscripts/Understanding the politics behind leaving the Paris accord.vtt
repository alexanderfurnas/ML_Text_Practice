JUDY WOODRUFF: We turn our
focus to politics now, from
tensions inside the White House

00:05.133 --> 00:08.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to pulling out of
the Paris accord.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we break it all
down with Matt Schlapp.

00:10.233 --> 00:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is chair of the American
Conservative Union.

00:13.066 --> 00:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Karine Jean-Pierre, a
senior adviser to MoveOn.org.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome back to both of you.

00:19.833 --> 00:21.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, let's be crassly
political here.

00:21.966 --> 00:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We talked earlier, Matt, in
the program about the substance
of the president's decision.

00:25.700 --> 00:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP, Former
White House Director of
Political Affairs: Right.

00:26.933 --> 00:28.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
the pushback on it.

00:28.366 --> 00:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What was the political calculus
behind this, do you think?

00:31.133 --> 00:33.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: You look
at all these polls.

00:33.233 --> 00:37.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most polls will tell you that
Americans supported the idea
of fighting climate change.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But that's really not
right the question.

00:38.633 --> 00:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's digging down deeper.

00:40.633 --> 00:44.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The real question about climate
change is, are they willing
to pay more to fill their

00:44.166 --> 00:45.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tank with gas?

00:45.666 --> 00:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are they willing to pay more
for their utility bills?

00:48.266 --> 00:52.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are they willing to take some
of this American energy -- we're
now the world's leading supplier

00:52.566 --> 00:57.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of energy -- and take
it offline, which has a
big impact on U.S. jobs?

00:57.233 --> 00:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's the real question.

00:58.533 --> 01:00.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
By the way, it cuts
across party lines.

01:00.633 --> 01:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most Americans think that what
they're asking them to pay for,
for this crusade on climate

01:06.700 --> 01:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is simply not worth losing
jobs or paying more for energy.

01:08.666 --> 01:11.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It makes
it sound like a winning
decision today, Karine.

01:11.166 --> 01:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE,
Democratic Strategist:
I think what happened
today, what we saw today,

01:13.600 --> 01:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what Donald Trump did was
-- it was a political play.

01:15.966 --> 01:16.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's all it was.

01:16.966 --> 01:17.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It wasn't about the economy.

01:17.966 --> 01:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It wasn't about the environment.

01:20.266 --> 01:22.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It wasn't about businesses.

01:22.266 --> 01:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was purely about that
small, shrinking base that he
has that he needs to placate

01:26.100 --> 01:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with -- when it comes to every
tweet, every action, every
message that he puts out, it's

01:32.633 --> 01:34.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all about them.

01:34.733 --> 01:38.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He continues to give them the
red meat that he feels that
they need, and that's what we

01:38.433 --> 01:40.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
saw.

01:40.533 --> 01:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, if anything, we really
saw Steve Bannon winning the
day with that speech as well.

01:44.400 --> 01:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, is there
any risk, political risk, in
what the president did, Matt?

01:48.533 --> 01:49.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Sure.

01:49.533 --> 01:51.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sure.

01:51.233 --> 01:52.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think, if it is
about politics, people
will see through that.

01:52.633 --> 01:54.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I actually think it's
something deeper.

01:54.666 --> 01:58.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a campaign promise he made
to the working men and women
across this country who have

01:58.966 --> 02:01.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not seen their economic
prospects improve.

02:01.533 --> 02:03.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You see that in poll after poll.

02:03.566 --> 02:06.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think it's the number
one reason Donald
Trump is president,
and that his number one

02:06.833 --> 02:11.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gauge of his success is if the
economy can get chugging and
we can make these folks feel

02:13.333 --> 02:15.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and actually know
that their economic
prospects are improving.

02:15.433 --> 02:17.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
If he can't do that,
I think he's going to
have political trouble.

02:17.966 --> 02:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Can I just
add, Judy, there is a poll --
speaking of a poll, there's

02:20.533 --> 02:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a poll that shows 70 percent
of Americans actually agreed
with the Paris accord; 55

02:26.400 --> 02:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
percent were Republicans.

02:27.900 --> 02:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, there were Americans who
were behind, behind this.

02:29.866 --> 02:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: But if you dig
deeper, the real political
question is, are you willing to

02:33.266 --> 02:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pay the higher taxes, the
credits and all the things that
you have to do to make carbon

02:37.500 --> 02:39.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
more expensive to
take it off the grid?

02:39.766 --> 02:41.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's where it gets
dicey for your side.

02:41.766 --> 02:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Well, I
think the bigger question is
our planet and what are we going

02:45.433 --> 02:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to leave our children with --
you have five kids, I have a
kid -- and our grandchildren

02:49.266 --> 02:53.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with, if we don't take actually
responsibility to what this
country, our country is doing

02:53.966 --> 02:55.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the climate?

02:55.900 --> 02:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's also
talk about what has been
happening inside the White House

02:57.466 --> 02:59.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

02:59.533 --> 03:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of suspense built up
today over what the president
was going to this, at a time

03:01.866 --> 03:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when there's been a lot of
reporting about unsettled -- the
unsettled nature of how things

03:08.600 --> 03:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are going now with the staff.

03:09.766 --> 03:11.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: I haven't
read any of that.

03:11.566 --> 03:13.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

03:13.266 --> 03:14.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well,
it's been in a couple
of news organizations.

03:14.833 --> 03:16.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let me put it that way.

03:16.933 --> 03:18.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You talk to people
in the White House.

03:18.633 --> 03:19.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Sure.

03:19.866 --> 03:20.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is
that overblown?

03:20.666 --> 03:22.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: No.

03:22.100 --> 03:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are people
feeling -- OK, what is going on?

03:23.333 --> 03:25.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: No,
it's not overblown.

03:25.866 --> 03:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my belief is that the
president is impatient
over the fact that
there's been some bungling

03:30.633 --> 03:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on some of these rollouts
and some of these decisions.

03:32.333 --> 03:34.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's been way
too much leaking.

03:34.433 --> 03:38.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There is always leaking
in White Houses, but
this is a journalist's
dream come true, because

03:38.633 --> 03:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you have 18, 20, 22 people
talking for stories.

03:41.933 --> 03:43.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's out of control.

03:43.300 --> 03:45.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think he knows
it needs to tighten up.

03:45.366 --> 03:48.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I believe that he's
communicated internally that
he expects it to tighten up.

03:48.766 --> 03:51.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And if it doesn't get
better -- and he has
got to up his game, too.

03:51.866 --> 03:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it doesn't get better,
I think he's going to
make a lot more changes.

03:54.766 --> 03:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Karine,
what is -- I mean, is this just
all an upside for Democrats,

03:59.600 --> 04:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if the president continues to
have these kinds of issues, or
are Democrats basically just

04:05.466 --> 04:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
watching from the sideline?

04:06.966 --> 04:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: I think
we just watch on the sideline.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think he's his worst enemy.

04:10.600 --> 04:13.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I mean, look, when it
comes to situations like
this -- and you know.

04:13.366 --> 04:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have worked for a president.

04:14.366 --> 04:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have worked for the president.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The fish really
rots at its head.

04:17.266 --> 04:18.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is Donald Trump's
responsibility.

04:18.666 --> 04:21.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There is no one else
to blame but himself.

04:21.400 --> 04:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's the one that tweets
off-message, not his staff.

04:24.400 --> 04:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's the one that says things
that doesn't make sense that
really angers a lot of people,

04:28.433 --> 04:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
including, you know, people
who even voted for him are a
little concerned about what

04:32.433 --> 04:33.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he's doing.

04:33.433 --> 04:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we see that in focus groups.

04:35.466 --> 04:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: When you say
he needs to up his game, your
words, what did you mean?

04:37.566 --> 04:38.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Yes.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Well, look, there's an
independent counsel.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's an
investigation going on.

04:42.400 --> 04:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's got to be careful about
how he talks about that.

04:45.733 --> 04:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My advice is for the White
House is simply go along
with the investigation.

04:50.166 --> 04:53.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do not comment on
the investigation.

04:53.166 --> 04:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Don't do anything that makes
it look like you're putting any
pressure on the investigation.

04:55.733 --> 04:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I understand the president
and his team are frustrated
because they don't see any there

04:59.600 --> 05:01.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.166 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
But I think they
need to do that.

05:03.166 --> 05:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, as far as the staff is
concerned, I think it was absurd
that the Russian delegation

05:06.433 --> 05:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was able to go into the
Oval Office with recording
devices and cameras.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They didn't know who was
going to get the photos.

05:11.566 --> 05:15.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Keystone Cops
part of this must end.

05:15.233 --> 05:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With an outsider president and
an investigation going on, the
staff has to be twice as good,

05:20.233 --> 05:22.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and they can't afford to
make these kind of mistakes.

05:22.266 --> 05:25.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Karine,
no matter what is going on
in the White House, if Donald

05:25.366 --> 05:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump's base, the people who
voted for him, like the basics
of what he's doing, whether

05:29.900 --> 05:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's the climate decision or,
I don't know, his attempts
to set up a travel ban, even

05:37.333 --> 05:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
though that hasn't
happened yet, does it
really matter politically
whether the White House

05:40.433 --> 05:41.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is -- quote --
"dysfunctional" or not?

05:41.866 --> 05:43.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: I think
it will at some point.

05:43.966 --> 05:46.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, there's 2018 coming
right around the corner.

05:46.566 --> 05:50.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's going to hurt
Republicans, what we see Donald
Trump doing, because it's not

05:50.866 --> 05:52.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just Republicans.

05:52.366 --> 05:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not that small base that
got him to the White House.

It was also Democrats
and independents that got
him into the White House.

05:58.766 --> 05:59.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: That's true.

05:59.766 --> 06:01.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

06:01.933 --> 06:02.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: And, by the way,
he has a lot of them on his
staff at the White House, too.

06:02.866 --> 06:03.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Right.

06:03.666 --> 06:05.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But here's the thing.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you look at the House in
some of these suburbs that they
have to win, the Republicans

06:07.266 --> 06:11.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have to win, you need support
outside of your Republican base.

06:11.033 --> 06:13.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it is going to hurt
them when it comes to 2018.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I have a feeling
this may not be the last
time we have a chance to talk

06:16.133 --> 06:17.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about this.

06:17.133 --> 06:18.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

06:18.133 --> 06:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Let's hope not.

06:19.733 --> 06:20.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Karine
Jean-Pierre, Matt
Schlapp, thank you both.

06:20.533 --> 06:21.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Thank you.

06:21.700 --> 06:21.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE:
Thanks, Judy.
