00:01.880 --> 00:08.880
world

00:11.240 --> 00:16.599
the American Midwest and east coast were
colder than Swanson antarctica today

00:16.599 --> 00:21.470
as the record-breaking freeze even
spread to the deep sound good evening

00:21.470 --> 00:22.779
i'm judy woodruff

00:22.779 --> 00:27.669
1i Feliz away also ahead the country's
biggest bank is slapped with another

00:27.669 --> 00:28.899
record fine

00:28.899 --> 00:31.939
this time for what JP Morgan didn't do

00:31.939 --> 00:37.350
when it learned a Bernie Madoff's Ponzi
scheme plus the head of the UN's World

00:37.350 --> 00:38.500
Food Programme

00:38.500 --> 00:41.679
the group on the front lines of the
fight against hunger

00:41.679 --> 00:46.469
in areas crippled by violence in the
central african republic

00:46.469 --> 00:50.570
their hundred thousand people in and
around the airport itself

00:50.570 --> 00:54.809
in Bangla when we began a feeding
program in that area

00:54.809 --> 00:59.699
are mentor workers were tapped those are
just some other stories we're covering

00:59.699 --> 01:00.370
tonight

01:00.370 --> 01:06.860
PBS Newshour bitter cold persisted and
spread across much of the country today

01:06.860 --> 01:09.909
conditions were better suited to paying
ones then people

01:09.909 --> 01:15.000
and gave new meaning to the term blue
states I'm wearing long underwear

01:15.000 --> 01:19.230
I feel like I'm going skiing but I'm not
going to work millions of Americans

01:19.230 --> 01:21.180
spend another long day in the

01:21.180 --> 01:26.870
icy grip of the polar vortex from
washington DC where reading started the

01:26.870 --> 01:27.320
day

01:27.320 --> 01:33.310
in the single digits as soon as I get
for make sure

01:33.310 --> 01:37.200
to most to the midwest and the northeast
and New England

01:37.200 --> 01:41.340
1a below 30 below forty below occurs
when you get that much probably doesn't

01:41.340 --> 01:43.780
make a lot of different model up in
layers

01:43.780 --> 01:48.840
well we have one uses a woman using a
towel as a scarf

01:48.840 --> 01:52.480
I I'm using my wife's gas

01:52.480 --> 01:55.920
because I couldn't find mine so lines
while wearing a pink sky

01:55.920 --> 01:59.160
and the deep south joined the misery as

01:59.160 --> 02:02.850
Frigidaire pushed all the way into the
region this is

02:02.850 --> 02:06.100
ice on the road in atlanta and snow

02:06.100 --> 02:11.490
in rural North Georgia and is completely
frozen fountain is in Greensboro North

02:11.490 --> 02:12.570
Carolina

02:12.570 --> 02:16.740
farther south vegetable and citrus crops
in Florida

02:16.740 --> 02:22.010
are at risk farmers work today to
protect fields are potatoes and cabbage

02:22.010 --> 02:26.060
from the following Mercury depends on
how cold it gets and how deep it freezes

02:26.060 --> 02:28.220
it could affect the top layer potatoes

02:28.220 --> 02:32.110
the cabbage crop actually low 20's it
can be affected also say can burn a top

02:32.110 --> 02:32.490
leave

02:32.490 --> 02:36.360
even places accustomed to cold winters
had a shock

02:36.360 --> 02:39.709
Chicago hit a record low for Monday's
date

02:39.709 --> 02:43.770
at -16 degrees not counting the
windchill

02:43.770 --> 02:46.980
this is what it look like when a man
opened his window

02:46.980 --> 02:53.250
and let freezing winds poor inside in
indiana about 30,000 people lost power

02:53.250 --> 02:54.459
overnight

02:54.459 --> 02:59.600
and with it their heat they turned to
generators blankets or shelters to stay

02:59.600 --> 03:00.400
warm

03:00.400 --> 03:05.070
many schools in the midwest stayed close
for a second day today

03:05.070 --> 03:09.489
Michigan Governor Rick Snyder this isn't
the data have the kids go out and build

03:09.489 --> 03:10.320
a snowman

03:10.320 --> 03:14.390
or an igloo on the conditions are such
where it's not safe to be out this

03:14.390 --> 03:15.610
called for very long

03:15.610 --> 03:20.420
black I E send slick patches on the
roads were another danger with the

03:20.420 --> 03:26.590
number of spin outs in rollovers growing
by the hour

03:26.590 --> 03:32.030
and more than 500 amtrak passengers got
off trains Daves spent the night on

03:32.030 --> 03:35.860
in climbed into buses to their
destination Chicago

03:35.860 --> 03:40.080
blowing drifting snow had them stuck on
the tracks in central

03:40.080 --> 03:44.069
Illinois since yesterday afternoon that
we did have power.

03:44.069 --> 03:47.519
we did have blankets ritually happy
about that

03:47.519 --> 03:50.890
but one part of the country escape the
Deep Freeze

03:50.890 --> 03:55.060
sunny Southern California temperatures
in the seventies

03:55.060 --> 03:58.470
the fact that it is the beginning in
January and I eating

03:58.470 --> 04:03.600
a covered by ice cream cost them
starting tomorrow those still suffering

04:03.600 --> 04:04.670
to the cold

04:04.670 --> 04:07.830
can expect somewhat warmer weather at
least

04:07.830 --> 04:13.390
near or above freezing we've heard the
term polar vortex quite a bit during

04:13.390 --> 04:14.790
this deep reason

04:14.790 --> 04:18.850
here to help us understand the science
behind it I'm joined by Andrew Friedman

04:18.850 --> 04:20.609
he senior science writer

04:20.609 --> 04:25.580
at Climate Central News & Research
organization Andrew Friedman thank you

04:25.580 --> 04:29.680
for being with us so tell us what is the
polar vortex

04:29.680 --> 04:33.560
so the polar vortex actually is is not
really a new

04:33.560 --> 04:37.210
meteorological phenomenon its armed just

04:37.210 --> 04:41.250
the national attention has been focused
on it and the past couple days it's

04:41.250 --> 04:45.800
you can think of it as this mass love
very cold air

04:45.800 --> 04:50.050
that usually resides near the North Pole
the user's eyes in the Arctic

04:50.050 --> 04:53.530
and is surrounded by very fast
upper-level winds

04:53.530 --> 04:57.280
and so so it usually sits there

04:57.280 --> 05:02.160
but what happened what caused it to move
yes that's especially interesting so

05:02.160 --> 05:06.889
usually these fast-moving upper-level
winds Canada trap that are out there and

05:06.889 --> 05:07.910
keep it up there

05:07.910 --> 05:11.190
and that's relatively good for people
down

05:11.190 --> 05:15.030
in the continental US cuz it spares us
from some the brutal called

05:15.030 --> 05:18.740
but occasionally what can happen is
those wins weekend

05:18.740 --> 05:22.320
and it's sort of Lake when you have a
spinning top

05:22.320 --> 05:25.440
when it's spinning very quickly it's
pretty stable

05:25.440 --> 05:30.479
when it starts to slow down it meanders
and wobbles and what we had was

05:30.479 --> 05:34.669
a while ball in the polaroid tax

05:34.669 --> 05:38.050
that kinda pinged of this this large
chunk of it

05:38.050 --> 05:43.210
and slid it South with the a dove other
weather systems and the jet stream that

05:43.210 --> 05:44.500
were more familiar with

05:44.500 --> 05:48.770
so at the risk of getting are really in
the weeds here what caused it to slow

05:48.770 --> 05:50.110
down to

05:50.110 --> 05:53.370
to start this wobble well I

05:53.370 --> 05:57.320
someone that is dynamics that are going
on in the very high atmosphere in the

05:57.320 --> 05:58.340
stratosphere

05:58.340 --> 06:02.510
I'm there's often waves that can I go
through the atmosphere from

06:02.510 --> 06:05.900
low to high and from high to low and I
can help

06:05.900 --> 06:09.880
I cause some in these wobbles I'm
there's also you know

06:09.880 --> 06:14.510
areas of high pressure I'm call blocking
eyes that sorted acts Lake

06:14.510 --> 06:19.140
stop signs in the atmosphere preventing
storms from kinda

06:19.140 --> 06:24.270
going through them and we had a a series
have blocking hines

06:24.270 --> 06:28.690
over the past week or so over the North
Pacific especially

06:28.690 --> 06:32.409
they kinda rerouted the traffic in the
atmosphere

06:32.409 --> 06:35.740
so it and is that what caused it to come
so far south

06:35.740 --> 06:40.140
this time yeah that that's that's pretty
much an explanation above why

06:40.140 --> 06:44.210
the polar vortex why such a big chunk of
it came this far south but

06:44.210 --> 06:47.640
given mind you know we haven't seen
anything like this in a in a long time

06:47.640 --> 06:49.180
in twenty to thirty years

06:49.180 --> 06:52.830
a lot other the records are being broken
from those periods

06:52.830 --> 06:57.030
but we have seen this before this is not
an all-time cold

06:57.030 --> 07:00.479
events that we've had many many worse
outbreaks

07:00.479 --> 07:02.669
any any way to predict how

07:02.669 --> 07:05.479
how often we're going to see it happen
in the future when we're gonna see the

07:05.479 --> 07:06.509
next one come

07:06.509 --> 07:10.429
well we can predict it in advance in
terms have

07:10.429 --> 07:15.189
a weaker to perhaps but a you know what
we are certain games he it is that we're

07:15.189 --> 07:18.279
going to continue to have called
outbreaks throughout the winter

07:18.279 --> 07:21.639
I'm but long-term climate change

07:21.639 --> 07:26.159
means that a lot of the cold outbreaks
that we experience may not be quite as

07:26.159 --> 07:27.689
cold as they used to be

07:27.689 --> 07:33.199
we're seeing more less frequent I
extremely cold temperatures in many cold

07:33.199 --> 07:35.649
places Minneapolis has had much

07:35.649 --> 07:40.270
fewer days although about -10 degrees
Fahrenheit

07:40.270 --> 07:46.339
fewer nighttime lows that allow in their
past decade versus the 1970s for example

07:46.339 --> 07:50.339
so you know the the long-term trend is
up but we've got these

07:50.339 --> 07:54.649
natural variations i in weather patterns
that we try to keep close track a

07:54.649 --> 07:58.629
and it sure does catch everybody's
attention Andrew Friedman have

07:58.629 --> 08:05.589
climates and for we thank you thank you
JP Morgan Chase agreed today to pay more

08:05.589 --> 08:07.569
than two and a half billion dollars

08:07.569 --> 08:10.839
to several criminal charges in the
Bernie Madoff fraud

08:10.839 --> 08:14.809
federal authorities charged the bank
ignored warning signs

08:14.809 --> 08:19.389
that made of was running a huge Ponzi
scheme will get full details right after

08:19.389 --> 08:20.379
the news summary:

08:20.379 --> 08:23.539
on wall street today stocks finally had
the first

08:23.539 --> 08:27.229
up day of the new year the Dow Jones
Industrial Average gained more than a

08:27.229 --> 08:28.740
hundred and five points

08:28.740 --> 08:32.300
to close at almost 16,000 531

08:32.300 --> 08:36.680
the Nasdaq rose 39 points to close it
4153

08:36.680 --> 08:40.130
a bill to restore long-term unemployment
benefits

08:40.130 --> 08:44.730
took its first step forward in the
Senate today half a dozen Republicans

08:44.730 --> 08:45.899
join Democrats

08:45.899 --> 08:50.779
to begin formal debate republicans also
call for spending cuts to pay for the

08:50.779 --> 08:51.259
bill

08:51.259 --> 08:55.040
will have a full report on today's
action later in the program

08:55.040 --> 09:00.250
in Iraq the government claimed it struck
a key blow et al Qaeda militants holding

09:00.250 --> 09:01.180
two cities

09:01.180 --> 09:06.139
the military said this video showed an
airstrike on an operation center

09:06.139 --> 09:10.980
just outside Ramadi it said 25 fighters
died in the attack

09:10.980 --> 09:14.510
militancy is Ramadi and Fallujah last
week

09:14.510 --> 09:18.660
when government troops pull back today
suny lawmakers warn

09:18.660 --> 09:22.309
that the shiite-led government should
keep out ish

09:22.309 --> 09:25.649
about the and yeah and it was the iraqi
troops were pulled out a

09:25.649 --> 09:29.800
and bar because they were defeated they
face tribes and so many armed men

09:29.800 --> 09:32.760
the troops participation in civilian
issues which are in fact the

09:32.760 --> 09:34.610
responsibilities of local police

09:34.610 --> 09:38.040
has created chaos in Anbar and the
situation is out of control

09:38.040 --> 09:42.760
the Obama administration has pledged to
help the iraqi government by providing

09:42.760 --> 09:44.519
surveillance drones

09:44.519 --> 09:48.189
the first chemical weapons materials
have left Syria

09:48.189 --> 09:51.370
the UN announced today that poison gas
ingredients

09:51.370 --> 09:56.069
were loaded aboard a Danish ship the
vessel took on the cargo in the port of

09:56.069 --> 09:57.000
Latakia

09:57.000 --> 10:00.069
then put to sea until the next shipment
arrives

10:00.069 --> 10:03.420
eventually the chemicals will be
destroyed when a US

10:03.420 --> 10:07.779
navy ship a corruption scandal in turkey
took a new turn

10:07.779 --> 10:11.230
overnight as Prime Minister ray gypped I
refer to one

10:11.230 --> 10:15.519
dismissed or reassigned 350 police
officers

10:15.519 --> 10:19.079
it was his latest effort to contain an
investigation

10:19.079 --> 10:24.059
he says is politically motivated a
corruption probe has grown steadily

10:24.059 --> 10:28.089
to include cabinet ministers and
businessman close to the government

10:28.089 --> 10:31.380
the los angeles county sheriff announced
today

10:31.380 --> 10:35.350
he'll retire from running the nation's
largest county jail system

10:35.350 --> 10:40.079
in the face of a scandal last month 18
current and former deputy

10:40.079 --> 10:43.089
were indicted on charges ranging from
beating

10:43.089 --> 10:47.670
inmates to obstructing investigators
today Sheriff Lee Baca

10:47.670 --> 10:52.040
said he decided not to seek a fifth term
to prevent further damage to his

10:52.040 --> 10:52.709
department

10:52.709 --> 10:57.800
the reasons for doing so are so many

10:57.800 --> 11:01.189
summer most personal and private

11:01.189 --> 11:05.610
but the prevailing one is a negative
perception

11:05.610 --> 11:09.069
this upcoming campaign has brought

11:09.069 --> 11:13.029
to the exemplary service provided by the
men and women

11:13.029 --> 11:18.160
at the sheriff's department baca is 71
years old he said he will step down at

11:18.160 --> 11:19.959
the end of the month

11:19.959 --> 11:24.390
more than a hundred former New York City
police officers firefighters in prison

11:24.390 --> 11:25.040
guard

11:25.040 --> 11:28.040
were charged today with faking mental
problems

11:28.040 --> 11:32.660
to get federal disability benefits some
falsely said they suffered ailments

11:32.660 --> 11:34.179
after 9/11

11:34.179 --> 11:37.630
prosecutors say four ringleaders coach
officers

11:37.630 --> 11:41.679
on how to describe symptoms of
depression and other problems

11:41.679 --> 11:45.230
they receive payouts as high as 500,000
dollars

11:45.230 --> 11:48.370
and ringleaders allegedly got kickbacks

11:48.370 --> 11:52.179
in Chicago a ban on handgun sales is now
in limbo

11:52.179 --> 11:55.860
a federal judge ruled Monday that
ordinances barring such sales

11:55.860 --> 12:00.500
are unconstitutional but he agreed to
delay his ruling from taking effect

12:00.500 --> 12:05.010
can give the city time to appeal last
year Chicago led all

12:05.010 --> 12:08.179
other American cities in homicides

12:08.179 --> 12:12.569
still to come on the news hour another
record fine for JP Morgan

12:12.569 --> 12:16.290
a bill to extend unemployment benefits
clears a key vote

12:16.290 --> 12:19.870
what to expect from Janet Yellen Federal
Reserve

12:19.870 --> 12:25.250
an inside look at a terrorist training
camp plus the challenger fighting hunger

12:25.250 --> 12:32.250
in the world crisis zones

12:36.689 --> 12:41.220
we return to the JP Morgan story in the
historic penalty it will pay

12:41.220 --> 12:44.290
but the banks connection with the maid
of Ponzi scheme

12:44.290 --> 12:49.540
settlement and find more announced five
years after Bri made of scheme collapsed

12:49.540 --> 12:50.459
around him

12:50.459 --> 12:54.170
and investors worldwide jeffrey Brown
picks up the details

12:54.170 --> 12:58.980
about those connections at the time that
nato's crimes were unveiled JP Morgan's

12:58.980 --> 13:02.569
name was not publicly connected with the
case in a significant way

13:02.569 --> 13:06.769
but federal prosecutors said today the
bank knew something was wrong

13:06.769 --> 13:10.949
well before the Ponzi scheme collapsed
US Attorney Preet Bharara

13:10.949 --> 13:14.319
spelled out some of that history at a
press conference this afternoon

13:14.319 --> 13:18.329
today's charges have been filed because
in this regard

13:18.329 --> 13:22.499
JP Morgan as an institution failed

13:22.499 --> 13:26.660
and failed miserably in part because of
that failure

13:26.660 --> 13:30.360
for decades Bernie Madoff was able to
launder

13:30.360 --> 13:34.319
billions of dollars in Ponzi proceeds
essentially

13:34.319 --> 13:37.350
to a single set up accounts JP Morgan

13:37.350 --> 13:43.309
far back as 1998 a bank fund manager
concluded that made us returns were

13:43.309 --> 13:46.850
were quote possibly too good to be true

13:46.850 --> 13:50.089
close for that there were too many red
flags

13:50.089 --> 13:54.240
Patricia Hurtado has been covering this
poor Bloomberg News & was at the

13:54.240 --> 13:56.720
prosecutor's press conference today she
joins me now

13:56.720 --> 14:00.079
well positioned thanks for joining us
such fill in the picture a little bit

14:00.079 --> 14:01.259
what exactly

14:01.259 --> 14:07.029
is JP Morgan admitting that it did well
they're basically accused of being the

14:07.029 --> 14:08.829
private banker for Bernard Madoff

14:08.829 --> 14:13.279
enabling his Ponzi scheme to continue
nearly but the mere fact that

14:13.279 --> 14:17.259
even though they were concerned and a
are got their own personal investments

14:17.259 --> 14:20.129
out it may often they thought they were
suspicious something was wrong

14:20.129 --> 14:23.769
they allowed other people to continue to
be victimized so we heard this

14:23.769 --> 14:27.860
phrase just now too good to be true
they're there that that's how it looked

14:27.860 --> 14:29.160
at least at the time but

14:29.160 --> 14:34.949
the problem is nobody said anything yet
the government basically alleges that

14:34.949 --> 14:38.149
for years dating back to 1986

14:38.149 --> 14:41.699
are made of had an account at JP Morgan
Chase

14:41.699 --> 14:45.949
and its predecessor entities and allowed
hundreds

14:45.949 --> 14:50.329
billions of dollars to go through and
allowed very unusual suspicious

14:50.329 --> 14:53.799
transactions to go through and yet the
bank never raise any red flags

14:53.799 --> 14:57.809
never raise any concerns and but the
that the bank was savvy enough to get

14:57.809 --> 14:59.990
its own money out when it became
concerned

14:59.990 --> 15:03.139
just before the fraud was uncovered in
December 2008

15:03.139 --> 15:06.610
now no individuals are cited I see to
the company said

15:06.610 --> 15:10.019
if I write the company still says it
doesn't believe employees

15:10.019 --> 15:16.720
knowingly assisted made of scheme yes
basically the US Attorney's Office

15:16.720 --> 15:19.929
conceded today that they're not charging
an individual that this is an

15:19.929 --> 15:21.470
institutional failure

15:21.470 --> 15:24.660
many many people this is a big huge bank

15:24.660 --> 15:28.589
are different and different parts to the
bank didn't communicate well with each

15:28.589 --> 15:31.379
other and didn't share their concerns
are sorta

15:31.379 --> 15:35.069
isolated or fragment eight their
concerns are fragmented

15:35.069 --> 15:38.069
so not one individual was aware the
Ponzi scheme

15:38.069 --> 15:41.879
and allowed it to continue Joe Patricia
give us some examples of the

15:41.879 --> 15:46.449
kinda red flags that were ignored well
the government

15:46.449 --> 15:51.069
as Sky a very unusual statement of facts
basically it's an admission

15:51.069 --> 15:54.519
of responsibility I i'm at Cobo if you
well

15:54.519 --> 15:57.649
up what the bank employees were talking

15:57.649 --> 16:01.429
insane to each other privately about
made of which are kinda incriminating

16:01.429 --> 16:05.199
for example there is one point in June
2007

16:05.199 --> 16:09.990
where one employee speculated that quote
made of and his returns are speculated

16:09.990 --> 16:11.819
to be part a Ponzi scheme

16:11.819 --> 16:16.509
and in December 98 one of the at JP
Morgan fund manager said

16:16.509 --> 16:20.179
that his returns are quote possibly too
good to be true

16:20.179 --> 16:23.350
and that they were quote too many red
flags and clout

16:23.350 --> 16:26.839
on and that in the last most significant
thing

16:26.839 --> 16:30.230
was in four months before pop I'm made
of play

16:30.230 --> 16:34.730
I basically admits he's conducted a
Ponzi scheme that's gone on for decades

16:34.730 --> 16:40.509
in December 2008 JP Morgan in October
2008 was really concerned

16:40.509 --> 16:44.629
and redeemed $275 million dollars have
its own money

16:44.629 --> 16:47.939
off from its investing with Madoff and
at one point

16:47.939 --> 16:52.019
wanna that traders said in October's 16
2008

16:52.019 --> 16:55.029
weeks before Madoff's fraud was
uncovered in December

16:55.029 --> 16:58.519
there are many elements in this story
that could make s nervous

16:58.519 --> 17:02.569
and later when may of was arrested on
December 11 2008

17:02.569 --> 17:05.689
one made of employees remark to another
one

17:05.689 --> 17:08.929
can't say I'm surprised can you and the
other guy said

17:08.929 --> 17:13.120
now now this is referred to as a
deferred prosecution agreement with the

17:13.120 --> 17:14.250
US attorney what

17:14.250 --> 17:18.360
what exactly does that mean is is still
potential for prosecution

17:18.360 --> 17:22.579
now if the bank continued amid a
basically agrees to behave itself it's

17:22.579 --> 17:23.669
like kind of like Witcher

17:23.669 --> 17:27.789
you might remember is terrible secret
probation their toll they have to behave

17:27.789 --> 17:31.620
there under the government's non for two
years

17:31.620 --> 17:35.389
they have to report to the US Attorney's
Office to prosecutors

17:35.389 --> 17:39.110
to federal regulators to banking
officials as well as the FBI

17:39.110 --> 17:42.639
and they have to alert the government as
soon as there where anybody is

17:42.639 --> 17:45.710
misbehaving and not complying with
banking regulations

17:45.710 --> 17:50.240
than they are on notice to notify the
government ASAP otherwise they will be

17:50.240 --> 17:51.120
prosecuted

17:51.120 --> 17:55.289
so its deferred for two years I'm told
they agree they are

17:55.289 --> 17:58.879
of probation basically so explain to us
something about

17:58.879 --> 18:03.159
the money involved here how much in
where is it going to much of it is

18:03.159 --> 18:06.590
much are all that going to victims yes
basically a

18:06.590 --> 18:09.929
Manhattan US Attorney Preet Bharara said
today that on

18:09.929 --> 18:13.159
with the addition of the 1.7 billion
that they're getting

18:13.159 --> 18:16.330
from extracted from JP Morgan today on
top

18:16.330 --> 18:20.730
of hundreds of millions of dollars it
can't Guyana billions in four billion

18:20.730 --> 18:22.090
dollars are

18:22.090 --> 18:25.470
basically collected through another made
of

18:25.470 --> 18:29.919
II case forfeiture case there's going to
be four billion dollars that are gonna

18:29.919 --> 18:31.210
be basically

18:31.210 --> 18:35.039
I've gotten into the pockets all the
maid of victims

18:35.039 --> 18:38.760
so summer this is going to the little
confusing there's a

18:38.760 --> 18:42.179
1.7 billion going through the they are
on the

18:42.179 --> 18:46.830
that the criminal side and then more a
Gather separately paying

18:46.830 --> 18:50.629
102 million dollars to settle private
claims

18:50.629 --> 18:54.809
yeah basically all the money from this
case is basically the government's

18:54.809 --> 18:59.149
agreement with the bank so this is one
point seven billion that's going and to

18:59.149 --> 19:00.299
be dispersed to

19:00.299 --> 19:05.179
made of account made of victims then
there's $350 million that's going to be

19:05.179 --> 19:06.220
dispersed

19:06.220 --> 19:10.080
are in a separate payment that the bank
is making to the officer

19:10.080 --> 19:14.940
are currency in controller and and 543
million

19:14.940 --> 19:18.529
areas are being collected by I the

19:18.529 --> 19:23.850
I the II trustee that's overseeing the
bankruptcy at me off

19:23.850 --> 19:27.309
NAS and the other part of this you say
is that the bank agrees to some kind of

19:27.309 --> 19:28.340
monitoring your

19:28.340 --> 19:32.220
something various steps to make sure it
doesn't happen again

19:32.220 --> 19:36.039
yes it also in addition to ask certain
knowledge responsibility which went on

19:36.039 --> 19:37.059
for pages

19:37.059 --> 19:40.770
have years in years and years a systemic
failures

19:40.770 --> 19:44.059
to pay attention to these basic red
flags that

19:44.059 --> 19:49.220
made of wasn't totally kosher so how
unusual is all this out big a deal did

19:49.220 --> 19:49.610
the

19:49.610 --> 19:54.350
US Attorney see it on it is very rare

19:54.350 --> 19:57.620
and it is pretty significant it's the
second largest

19:57.620 --> 20:01.220
forfeiture that the government has ever
been able to extract the Department of

20:01.220 --> 20:02.970
Justice ever been able to get from

20:02.970 --> 20:08.799
banking institution on only the larger
one was on real involved HSBC

20:08.799 --> 20:13.350
so it's significant it's quite a big Dan
it's cold outside in New York and it was

20:13.350 --> 20:14.690
kinda cold day for

20:14.690 --> 20:17.740
on JP Morgan today alright Patricia
Hurtado

20:17.740 --> 20:20.980
Bloomberg thanks so much

20:20.980 --> 20:25.289
even as prosecutors announced the JP
Morgan settlement a separate trial got

20:25.289 --> 20:26.320
underway today

20:26.320 --> 20:30.919
over allegations that insider trading by
the former manager of the hedge fund

20:30.919 --> 20:35.659
run by billionaire Steven a call when
insider trading has been a major focus

20:35.659 --> 20:37.549
for the US Attorney's Office

20:37.549 --> 20:41.549
for seven years and Cohen's hedge fund
SAAC

20:41.549 --> 20:45.740
has become a major target of several
cases that's the subject of tonight's

20:45.740 --> 20:46.950
frontline

20:46.950 --> 20:51.149
to catch a traitor here's an excerpt
about the pursuit of Cohen

20:51.149 --> 20:55.059
including exclusive footage video
deposition he gave

20:55.059 --> 20:59.820
in a private civil suit over these
matters

20:59.820 --> 21:03.370
this is a copy of the SEC's Kotov ethics
and conduct

21:03.370 --> 21:05.370
obtained by frontline

21:05.370 --> 21:08.850
in the industry it's called a compliance
manual and

21:08.850 --> 21:12.300
it spells out the rules prohibiting
insider trading

21:12.300 --> 21:15.470
in his 2011 deposition

21:15.470 --> 21:19.940
colon was asked by the plaintiffs
attorney if he was familiar with SEC's

21:19.940 --> 21:21.170
compliance manual

21:21.170 --> 21:24.230
now the SACE compliance manual

21:24.230 --> 21:27.610
time provided that if you are in
possession of material non-public

21:27.610 --> 21:31.150
information you could not trade period
radio

21:31.150 --> 21:34.330
while the weather looks like object I'm
not sure I don't know what it says

21:34.330 --> 21:37.420
go catch you don't know at the time you
didn't know what missus is compliance

21:37.420 --> 21:38.970
manual said insider trading

21:38.970 --> 21:42.850
in on when it comes to trading I rely
account some

21:42.850 --> 21:45.440
you know you're talking about somebody
has been in the industry for thirty

21:45.440 --> 21:45.960
years

21:45.960 --> 21:49.710
and for him to be that oblivious I love
these very sensual things that his

21:49.710 --> 21:50.250
business

21:50.250 --> 21:54.100
in that deposition was shocking I
remember what is

21:54.100 --> 21:57.640
thats case you don't know today sitting
here Saturday from 10 points manual so i

21:57.640 --> 21:58.180
i

21:58.180 --> 22:01.400
I've read it but I don't know if you're
asking what it says today I remember

22:01.400 --> 22:04.130
what it meant was he really didn't care

22:04.130 --> 22:07.540
to have and understanding love what the
rules were

22:07.540 --> 22:10.830
or even what was in his compliance
manual which has told me

22:10.830 --> 22:14.760
he didn't take those things very
seriously and there was trading

22:14.760 --> 22:20.880
in for faxing the depositions was part
of a lawsuit filed against SEC and other

22:20.880 --> 22:22.740
hedge funds by a company called

22:22.740 --> 22:27.330
Fairfax Financial Fairfax over
allegations of price manipulation

22:27.330 --> 22:32.030
and we want short Fairfax Fairfax had
been targeted for what class could call

22:32.030 --> 22:35.950
a bear rate which is when short sellers
want to market place and try and drive

22:35.950 --> 22:38.030
to stock price down artificially

22:38.030 --> 22:41.650
by putting out negative information
about the company well really comes down

22:41.650 --> 22:42.720
to where they heard that

22:42.720 --> 22:46.930
if they heard a rumor I think it's only
appropriate if Michael boy

22:46.930 --> 22:50.910
ask call on whether he thought it was
acceptable for his traders too short a

22:50.910 --> 22:51.570
stock

22:51.570 --> 22:55.110
if they have advanced knowledge of
negative press stories about the company

22:55.110 --> 22:58.370
if they sent you an email that said the
reporter told me is coming out with a

22:58.370 --> 22:59.400
negative story

22:59.400 --> 23:06.400
is that your testimony to be okay for
them too short

23:29.539 --> 23:33.640
if the story was not coming out in a
relatively short period of time

23:33.640 --> 23:37.179
I would say a there was a and the union
that

23:37.179 --> 23:40.429
I think I might be okay Fairfax's suit
was dismissed

23:40.429 --> 23:44.159
but the Securities and Exchange
Commission took an interest in cones

23:44.159 --> 23:45.470
answers under oath

23:45.470 --> 23:49.260
been subpoenaed his deposition
deposition by Steve Cohen may come back

23:49.260 --> 23:50.260
to haunt him

23:50.260 --> 23:53.539
as he tries to protect his mcg Capital
from me federal

23:53.539 --> 23:56.750
insider-trading lawsuit in July of 2013

23:56.750 --> 24:00.260
the SEC brought a civil case against
going

24:00.260 --> 24:04.789
alleging he failed to supervise his
traders the charge he is white

24:04.789 --> 24:08.610
they basically said look this was an
operation where there was a complete

24:08.610 --> 24:12.640
failure of compliance and Colin who is
his name on the door in on two hundred

24:12.640 --> 24:13.880
percent in the firm

24:13.880 --> 24:18.270
fail to properly supervise these guys
that's a month

24:18.270 --> 24:21.460
the Justice Department filed a criminal
indictment against

24:21.460 --> 24:25.470
SEC in calling it a magnet for market
cheaters

24:25.470 --> 24:30.000
in the government decided that they
found insider trading so pervasive

24:30.000 --> 24:33.700
that they wanted to put their foot down
and say okay this is effectively a

24:33.700 --> 24:35.110
criminal enterprise

24:35.110 --> 24:38.679
and we're going to declare that and
charge the firm criminally

24:38.679 --> 24:43.409
in Stephen Collins lawyers have argued
that he has never been involved in

24:43.409 --> 24:45.320
insider trading

24:45.320 --> 24:50.760
colin has repeatedly declined
frontline's request for an interview

24:50.760 --> 24:53.610
tonight addition a front line to catch a
traitor

24:53.610 --> 25:00.610
airs on most PBS stations later this
evening US Senate took action to extend

25:06.750 --> 25:09.650
emergency unemployment insurance today

25:09.650 --> 25:12.960
but as news our congressional
correspondent Kwami Homan report

25:12.960 --> 25:16.870
many challenges still remain before
benefits are restored

25:16.870 --> 25:21.040
on this vote the yeas are sixty the
names are 37

25:21.040 --> 25:24.760
the drive to restore benefits to the
long-term unemployed

25:24.760 --> 25:29.000
cleared its first hurdle this morning as
the senate voted to proceed with debate

25:29.000 --> 25:33.720
Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid
argued millions of people need the help

25:33.720 --> 25:38.090
and so does the economy American Jews
are on employee benefits to buy food and

25:38.090 --> 25:40.620
fuel and gas station to pay the landlord

25:40.620 --> 25:47.160
would approach to child a cope that's
why every dollar we spend unemployment

25:47.160 --> 25:48.320
benefits I repeat

25:48.320 --> 25:52.490
the economy grows by dollar-and-a-half
never six Republicans

25:52.490 --> 25:56.000
sided with the Democrats in voting to
limit debate on the bill

25:56.000 --> 26:01.030
for it provides up to 47 weeks out
federal unemployment benefits

26:01.030 --> 26:05.840
after state offerings are exhausted the
payments had averaged three hundred

26:05.840 --> 26:06.660
dollars a week

26:06.660 --> 26:12.470
when the program expire December 28 this
bill would restore benefits to 1.3

26:12.470 --> 26:14.630
million Americans for three months

26:14.630 --> 26:19.470
while a longer-term deal is worked on
Republican Minority Leader Mitch

26:19.470 --> 26:21.970
McConnell said he still wants to see
those

26:21.970 --> 26:25.080
6.4 billion dollar cost officer

26:25.080 --> 26:30.150
one way he suggested is to eliminate new
health care subsidies for the poor

26:30.150 --> 26:34.480
by delaying the requirement they get
coverage not like to propose that

26:34.480 --> 26:38.590
will be allowed about %uh be allowed to
offer an amendment to pay for these

26:38.590 --> 26:39.310
benefits

26:39.310 --> 26:43.770
by lifting the burden Obamacare's
individual mandate for one year

26:43.770 --> 26:48.420
and take care our veterans who were
harmed by the recently agreed to budget

26:48.420 --> 26:48.880
deal

26:48.880 --> 26:52.070
read was quick to knock down mcconnell's
proposal

26:52.070 --> 26:55.210
while leaving the door open to spending
cuts elsewhere

26:55.210 --> 27:00.110
he wants to pay for them by lacking
Obamacare

27:00.110 --> 27:03.570
that's a non-starter so

27:03.570 --> 27:07.340
if they come with something that's

27:07.340 --> 27:10.700
serious

27:10.700 --> 27:15.200
I'll talk to them right now everyone
should understand

27:15.200 --> 27:20.410
the low-hanging fruit is gone unemployed
all over that as President Obama met

27:20.410 --> 27:23.030
with people who've lost their job loss
benefits

27:23.030 --> 27:26.730
we welcome Senate vote but said it's
just the first step

27:26.730 --> 27:29.840
all they've agreed to so far as that
were actually gonna be able to

27:29.840 --> 27:34.610
have a vote on man actually passed so we
gotta

27:34.610 --> 27:37.830
get this across the finish line without
obstruction or delay

27:37.830 --> 27:41.680
and we need the House of Representatives
to be able to vote for it as well

27:41.680 --> 27:47.400
and its thats that may not be easy

27:47.400 --> 27:50.460
in a statement Republican House Speaker
John Boehner

27:50.460 --> 27:54.730
warned even if it passes the Senate bill
has little chance of reaching the house

27:54.730 --> 27:55.380
floor

27:55.380 --> 27:59.870
he said another extension of temporary
emergency unemployment benefits

27:59.870 --> 28:03.970
should not only be paid for but include
something to help put people back to

28:03.970 --> 28:04.470
work

28:04.470 --> 28:09.350
to date the president has offered no
such point number last Senate Democrats

28:09.350 --> 28:10.980
pushed forward for a second

28:10.980 --> 28:16.420
key procedural vote sometime this week
the high rate of unemployment is one of

28:16.420 --> 28:20.290
many challenges that the new chair the
Federal Reserve will face

28:20.290 --> 28:24.720
when she takes over next month Janet
Yellen the first woman to head the

28:24.720 --> 28:25.650
Central Bank

28:25.650 --> 28:29.630
was confirmed by the Senate last night
she's already made it clear that

28:29.630 --> 28:32.290
joblessness is one of her main concerns

28:32.290 --> 28:35.440
we take a closer look at how she may
change things

28:35.440 --> 28:39.540
she tries to navigate some tricky
terrain Michael Hirsch has written about

28:39.540 --> 28:40.380
the yelling

28:40.380 --> 28:43.520
agenda for national journal and Jillian
te

28:43.520 --> 28:47.040
rights on these matters for the
financial times and welcome to you both

28:47.040 --> 28:51.570
so Michael her she offers a is we just
said Janet Yellen is made it clear she

28:51.570 --> 28:52.940
worries a lot about

28:52.940 --> 28:57.610
unemployment what more do you expect we
expect her to do as chairman at the fed

28:57.610 --> 28:58.580
about that

28:58.580 --> 29:03.070
well I think the main thing is this has
been the grand passion for life

29:03.070 --> 29:06.910
and her career as an economist you look
at what she's written

29:06.910 --> 29:10.840
she comes at a very activist traditional
keynesian tradition

29:10.840 --> 29:15.540
economic thinking that is quite
distinctive I think from the previous to

29:15.540 --> 29:16.680
fed chairman

29:16.680 --> 29:19.760
alan greenspan embed bracket both of
whom were conservative

29:19.760 --> 29:24.250
economists I and I think that based on
her writings and some other things she

29:24.250 --> 29:26.020
said in her speech is going back

29:26.020 --> 29:30.200
more than a decade we can expect to see
her focus on the

29:30.200 --> 29:33.670
employment issue in a way that I I don't
think we've seen the Federal Reserve

29:33.670 --> 29:35.020
Chairman do for quite a while

29:35.020 --> 29:38.940
and she's in a position to make a
difference the important thing about

29:38.940 --> 29:40.560
Federal Reserve

29:40.560 --> 29:43.590
share people like us we have to use that
term now are

29:43.590 --> 29:47.900
is they have an influence that goes way
beyond the specific mandate the Fed

29:47.900 --> 29:52.570
monetary policy their economic thinking
is enormously influential not just in

29:52.570 --> 29:54.270
Washington right around the world

29:54.270 --> 29:58.550
this is the most important economic job
in the world it said to be the most

29:58.550 --> 30:02.550
second most important he job in
Washington after the president

30:02.550 --> 30:06.480
so I think you know her four-year term
earning during that time we're gonna see

30:06.480 --> 30:10.010
a lot of testimony a lot of discussions
with congress that are gonna shape

30:10.010 --> 30:13.950
perhaps a new thinking on on on
employment so gillian 10 at the same

30:13.950 --> 30:16.160
time she's expressed alarm worry about

30:16.160 --> 30:21.570
joblessness she's also under pressure to
wind down this stimulus program that the

30:21.570 --> 30:24.030
Federal Reserve has been engage in bond

30:24.030 --> 30:28.929
a asset-buying so-called quantitative
easing how much

30:28.929 --> 30:32.030
tension is there between those two goals

30:32.030 --> 30:35.980
well the reality is that writing tension
right now and you can see that

30:35.980 --> 30:39.450
in terms that people sitting one table
with her on the Federal Reserve

30:39.450 --> 30:40.350
committee

30:40.350 --> 30:44.470
because opinions are increasingly
divided about just how quickly

30:44.470 --> 30:48.440
the Fed should change call for not but
the key thing to understand about Janet

30:48.440 --> 30:48.870
Yellen

30:48.870 --> 30:52.750
Michael said is that she's not just the
first woman to hold the post which is

30:52.750 --> 30:53.720
remarkable

30:53.720 --> 30:56.950
but she'd won the first Keynesians to
actually hold that post

30:56.950 --> 31:00.670
she someone who really cares a lot about
the human face in economics

31:00.670 --> 31:03.850
and as she herself has said many times
for her

31:03.850 --> 31:07.050
unemployment if not just that but
justice takes

31:07.050 --> 31:11.300
is also very much by human lives so for
that reason alone we certainly can

31:11.300 --> 31:12.870
expect to see

31:12.870 --> 31:17.050
that to take a much softer policy line
and from her predecessors so

31:17.050 --> 31:21.770
Julian Ted staying with you what does
that mean we could look for her to do

31:21.770 --> 31:25.070
well I think the most important thing is
what you've not going to do

31:25.070 --> 31:28.790
and i'd with what he's not going to do
it withdraw the stimulus that that is

31:28.790 --> 31:31.120
put into the economy enough couple years

31:31.120 --> 31:35.720
in a very rapid manner she someone is
really looking for a gentle exit

31:35.720 --> 31:36.660
strategy

31:36.660 --> 31:39.800
that ensures that although the Fed does
not

31:39.800 --> 31:43.340
fuel the bubble anymore that we've seen
in bond prices

31:43.340 --> 31:46.420
but at least it tries to maintain
estimates and keep the economic machine

31:46.420 --> 31:47.780
going

31:47.780 --> 31:51.610
and and Michael Hirsh in connection with
with all of this you wrote

31:51.610 --> 31:54.990
recently in his picks up watching you
what you said on which you said a few

31:54.990 --> 31:55.950
minutes ago

31:55.950 --> 32:00.060
that she for a long time is advocated a
higher minimum wage

32:00.060 --> 32:03.720
is she in a position to do something
about that not

32:03.720 --> 32:07.540
specifically in other words she that you
know again vent

32:07.540 --> 32:10.750
the Fed's mandate doesn't allow her to
shape

32:10.750 --> 32:13.990
legislation specifically and she's going
to be a little bit wary of getting

32:13.990 --> 32:17.810
into congress' business because there
has been some backlash

32:17.810 --> 32:21.500
against somebody's fed policies while
the reasons that her confirmation but

32:21.500 --> 32:23.060
was as close as it was

32:23.060 --> 32:26.190
but I do think that she will have a lot
of the

32:26.190 --> 32:30.620
influence in terms of the with the kinds
of things she says in her

32:30.620 --> 32:34.380
you know biannual our semi-annual rather

32:34.380 --> 32:37.720
congressional testimony in the kinds of
things she do

32:37.720 --> 32:42.750
she says in speeches in the same way
that alan greenspan over his 18 years at

32:42.750 --> 32:43.440
the Fed

32:43.440 --> 32:47.830
and Ben Bernanke he during his two terms
really influenced economic thinking

32:47.830 --> 32:50.190
about the response to the crisis and and

32:50.190 --> 32:53.160
you know the period before the crisis
enjoyment at this is something I know

32:53.160 --> 32:57.720
you've written about about how they how
important the communication skills

32:57.720 --> 33:02.630
the Federal Reserve chair I can be how
do you see that in connection with Janet

33:02.630 --> 33:03.260
Yellen

33:03.260 --> 33:07.860
well Jenny and somebody who even two
years ago with pointing out that

33:07.860 --> 33:11.050
the Fed has already engaged in such
extreme

33:11.050 --> 33:14.710
monetary policy measures that frankly
there's not a lot more they can do in

33:14.710 --> 33:17.210
terms actually putting money into the
economy

33:17.210 --> 33:21.310
instead they're increasingly trying to
shape how the economy works and how we

33:21.310 --> 33:23.150
all expect the economy to work

33:23.150 --> 33:26.980
by talking about the future by trying to
persuade people

33:26.980 --> 33:30.100
that they're going to take a very easy
start for a long time

33:30.100 --> 33:34.270
now that's incredibly controversial from
people that have policy which is called

33:34.270 --> 33:37.520
forward guidance willy is just a bunch
of the do

33:37.520 --> 33:41.370
but certainly it means that people can
be watching what John yen says

33:41.370 --> 33:45.880
very very carefully indeed because he's
not just describing what's happening

33:45.880 --> 33:49.929
should offer describing how she hopes to
steer the economy going for the future

33:49.929 --> 33:53.330
is that something you expect her to do
what do you very much so I think the

33:53.330 --> 33:56.720
most distinctive thing about Joe yellow
the fact which is the first woman to

33:56.720 --> 33:57.820
lead the fed

33:57.820 --> 34:01.690
is the Brett Favre economic thinking you
know Bernanke he's

34:01.690 --> 34:05.630
focus is a scholar was on the Great
Depression alan greenspan was very

34:05.630 --> 34:06.580
famously

34:06.580 --> 34:11.580
financial a communist she is someone who
has studied the whole economy and again

34:11.580 --> 34:14.870
in a very keynesian way she comes out of
this Act the school at Yale

34:14.870 --> 34:18.909
she studied under James Tobin who was
renowned for his belief in government to

34:18.909 --> 34:19.540
mention

34:19.540 --> 34:22.480
so I think you're going to see that
reflected in every policy decision she

34:22.480 --> 34:23.129
makes

34:23.129 --> 34:27.020
is Julian says you know first things
first she's going to have to decide on

34:27.020 --> 34:27.600
on on

34:27.600 --> 34:30.890
unwanted sir tabor back we are fed
intervention she's gonna be inclined to

34:30.890 --> 34:31.290
do

34:31.290 --> 34:34.679
that less than 10 more and and I would
you say I think you've also what you

34:34.679 --> 34:36.540
expected to be tougher in terms our
regular

34:36.540 --> 34:40.460
regulating Wall Street yeah that's
another already she's gotten into turf

34:40.460 --> 34:42.950
battles with Dan true love the fed
governor

34:42.950 --> 34:46.240
there who is who Bernanke use or to left
it to do this

34:46.240 --> 34:49.879
she she's at her as her gender something
that she wants to take on personally

34:49.879 --> 34:52.890
as fed chairman so I think you're going
to see her taking a much more prominent

34:52.890 --> 34:53.690
role

34:53.690 --> 34:56.750
perhaps even getting into a fight or two
with the Treasury Department how do you

34:56.750 --> 35:00.780
see that Jillian and now I do want to
ask about that the fact that she is the

35:00.780 --> 35:02.770
first woman and how that can affect

35:02.770 --> 35:07.290
if in any way what she does well before
I get on women issue

35:07.290 --> 35:10.900
i'd gonna point one thing out which is
it she have got more experience

35:10.900 --> 35:14.960
the one bit of good chief not got is the
right market experience

35:14.960 --> 35:17.970
and her focus is rather different from
approved SS

35:17.970 --> 35:21.210
she's actually not that focus on the way
the market behaved

35:21.210 --> 35:24.370
she cared for more about the real
economy the human face

35:24.370 --> 35:27.940
the economy and that could bring quite a
different tone to the kinda policy

35:27.940 --> 35:28.750
debate

35:28.750 --> 35:32.690
from what we've seen before does not
have any time with the back to the woman

35:32.690 --> 35:36.270
well it's very hard to say I think
however she does take a much more

35:36.270 --> 35:37.330
holistic view

35:37.330 --> 35:40.580
how economic growth is at work and
perhaps one the most

35:40.580 --> 35:45.340
into thinking the ball is it by being
the first woman to hold this position

35:45.340 --> 35:49.210
suddenly an entire generation of young
female economist

35:49.210 --> 35:52.780
can look up and think Wow made of
possible

35:52.780 --> 35:56.960
and that helped we ship expectations in
many ways it helps to be like caught the

35:56.960 --> 35:57.470
whole new

35:57.470 --> 36:00.770
faith a new stamp on what economic for
the back out

36:00.770 --> 36:03.670
and actually may help to encourage more
women into the field as well going

36:03.670 --> 36:04.430
forward

36:04.430 --> 36:07.810
why have there been so few women do you
think well

36:07.810 --> 36:11.140
happy I'm asking michael this but i
wanna get job but

36:11.140 --> 36:15.120
of combat I just how I play because if
you notice can make a difference I oh

36:15.120 --> 36:16.180
absolutely

36:16.180 --> 36:20.560
I also would note I don't think it's
just a coincidence that going back to

36:20.560 --> 36:23.620
brooklyn born who is the head of the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission

36:23.620 --> 36:24.820
late 1990s

36:24.820 --> 36:27.450
try to take on the issue
over-the-counter derivatives way before

36:27.450 --> 36:28.550
the crisis happen

36:28.550 --> 36:31.550
and was slapped down by the men in
charge

36:31.550 --> 36:35.590
we've seen women Sheila Bair the FDIC
come along and really take on wall

36:35.590 --> 36:36.990
street in a way that frankly

36:36.990 --> 36:40.810
not that many men have Gary Gensler does
is one of the few exceptions so

36:40.810 --> 36:44.890
it's interesting to see her at the tail
end of this in she represents also

36:44.890 --> 36:49.540
what's worse on described me as someone
who is truly not captured by Wall Street

36:49.540 --> 36:53.090
you know she is not not working there in
some ways as a strength

36:53.090 --> 36:56.950
and and and and that way like proxy war
like some of these other women who have

36:56.950 --> 36:59.090
not been for the wall street mindset

36:59.090 --> 37:02.430
you know she could stand back and look
at it the in a very different way than

37:02.430 --> 37:04.090
we've seen by some of those

37:04.090 --> 37:07.130
inside the power structure in washington
who have previously worked for Wells so

37:07.130 --> 37:09.650
chilling in just a few seconds what do
you look for

37:09.650 --> 37:13.220
well i'm looking for. heard but I think
about a new face about nomic

37:13.220 --> 37:16.190
and the great study by found the
universe to show that when you have a

37:16.190 --> 37:16.650
female

37:16.650 --> 37:20.500
economic professor in the Department you
get a lot well women doing PhD in

37:20.500 --> 37:21.380
economics

37:21.380 --> 37:24.740
to the very factually that could
certainly help to change because the

37:24.740 --> 37:26.690
economics the next generation

37:26.690 --> 37:29.780
those women can go on to become
policymakers

37:29.780 --> 37:33.220
well lessee at the moment that he can
defend the world central bank governors

37:33.220 --> 37:34.130
are women

37:34.130 --> 37:37.150
so that a lot of ground to catch up but
certainly the very interesting

37:37.150 --> 37:38.200
appointment

37:38.200 --> 37:41.220
gillian tat Michael Hirsh we thank you
both

37:41.220 --> 37:48.220
thank you

37:51.080 --> 37:54.240

37:54.240 --> 37:59.220
terrorist groups are secretive by nature
using violent attacks to make public

37:59.220 --> 38:00.430
statements

38:00.430 --> 38:03.650
tonight we get a rare look inside a
training camp for

38:03.650 --> 38:08.540

organization based in Somalia

attack at the Westgate shopping mall in

Kenya

38:37.560 --> 38:40.580
that left 67 people that

38:40.580 --> 38:44.130
this is the faith they want the world to
see

completed a six-month course

38:56.880 --> 39:00.500
the same military training as the
Westgate a Packers

believe else above is in decline but the
group A

39:39.650 --> 39:42.960
the Westgate Park proves how strong they
remain

39:42.960 --> 39:49.960
in that's why else about viewed the
Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi Kenya

39:51.050 --> 39:55.670
as a PR victory these

39:55.670 --> 39:59.560
terrifying images from the attack show
us about fighters

39:59.560 --> 40:05.580
casually walking through the mall as
they shoot civilians

40:05.580 --> 40:08.930
the most optimistic heading in the they
were innocent shoppers going about their

40:08.930 --> 40:09.770
daily life

40:09.770 --> 40:13.620
why target civilians rather than the
military Hill

40:13.620 --> 40:17.210

times stay away from us

40:17.210 --> 40:20.750

are you but they ignored us

40:25.080 --> 40:28.460
leading to look at what is the atomic we
knew we had to spill blood to send a

40:28.460 --> 40:29.130
message

40:29.130 --> 40:33.610
their women are better than ours their
sons are better than ours

40:33.610 --> 40:37.370
their children aren't better than ours

by several Western nations

42:08.200 --> 42:13.900
after losing control of all major cities

42:13.900 --> 42:17.050
the Islamists with thought to have been
defeated

42:17.050 --> 42:20.850
but they still control large parts of
the country

42:20.850 --> 42:24.190
and see themselves as an alternative
government

42:24.190 --> 42:27.330
this is

42:27.330 --> 42:31.060
Liberty key strategic crossing point

42:31.060 --> 42:34.830
on the Savannah River its announcer Bob
stronghold

42:34.830 --> 42:39.410
it also happens to be the tile where one
of the Westgate

42:39.410 --> 42:43.180
attackers came from

42:43.180 --> 42:47.360
the number and identities up clockers
still remains

42:47.360 --> 42:50.870
a mystery canyons claimed they were on
leave for

42:50.870 --> 42:54.160
but locals here suggests there were more

42:54.160 --> 42:57.590
and some I've been believed to have
returned to Somalia

42:57.590 --> 43:01.820
was opening the are you going to release
the identities of the attackers

43:01.820 --> 43:06.380
and I saw this on we will do that when
we choose to the men and women who did

43:06.380 --> 43:06.740
not

43:06.740 --> 43:09.760
it happened at the heart of their
country in the attack lasted days

43:09.760 --> 43:13.030
invalid and they still don't know if our
men escaped or not

43:13.030 --> 43:17.510
than in how many were there regularly
that shows how weak they are

43:17.510 --> 43:22.960
Leutze but got so are you enjoying their
we are very happy to see their weakness

43:22.960 --> 43:27.320
unlike other parts of southern and
central Somalia

43:27.320 --> 43:30.460
there is peace here but its and doubts
about

43:30.460 --> 43:34.450
strict Sharia law all the women do go to
school

43:34.450 --> 43:39.830
and allowed to run their own businesses
the locals my not agree with us above

43:39.830 --> 43:44.380
military campaign but they told me they
appreciate them for bringing

43:44.380 --> 43:47.810
law-and-order I ask local Mohammed but
the

43:47.810 --> 43:52.850
what like this like now under the self
appointed Sabah brought at the end of

43:52.850 --> 43:53.310
the month

43:53.310 --> 43:57.070
it's very good day and night it's a safe
place

43:57.070 --> 44:00.320
we're not afraid you don't hear gunshots

44:00.320 --> 44:05.180
I followed the his that doubts about
police on their beat

44:05.180 --> 44:10.390
none of them would let me fill in their
faces the first stop

44:10.390 --> 44:15.040
lost this restaurant telling the female
Allah to remove the rubbish from outside

44:15.040 --> 44:18.250
then

44:18.250 --> 44:22.870
they make their way to the local
hospital where they checked the pharmacy

44:22.870 --> 44:26.190
for out-of-date medicine well

44:26.190 --> 44:29.800
as a medicine man checked yes it's been
checked can past

44:29.800 --> 44:33.280
and also the cleanliness of the
facilities

44:33.280 --> 44:39.170
they seem satisfied I will finally stop

44:39.170 --> 44:43.500
is a minute supermarket where they
checked product expiry dates

44:43.500 --> 44:46.710
but us

44:46.710 --> 44:52.579
so on us they hear the call to prayer
everything stocks

44:52.579 --> 44:54.890
people head to the mosque for midday
prayer

44:54.890 --> 45:00.019
whether they like it or not up

45:00.019 --> 45:05.089
passing vehicles %uh pulled over healed

45:05.089 --> 45:09.660
spare time Arctic Arctic doubts about
police

45:09.660 --> 45:15.989
make sure everyone goes to the most here

45:15.989 --> 45:19.479
stand-up you can come back to work later
in

45:19.479 --> 45:23.440
23rd what are you doing

45:23.440 --> 45:26.940
I'm on my way then again stand up let's
go

45:26.940 --> 45:30.259
this picture is reluctant but no

45:30.259 --> 45:34.630
is not an option

45:34.630 --> 45:36.220
the mosque quickly fills

45:36.220 --> 45:40.650
up with some having to pray outside in
the heat well

45:40.650 --> 45:44.270
it's a good opportunity for also bob
spokesman

45:44.270 --> 45:47.330
a valid data this time in civilian
clothes

45:47.330 --> 45:51.290
to drum up more support and the little
girl

45:51.290 --> 45:54.760
it's your duty to deal with the infidels
in the long run out over but I think

45:54.760 --> 45:56.490
it's you who should defend Islam

45:56.490 --> 46:01.800
usual victory is close God willing
dollar held in the infidels have little

46:01.800 --> 46:02.590
time left

46:02.590 --> 46:08.380
there in their eleventh hour the

46:08.380 --> 46:11.810
in

46:11.810 --> 46:15.110
up

46:15.110 --> 46:18.890
it's an on this message from a group
that says

46:18.890 --> 46:22.040
it's been revived and strengthened by
the Kenya

46:22.040 --> 46:26.020
attack they say they will strike

46:26.020 --> 46:29.440
a game the question is where and where

46:29.440 --> 46:36.440
and now yeah

46:40.750 --> 46:43.600
finally tonight we turn our attention to
hunger

46:43.600 --> 46:47.930
their 870 million undernourished people
around the world

46:47.930 --> 46:52.150
most to them in developing countries
that is according to the United Nations

46:52.150 --> 46:56.820
and at least 20 percent of household
face extreme food shortages

46:56.820 --> 47:00.970
Jeff sat down recently with the woman in
charge of combatting

47:00.970 --> 47:06.740
this chronic problem the World Food
Program is the UN's frontline agency for

47:06.740 --> 47:10.810
fighting global hunger and right now it
has its hands especially full

47:10.810 --> 47:15.850
with four major food emergencies at once
in Syria with millions displaced in

47:15.850 --> 47:16.850
refugee camps

47:16.850 --> 47:20.150
in the central african republic another
conflict area

47:20.150 --> 47:24.680
where the UN has warned of potential
famine in neighboring South Sudan

47:24.680 --> 47:28.670
in the news recently with an outbreak a
factional and tribal violence

47:28.670 --> 47:32.350
and the Philippines still reeling from
typhoon high on

47:32.350 --> 47:36.960
the World Food Program is based in Rome
its executive directors or three and

47:36.960 --> 47:37.580
cousin

47:37.580 --> 47:40.920
an American with many years of
experience in food issues in the

47:40.920 --> 47:44.380
nonprofit corporate and government
sectors and she joins us now in love

47:44.380 --> 47:44.770
with you

47:44.770 --> 47:49.870
thank you so much first the sheer number
of emergency situations how unusual

47:49.870 --> 47:53.120
and and what kind of challenges is it to
deal with them all at once

47:53.120 --> 47:58.330
well meals to say it is highly unusual
when we created this category have level

47:58.330 --> 48:00.600
3 emergencies which the UN

48:00.600 --> 48:04.830
and the nonprofit community work
together globally to ensure that we meet

48:04.830 --> 48:05.850
the need to bells

48:05.850 --> 48:09.150
who are impacted by the most serious
emergencies we also

48:09.150 --> 48:12.180
what we do for yet three of them and now
we have four

48:12.180 --> 48:15.590
it's notable that three of the four are

48:15.590 --> 48:19.120
her conflict areas civil war a lot of
violence

48:19.120 --> 48:22.220
yes what kind of challenges does that
pose in particular

48:22.220 --> 48:26.930
all-news a sensible in conflict there is
a challenge is that you have

48:26.930 --> 48:30.260
war and you have the inability to access
those

48:30.260 --> 48:34.540
who are in what we call besieged areas
or areas where fighting is ongoing

48:34.540 --> 48:37.680
because it's very difficult for
humanitarian axles it

48:37.680 --> 48:40.760
access those areas to assist the victims
are

48:40.760 --> 48:44.050
up the complex so give so take an
example love the

48:44.050 --> 48:47.370
Central African Republic one that
doesn't get that much attention

48:47.370 --> 48:50.800
what are you doing what he able to do
what are you not able to do in the

48:50.800 --> 48:52.260
central african republic

48:52.260 --> 48:55.900
we are we fed over 300,000 people

48:55.900 --> 49:00.980
in the in Bangi itself as well as in
both ago I in the areas and the rural

49:00.980 --> 49:04.800
areas in Central African Republic but
the challenge is there a lot more people

49:04.800 --> 49:07.640
or need assistance that we can't get
access to

49:07.640 --> 49:10.930
and a good example of that is that
they're hundred thousand people

49:10.930 --> 49:14.130
in and around the airport itself in
Bengal

49:14.130 --> 49:17.340
when we began a feeding program in that
area

49:17.340 --> 49:21.930
are mention workers were tapped and so
we had to stop the feeling bold

49:21.930 --> 49:25.630
program yes food is there but you just
can't get it you can get it to people

49:25.630 --> 49:27.950
because the ongoing violence in the area

49:27.950 --> 49:32.450
though you know we would talk about
these crises but in the meantime there's

49:32.450 --> 49:33.780
so much more I now

49:33.780 --> 49:36.920
and I was just reading today about the
continuing problem

49:36.920 --> 49:41.100
you dealing with in Kenyan refugee camps
and I saw what you wrote

49:41.100 --> 49:45.430
the world's gaze has turned elsewhere
now this must happen

49:45.430 --> 49:48.630
constantly for you I it does

49:48.630 --> 49:54.470
and it's tragic because need you feel as
if you prioritize 100 child over another

49:54.470 --> 49:59.150
you do if you feel that person I feel
that personally because in Kenya and the

49:59.150 --> 50:03.890
DOB where you have Somali refugees is
still a 500,000 people in the Dadaab

50:03.890 --> 50:05.010
refugee camps

50:05.010 --> 50:09.620
and we had to cut rations their first 10
percent in December in another 10

50:09.620 --> 50:11.940
percent in January that means that

50:11.940 --> 50:15.020
their children they're they're not going
to get the nutritious food that they

50:15.020 --> 50:15.480
need

50:15.480 --> 50:18.800
you've been at this in many different
ways for a long time

50:18.800 --> 50:22.760
wind is the world pay attention in and
when does it not

50:22.760 --> 50:26.120
and I and when do you get frustrated who
knocks

50:26.120 --> 50:29.580
unfortunately the world pays attention
when

50:29.580 --> 50:32.870
the media shines a light on those in
need

50:32.870 --> 50:36.740
which is why it's so important that we
maintain the global public will that is

50:36.740 --> 50:37.560
necessary

50:37.560 --> 50:40.590
to meet the needs I love those we serve

50:40.590 --> 50:44.800
we require investments WP is a hundred
percent voluntarily

50:44.800 --> 50:49.120
funded and we depend upon the generosity
of governments from around the world

50:49.120 --> 50:50.400
like the United States

50:50.400 --> 50:55.310
where we received significant support
for for work but we recognize that

50:55.310 --> 50:57.880
there's only so many dollars to go
around

50:57.880 --> 51:02.110
and what it forces us to do is when I
get frustrated

51:02.110 --> 51:05.970
is when I see a situation where we know
we can make a difference

51:05.970 --> 51:09.340
but we don't have the resources to
support those in need and and and that

51:09.340 --> 51:10.350
happens

51:10.350 --> 51:15.140
to a too often a setting aside the
immediate crisis that we're talking

51:15.140 --> 51:15.610
about

51:15.610 --> 51:19.680
if you can for a moment when you think
about the longer-term issues of food

51:19.680 --> 51:22.730
security around the world because I know
is another area for you

51:22.730 --> 51:27.030
is just how people feed themselves not
as the world feed itself

51:27.030 --> 51:31.350
crises aside what do you think what what
do we need to know what what what is not

51:31.350 --> 51:33.150
happening that you'd like to see happen

51:33.150 --> 51:37.400
well the solutions are

51:37.400 --> 51:41.430
are available to us we were recognized
that the majority of people who are food

51:41.430 --> 51:43.160
insecure hungry in the world

51:43.160 --> 51:47.400
live in rural areas and most of them are
small holder subsistence farmers

51:47.400 --> 51:52.880
by increasing the development of the
agricultural chain and cultural

51:52.880 --> 51:56.240
marketing chain in countries where we
serve

51:56.240 --> 52:00.880
we can provide the economic support
necessary to those small holder so that

52:00.880 --> 52:01.940
they can

52:01.940 --> 52:05.190
feed their families in a sustainable and
durable manner

52:05.190 --> 52:08.290
so we know what what's required the
challenges

52:08.290 --> 52:12.730
it's not a one-year solution it's going
to require multi-year

52:12.730 --> 52:16.200
implementation all the work that is
necessary to some

52:16.200 --> 52:20.700
support the smallholder farmers so that
they can ultimately

52:20.700 --> 52:24.010
