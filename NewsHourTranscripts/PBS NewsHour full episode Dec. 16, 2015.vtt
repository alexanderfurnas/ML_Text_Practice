GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill. Judy Woodruff is on
assignment.

00:09.042 --> 00:13.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: A
judge in Baltimore declares a
hung jury for the first officer

00:13.714 --> 00:17.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
charged in the death
of Freddie Gray.

00:17.684 --> 00:22.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also ahead: near zero no more.
The Federal Reserve bank raises
interest rates for the

00:22.356 --> 00:26.560 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
first time in nearly a decade.

00:26.560 --> 00:31.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fact-checking the Republican
candidates at yesterday's
security-focused debate.

And how the musical duo Black
Violin is breaking stereotypes
by blending classical and
hip-hop.

00:38.238 --> 00:43.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEV MARCUS, Black Violin: I look
like I should be a linebacker,
but to be a violinist, when

00:43.543 --> 00:47.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I realized that, I was just,
like, I love it. I'm drawn to
it. It's the thing that --
that's

00:47.447 --> 00:50.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why I wake up in the morning, is
to take the violin and kind of
change people's perceptions

00:50.250 --> 00:51.919 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about it.

00:51.919 --> 00:53.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

(BREAK)

00:58.692 --> 01:09.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Two major
stories tonight.

01:09.636 --> 01:15.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Baltimore, a mistrial, a jury
deadlocked over the guilt or
innocence of a policeman

01:15.676 --> 01:21.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the death-in-custody of
Freddie Gray. The incident last
April touched off violent
protests,

01:21.014 --> 01:26.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and six officers were charged.
This was the first case to go to
trial.

01:26.219 --> 01:31.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Federal Reserve is doing
something it hasn't done since
2006: It's raising interest

01:31.591 --> 01:36.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rates. Today's long-awaited
announcement hikes a key
short-term rate by a
quarter-point from

01:36.663 --> 01:41.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
near zero. We will explore both
the Fed's decision and the
Baltimore mistrial, in full,

01:41.134 --> 01:44.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after the news summary.

01:44.471 --> 01:49.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the day's other news, Wall
Street surged on the Fed's
reasoning that the economy is

01:49.109 --> 01:54.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
finally strong enough to stand a
rate hike. The Dow Jones
industrial average gained 224

01:54.715 --> 02:03.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
points to close near 17750. The
Nasdaq rose 75 points, and the
S&amp;P 500 added 29.

02:03.857 --> 02:10.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Public schools in Los Angeles
reopened today. Officials
canceled classes for 640,000
students

02:10.063 --> 02:16.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yesterday over an e-mailed
threat that cited bombs and
guns. It was later deemed a
hoax.

02:16.636 --> 02:19.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Students returning this morning
encountered stepped-up security,
and the school district's

02:19.606 --> 02:22.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
decision was still a
topic of dispute.

02:22.843 --> 02:26.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KANIAH CHAPMAN, Student: I'm
really glad they did shut down
the school, because, for all

02:26.446 --> 02:29.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we know, it could have been our
school or any other school in --
around this district

02:29.916 --> 02:33.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that could have been bombed, and
a lot of kids would have gotten
hurt.

02:33.587 --> 02:36.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BLUE SANDEFUR, Parent: It didn't
inconvenience me, but I do think
that they overreacted.

02:36.957 --> 02:39.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I certainly think
they overreacted.

02:39.393 --> 02:42.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: New York City's
school system received a similar
threat, but it remained

02:42.763 --> 02:45.432 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
open.

02:45.432 --> 02:50.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Schools all over Pakistan closed
today, marking one year since a
Taliban attack that killed

02:50.337 --> 02:56.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more than 140 people, nearly all
of them children. A special
ceremony in Peshawar began with

02:56.743 --> 03:02.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a moment of silence, honoring
those who died in the assault on
an army-run school. Prime

03:02.749 --> 03:08.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Minister Nawaz Sharif addressed
today's crowd and promised
vengeance on behalf of the
victims.

03:08.055 --> 03:14.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Yemen, a day-old cease-fire
appeared in peril, as continued
fighting killed at least

03:14.428 --> 03:21.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
42 people. Clashes broke out in
five provinces, including around
the besieged city of Taiz

03:21.101 --> 03:26.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Southwestern Yemen. Security
officials said shelling by
Houthi rebels killed six

03:26.473 --> 03:31.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
civilians. They said field
commanders and fighters from
both sides were ignoring
cease-fire

03:31.545 --> 03:36.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
orders. The violence threatened
to undermine peace talks in
Switzerland.

03:36.616 --> 03:41.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Supreme Court of India is
laying down the law about air
pollution in New Delhi,

03:41.822 --> 03:46.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deemed the world's most polluted
city. The court today ordered a
three-month ban on sales

03:46.827 --> 03:50.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of large diesel vehicles,
imposed higher tolls for trucks,
and mandated that taxis switch

03:50.964 --> 03:54.401 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to natural gas.

03:54.401 --> 03:57.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Environmentalists welcomed the
moves, and urged India's
government to see that they're

03:57.037 --> 03:59.372 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
put into effect.

03:59.372 --> 04:04.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: They are going to look at
emission standards for vehicles,
pollution from power

04:04.845 --> 04:09.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plants, and public transport
strategy for the industry. It's
a great beginning, and

04:09.816 --> 04:13.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we just hope that this -- the
momentum that we're building up,
this should continue. We

04:13.487 --> 04:15.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
must not slow down.

04:15.755 --> 04:21.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Air pollution
contributes to more than 600,000
deaths each year across India.

04:21.728 --> 04:26.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The highest court in Japan dealt
a setback to advocates of gender
equality. A decision

04:26.967 --> 04:32.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today upheld a law that requires
married couples to use the same
surname. The law dates to

04:32.706 --> 04:38.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the 1800s. About 96 percent of
married women in Japan take
their husband's surname.

04:38.478 --> 04:44.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the Freddie Gray case declared a
mistrial; what the Fed

04:44.718 --> 05:02.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rate hike means for the U.S.
economy; fact-checking the
Republican debate; and much
more.

05:02.502 --> 05:05.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now to Baltimore and the
no-decision in the trial of
officer William Porter, for the
death

05:05.872 --> 05:08.842 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Freddie Gray.

05:08.842 --> 05:14.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The jury deliberated 15 hours
over three days, but it
deadlocked on manslaughter and
other

05:14.447 --> 05:19.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
charges. Gray's death in custody
touched off violent protests
last April. After news of

05:19.186 --> 05:23.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the mistrial today, protesters
gathered in downtown Baltimore.

05:23.223 --> 05:26.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And Mayor Stephanie
Rawlings-Blake appealed for
calm.

05:26.826 --> 05:29.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MD-BO STEPHANIE RAWLINGS-BLAKE
(D), Mayor of Baltimore,
Maryland: Twelve Baltimore city

05:29.563 --> 05:36.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
residents answered the solemn
call to serve. They listened to
the evidence presented and

05:36.570 --> 05:43.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they rendered a decision. If
some choose to protest, they
must peacefully demonstrate.

05:43.777 --> 05:49.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is their right. But I also
want to be very, very clear
about any potential disturbances

05:49.015 --> 05:54.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in our city. We are
prepared to respond.

05:54.521 --> 05:59.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: William Porter was
the first of six officers to go
on trial in the case. In

05:59.626 --> 06:02.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a statement, Freddie Gray's
stepfather expressed confidence
in the proceedings, and he also

06:02.562 --> 06:04.864 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
urged calm.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD SHIPLEY, Freddie Gray's
Stepfather: We want to thank
this hardworking jury for

06:07.834 --> 06:12.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their service to the public,
their quest for justice, and
their personal sacrifice for

06:12.739 --> 06:16.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their time and effort. We are
not at all upset with them.
Neither should the public be
upset.

06:16.843 --> 06:19.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They did the best they could.

06:19.512 --> 06:23.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: "NewsHour"'s William
Brangham has been in Baltimore
throughout the day today.

06:23.416 --> 06:26.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke with him a short time
ago. He's outside the
courthouse.

06:26.686 --> 06:29.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
William, thank you
for joining us.

06:29.623 --> 06:32.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know you have spent the day in
Baltimore. What has been the
immediate reaction to the

06:32.425 --> 06:34.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
news of the hung jury?

06:34.828 --> 06:38.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Well, when the
word came out outside the
courthouse today, it was like

06:38.999 --> 06:42.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a ripple went through the crowd.
And there were only about a few
dozen protesters that

06:42.068 --> 06:45.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
were out here. They had
been waiting here all day.

06:45.171 --> 06:51.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they were visibly upset.
People started chanting "Black
lives matter, put the racist

06:51.044 --> 06:56.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cops in jail, no justice, no
peace." I mean, there was a lot
of visceral, visceral anger

06:56.249 --> 06:59.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and disappointment that there
was no verdict reached today.

06:59.853 --> 07:04.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, William, is
there any reason that has been
given -- reasons for this
mistrial?

07:04.357 --> 07:09.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: No, it's not
clear why the jury couldn't come
to a final decision.

07:09.195 --> 07:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's important to remember,
in this particular case, unlike
a lot of other police killing

07:14.000 --> 07:18.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cases that we have seen in
recent months, there is not
obvious evidence. There is no

07:18.204 --> 07:22.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dash-cam video to show exactly
what happened to Freddie Gray
when he went into the back

07:22.008 --> 07:25.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of that van and came out after
multiple stops around the city
of Baltimore in this near

07:25.145 --> 07:27.914 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fatal state.

07:27.914 --> 07:31.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, those other cases were
clearer-cut. You could see a
police officer shooting a young

07:31.818 --> 07:35.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
man. In this case, the evidence
is just not as crystal-clear.
But, that said, we still

07:35.755 --> 07:38.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't know exactly why the jury
couldn't come to a final
decision.

07:38.925 --> 07:44.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Now, as we
mentioned, this was the first of
six trials for six officers
involved

07:44.030 --> 07:48.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in that -- the events of that
day. Is there a sense that this
mistrial will endanger the

07:48.735 --> 07:51.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
other prosecutions?

07:51.171 --> 07:54.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Well, there is
the possibility that that's the
case.

07:54.708 --> 07:59.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, obviously, officer
Porter, the gentleman who was on
trial tonight, he was being
relied

07:59.012 --> 08:04.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on to testify in some subsequent
cases of the other officers
involved. We heard from

08:04.918 --> 08:09.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the lawyer for the Gray family
tonight, and they seem to think
that they would -- they

08:09.956 --> 08:13.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were still very confident that
the prosecution will be able to
go forward, that the other

08:13.126 --> 08:16.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
police officers will be able
to be brought to justice.

08:16.629 --> 08:19.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they refer to this simply as
a bump in the road, not anything
calamitous for the

08:19.699 --> 08:21.835 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
case itself.

08:21.835 --> 08:25.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And did the lawyer
for the Gray family join with
the mayor and the police

08:25.805 --> 08:30.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chief in calling for calm,
because this obviously was a
trigger last time?

08:30.343 --> 08:32.645 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Absolutely.

08:32.645 --> 08:36.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We heard that from them. We
heard that from a lot of people
here today, because everybody

08:36.383 --> 08:41.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
remembers what happened back in
April right after Freddie Gray's
funeral, when the city

08:41.087 --> 08:46.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
literally came apart at the
seams. Buildings were on fire.
People were venting very
visceral,

08:46.126 --> 08:50.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
obvious anger at what they saw
had happened to that young man.

08:50.096 --> 08:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think people are very
worried that that might happen
here if these subsequent

08:53.566 --> 08:57.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cases don't come to a verdict
that the community thinks is
legitimate.

08:57.003 --> 09:00.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: And a final
question, William. Can officer
Porter be tried again for the

09:00.640 --> 09:03.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
same alleged crime?

09:03.176 --> 09:07.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Yes, my
understanding is that this -- if
he were to be tried again

09:07.046 --> 09:11.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- and we're going to hear from
attorney Marilyn Mosby tomorrow,
we believe -- she will decide

09:11.951 --> 09:14.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whether she wants to appeal this
and try to re-prosecute him.

09:14.854 --> 09:18.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there's no sense of double
jeopardy. If they appeal and
they can bring a second case

09:18.258 --> 09:20.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against him, I believe that will
be able to go forward. But we
will know more about that

09:20.226 --> 09:21.828 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tomorrow.

09:21.828 --> 09:33.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All right, William
Brangham for us tonight in
Baltimore, thank you.

09:33.907 --> 09:39.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, up it finally went. The
long-awaited and long-predicted
interest rate hike was

09:39.913 --> 09:43.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
announced today by
the Federal Reserve.

09:43.049 --> 09:46.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This afternoon in Washington,
Fed Chair Janet Yellen explained
economic conditions were

09:46.619 --> 09:49.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ripe for the increase.

09:49.589 --> 09:54.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANET YELLEN, Federal Reserve
Chair: The underlying health of
the U.S. economy, I consider to

09:54.227 --> 10:01.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be quite sound. I think it's a
myth that expansions die of old
age. I do not think that they
die

10:01.901 --> 10:08.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of old age. So, the fact that
this has been quite a long
expansion doesn't lead me to

10:08.575 --> 10:13.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
believe that its one that has
-- its days are numbered.

10:13.947 --> 10:19.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For a closer look at
today's rate hike, both in terms
of how the Fed makes its

10:19.018 --> 10:23.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decisions and what this move
might mean for your average
household budget, we turn to

10:23.423 --> 10:28.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Wessel, director of the
Hutchins Center on Fiscal and
Monetary Policy at The Brookings

10:28.261 --> 10:32.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Institution, a nonpartisan
research center, and
contributing correspondent to
The Wall

10:32.699 --> 10:36.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Street Journal, and Tara Siegel
Bernard, personal finance
reporter at The New York Times.

10:36.870 --> 10:39.372 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
David, welcome.

10:39.372 --> 10:43.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, tell me. We have been
talking about this for a long
time. And as you just heard her

10:43.810 --> 10:47.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talk about the long expansion,
what took so long for them to
finally make such an incremental

10:47.213 --> 10:48.481 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
move?

10:48.481 --> 10:48.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL, The Wall Street
Journal: You sound impatient,
Gwen.

10:48.781 --> 10:50.550 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

10:50.550 --> 10:54.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, I think that
the Fed has figured that
interest rates needed to be low

10:54.821 --> 11:00.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a very long time because the
economy was very slow to recover
from a devastating recession,

11:00.593 --> 11:03.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and because part of their
strategy is to get inflation to
a 2 percent target. And they're

11:03.830 --> 11:06.165 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
still not there.

11:06.165 --> 11:10.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there was no reason to rush.
And now they have decided the
economy is healthy enough

11:10.637 --> 11:13.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for them to just to begin to
lift their foot gradually off
the accelerator.

11:13.773 --> 11:18.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You mentioned
inflation. She put in a little
caveat there that if things were

11:18.077 --> 11:20.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to begin to look southward, she
would consider going back down
again?

11:20.813 --> 11:22.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID WESSEL: Right.

11:22.315 --> 11:26.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, what she said was what --
people want to know, what's the
Fed going to do next?

11:26.920 --> 11:29.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what really matters. A
quarter percentage point doesn't
matter much, but this is the

11:29.022 --> 11:32.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
beginning of a longer process.

11:32.592 --> 11:37.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And what she said is, my
colleagues on the Fed expect
interest rates to go up perhaps

11:37.163 --> 11:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a full percentage point over the
next year, but we're only going
to do that if we're convinced

11:40.833 --> 11:43.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that inflation is
moving to our target.

11:43.670 --> 11:46.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she was very careful to
leave herself a lot of
flexibility on that.

11:46.906 --> 11:50.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tara Siegel Bernard,
when we hear her talk about --
when we talk about 1 percentage

11:50.910 --> 11:55.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
increase in interest rates over
the long -- over the next year,
what does that actually mean

11:55.848 --> 11:58.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for people's pocketbooks? What
does that mean for their ability
to buy a house or buy a

11:58.785 --> 12:01.087 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
car?

12:01.087 --> 12:03.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MD-BO TARA SIEGEL BERNARD, The
New York Times: Well, the big
takeaway is that it doesn't

12:03.790 --> 12:06.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have that much of an
immediate impact.

12:06.626 --> 12:12.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have only seen the rates rise
a quarter of a percentage point
today, and the Fed has

12:12.932 --> 12:18.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
telegraphed that this is going
to be a very slow and gradual
increase. So, even if we

12:18.471 --> 12:25.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do get to 1 percent, yes, the
cost of borrowing will rise
marginally. You may be able to
get

12:25.912 --> 12:31.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a higher rate on a savings
account, but for now it's really
-- it's pretty much the status

12:31.651 --> 12:33.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
quo for the most part.

12:33.920 --> 12:39.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, if you're a
retiree who's had a lot of your
money in C.D.s and conservative

12:39.258 --> 12:43.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investments, does this have any
immediate effect or does it make
you make a little bit

12:43.796 --> 12:45.632 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more money now?

12:45.632 --> 12:47.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TARA SIEGEL BERNARD: A teeny
tiny amount of more money.

12:47.967 --> 12:49.936 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

12:49.936 --> 12:55.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TARA SIEGEL BERNARD: It's really
going to be a small amount for
people that are holding

12:55.141 --> 13:00.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
C.D.s, people that have deposit
accounts at their local banks.
Don't wait for them to

13:00.847 --> 13:04.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immediately hike your rate. It's
probably not going to happen.
Banks are sitting on

13:04.150 --> 13:07.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a lot of deposits.

13:07.487 --> 13:12.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what usually kind of prompts
them to raise their rate is to
attract more. So, right now,

13:12.358 --> 13:18.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they really don't need to. So,
you shouldn't expect an
immediate hike on your deposit
or

13:18.931 --> 13:24.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your C.D.s. That said, there are
institutions that have raised
their rates. You can find

13:24.604 --> 13:29.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a whopping 1 percent at
some online institutions.

13:29.442 --> 13:34.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the big takeaway is to shop
around. There are some better
opportunities, but it's still

13:34.447 --> 13:37.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pretty meager at the
end of the day.

13:37.450 --> 13:41.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, David, if this
is pretty meager at the end of
the day, are we talking about

13:41.154 --> 13:44.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the impact of this increase or
the trend line that it is
setting?

13:44.257 --> 13:46.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: We're talking
about the trend line.

13:46.059 --> 13:51.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What Janet Yellen said today is
that they expect this to be
gradual. Because this is

13:51.130 --> 13:56.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
such a big change in monetary
policy, because we have had
seven years of zero interest
rates,

13:56.102 --> 13:59.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
almost unprecedented in American
history, she wants to be very
careful that she doesn't

13:59.172 --> 14:02.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
throw the economy off balance.

14:02.241 --> 14:07.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So this was designed not to
upset anybody. And they
succeeded in that. But if the
economy

14:07.780 --> 14:11.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
continues to get better, they
will ratchet rates up, and those
people you referred to

14:11.350 --> 14:14.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on C.D.s will be getting more
interest on their savings a year
from now, and people

14:14.721 --> 14:17.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will be paying more for
mortgages a year from now.

14:17.457 --> 14:21.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's broaden this
out to the global economic
impact. David, are people

14:21.160 --> 14:24.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
watching from around the world
what she does in this case as a
cue to what they do?

14:24.997 --> 14:28.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: Absolutely.

14:28.134 --> 14:31.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even more than ever, what the
Fed does really matters around
the world. There has been a

14:31.170 --> 14:35.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lot of anxiety, for instance, in
emerging markets. When rates
were low here, a lot of

14:35.074 --> 14:39.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
money went to emerging markets.
It has started to come back. So,
emerging markets have to

14:39.178 --> 14:43.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
manage their currencies very
carefully when the Fed is
moving.

14:43.282 --> 14:48.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China is changing the way it
manages its currency in
anticipation of the dollars
rising as the

14:48.020 --> 14:52.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fed tightens. So, it has huge
impacts. And she referred that
today. She said the U.S.

14:52.358 --> 14:56.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
economy is in pretty good shape,
getting better, but she's
worried about the rest of the
world.

14:56.662 --> 15:00.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her judgment is that the U.S.
economy is strong enough to
offset the weakness abroad, but

15:00.032 --> 15:02.135 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that could change.

15:02.135 --> 15:05.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tara Siegel Bernard,
a lot of people have a
pocketful, especially at holiday

15:05.838 --> 15:11.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time, pocketful of credit cards,
which they are using liberally.
Does today's actions

15:11.477 --> 15:17.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
affect how they treat their
credit standing, their credit
investment, their spending?

15:17.950 --> 15:26.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TARA SIEGEL BERNARD: Well, the
rate hike will jack up your
credit card interest rate a bit.

15:26.092 --> 15:32.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And pretty much in line with the
Fed's action today, people can
expect that to be reflected

15:32.231 --> 15:38.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in their credit card statements
within one to two billing
cycles. There are still -- if

15:38.271 --> 15:42.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people are carrying debt on
their credit cards and slowly
paying it off, now's the time to

15:42.975 --> 15:47.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
find those last remaining zero
percent balance transfer offers,
and take advantage of those

15:47.346 --> 15:50.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
now while they're
still available.

15:50.950 --> 15:57.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But rates will rise on credit
cards, variable rate cards, by
-- in line with the Fed.

15:57.023 --> 16:00.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, David, Wall
Street seemed to take this all
in stride today. They seemed

16:00.927 --> 16:04.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to see it coming. This gradual
buildup clearly had its effect,
its intended effect.

16:04.530 --> 16:07.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID WESSEL: Right.
It was by design.

16:07.066 --> 16:10.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think when you score Janet
Yellen, how did she do, you
would say, A, they wanted

16:10.636 --> 16:12.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to prepare the markets for this
so there wouldn't be any uproar.

16:12.238 --> 16:14.307 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

16:14.307 --> 16:17.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: In 1994, when the
Fed raised interest rates after
a long period of calm,

16:17.610 --> 16:21.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there was a big uproar in the
market. She succeeded in that.

16:21.414 --> 16:26.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think her other goal was to
keep this committee that she
chairs, it's now 10 voters at
the

16:26.619 --> 16:31.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
moment, unanimous, because when
you have got a big change, you
don't want a lot of dissent.

16:31.157 --> 16:35.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know there are people who are
impatient who want rates to go
up faster. We know there

16:35.094 --> 16:37.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are others, even some governors
of the board, Dan Tarullo and
Lael Brainard, who expressed

16:37.496 --> 16:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
some reservations about this.

16:40.333 --> 16:45.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So she must have worked very
hard to get them all to agree
that not everybody likes this,

16:45.371 --> 16:47.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but we're going to do this, and
let's do it all together because
it strengthens her hand

16:47.673 --> 16:49.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and her credibility.

16:49.108 --> 16:51.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, she's been there
in this chair for about two
years now.

16:51.077 --> 16:51.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID WESSEL: Two years.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.045 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

16:53.045 --> 16:56.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: How's she measuring
up? Because, as we know, the
Republicans complain that

16:56.716 --> 16:58.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she is -- that they don't like
the Fed. And the Democrats have
been -- had mixed response

16:58.784 --> 17:01.120 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to today's move.

17:01.120 --> 17:04.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: Well, the -- yes,
Bernie Sanders and Gene
Sperling, who is an adviser to
Hillary

17:04.257 --> 17:06.859 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Clinton, they
criticized the move.

17:06.859 --> 17:11.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I noticed that Sheila Bair, who
used to be head of the FDIC,
praised it. I didn't see

17:11.230 --> 17:14.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
any Republicans. But the
Republicans in general have
thought the Fed was keeping
interest

17:14.567 --> 17:19.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rates too low. I think that
this is her first big test.

17:19.138 --> 17:24.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Until now, she's basically been
following the game plan that Ben
Bernanke left her.

17:24.143 --> 17:28.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was an important call, when
to start raising rates and how
to do it. And there

17:28.714 --> 17:32.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will be a series of calls like
this over the next year. She
will have to decide, did this

17:32.652 --> 17:36.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
work out as I expected? Should I
continue to ratchet things up?

17:36.522 --> 17:40.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She has a real communications
problem, because she wants to
tell people rates are going up,

17:40.660 --> 17:43.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but she also wants to assure
them, if the economy
deteriorates, she won't do it,
and

17:43.896 --> 17:45.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
everybody will complain
that she's confusing them.

17:45.798 --> 17:49.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Must be fun to
be the chairman of the Fed.

17:49.335 --> 17:51.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Wessel of the Brookings
Institution and The Wall Street
Journal, and Tara Siegel

17:51.737 --> 17:54.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bernard of The New York Times,
thank you both very much.

17:54.473 --> 18:00.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: You're welcome.

18:00.012 --> 18:06.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TARA SIEGEL BERNARD: Thank you.

18:06.886 --> 18:11.590 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

18:11.590 --> 18:16.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
sticking points in the
trillion-dollar budget bill; the
creator

18:16.529 --> 18:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Humans of New York profiles
Syrians seeking refuge in the
Empire State; and classical

18:21.500 --> 18:25.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
meets hip-hop in the
musical duo Black Violin.

18:25.504 --> 18:30.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, nine candidates made
it to the main stage for the
final Republican debate

18:30.810 --> 18:35.881 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of the year. Four others
appeared in an earlier undercard
face off. The candidates left
Las

18:35.881 --> 18:40.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Vegas much as they arrived,
jockeying to survive into the
new year.

18:40.586 --> 18:46.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The cast of characters has
shifted, but there has been one
constant this Republican debate

18:46.859 --> 18:51.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
season: front-runner
Donald Trump center stage.

18:51.731 --> 18:55.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last night, the candidates
competed to prove who would be
best prepared as commander in

18:55.134 --> 18:58.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
chief to keep the country safe.

18:58.537 --> 19:02.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For Trump, it meant defending
his plan to ban Muslims, at
least temporarily, from entering

19:02.775 --> 19:04.744 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the U.S.

19:04.744 --> 19:07.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: We are not talking
about isolation. We're

19:07.546 --> 19:12.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talking about security. We're
not talking about religion.
We're talking about security.

19:12.284 --> 19:15.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For former Florida
Governor Jeb Bush, it meant
seizing the opportunity to

19:15.621 --> 19:19.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
try to take Trump down a peg.

19:19.191 --> 19:22.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEB BUSH (R), Presidential
Candidate: Look, this is not a
serious proposal. In fact, it

19:22.561 --> 19:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will push the Muslim world, the
Arab world away from us, at a
time when we need to reengage

19:27.433 --> 19:32.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with them to be able to create a
strategy to destroy ISIS. He's a
chaos candidate. And

19:32.905 --> 19:36.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he'd be a chaos president. He
wouldn't be the commander in
chief we need to keep our

19:36.275 --> 19:38.644 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
country safe.

19:38.644 --> 19:42.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And for the rest,
the night was spent making the
case that they are, in fact,

19:42.314 --> 19:45.251 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
qualified.

19:45.251 --> 19:50.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson,
who has stumbled over foreign
policy questions of late, said

19:50.356 --> 19:55.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he would take the fight to ISIS,
up to and including deploying
U.S. ground troops in

19:55.194 --> 19:56.729 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Syria.

19:56.729 --> 19:59.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN CARSON (R), Presidential
Candidate: You know, we have got
a phobia about boots on

19:59.698 --> 20:03.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the ground. If our military
experts say we need boots on the
ground, we should put boots

20:03.869 --> 20:08.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the ground and recognize
there will be boots on the
ground, and they will be over

20:08.107 --> 20:10.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here, and they will be their
boots if we don't get them out
of there now.

20:10.709 --> 20:15.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For two senators
recently on the rise, Marco
Rubio and Ted Cruz, the clashes

20:15.114 --> 20:18.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
came over the tradeoff between
safety and surveillance.

20:18.918 --> 20:21.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate: We are
now at a time when we need more
tools,

20:21.420 --> 20:24.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not less tools. And that tool we
lost, the metadata program, was
a valuable tool that

20:24.723 --> 20:26.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we no longer have
at our disposal.

20:26.959 --> 20:30.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate: The old
program covered 20 percent to 30
percent

20:30.496 --> 20:35.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of phone numbers to search for
terrorists. The new program
covers nearly 100 percent.

20:35.267 --> 20:38.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That gives us greater ability to
stop acts of terrorism, and he
knows that that's the

20:38.904 --> 20:40.706 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
case.

20:40.706 --> 20:45.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: They also scrapped
over immigration and border
security, with Rubio turning his

20:45.411 --> 20:51.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
guns on Cruz to downplay his own
support for a 2013 Senate bill
that included a path to

20:51.050 --> 20:54.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
citizenship for some
undocumented immigrants.

20:54.620 --> 20:57.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: Does Ted Cruz
rule out ever legalizing people
that are in this country

20:57.490 --> 20:58.290 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
illegally now?

20:58.290 --> 20:59.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUESTION: Senator Cruz?

20:59.225 --> 21:00.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: I have never
supported legalization.

21:00.926 --> 21:03.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO:
Will you rule it out?

21:03.028 --> 21:06.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: I have never
supported legalization, and I do
not intend to support
legalization.

21:06.732 --> 21:11.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For the non-senators
on stage, especially former
business executive Carly

21:11.637 --> 21:15.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fiorina and New Jersey Governor
Chris Christie, the Cruz-Rubio
disagreement left room for

21:15.641 --> 21:17.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an outsider's attack.

21:17.943 --> 21:20.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARLY FIORINA (R), Presidential
Candidate: We need a commander
in chief who has made

21:20.579 --> 21:25.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tough calls in tough times, and
stood up to be held accountable
over and over, not first-term

21:25.317 --> 21:28.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
senators who've never made an
executive decision in their
life.

21:28.654 --> 21:30.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R-NJ),
Presidential Candidate: This is
the difference between being a
governor

21:30.356 --> 21:35.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and being in a legislature. See,
because when something doesn't
work in New Jersey, they

21:35.027 --> 21:38.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
look at me, say, why didn't it
get done? Why didn't you do it?
You have to be responsible

21:38.364 --> 21:40.399 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and accountable.

21:40.399 --> 21:44.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The questions and
answers stuck close to matters
of terrorism and domestic

21:44.637 --> 21:50.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
security. And the debate drew
another big audience, a hefty 18
million viewers. The

21:50.576 --> 21:54.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GOP candidates meet
next in mid-January.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's take a closer look now at
some of the claims made last
night, and try to separate

21:57.983 --> 22:01.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fact from fiction.

22:01.053 --> 22:06.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Angie Drobnic Holan is the
editor of PolitiFact, an
independent fact-checking Web
site and

22:06.325 --> 22:11.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a division of The Tampa Bay
Times. Her team recently took
stock of the statements they

22:11.030 --> 22:15.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have checked out so far this
election season. The takeaway?
No candidate has been completely

22:15.401 --> 22:19.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
honest, Democrat or Republican.
Some fared worse than others.

22:19.939 --> 22:24.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For instance, out of more than
70 Donald Trump statements,
three-quarters of them proved

22:24.476 --> 22:28.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
false. Jeb Bush tried to call
attention to that last night.

22:28.714 --> 22:34.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEB BUSH: Look, two months ago,
Donald Trump said that ISIS
wasn't our fight, just two

22:34.587 --> 22:41.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
months ago. He said that Hillary
Clinton would be a great
negotiate with Iran. And he gets

22:41.093 --> 22:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his foreign policy experience
from the shows. That's not a
serious kind of candidate.

22:47.533 --> 22:50.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Other -- from the
amusement watching Donald
Trump's faces while that
accusation

22:50.736 --> 22:54.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was being made. Is it true that
Donald Trump said those things?

22:54.506 --> 22:57.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGIE DROBNIC HOLAN, Editor,
PolitiFact: You know, we rated
that mostly true.

22:57.042 --> 23:02.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He did make the comments about
ISIS not being our fight. Now,
his most on-point comments

23:02.648 --> 23:07.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were more than like five months
ago, rather than just two. Now,
looking at Donald Trump's

23:07.586 --> 23:12.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
statements about foreign policy,
he seems to go back and forth
between saying the U.S.

23:12.324 --> 23:16.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should hit ISIS very hard and
saying the U.S. needs not to get
too entangled in foreign

23:16.028 --> 23:17.596 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
affairs.

23:17.596 --> 23:22.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, there is some
dissonance there.

23:22.635 --> 23:26.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: When you talk about
dissonance, I just want to
follow up a little bit more

23:26.038 --> 23:29.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on what you found overall
looking at Donald Trump's
statements. That's a big number
of

23:29.441 --> 23:32.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
false statements.

23:32.011 --> 23:35.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGIE DROBNIC HOLAN: Yes. We
haven't fact-checked anyone as
many times as we have
fact-checked

23:35.814 --> 23:40.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump with so much
inaccuracy. He just gets a lot
of factual matters incorrect.

23:40.753 --> 23:43.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: And it
doesn't seem to hurt.

23:43.756 --> 23:46.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGIE DROBNIC HOLAN: Well,
voters have not gone to the
polls yet, is what I say. So,

23:46.191 --> 23:48.427 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we will see.

23:48.427 --> 23:52.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's move on to Ted
Cruz. He was asked whether he --
how he disagreed with

23:52.031 --> 23:57.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump, and his response was to
change the subject. Let's
listen.

23:57.436 --> 24:02.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: We're looking at
a president who's engaged in
this double-speak where he

24:02.574 --> 24:09.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't call radical Islamic
terrorism by its name. Indeed,
he gives a speech after

24:09.448 --> 24:13.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the San Bernardino attack where
his approach is to try to go
after the constitutional rights

24:13.452 --> 24:17.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of law-abiding citizens
rather than to keep us safe.

24:17.656 --> 24:23.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even worse, President Obama
and Hillary Clinton are
proposing bringing tens of
thousands

24:23.696 --> 24:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Syrian refugees to this
country when the head of the FBI
has told Congress they cannot

24:28.300 --> 24:30.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
vet those refugees.

24:30.569 --> 24:35.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now, it is true that
the president doesn't use the
word -- the phrase radical

24:35.474 --> 24:38.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Islamic terrorism. He kind of
goes out of his way not to use
that phrase for lots of

24:38.977 --> 24:41.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reason. But is it true that he
has dropped the ball, that the
administration has dropped

24:41.680 --> 24:44.383 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the ball on vetting refugees?

24:44.383 --> 24:47.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGIE DROBNIC HOLAN: We looked
at Cruz's statement that Comey
said they can't vet Syrian
refugees.

24:47.553 --> 24:48.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The FBI director.

24:48.220 --> 24:50.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ANGIE DROBNIC HOLAN:
That's correct.

24:50.522 --> 24:56.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We rated Cruz's statement mostly
false. There is a vetting
process for the Syrian refugees.

24:56.895 --> 25:01.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's actually somewhat
extensive. It's more than, say,
a tourist visa would go through.

25:01.700 --> 25:07.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The United Nations certifies
refugees overseas. And then the
U.S. government puts the
refugees

25:07.005 --> 25:10.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through a number of checks, such
as from the Defense Department,
Homeland Security Department,

25:10.743 --> 25:13.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
State Department.

25:13.579 --> 25:19.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, we rated it mostly false
because Comey did say he could
not personally certify that

25:19.785 --> 25:25.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
every refugee didn't represent a
security check. That's the
standard the Republicans

25:25.023 --> 25:30.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Congress wanted him to meet.
He said that that wasn't
feasible, but they do have a
standard

25:30.662 --> 25:33.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
vetting process that the
refugees go through.

25:33.699 --> 25:36.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That's interesting,
because the Congress said they
were going to do something

25:36.402 --> 25:40.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about that, but that wasn't
included in the budget bill that
passed in Congress.

25:40.139 --> 25:47.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's move on to the other big,
I guess, fact-checkable moment
of the night, where Senator Rand
Paul

25:47.780 --> 25:53.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
accused Senator Rubio -- there
were three senators on the stage
last night -- that -- he

25:53.585 --> 25:58.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said of opposing increased
border security. Let's listen.

25:58.924 --> 26:01.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY),
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: So Marco
can't have it both ways. He
thinks

26:01.727 --> 26:05.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he wants to be this, "Oh, I'm
great and strong on national
defense."

26:05.464 --> 26:09.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he's the weakest of all the
candidates on immigration. He is
the one for an open

26:09.668 --> 26:13.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
border that is leaving us
defenseless. If we want to
defend the country, we have to

26:13.839 --> 26:18.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
defend against who's coming in,
and Marco is -- has more of an
allegiance to Chuck Schumer

26:18.410 --> 26:21.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and to the liberals than he
does to conservative policy.

26:21.580 --> 26:24.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I guess we can
interpret that look on Marco
Rubio's face that he doesn't

26:24.049 --> 26:26.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
believe it's true.
What did you think?

26:26.518 --> 26:29.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGIE DROBNIC HOLAN: Well,
PolitiFact didn't think it was
true either. We rated Rand
Paul's

26:29.922 --> 26:34.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
statement that Marco Rubio
supports open borders as Pants
on Fire. That's our worst
rating,

26:34.059 --> 26:37.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not only false, but ridiculous.

26:37.463 --> 26:42.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the reason we rated is this
way that Marco Rubio has
supported this comprehensive
immigration

26:42.267 --> 26:47.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
legislation. It passed in the
Senate. It failed in the House.
It never became law. It included

26:47.873 --> 26:53.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
money and border agents
to increase security.

26:53.212 --> 26:58.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Open borders implies that the --
there would be a border where
people could come back and

26:58.016 --> 27:02.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forth freely with very minimal
checks. That's not at all what
Marco Rubio has supported.

27:02.020 --> 27:06.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, Rand Paul may have a
point that Rubio supported this
immigration legislation

27:06.158 --> 27:09.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
when other candidates didn't.

27:09.495 --> 27:12.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But to say he supports open
borders just crosses the line
and is really at odds with what
the

27:12.030 --> 27:14.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
legislation contained.

27:14.600 --> 27:19.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We have talked
before about how -- the tenuous
relationship between the truth

27:19.571 --> 27:24.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and fact in this year's election
so far on both sides of the
aisle.

27:24.243 --> 27:28.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the viewers would be
interested in knowing, how do
you do this, how you vet them,

27:28.413 --> 27:33.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
especially with nine candidates
on the main stage last night,
four candidates on the
undercard,

27:33.151 --> 27:37.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and then another three
candidates on the Democratic
side.

27:37.022 --> 27:39.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGIE DROBNIC HOLAN: You know,
we're looking for claims that we
think voters would care

27:39.458 --> 27:43.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about and that would make them
say, I wonder if that's true.

27:43.729 --> 27:48.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we're definitely using our
news judgment. We don't do a
random sample or pick statements

27:48.734 --> 27:52.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out of the hat. We are looking
for what's most important and
significant to voters.

27:52.671 --> 27:56.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, after we watch a debate like
last night, we just think, what
would people be talking

27:56.241 --> 27:59.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about? What would they
be wondering about?

27:59.077 --> 28:02.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we fact-check statements
about immigration, about ISIS,
about national security. Those

28:02.681 --> 28:04.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
were the topics from this week.

28:04.917 --> 28:08.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And what kind of
feedback do you get from
viewers, readers, or candidates?

28:08.020 --> 28:12.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGIE DROBNIC HOLAN: We get a
lot of reader feedback that is
thanking us for checking

28:12.558 --> 28:15.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the facts. And then we get
reader feedback that says, oh,
you're biased against the
candidate

28:15.527 --> 28:16.328 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that I like.

28:16.328 --> 28:18.430 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, we get both.

28:18.430 --> 28:20.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Both of them. Well,
if you're getting them both,
then you're probably somewhere

28:20.098 --> 28:22.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
right in the middle.

28:22.167 --> 28:23.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Angie Drobnic Holan, editor
of PolitiFact, thanks again.

28:23.468 --> 28:26.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ANGIE DROBNIC HOLAN:
Thanks for having me.

28:26.805 --> 28:31.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: As the candidates
tangled last night, members of
Congress were shaking hands

28:31.443 --> 28:35.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Washington, as leaders agreed
to a sweeping deal to fund the
government and extend dozens

28:35.480 --> 28:38.083 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of tax breaks.

28:38.083 --> 28:41.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Attached to all of that are a
slew of other issues, from
immigration to oil.

28:41.820 --> 28:45.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Speaker Paul Ryan said both
parties made concessions.

28:45.057 --> 28:48.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House: Republicans didn't
get all that we wanted.

28:48.327 --> 28:52.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats didn't get all that we
-- we wanted. This is a
bipartisan compromise. It's a
bicameral

28:52.064 --> 28:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
compromise. And I understand
that some people don't like some
of the aspects of this, but

28:55.100 --> 28:58.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that is the compromise
that we have.

28:58.036 --> 29:01.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Political director
Lisa Desjardins has been digging
into the deal, and she joins

29:01.773 --> 29:05.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
us now live from Capitol Hill.

29:05.010 --> 29:09.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lisa, it's so interesting to
hear Paul Ryan talk about a
bipartisan agreement. Before

29:09.047 --> 29:12.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we get into the details of that
agreement, how unusual is it for
both parties to agree

29:12.184 --> 29:14.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on something this big anymore?

29:14.586 --> 29:17.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, they used
to do this only by force. We
used to run right up to

29:17.789 --> 29:21.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and sometimes across a
government shutdown to do this.

29:21.393 --> 29:25.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think what's really unusual
here, Gwen, is, for the past
years, we have seen all of

29:25.397 --> 29:30.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these collisions result in no
one getting anything, everyone
sticking to their hard

29:30.035 --> 29:33.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lines. But here, what we see is
both sides getting something, in
fact, a lot of something,

29:33.639 --> 29:35.974 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ahead of the holiday break.

29:35.974 --> 29:39.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, let's start by
talking about the cyber-security
provisions in this, which

29:39.978 --> 29:42.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
actually got tougher,
it seemed to me.

29:42.614 --> 29:45.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

29:45.283 --> 29:50.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This cyber-security bill has
been a controversial idea for
the past year. And I'm going to
talk

29:50.122 --> 29:55.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about why it is a controversial
provision. Supporters say that
this bill would allow

29:55.560 --> 30:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
businesses to send data about
specific hacks to the federal
government, and then, from

30:01.566 --> 30:04.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there, the government could
alert other businesses. So, if
Target was hacked, they would
tell

30:04.369 --> 30:08.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the NSA, the NSA would
alert other businesses.

30:08.106 --> 30:12.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say those companies would
share that data voluntarily.
What about critics? Well,

30:12.377 --> 30:16.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
critics say, that's fine, but
the truth is that the government
could hold on to that

30:16.181 --> 30:20.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
data, and as much as the data is
not supposed to be our personal
information, it's very

30:20.952 --> 30:26.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
possible that it could be. And
once the government got that
data, Gwen, the critics say this

30:26.191 --> 30:32.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
law would allow them to use it
for some prosecutorial aspects,
not just on cyber-security, but
everything

30:32.297 --> 30:37.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
from espionage to child
exploitation, things, of course,
that the government does want to

30:37.502 --> 30:40.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prosecute, but things that those
who are worried about civil
liberties say opens a vast door

30:40.772 --> 30:43.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to government surveillance.

30:43.642 --> 30:48.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One thing about this, Gwen, it
splits the business community
itself. Retailers and financial

30:48.914 --> 30:53.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
companies, they really like
this. They say it's needed. But
those who are involved in

30:53.552 --> 30:56.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
technology, especially Silicon
Valley, Facebook, Apple, they
don't like it at all. They think

30:56.822 --> 30:59.091 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it's a bad idea.

30:59.091 --> 31:02.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's move to the
energy trade-off, the deal that
they cut. The Democrats were

31:02.894 --> 31:05.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
happy for some of it,
Republicans for others, for
other parts.

31:05.931 --> 31:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.
This is what I mean by some --
each side got a little bit

31:08.133 --> 31:10.268 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of something.

31:10.268 --> 31:14.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, here's what the energy
trade-off was in this bill.
First of all, for Republicans,

31:14.606 --> 31:20.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they got a reversal of a 40-year
ban on exporting oil. That is a
very big deal for them, and

31:20.278 --> 31:25.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
especially a very big deal for
oil, for drilling here in this
country.

31:25.417 --> 31:29.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats, on the other hand,
got something that they want.
They got extended solar and

31:29.921 --> 31:33.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wind tax credits. Those will be
extended over the next five
years. That's something the

31:33.625 --> 31:36.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republicans had talked
about completely ending.

31:36.528 --> 31:41.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, here, you see some this sort
of -- some of the environment
and the energy sector gaining,

31:41.867 --> 31:44.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
both sides here. Everyone liked
something and didn't like
something as far as the energy

31:44.636 --> 31:46.972 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
portion of this bill goes.

31:46.972 --> 31:49.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: There was another
part of the bill which I found
interesting, because it

31:49.307 --> 31:52.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
showed lobbying working, but it
was unconventional lobbying.

31:52.344 --> 31:59.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The comedian Jon Stewart went to
Capitol Hill and he pushed for a
9/11 first-responders

31:59.885 --> 32:04.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
protection bill, which he
actually confronted members of
the Senate and House face to
face,

32:04.589 --> 32:05.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and this survived.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

32:08.260 --> 32:13.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He really became a leading force
in that bill. It was an
emotional bill talking about the

32:13.632 --> 32:21.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
60,000 or so first-responders
whose insurance doesn't cover
all of their care. Now, this

32:21.640 --> 32:26.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bill that would have covered the
rest of it expired, Gwen, in
September. Jon Stewart has

32:26.778 --> 32:31.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been a very strong advocate. And
we have also seen, of course, a
large amount of lobbying

32:31.583 --> 32:34.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from the New York
delegation here as well.

32:34.386 --> 32:38.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So this bill in full went into
the omnibus. That's what I mean.
This bill just contains

32:38.490 --> 32:41.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so much that will affect a great
number of lives, including that
of first-responders

32:41.626 --> 32:43.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in New York City.

32:43.528 --> 32:46.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And we probably just
scratched the surface of it, but
you did it very well.

32:46.731 --> 32:50.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thank you very much, Lisa
Desjardins, for us on Capitol
Hill tonight.

32:50.802 --> 32:58.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: You're welcome.

32:58.543 --> 33:03.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: As you have been
hearing, there has been plenty
of political debate about

33:03.882 --> 33:08.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
immigration policy, about
refugees and security fears.

33:08.320 --> 33:12.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now we're going to hear the case
for helping refugees. Their
plight is the center of a

33:12.591 --> 33:17.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
big push on social media and the
Web this week. It comes from a
popular blog and Web

33:17.762 --> 33:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
site whose creator and founder
says he's been more affected by
these stories than thousands

33:22.300 --> 33:24.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of others he's told.

33:24.703 --> 33:27.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hari Sreenivasan has our
story from New York.

33:27.138 --> 33:31.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANDON STANTON, Humans of New
York: My name is Brandon
Stanton. I run the Web site
Humans

33:31.142 --> 33:34.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of New York. And I stop random
people on the streets of New
York City, and I learn their

33:34.412 --> 33:36.214 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stories.

33:36.214 --> 33:39.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In five years,
Brandon Stanton has learned and
shared the stories of thousands

33:39.818 --> 33:41.152 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of people.

33:41.152 --> 33:45.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, how often do you
shoot? Every day?

33:45.957 --> 33:49.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANDON STANTON: Every day, yes.
I got to keep the blog going. If
I ever -- if I stop

33:49.094 --> 33:50.595 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shooting, the blog stops.

33:50.595 --> 33:53.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
blog doesn't stop.

33:53.765 --> 33:58.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sixteen million people see his
portraits and the captions that
go with them on Facebook.

33:58.570 --> 34:02.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Another 4.4 million follow
along on Instagram.

34:02.140 --> 34:05.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANDON STANTON: I'm never
really looking for the thing
that makes somebody the same

34:05.010 --> 34:07.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as everybody else, because I
have interviewed 10,000 people.

34:07.345 --> 34:09.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Right.

34:09.447 --> 34:14.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANDON STANTON: So, in order to
keep my blog interesting, I need
to find something different

34:14.286 --> 34:18.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about that person than about the
other 10,000 people I have
interviewed.

34:18.623 --> 34:21.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Are you ever
amazed by how much a stranger is
willing to share with you?

34:21.192 --> 34:22.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRANDON STANTON: Oh, always.

34:22.694 --> 34:25.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I first started, I didn't
even think a stranger would let
me take their photo.

34:25.096 --> 34:27.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Right.

34:27.432 --> 34:32.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANDON STANTON: Now, I have
done it so much, I almost walk
up to people with the
expectation

34:32.003 --> 34:35.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, after a few minutes, we're
going to be talking about
something deeply personal

34:35.273 --> 34:38.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that they might not have
told anyone else in years.

34:38.510 --> 34:41.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Every so
often, the story of one of
Stanton's subjects will resonate

34:41.513 --> 34:44.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with thousands, and lead
to something bigger.

34:44.582 --> 34:49.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANDON STANTON: There was a
story of young man that I met in
Brownsville, Brooklyn, that

34:49.120 --> 34:52.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he ended up telling me about his
principal, and we ended up
raising $1.5 million for his

34:52.824 --> 34:54.859 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
school.

34:54.859 --> 35:01.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a story in Pakistan
about a woman who was battling
slave labor that we ended

35:01.199 --> 35:06.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up raising $2.5 million for. So
there are some stories that have
been so powerful that

35:06.638 --> 35:10.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they have spilled over, and had
some sort of larger impact.

35:10.241 --> 35:13.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: His work has
resulted in two bestselling
books, which have helped him

35:13.044 --> 35:17.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tell people's stories from
20 different countries.

35:17.182 --> 35:20.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Recently, Stanton traveled to
Turkey and Jordan to visit
refugees.

35:20.719 --> 35:24.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANDON STANTON: Being a refugee
is awful. And that's one of the
-- my eyes have been

35:24.422 --> 35:28.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
opened so much to what
these people go through.

35:28.460 --> 35:32.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These people are stuck in
Turkey, stuck in Jordan,
millions of them. They're not
allowed

35:32.831 --> 35:36.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to work. They don't have
benefits. They have no money.
They're getting, I don't know,
dollars

35:36.601 --> 35:38.937 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a month.

35:38.937 --> 35:44.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stanton met
with 12 families, part of the
10,000 refugees bound for
America,

35:44.309 --> 35:48.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who had passed the lengthy
screening process through the
UNHCR and multiple U.S.
intelligence

35:48.780 --> 35:50.882 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agencies.

35:50.882 --> 35:55.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are their perceptions of
and what are their hopes for
their lives when they get

35:55.186 --> 35:57.455 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here?

35:57.455 --> 36:05.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANDON STANTON: Existing, being
on the radar, having an I.D.,
having a passport, being a

36:05.597 --> 36:12.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
citizen, being in a place where
your labor and your effort will
actually lead to results.

36:12.771 --> 36:17.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are not allowed to do
anything as a refugee. You have
no options to move your life
forward.

36:17.742 --> 36:21.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
All you do is suffer and wait.

36:21.079 --> 36:25.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Just this past
week, one of those stories
reached the White House.

36:25.417 --> 36:30.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama commented on a
photo of a scientist profiled by
Stanton, saying, "You're

36:30.121 --> 36:32.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
part of what makes
America great."

36:32.791 --> 36:38.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANDON STANTON: And I'm meeting
these families, and all of them
are extremely exceptional

36:38.263 --> 36:44.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in some way. Either they have
very bad health conditions that
need immediate attention,

36:44.369 --> 36:50.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have handicapped children,
or they have Ph.D.s. They're
extremely highly educated.

36:50.675 --> 36:55.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I came to realize how
selective America was being
about who they let in.

36:55.280 --> 37:00.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: On Sunday,
Stanton began sharing a story he
didn't expect. While helping

37:00.452 --> 37:05.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
translate the stories of the
dozen families he was speaking
with, he found out the deep

37:05.090 --> 37:10.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
suffering his own interpreter
has already endured. Her name is
Aya Abdullah.

37:10.562 --> 37:17.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANDON STANTON: She is a victim
of both the Iraq and Syrian
wars. She grew up in Iraq.

37:17.635 --> 37:24.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She was about 7 when the war
came. Her entire neighborhood
was destroyed. Her best friend

37:24.209 --> 37:32.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was cut in half by a bomb and
died in front of Aya's eyes. She
had to watch that.

37:32.250 --> 37:37.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A car bomb exploded in front of
her when she was about 10 or 11,
and she had to help her

37:37.789 --> 37:41.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
father pick out survivors
on the side of the road.

37:41.259 --> 37:46.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: To escape,
Aya's family fled to Syria, but,
within a year, war found

37:46.030 --> 37:50.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them again, and they fled to
Turkey. Her father has now
disappeared, leaving Aya to take
care

37:50.301 --> 37:54.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of her three siblings and
her shell-shocked mother.

37:54.205 --> 37:58.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Aya applied for refugee status
four years ago, went through all
the interviews, in hopes

37:58.610 --> 38:03.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that she could start over in the
United States. In September, Aya
was told she and her family

38:03.381 --> 38:05.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would be accepted into
the United States.

38:05.583 --> 38:07.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We spoke to her via Skype.

38:07.986 --> 38:12.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AYA ABDULLAH, Refugee: We were
dancing, all the family, and
doing some music, because

38:12.524 --> 38:19.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we just tell ourselves that we
are going to go to a new life, a
new country. We start

38:19.030 --> 38:27.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to just -- to be ready to go.
And we just, like, buy new
things to have it with us and

38:27.438 --> 38:28.606 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
everything.

38:28.606 --> 38:30.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But
that joy was short-lived.

38:30.608 --> 38:32.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, you had your bags packed.
And then what happened?

38:32.544 --> 38:35.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AYA ABDULLAH: Yes.

38:35.747 --> 38:40.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what happened, that, in
December, we just get the
message that we just have --
rejected

38:40.552 --> 38:49.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from America. That's it. That's
feel that you just build dreams,
and there's someone

38:49.427 --> 38:53.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
come and destroy that.

38:53.531 --> 38:58.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Her rejection
letter offers no specific reason
why. Aya is appealing.

38:58.703 --> 39:01.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She understands that there is
currently a fear in the United
States of refugees from

39:01.472 --> 39:03.241 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Syria.

39:03.241 --> 39:07.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
AYA ABDULLAH: We're not
dangerous. We just escaped from
wars to go to a safer place.

39:07.011 --> 39:11.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're not going to do something
bad in your country.

39:11.249 --> 39:19.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I hope that -- as a refugee,
I told the people that Muslim
people and Arabic people

39:19.457 --> 39:24.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and refugees are not bad people.
This is the message that I want
to give.

39:24.963 --> 39:28.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, Brandon is
using the reach of his stories
to put a face on those

39:28.099 --> 39:30.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
refugees left behind.

39:30.635 --> 39:37.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANDON STANTON: Yes, she's just
one person. But she's also
representative of so many people

39:37.041 --> 39:41.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that are in a similar situation
that don't have the benefit of
speaking English, that

39:41.479 --> 39:45.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't have the benefit of
speaking for themselves and
telling their own stories.

39:45.883 --> 39:51.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are smart, educated people
who through no fault of their
own are just languishing

39:51.856 --> 39:56.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in near homelessness in
countries that, honestly, a lot
of people don't want them there.
They're

39:56.661 --> 40:00.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
facing discrimination. Aya has
been hit by a car. Her sister's
teeth have been knocked

40:00.732 --> 40:04.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out. They get shouted out on the
street and they have nowhere to
go.

40:04.936 --> 40:07.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: He's concerned
that, if Aya's appeal is not
approved, she will be

40:07.972 --> 40:10.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
left to move to Iraq
and marry a cousin.

40:10.908 --> 40:14.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Hari Sreenivasan, New York.

40:14.846 --> 40:20.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stanton has started
an online petition to support
Aya's appeal. The petition

40:20.985 --> 40:25.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
has more than 800,000
signatures. Stanton's goal is
one million. You can see more of
her

40:25.890 --> 40:36.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
story on our Web site
at PBS.org/NewsHour.

40:36.601 --> 40:49.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Next: where Bach meets hip-hop,
with a strong message about
stereotyping.

40:49.213 --> 40:54.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown looks at the
musical group Black Violin.

40:54.152 --> 41:03.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Wil Baptiste and
Kev Marcus, members of Black
Violin, two former high school

41:03.661 --> 41:10.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
orchestra nerds. That's how they
met. But, also, by their own
description, two 6'2''

41:10.968 --> 41:15.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
black men who are eager to
change perceptions about who
plays what when it comes to
music.

41:15.840 --> 41:19.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Their new album is
titled "Stereotypes."

41:19.811 --> 41:24.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WIL BAPTISTE, Black Violin: I
think that's probably the main
agenda, right? You think

41:24.215 --> 41:24.982 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of...

41:24.982 --> 41:25.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: You
use the word agenda?

41:25.750 --> 41:28.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WIL BAPTISTE: Yes, I think so.

41:28.386 --> 41:33.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you look at us, we don't look
like your typical violinists. We
talk to the kids all

41:33.157 --> 41:37.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the time, and the kids love us
just because we can relate to
them, so to speak. And that's

41:37.195 --> 41:39.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what it's all about,
breaking stereotypes.

41:39.230 --> 41:44.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEV MARCUS, Black Violin: I look
like I should be a linebacker,
but to be a violinist, when

41:44.268 --> 41:48.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I realized that, I was just,
like, I love it. I'm drawn to
it. It's the thing that --
that's

41:48.139 --> 41:51.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why I wake up in the morning, is
to take the violin and kind of
change people's perceptions

41:51.142 --> 41:54.045 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about it.

41:54.045 --> 41:59.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%

We met them recently at the
Publick Playhouse in Cheverly,
Maryland. They have played the

42:17.368 --> 42:25.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Apollo Theater in Harlem. They
met with American troops in
Iraq, and have opened for top
pop

42:25.643 --> 42:29.614 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
stars, including Alicia Keys.

42:29.614 --> 42:34.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It all began in an ordinary,
even accidental, way at Dillard
High School for the Performing

42:34.585 --> 42:36.721 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Arts in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida.

42:36.721 --> 42:39.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Was it your choice to
pick up the viola?

42:39.323 --> 42:41.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KEV MARCUS: No. My mom
made me do it, actually.

42:41.159 --> 42:42.927 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:42.927 --> 42:45.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEV MARCUS: But now I thank her
every day. I mean, 25 years
later, I can't believe I'm

42:45.830 --> 42:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
still playing this instrument.

42:48.266 --> 42:51.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WIL BAPTISTE: To be quite
honest, I didn't want to pick it
up. I wanted to play the
saxophone.

42:51.135 --> 42:52.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They put me in the wrong class.
That's my story. True story.

42:52.804 --> 42:54.705 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:54.705 --> 42:57.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WIL BAPTISTE: But I'm grateful
now that I have -- you know,
Black Saxophone just doesn't

42:57.175 --> 42:58.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have the same ring
to it, you know?

42:58.276 --> 43:00.144 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

43:00.144 --> 43:03.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You were telling
me, Wil, earlier, about high
school, the rigor of the
training,

43:03.681 --> 43:05.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
right? You were always playing.

43:05.550 --> 43:06.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WIL BAPTISTE: Always playing.

43:06.317 --> 43:08.052 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

43:08.052 --> 43:11.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Playing in
orchestra, playing in quartets,
concerts all the time.

43:11.889 --> 43:15.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WIL BAPTISTE: Exactly, concert
every weekend. We had a viola
technique class, chamber music,

43:15.726 --> 43:18.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
orchestra, youth orchestra.

43:18.796 --> 43:22.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, you know, we had a ton
of classes, but that was the
really, really good thing.

43:22.867 --> 43:24.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the time, it was very like,
ah, I have got another concert,
I have got another -- you

43:24.902 --> 43:27.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
know, got to rehearse.

43:27.772 --> 43:33.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The genre-bending
music they play today is a
direct fusion of their musical

43:33.444 --> 43:35.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
training and passions.

43:35.813 --> 43:41.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEV MARCUS: Think of it this
way. We studied classical, but
we lived rap music. So...

43:41.619 --> 43:44.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You studied
one and you lived the other.

43:44.188 --> 43:44.655 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

43:44.655 --> 43:47.225 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEV MARCUS: And lived the other.

43:47.225 --> 43:51.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, second period every day,
we'd play Bach and Beethoven and
Mozart, but, on the way

43:51.963 --> 43:56.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to third period, we'd be
listening to Biggie or Tupac or
whatever we liked at the time,

43:56.467 --> 43:59.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
whatever was hot.

43:59.070 --> 44:04.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, when it came time to blend
them together, we did it so
naturally and so seamlessly that

44:04.275 --> 44:09.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it didn't even seem like we were
doing anything groundbreaking at
the time. We were just naturally

44:09.113 --> 44:16.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- I would hear that hip-hop
beat and pick up our violins and
play to it.

44:16.020 --> 44:27.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WIL BAPTISTE: We're bridging two
worlds together. We're bridging
hip-hop and classical and jazz

44:27.465 --> 44:29.267 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and funk.

44:29.267 --> 44:33.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what that does is, to me,
particularly with the kids, it
just -- to them, they're

44:33.804 --> 44:38.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like, oh, my God, this looks
incredible. It sounds
incredible. It looks impossible.
Maybe

44:38.676 --> 44:43.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can do this with literature,
art, science, or anything that I
have a passion for.

44:43.414 --> 44:53.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A Black Violin
concert is a dancing, even
shouting affair. They play their

44:53.190 --> 44:55.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
own compositions, such
as the song "Invisible."

44:55.960 --> 45:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WIL BAPTISTE: I need you guys to
help me out. I'm not invisible.
Clap your hands. Come on.

45:02.333 --> 45:04.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm not invisible.

45:04.569 --> 45:10.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And cover hits
like Ed Sheeran's "Thinking Out
Loud."

45:10.374 --> 45:13.210 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(SINGING)

45:13.210 --> 45:27.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But there are
also slightly older hits, like
Bach's Brandenburg Concertos.

45:27.892 --> 45:40.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEV MARCUS: Bach, to me, is the
equalizer. Beethoven, I just --
anything late Beethoven

45:40.137 --> 45:45.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as far as chamber music is
concerned, I just love. I'm very
excited about classical music.

45:45.209 --> 45:50.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what we do is just
different. It's not -- it
doesn't elevate it. It's just
different

45:50.114 --> 45:54.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from classical, just like it's
different from hip-hop. We get
to create our own lane and

45:54.685 --> 45:58.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
walk in it on our own, and
hopefully others follow.

45:58.356 --> 46:03.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, because the
question is how does Bach and
what does Bach say to Jay-Z

46:03.494 --> 46:08.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or Tupac? What are they
saying to one another?

46:08.065 --> 46:13.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WIL BAPTISTE: Honestly, I think,
if Bach were here today, he
would say, good job, fellows,

46:13.237 --> 46:15.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because, honestly, if you think
about -- if you think about
classical and hip-hop, they're

46:15.873 --> 46:19.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not so different.

46:19.243 --> 46:25.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the Bach world, back in those
days, I mean, someone would pay
Bach to write a specific

46:25.216 --> 46:30.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
piece for a banquet or a party.
You know what I'm saying? Bach
was the producer at that

46:30.888 --> 46:34.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time, the hip-hop producer, so
to speak, at that time. So it's
not so different from today's

46:34.992 --> 46:36.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
age right now. You
know what I mean?

46:36.927 --> 46:38.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, there's a lot
of similarities.

46:38.963 --> 46:41.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I'm not sure I
have heard that before. Bach is
a hip-hop producer of his

46:41.365 --> 46:43.367 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

46:43.367 --> 46:49.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Braxton Saint Hill (ph), age 7,
part of the Washington, D.C.,
Youth Orchestra, was immersed

46:49.240 --> 46:53.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the concert from the front
row. His mother, Anhela (ph),
told us he'd had a bad cold,

46:53.711 --> 46:56.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but wasn't going to miss this.

46:56.781 --> 47:02.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BOY: Hey, Black Violin, when I
get as old as you, I'm going to
play too with you. All

47:02.086 --> 47:04.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
right. Bye, Black Violin.

47:04.789 --> 47:09.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Earlier, I had
asked Wil Baptiste and Kev
Marcus where they hope this all
leads.

47:09.960 --> 47:14.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WIL BAPTISTE: I think a lot of
kids are now open to listening
to a Mozart piece or a Beethoven

47:14.098 --> 47:16.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
piece because of what we do.

47:16.467 --> 47:21.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think we're creating --
and also hip-hop as well, the
true essence of hip-hop, which

47:21.405 --> 47:24.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is creativity. Someone that
would never listen to hip-hop is
seeing hip-hop in a different

47:24.842 --> 47:26.877 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
light.

47:26.877 --> 47:32.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEV MARCUS: Whoever you are,
whether you're yellow, purple,
black, young, 5, 70, whatever,

47:32.149 --> 47:37.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just come have a good time, and,
hopefully, you're educated,
entertained and inspired.

47:37.822 --> 47:46.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In January, Black
Violin will set off again on a
30-city U.S. tour.

47:46.030 --> 47:57.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Cheverly, Maryland, I'm
Jeffrey Brown for the "PBS
NewsHour."

47:57.108 --> 48:08.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And finally tonight,
another in our series of essays,
a tradition here at

48:08.586 --> 48:10.654 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the "NewsHour."

48:10.654 --> 48:13.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Robin Givhan is the fashion
critic of The Washington Post
and the winner of the Pulitzer

48:13.190 --> 48:15.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Prize for Criticism.

48:15.593 --> 48:19.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, she explores the sexism
behind some critiques of haute
couture.

48:19.597 --> 48:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBIN GIVHAN, Pulitzer Prize
Winner: Fashion makes people
nervous. Sometimes, they get

48:22.433 --> 48:25.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a little mean. They turn sexist.

48:25.636 --> 48:31.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I say fashion, I don't mean
basic T-shirts and jeans, or
even some scrim of a dress that

48:31.108 --> 48:34.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
leaves nothing to
the imagination.

48:34.245 --> 48:41.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean runway fashion, the
clothes that designers send out
on professional models, clothes
that

48:41.118 --> 48:45.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
speak to the state of our
culture, where it's moving and
how women and men will want to

48:45.689 --> 48:50.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be perceived in the public
square six months from now and
beyond.

48:50.294 --> 48:57.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For example, there is a movement
in fashion inspired by blurring
gender lines. A lot of

48:57.168 --> 49:01.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
designers have been part of this
conversation, but the most
aggressive has been Gucci's
Alessandro

49:01.939 --> 49:07.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michele. He startled the fashion
industry with a men's wear
collection that included

49:07.244 --> 49:13.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ruffles, rows, and lace. Markers
of women's attire had been
applied to men. Here was social

49:13.484 --> 49:17.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
change meted out in the form
of a men's wear revolution.

49:17.988 --> 49:23.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dutch designer Iris van
Herpen merges fashion with
technology in the search for

49:23.460 --> 49:27.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
new materials and techniques.
Her clothes are otherworldly,
such as dresses that look

49:27.932 --> 49:30.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like waves captured mid-splash.

49:30.634 --> 49:37.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's a futurist. And without
designers like her, we would all
still be in pantaloons and

49:37.041 --> 49:43.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hoopskirts. But when people see
her work, and Michele's, they
freak out. I know this

49:43.581 --> 49:49.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because these people write to
me. It's only natural to be
unnerved by something that is

49:49.186 --> 49:53.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unfamiliar, but other categories
of commerce regularly shock us,
without sending us into

49:53.324 --> 49:56.560 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a fit of aggrieved mocking.

49:56.560 --> 50:01.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For instance, we have been
informed that drones will soon
be delivering dog food to our
front

50:01.599 --> 50:07.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
door. And the only question we
ask is, how fast? In other
industries, tentative leap

50:07.404 --> 50:12.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
forwards encourage us to look
closer, but not fashion.

50:12.243 --> 50:18.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With fashion, the first reaction
from so many, from so many men
in particular, is to laugh.

50:18.315 --> 50:24.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Who would wear that? If there is
one common thread in all this
lampooning and fretting,

50:24.321 --> 50:29.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's the belief that the mere
existence of strange and
expensive fashion is an affront.

50:29.526 --> 50:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fact that a woman might
spend $20,000 on a Dior haute
couture dress pushes many

50:35.733 --> 50:42.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people to distraction. They seem
to believe that the existence of
such an expensive garment

50:42.172 --> 50:49.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
endangers the existence of $100
ZARA dresses. I assure you the
$100 dress is safe.

50:49.546 --> 50:56.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I find this strange because I
don't detect similar outrage
over, say, fancy cars. We

50:56.020 --> 51:02.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't presume that the social
fabric is being shredded by your
$100,000 Cadillac or your

51:02.359 --> 51:07.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
$200,000 starter Bentley. But if
you build a special elevator for
them and then run for

51:07.264 --> 51:10.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president, well, you
will have a problem.

51:10.668 --> 51:15.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The cultural conversation about
these luxury cars typically
centers on their engineering,

51:15.873 --> 51:22.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their sleek lines and their
precision. That same
conversation could be had about
fashion.

51:22.146 --> 51:26.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At its highest level, fashion is
also about proportions and
lines, balance and details,

51:26.250 --> 51:29.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and considering performance.

51:29.486 --> 51:35.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But the conversation is
different, because we still tend
to think of cars as boys' toys,

and fashion is for girls.
Fashion has a lot of problems of
its own making. It isn't as

51:40.965 --> 51:44.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
diverse as it should be. It
appeals to our insecurities. And
it struggles to balance

51:44.568 --> 51:48.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
creativity with commerce.

51:48.372 --> 51:53.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But it is pervasive and
influential, so we should
examine it seriously. It is
beautiful

51:53.510 --> 51:57.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and entertaining, too, and we
should enjoy that. We should
treat it no better and no

51:57.481 --> 52:00.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
worse than any other industry.

52:00.718 --> 52:06.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we dismiss it at our peril,
because, when men end up with a
closet full of floral lace

52:06.223 --> 52:13.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shirts, they're going to want
to know how they got there.

people

52:31.281 --> 52:35.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
