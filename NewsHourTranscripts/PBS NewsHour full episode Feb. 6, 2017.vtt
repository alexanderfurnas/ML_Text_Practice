JOHN YANG: Good evening.

00:05.472 --> 00:06.440 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm John Yang.

00:06.473 --> 00:07.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Judy Woodruff is away.

00:07.474 --> 00:09.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:09.343 --> 00:11.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
We will defeat radical Islamic
terrorism and

00:11.979 --> 00:15.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we will not allow it to take
root in our country.

00:15.949 --> 00:20.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: President Trump
addresses troops
as his immigration ban faces
court challenges.

00:20.888 --> 00:26.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, our Politics Monday team
takes a look
at the inner workings of the
Trump White House.

00:26.960 --> 00:32.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Also ahead: taking the
temperature of an experimental
program under the Affordable
Care Act aimed

00:32.199 --> 00:36.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
at keeping costs down by
changing the way
hospitals deliver care.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.138 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

00:38.171 --> 00:39.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TIMOTHY FERRIS, Manager,
Partners HealthCare:
It allows us essentially to
customize the

00:40.007 --> 00:46.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
delivery of services to the
specific needs
and not base how we are
delivering that service

00:46.480 --> 00:49.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on exactly what is paid for in
the fee-for-service
system.

00:49.449 --> 00:52.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And a record-setting
win.

00:52.119 --> 00:56.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Patriots score the biggest
comeback in
Super Bowl history.

00:56.924 --> 00:59.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:59.393 --> 01:02.696 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:02.729 --> 01:16.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: A federal appeals
court in California
is the focus tonight in the
legal war over

01:16.576 --> 01:19.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
banning travelers from seven
mostly Muslim
nations.

01:19.546 --> 01:24.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The flow resumed over the
weekend, and today
the president again defended his
order.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins begins our
coverage.

01:26.019 --> 01:31.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Today, a
continued current
of arrivals like this one at
Dulles Airport

01:31.491 --> 01:36.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outside of Washington, families
previously
denied entry under President
Trump's travel

01:36.196 --> 01:41.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
order now met with applause,
some due to the
weekend's court orders, others
like brothers

01:41.969 --> 01:46.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tareq and Ammar Aziz from Yemen
because they
are green card holders who had
to reschedule

01:46.974 --> 01:49.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after confusion over their
status.

01:49.042 --> 01:54.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAREQ AZIZ, Green Card Holder: I
just wanted
to thank all of the people who
support us,

01:54.247 --> 01:57.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who were with us.

01:57.117 --> 02:02.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They made me feel like there's a
family here,
that we have a family.

02:02.522 --> 02:04.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what I love about
America.

02:04.458 --> 02:08.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: All this
following Friday's
ruling by federal Judge James
Robart in Seattle

02:08.996 --> 02:13.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that halted several key
provisions, at least
temporarily.

02:13.100 --> 02:16.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That ruling drew a tweetstorm of
criticism
from the president.

02:16.636 --> 02:21.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"If something happens," Mr.
Trump wrote, "blame
him and the court system."

02:21.241 --> 02:24.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had more to say today at
MacDill Air Force
Base in Tampa, Florida.

02:24.444 --> 02:30.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
We need strong programs, so that
people that

02:30.350 --> 02:37.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
love us and want to love our
country and will
end up loving our country are
allowed in,

02:37.991 --> 02:42.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not people that want to destroy
us and destroy
our country.

02:42.562 --> 02:44.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:44.965 --> 02:50.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It was his
first visit to
U.S. Central Command, the
military wing overseeing

02:50.704 --> 02:52.606 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Middle East.

02:52.639 --> 02:57.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As he spoke about radical
Islamic terror attacks,
Mr. Trump's sharpest criticism
was about the

02:57.544 --> 02:59.312 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
media.

02:59.346 --> 03:02.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: It's gotten to a
point where
it's not even being reported,
and in many

03:02.749 --> 03:08.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cases the very, very dishonest
press doesn't
want to report it.

03:08.288 --> 03:10.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have their reasons, and you
understand
that.

03:10.657 --> 03:15.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: We asked the
White House
for specific examples of
unreported terror

03:15.095 --> 03:18.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attacks and didn't receive a
response.

03:18.298 --> 03:22.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meantime, Vice President Pence
defended the
president's words about the
Seattle judge

03:22.736 --> 03:24.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over the weekend on ABC.

03:24.604 --> 03:26.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE, Vice President of
the United States:
And the president is determined
to use the

03:26.540 --> 03:29.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
authority that he has under the
Constitution
and under the law.

03:29.509 --> 03:32.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The legal
battle has moved
fast.

03:32.279 --> 03:36.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Justice Department asked a
federal appeals
court over the weekend to
reconsider Judge

03:36.516 --> 03:41.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Robart's action, saying it harms
the public
by thwarting enforcement, and
second-guesses

03:41.688 --> 03:44.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the president's national
security judgment.

03:44.558 --> 03:48.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the attorneys general of
Washington State
and Minnesota who pushed for the
original

03:48.528 --> 03:51.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
halt to the order responded back
strongly.

03:51.164 --> 03:56.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Unfreezing it," they told the
appeals court,
"would unleash chaos, and would,
once again,

03:56.436 --> 04:00.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
separate families and strand
university students
and faculty."

04:00.941 --> 04:05.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Major tech firms, including
Uber, Apple and
Google, filed their own briefs
against the

04:05.145 --> 04:09.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
travel ban, saying it will hurt
their work
forces and the economy.

04:09.816 --> 04:14.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And former Secretaries of State
John Kerry
and Madeleine Albright also
filed briefs,

04:14.387 --> 04:18.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
saying the ban will harm
counterterrorism
partnerships with other nations.

04:18.325 --> 04:24.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Late today, President Trump
returned to Washington,
as the appeals court mulled its
decision.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And staff here at the White
House just confirmed
to me what many people are
thinking, that

04:27.968 --> 04:32.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this whole fight over the travel
ban could
end up at the U.S. Supreme Court
-- John.

04:32.372 --> 04:36.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Lisa, we heard
President Trump
talking about this court case
involving his

04:36.810 --> 04:38.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
immigration order.

04:38.044 --> 04:39.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are the officials at the
White House
saying?

04:39.913 --> 04:43.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I just came
back from talking
to Assistant Press Secretary
Michael Short.

04:43.049 --> 04:44.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He stressed two things.

04:44.851 --> 04:49.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One, this is temporary, that the
administration
is working on more permanent
actions that

04:49.222 --> 04:52.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may not be executive orders, but
may be just
new forms of vetting.

04:52.792 --> 04:55.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Second, he talked about a real
fear that the
White House has.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He even used these words.

04:57.697 --> 05:01.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said: "I would hate to be
explaining a
terror attack that could have
been prevented

05:01.434 --> 05:03.303 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by our actions."

05:03.336 --> 05:08.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, at the same time, John,
we now have
word that 16 Democratic state
attorneys general

05:08.909 --> 05:10.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
feel the opposite.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They feel the real threat is
from this order.

05:12.312 --> 05:16.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have filed supportive
briefs to those
attorneys generals who are
fighting it.

05:16.716 --> 05:20.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: And, Lisa, I
understand you have
gotten a little later word from
the White

05:20.053 --> 05:24.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House about this claim of
reported terrorist
attacks?

05:24.124 --> 05:25.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

05:25.892 --> 05:29.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the plane back from Florida,
White House
Press Secretary Sean Spicer told
reporters

05:29.095 --> 05:34.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who were there that what the
president was
talking about was
under-reporting of terror

05:34.067 --> 05:35.435 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
plots.

05:35.468 --> 05:37.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We pressed that here at the
White House a
bit more.

05:37.871 --> 05:40.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I was told that the White
House is coming
up with a list.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, the president himself
didn't use
the word under-reported.

05:43.577 --> 05:46.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He said not even being reported.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're waiting to see what list
they come up
with.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.282 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We haven't seen that list yet.

05:49.316 --> 05:54.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Lisa Desjardins on
the White House
North Lawn.

05:54.421 --> 05:58.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
Senate went into
an around-the-clock session in a
showdown

05:59.025 --> 06:03.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over Betsy DeVos, President
Trump's nominee
to be education secretary.

06:03.897 --> 06:08.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's a wealthy Republican donor
and champion
of alternatives to public
schools.

06:08.468 --> 06:12.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Democrats said today they
will hold the
Senate floor until tomorrow's
confirmation

06:12.639 --> 06:13.607 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
vote.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.542 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:15.575 --> 06:18.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: She
is the least qualified
nomination in a historically

06:18.778 --> 06:21.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
unqualified Cabinet.

06:21.314 --> 06:24.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On conflicts of interest, she
ranks among
the worst.

06:24.951 --> 06:27.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On philosophy of education, her
views are
extreme.

06:27.854 --> 06:29.556 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:29.589 --> 06:31.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: I
have every confidence that Ms.
DeVos will

06:31.324 --> 06:34.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lead the Department of Education
in such a
way that will put our students'
interests

06:34.995 --> 06:41.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first while also strengthening
the educational
opportunities available to all
of America's

06:41.668 --> 06:43.003 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
children.

06:43.036 --> 06:45.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Tomorrow's Senate
roll call could
come down to a tie.

06:45.905 --> 06:50.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That would leave Vice President
Pence to cast
the deciding vote, something no
other vice

06:50.377 --> 06:54.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president has ever done in a
Cabinet confirmation.

06:54.247 --> 06:58.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senior Republicans are brushing
aside President
Trump's latest remarks on
Russian President

06:58.285 --> 07:00.053 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Vladimir Putin.

07:00.086 --> 07:04.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a FOX News interview that
aired Sunday,
he dismissed Bill O'Reilly's
characterization

07:04.591 --> 07:06.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Putin as a killer.

07:06.326 --> 07:09.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president said: "There are a
lot of killers."

07:09.062 --> 07:11.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he asked, "Our country's so
innocent?"

07:11.631 --> 07:16.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Texas Congressman Mac
Thornberry, chairman
of the House Armed Services
Committee, rejected

07:16.670 --> 07:17.837 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the comparison.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said: "Are we the same as
Putin's Russia?

07:20.840 --> 07:22.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The answer is no."

07:22.742 --> 07:28.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Afghanistan, bad weather and
snow-blocked
roads are hampering rescue
efforts after avalanches

07:28.615 --> 07:32.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
killed at least 119 people over
the weekend.

07:32.252 --> 07:34.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Nearly 90 more were hurt.

07:34.321 --> 07:37.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Workers are trying to reach
remote villages
in the northern part of the
country, where

07:38.024 --> 07:41.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nearly 200 homes have been
destroyed.

07:41.494 --> 07:46.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officials say some places were
buried under
more than six feet of snow.

07:46.399 --> 07:50.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The one-time presidential
front-runner in
France insisted tonight he will
not drop out

07:50.837 --> 07:53.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the race despite an
embezzlement scandal.

07:53.973 --> 07:59.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Conservative Francois Fillon has
plunged in
the polls, opening the door to
far-right leader

07:59.045 --> 08:03.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Marine Le Pen, who echoes
President Trump's
populism.

08:03.183 --> 08:08.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This evening, Fillon defended
himself against
claims that he put relatives in
high-paying

08:08.288 --> 08:10.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government jobs with no real
duties.

08:10.690 --> 08:13.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRANCOIS FILLON, French
Presidential Candidate
(through translator): What was
acceptable

08:13.860 --> 08:16.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
yesterday isn't anymore today.

08:16.396 --> 08:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By working with my wife and my
children, I
favored this collaboration of
trust which

08:20.367 --> 08:23.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
today creates distrust.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was a mistake.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The first round of
voting in the
French election will be in
April.

08:28.441 --> 08:33.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ahead of the balloting, Facebook
and Google
are teaming up with French news
organizations

08:33.179 --> 08:35.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to tackle fake news.

08:35.382 --> 08:40.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The companies say they will
provide tools
to 17 French newsrooms to help
them identify

08:40.286 --> 08:42.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and debunk false stories.

08:42.389 --> 08:46.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Facebook was criticized for not
preventing
false information from being
republished during

08:46.559 --> 08:49.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the American presidential
election.

08:49.429 --> 08:51.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Wall Street opened the week on a
quiet note.

08:51.931 --> 08:57.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 19 points
to close at 20052.

08:57.237 --> 09:02.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell three points,
and the S&amp;P
500 slipped nearly five.

09:02.876 --> 09:08.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Boston is getting ready for
a blowout
celebration after New England's
dramatic overtime

09:08.681 --> 09:11.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
win over Atlanta in the Super
Bowl.

09:11.384 --> 09:16.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Patriots returned home this
afternoon
after coming from 25 points
behind last night

09:16.489 --> 09:19.459 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to win 34-28.

09:19.492 --> 09:22.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's their fifth NFL title.

09:22.195 --> 09:23.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The city holds a parade
tomorrow.

09:24.030 --> 09:28.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will take a closer look at a
game for the
ages later in the program.

09:28.568 --> 09:33.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
legal arguments
for and against the immigration
ban as the

09:33.740 --> 09:38.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
courts weigh in; and it's
Politics Monday,
a look at the inner workings of
the White

09:39.012 --> 09:52.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
House; and much more.

09:52.158 --> 09:57.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now to the constitutional
showdown over President
Trump's executive order on
immigration.

09:57.130 --> 10:01.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the first of two looks at
what's at stake,
we are joined first by
Washington State Attorney

10:01.768 --> 10:04.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
General Bob Ferguson from
Seattle.

10:04.304 --> 10:09.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was his suit that led to this
weekend's
temporary shutdown of the ban.

10:09.642 --> 10:11.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Attorney General Ferguson,
thanks for joining
us.

10:11.678 --> 10:13.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BOB FERGUSON, Washington State
Attorney General:
Thanks for having me on.

10:13.446 --> 10:18.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: If you -- if the
court lifts this
ban, lifts the temporary
restraining order,

10:18.618 --> 10:20.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will you appeal to the Supreme
Court?

10:20.420 --> 10:25.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB FERGUSON: Well, to be
crystal clear, I
will use every tool I have to
make sure that

10:25.625 --> 10:29.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this unconstitutional executive
order doesn't
stand.

10:29.128 --> 10:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That said, we're confident the
Ninth Circuit
will affirm what Judge Robart,
who was appointed,

10:33.867 --> 10:37.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of course, by President George
W. Bush, will
affirm his decision to grant
that TRO.

10:37.937 --> 10:43.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: I assume you're
anticipating if
he does keep it in place that
the Justice

10:43.309 --> 10:45.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Department will take it to the
Supreme Court.

10:45.778 --> 10:50.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's your sense of how your
chances would
fare on the current court?

10:50.950 --> 10:53.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BOB FERGUSON: Well, I feel very
confident.

10:53.620 --> 10:58.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As I mentioned, Judge Robart is
a very serious,
well-respected judge appointed
by President

10:58.658 --> 11:00.159 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
George W. Bush.

11:00.193 --> 11:05.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he took the significant step
of granting
a temporary restraining order.

11:05.198 --> 11:10.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a high hurdle for a
lawyer to meet
in a courtroom to get a judge to
grant a TRO,

11:10.403 --> 11:12.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a temporary restraining order.

11:12.272 --> 11:15.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, given that and the fact the
Ninth Circuit
declined to give an emergency
stay a couple

11:15.608 --> 11:19.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nights ago, we feel confident
with our case
not just at the Ninth Circuit,
but frankly

11:19.812 --> 11:22.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all the way up to the U.S.
Supreme Court,
if that's what it comes down to.

11:22.482 --> 11:25.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And all this is right
now is just
over this temporary restraining
order.

11:25.852 --> 11:30.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You would still have to go back
for a trial
on the merits before Judge
Robart in Seattle,

11:30.990 --> 11:32.659 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is that right?

11:32.692 --> 11:35.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB FERGUSON: That's correct,
although we
feel confident there, because in
order to

11:35.295 --> 11:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grant the temporary restraining
order, one
of the criteria that the judge
must conclude

11:41.234 --> 11:45.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is that the state has a high
likelihood of
prevailing on the merits.

11:45.104 --> 11:48.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's already reached that
conclusion that
we're likely to prevail once we
get to the

11:48.408 --> 11:50.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
merits before the judge.

11:50.276 --> 11:55.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Now, the Constitution
gives the
president authority to deal with
immigration,

11:55.882 --> 11:59.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to conduct foreign affairs and
address immigration.

11:59.185 --> 12:03.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congress in the immigration law
gives the
president the power to restrict
or suspend

12:03.356 --> 12:06.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the entry of people he may deem
appropriate.

12:06.893 --> 12:09.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why do you argue that this is
unconstitutional?

12:09.162 --> 12:11.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BOB FERGUSON: Well, it's pretty
straightforward.

12:11.664 --> 12:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes, the president has broad
authority.

12:14.534 --> 12:16.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We don't question that.

12:16.369 --> 12:19.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what the federal government
is literally
arguing, and that your viewers
should be aware

12:19.138 --> 12:25.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of, is they're arguing that it's
unfettered,
that the court cannot look
behind any motivation

12:25.044 --> 12:27.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for that order or whether or not
it's constitutional.

12:27.714 --> 12:30.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that has never been the law
and simply
cannot be the law.

12:30.817 --> 12:32.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we are a nation of laws.

12:32.518 --> 12:35.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And nobody can ignore our
Constitution.

12:35.455 --> 12:36.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No one's above the law.

12:36.623 --> 12:38.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that includes the president
of the United
States.

12:38.424 --> 12:43.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: If this executive
order had just
called for the extreme vetting,
as President

12:43.496 --> 12:48.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Trump calls it, and not
specified countries,
not given preference to
Christians -- well,

12:48.568 --> 12:53.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it gives preference to religious
minorities
in these countries, which means
Christians

12:53.239 --> 12:58.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and other religions -- would
that have removed
the constitutional objections,
in your view?

12:58.911 --> 13:02.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB FERGUSON: Well, I'm often
asked about
different permutations that
might solve the

13:02.382 --> 13:04.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
significant problem the federal
government
has.

13:04.150 --> 13:06.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What I can say is, there is
pretty significant
vetting going on.

13:06.753 --> 13:10.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just returned from Sea-Tac
Airport here
in Washington State, where I met
individuals

13:10.957 --> 13:14.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who had been denied entry to the
country as
a result of the president's
executive order,

13:14.761 --> 13:16.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but are now back in.

13:16.529 --> 13:19.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in one case, he had gone
through a through
a two-year process to get his
visa.

13:19.599 --> 13:23.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's now joining his wife, who's
a citizen
of this state, and his cousin,
who is a graduate

13:23.536 --> 13:26.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Washington State University
and works at
Boeing.

13:26.239 --> 13:30.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are folks who would be
great additions
to our life in Washington State.

13:30.076 --> 13:31.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's happening all across
the country
as well.

13:31.944 --> 13:36.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: So, we're learning
that the judge
has asked -- the appeals court
asked for oral

13:36.182 --> 13:37.517 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
arguments today.

13:37.550 --> 13:38.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Give us a preview.

13:38.885 --> 13:41.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are you going to be saying
before this
three-judge panel?

13:42.021 --> 13:44.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BOB FERGUSON: So, you have news
that I just
am hearing for the first time.

13:45.024 --> 13:47.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we're not surprised if
there's oral argument.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We anticipated that would be the
case for
an issue of this magnitude.

13:50.830 --> 13:55.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will make the same case,
frankly, that
we made before Judge Robart,
that there can

13:55.134 --> 14:00.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be no unfettered discretion for
a president,
that you have to look behind
what he's doing

14:00.373 --> 14:05.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here, and that we find in this
case that it
violates various constitutional
provisions,

14:05.144 --> 14:08.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and also violates specific
statutory provisions
as well.

14:08.247 --> 14:09.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we're confident we will
prevail.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The president has
been tweeting
about this.

14:11.617 --> 14:18.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said that this stay, this
temporary restraining
order, puts our country in such
peril, he

14:18.091 --> 14:19.859 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
says.

14:19.892 --> 14:23.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If something happens, blame him,
meaning the
judge, Judge Robart, and the
court system.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do you respond to that?

14:25.164 --> 14:28.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BOB FERGUSON: Well, look, a
couple things.

14:28.201 --> 14:33.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Number one, as a lawyer, his
comments about
the judge being a so-called
judge, for example,

14:33.106 --> 14:36.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or statements like that are
deeply concerning
to anyone who cares about our
judiciary.

14:36.676 --> 14:41.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Number two, my wife and I, we
are raising
our twins, our young twins, to
be gracious

14:41.614 --> 14:43.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in victory or defeat.

14:43.316 --> 14:46.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And President Trump is obviously
having a
very difficult time handling the
defeat that

14:46.552 --> 14:48.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he suffered before a federal
district court
judge.

14:49.021 --> 14:53.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What about his
underlying argument,
though, that this is allowing,
this could

14:53.993 --> 14:57.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
allow a terrorist to come into
the country?

14:57.130 --> 15:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB FERGUSON: What did I would
encourage the
president to do is to draft an
executive order

15:01.067 --> 15:02.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that's constitutional.

15:02.568 --> 15:03.536 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's his job.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's his responsibility.

15:05.404 --> 15:09.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My job and my responsibility is
to make sure
that everybody, including the
president, plays

15:09.575 --> 15:11.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by the rules and follows the
Constitution.

15:11.644 --> 15:15.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in a courtroom, it is not
the loudest
voice that prevails.

15:15.114 --> 15:16.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's the Constitution.

15:16.215 --> 15:17.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why I think we're
prevailing right
now.

15:17.950 --> 15:21.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Attorney General Bob
Ferguson from
Seattle, thank you very much.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BOB FERGUSON: Thank you.

15:22.955 --> 15:25.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: And now for a
different take on
President Trump's executive
order, Republican

15:25.658 --> 15:29.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congressman Ted Yoho of Florida
joins us from
Capitol Hill.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Yoho, thanks for being with
us.

15:31.798 --> 15:33.065 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I hope you were able to hear the
attorney
general from Washington.

15:34.567 --> 15:35.535 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

15:35.568 --> 15:36.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TED YOHO (R), Florida: Yes, I
was.

15:36.569 --> 15:37.537 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

15:37.570 --> 15:38.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What do you say to
him?

15:38.938 --> 15:40.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says this violates both the
Constitution
and immigration law.

15:40.039 --> 15:41.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you say to that?

15:41.040 --> 15:42.008 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

15:42.041 --> 15:43.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TED YOHO: I disagree with that.

15:44.010 --> 15:47.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the president -- the
executive, regardless
who it is, has the ability to
decide who comes

15:47.613 --> 15:50.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in and doesn't if it's a
national security
risk.

15:50.449 --> 15:55.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all he's asking -- I have
read the executive
order -- all he's asking is put
a pause on

15:55.054 --> 16:00.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it so that we get the metrics
right, so that
we can do the background checks
correct.

16:00.126 --> 16:02.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't see a problem with that.

16:02.161 --> 16:06.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's got in there where you
come back
in 30 days, reassess it, 60, 90,
and 120 days.

16:06.232 --> 16:07.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
This is a pause.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is not a ban, complete ban.

16:10.336 --> 16:12.104 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It is a pause.

16:12.138 --> 16:17.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think anybody that is
concerned with
national security, and if you
look at our

16:17.910 --> 16:22.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Constitution -- he kept talking
about being
Constitution -- the Constitution
states very

16:22.048 --> 16:26.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clearly that the number one task
of our government
is to provide for the common
defense and protection

16:26.986 --> 16:28.821 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of this country.

16:28.855 --> 16:33.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, when you look
around the world,
other areas that have not done
this, I think

16:33.793 --> 16:37.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're wishing they would have
been a little
bit more stringent in the
examination of people

16:37.697 --> 16:39.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
coming in, in the refugee
program.

16:39.565 --> 16:44.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, look at Belgium, look
at Paris,
look at Germany.

16:44.103 --> 16:47.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think this is a time that
we have to
do that.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's -- again, it's a
temporary pause.

16:50.176 --> 16:55.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And people, I think, just need
to calm down,
let us work through the process.

16:55.081 --> 16:56.816 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The courts will work this out.

16:56.849 --> 17:01.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think it's also good that
it brought
to light how we have to fix our
immigration

17:01.254 --> 17:02.221 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
policy.

17:02.255 --> 17:04.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So I welcome that, too.

17:04.056 --> 17:08.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And the opponents of
this are also
arguing that -- in their court
challenge,

17:08.427 --> 17:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that this creates -- even this
ban, this temporary
-- temporary pause, as you call
it, as you

17:13.866 --> 17:20.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say, would create immediate and
irreparable
injury, in employment,
education, business,

17:20.039 --> 17:22.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
family relations and freedom to
travel.

17:22.074 --> 17:23.042 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do you respond to that?

17:23.075 --> 17:24.877 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

17:24.911 --> 17:26.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TED YOHO: You know, I think
those are talking
points that people are throwing
out there.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is going to be some
inconvenience.

17:28.147 --> 17:30.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But how inconvenient was 9/11?

17:30.449 --> 17:34.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How inconvenient were the
attacks in Belgium
and Brussels?

17:34.387 --> 17:40.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those were extreme consequences
that came
from not vetting people
properly.

17:40.359 --> 17:42.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't want to make that
mistake.

17:42.161 --> 17:45.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Would you rather make the
mistake and err
on the side of caution or wait
until something

17:45.398 --> 17:49.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happens and then answer to the
American people,
why you didn't vet these people
properly?

17:50.002 --> 17:53.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In the last Congress,
you were
on the House Foreign Affairs
Subcommittee

17:53.873 --> 17:55.641 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on Terrorism.

17:55.675 --> 17:58.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Are these countries, the
countries that are
specified in the executive
order, given your

17:58.878 --> 18:01.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
experience on that panel, are
these the countries
you would have chosen?

18:01.948 --> 18:03.149 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

18:03.182 --> 18:05.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TED YOHO: I think these are good
countries
to put on there.

18:05.418 --> 18:08.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You look at Syria, you look at
Somalia, you
look at these other ones, they
don't have

18:08.387 --> 18:13.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the infrastructure or the I.T.
to go back
and look at somebody's birth
record, their

18:13.392 --> 18:15.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
history, their work records.

18:15.594 --> 18:19.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You look at other countries, and
we hear,
well, Saudi Arabia is not on,
and that's where

18:19.131 --> 18:23.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the 9/11 terrorists came from,
or the majority
of them.

18:24.003 --> 18:26.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have sat down with Saudi
Arabia, the UAE.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In Egypt, they have good
technology.

18:28.841 --> 18:32.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have good I.T. systems
where we can do
these background checks.

18:32.178 --> 18:34.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In fact, they have beefed that
up since then.

18:34.747 --> 18:36.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so we feel comfortable with
there.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But look at Syria.

18:38.851 --> 18:42.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a nation ravaged with war
that they can't
go back and look at these
records, or Somalia.

18:42.888 --> 18:44.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can't go in there in a
country like that.

18:44.924 --> 18:49.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then you look at the people that
have infiltrated
the refugee programs.

18:49.261 --> 18:50.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know they're using fake
passports.

18:50.863 --> 18:55.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know countries that are
complicit making
fake passports.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so let's get this right.

18:57.370 --> 19:02.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's let people calm down and
make sure that
we go through the vetting
process, and then

19:02.608 --> 19:04.343 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we will get through this.

19:04.377 --> 19:10.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: If the courts were to
block this
for longer or even maybe strike
it down, is

19:10.416 --> 19:11.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there a congressional fix for
this?

19:12.018 --> 19:12.985 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

19:13.019 --> 19:13.986 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TED YOHO: Yes.

19:14.020 --> 19:15.755 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sure.

19:15.788 --> 19:16.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's going through and doing
legislation,
passing it in the House and the
Senate, and

19:16.789 --> 19:18.324 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the president will sign it.

19:18.357 --> 19:20.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And these are things that will
be stimulated.

19:20.126 --> 19:24.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a catalyst that tells us
that we should
go ahead and get these processes
done.

19:24.363 --> 19:25.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, yes, for sure.

19:25.664 --> 19:30.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And let me ask you
about President
Trump's tweets.

19:30.302 --> 19:34.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know you were elected as a
member of the
Tea Party.

19:34.340 --> 19:37.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You believe in the Constitution
and the three
branches of government.

19:37.843 --> 19:38.811 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TED YOHO: Absolutely.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What do you think of
him saying
-- calling this judge a
so-called judge and

19:42.748 --> 19:44.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saying, if something happens,
blame him?

19:45.017 --> 19:46.952 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

19:46.986 --> 19:50.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TED YOHO: Well, you know, Mr.
Trump has his
own style, his own technique,
his own uniqueness.

19:50.456 --> 19:54.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not something I probably
would have done,
but, again, that's the way he
has evolved

19:55.027 --> 19:56.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to this point in his life.

19:56.395 --> 19:57.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's worked well for him.

19:57.596 --> 20:01.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I expect you're going to see
more of that.

20:01.767 --> 20:05.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a minor thing compared to
what he's
trying to do.

20:05.271 --> 20:08.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's putting national security
in front, where
it needs to be.

20:08.941 --> 20:14.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have had such a lapsed
process over
the last probably 15 years, that
it's time

20:14.447 --> 20:17.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that somebody stands up and does
that.

20:17.149 --> 20:22.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you do that, when you
have the leadership
and the strength to do that,
people get upset.

20:22.621 --> 20:26.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it just takes somebody
willing to stand
up and take the arrows for that.

20:26.425 --> 20:27.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And, again, it's a pause.

20:28.027 --> 20:29.228 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's not a ban.

20:29.261 --> 20:31.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, also, let me
ask, finally.

20:31.564 --> 20:37.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You were very critical of
President Obama
for his executive orders, for
going around

20:37.470 --> 20:38.437 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Congress.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.438 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

20:39.472 --> 20:40.439 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TED YOHO: Sure.

20:40.473 --> 20:41.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: How is this
different?

20:41.474 --> 20:42.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why is this case different, in
your mind?

20:42.475 --> 20:43.876 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TED YOHO: I think the big thing
is, this centers
on national security.

20:45.678 --> 20:50.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you look at what President
Obama did
with the executive order
November 20 of 2014,

20:50.382 --> 20:55.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was giving a blanket amnesty
to five million
people that came into this
country illegally.

20:55.488 --> 20:58.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Again, you can't vet that many
people properly.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you can't use a blanket
order for that.

21:00.893 --> 21:06.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's not discretionary review
of those type
of individuals.

21:06.265 --> 21:10.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump, on the other
side, is standing
up on the -- erring on the side
of caution

21:10.903 --> 21:16.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on a national security basis
that I think
we all should applaud, that
we're putting

21:16.575 --> 21:22.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the country first and the
Constitution of
protecting and preserving our
freedoms here.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, that's where I see a
difference.

21:24.617 --> 21:30.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And if you look at what
President Obama did,
right before he got out, he
removed wet foot-dry

21:30.089 --> 21:32.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
foot on our Cuban Adjustment
Act.

21:32.791 --> 21:37.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And nobody said a word about
that, but yet
he did the same thing, and I
applaud him for

21:37.496 --> 21:38.731 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
doing that.

21:38.764 --> 21:41.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Representative Ted
Yoho, thanks
for joining us.

21:41.800 --> 21:42.768 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

21:42.801 --> 21:46.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TED YOHO: Yes, sir.

21:46.672 --> 21:50.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Have a good evening.

21:50.576 --> 21:54.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Thank you.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Stay with us.

21:57.149 --> 22:02.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
elusive Obamacare
promise of better treatment at
lower costs;

22:02.354 --> 22:08.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plus, a stunning Super Bowl
comeback for the
ages from the New England
Patriots and Tom

22:08.093 --> 22:09.862 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Brady.

22:09.895 --> 22:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: a look at what we
know about the
inner workings of the Trump
White House and

22:14.366 --> 22:17.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the at times chaotic rollout of
executive
actions.

22:17.937 --> 22:24.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have our Politics Monday team
of Tamara
Keith of NPR and Amy Walter of
The Cook Political

22:24.043 --> 22:25.844 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Report.

22:25.878 --> 22:28.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, tonight, we're also joined
by Glenn Thrush,
the White House correspondent
for The New

22:28.214 --> 22:29.315 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
York Times.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.650 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Glenn, let me start with you.

22:31.684 --> 22:35.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have a not only -- because
you're the
only one of us, I think, who has
been immortalized

22:35.921 --> 22:37.156 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on "Saturday Night Live."

22:37.189 --> 22:38.958 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

22:38.991 --> 22:41.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: So, you had a story
this morning
in The New York Times that had
all sorts of

22:41.493 --> 22:45.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interesting details on the inner
workings
of the Trump White House.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What struck you as you were
reporting that
story?

22:47.967 --> 22:51.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GLENN THRUSH, The New York
Times: Well, what
struck me is -- and I will use
this metaphor

22:52.004 --> 22:56.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- is that the Trump White
House, this very
small crew of ideologues and
operatives who

22:56.842 --> 23:03.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are loyal to the president, have
begun carpet-bombing
the world with these executive
orders, insults

23:03.949 --> 23:08.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and taunts hurled at leaders
around the world,
while they are still essentially
building

23:08.587 --> 23:10.322 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the plane.

23:10.356 --> 23:15.060 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The point is, there is a
tremendous amount
of audacity and a lot of
boldness coming out

23:15.094 --> 23:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Stephen Bannon, who is the
president's
chief strategist, who is the
brain behind

23:21.233 --> 23:26.705 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
what is essentially 250
executive orders that
have been at least looked at,
dozens and dozens

23:26.739 --> 23:34.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which are likely to be unveiled
over the next
12 months, while the president
is figuring

23:34.613 --> 23:39.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out how to operate the basic
levers of power
in Washington, D.C.

23:39.551 --> 23:43.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my partner and I, Maggie
Haberman, point
out just how fundamental that
is.

23:43.589 --> 23:47.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When we say operate the levers
of power, we
mean that literally.

23:47.359 --> 23:50.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are staffers in the West
Wing of the
White House who don't know how
to operate

23:50.796 --> 23:52.564 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the lights yet.

23:52.598 --> 23:57.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Tam, you have done a
little reporting
on this in terms of the
historical record.

23:57.803 --> 24:03.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How unusual is this for an
outsider from Washington
coming into the White House like
this to have

24:03.876 --> 24:07.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this sort of -- it's been
described as chaos
and disorganization?

24:07.179 --> 24:09.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Well,
you don't have to go back too
far, because

24:09.915 --> 24:14.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there was an outsider who came
in, in 1993
from Arkansas, brought a bunch
of people from

24:14.887 --> 24:21.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Arkansas in, and thought that
they didn't
need the people who were experts
and who had

24:21.327 --> 24:23.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
done it all before.

24:23.295 --> 24:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was pretty problematic
for about the
first year-and-a-half of the
Clinton administration,

24:27.366 --> 24:33.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where they had a lot of trouble
getting their
nominees through and similar
hiccups.

24:33.939 --> 24:36.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, there is a model for it.

24:36.675 --> 24:39.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And about a year-and-a-half into
the Clinton
administration, there was sort
of a staff

24:39.445 --> 24:43.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shakeup and they brought in
somebody with
some more Washington experience,
Leon Panetta,

24:43.949 --> 24:45.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be chief of staff.

24:45.184 --> 24:47.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Amy, could this be by
design?

24:47.052 --> 24:52.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Well,
listen, we saw that Donald Trump
as a candidate,

24:52.124 --> 24:57.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump as a businessman,
his management
style is chaos and conflict, and
it won him

24:57.663 --> 25:00.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the nomination, and it won him
the White House.

25:00.332 --> 25:03.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's been successful in his
business dealings
with this.

25:03.369 --> 25:06.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So why not use it at the White
House, right?

25:06.338 --> 25:09.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The question is, how long can
you keep going
like this?

25:09.608 --> 25:14.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know a lot of folks come to
Washington saying,
I'm just going to run Washington
like you

25:14.713 --> 25:15.647 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
run a business.

25:15.681 --> 25:16.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Well, Washington isn't a
business.

25:16.915 --> 25:18.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Running the government isn't
like running
a business.

25:18.751 --> 25:20.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is big and complicated.

25:20.719 --> 25:24.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for the first time in his
life, he's got
a whole bunch of people that not
only answer

25:24.823 --> 25:28.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to him, but who he has to answer
to, namely
the two other branches of
government that

25:28.627 --> 25:29.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he's learning right now.

25:29.928 --> 25:31.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, will this continue to
happen?

25:31.897 --> 25:33.298 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Maybe.

25:33.332 --> 25:36.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I talked to some folks who say,
you're not
likely to see him change.

25:36.602 --> 25:40.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the same time, you saw
during the
course of the campaign he would
make course

25:40.806 --> 25:42.741 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
corrections.

25:42.775 --> 25:46.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remember, he went through two
campaign managers
after -- and then finally
landing on Kellyanne

25:46.145 --> 25:47.913 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Conway.

25:47.946 --> 25:51.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he could make some changes
when he sees
that the outside pressure is
coming, whether

25:51.450 --> 25:56.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's in stories like the one
that Glenn had
this morning or other
frustrations that he's

25:56.555 --> 25:58.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
feeling personally.

25:58.457 --> 26:01.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Glenn, you talked
about them trying
to figure out how to turn the
lights on, but

26:01.193 --> 26:04.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also in some of the offices
they're trying
to turn the lights on, there
aren't -- there

26:04.830 --> 26:06.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is no one in there anyway,
right?

26:06.131 --> 26:09.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GLENN THRUSH: Well, I think, you
know, they
put forth figures.

26:09.234 --> 26:14.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The chief of staff, Reince
Priebus, says that
they're meeting their staffing
expectations

26:14.973 --> 26:17.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
comparable to what President
Obama had eight
years ago.

26:17.643 --> 26:22.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The truth of the matter is,
though -- and
I should say we spoke with 40 to
50 people

26:22.648 --> 26:25.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for this story over the course
of the last
two weeks.

26:25.317 --> 26:28.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The problem isn't getting names
on a list.

26:28.253 --> 26:34.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The problem is that the
president of the United
States only likes six to eight
people in his

26:34.259 --> 26:36.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
orbit at any given time.

26:36.228 --> 26:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The most telling image -- and
this is a president,
remember, who's very visual --
is around the

26:41.433 --> 26:46.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Resolute desk in the office, you
have four
hardback chairs arranged.

26:46.338 --> 26:51.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's about the number of
people who have
influence on him on any given
day.

26:51.076 --> 26:55.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what a lot of people said to
us was, we
have tried to bring in new
people, but we're

26:55.547 --> 27:00.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
afraid, if they underperform or
if the president
doesn't like him, he will take
it out on us,

27:00.752 --> 27:03.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and we will lose our seats in
one of those
four chairs.

27:03.889 --> 27:10.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this management style that
worked very
well in Trump Tower, the
question is, as Tamara

27:10.529 --> 27:15.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
put it, is, will he be able to
adjust his
management style which worked in
business

27:15.267 --> 27:19.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and branding to a much more
complicated job,
probably the most complicated
job on the planet?

27:20.005 --> 27:23.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Glenn, we should
point out that
the president, continuing his
love affair

27:24.009 --> 27:26.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with your publication, tweeted
out this morning.

27:26.845 --> 27:30.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said: "The failing New York
Times writes
total fiction concerning me.

27:30.883 --> 27:35.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have gotten it wrong for
two years and
now are making up stories and
sources."

27:35.454 --> 27:40.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Air Force One on the way back
from Florida,
Sean Spicer, the press
secretary, called it

27:40.158 --> 27:43.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
literally the epitome of fake
news.

27:43.061 --> 27:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know if you want to
respond to that
or not, but that's what they're
saying about

27:48.367 --> 27:50.002 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your reporting.

27:50.035 --> 27:53.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GLENN THRUSH: Our reporting, I
think, is substantial,
and solid and well-sourced.

27:53.338 --> 27:59.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And every detail in -- major
detail in that
story was run by officials in
the Trump White

27:59.711 --> 28:01.446 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
House before it was published.

28:01.480 --> 28:06.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Tamara, you have also
looked at
the record on getting Cabinet
nominees in

28:06.485 --> 28:08.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
place and also the sub-Cabinet
officials.

28:08.987 --> 28:10.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Right.

28:10.656 --> 28:16.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there are about 700
important positions
that require Senate
confirmation.

28:16.128 --> 28:21.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At this point, the Trump
administration has
named about 35 people of those
700.

28:21.867 --> 28:26.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, many administrations take a
while to
name some of the sub-Cabinet,
but, at this

28:26.672 --> 28:31.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point -- in part, this is
because of the Senate
and Senate Democrats, and, in
part, it's because

28:31.777 --> 28:36.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the types of nominees that
were picked
and because of the fact that
they weren't

28:36.915 --> 28:39.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pre-vetted by the Office of
Government Ethics
before their names were
announced.

28:39.851 --> 28:46.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in terms of the Cabinet,
Donald Trump
has the fewest Cabinet members
confirmed of

28:46.725 --> 28:48.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anyone going back to World War
II.

28:48.894 --> 28:52.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's no precedent for a
president this
far in having so few people.

28:52.965 --> 28:57.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As one person I talked to said,
you're going
into the Super Bowl and you
don't have the

28:57.869 --> 28:59.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
team on the field.

28:59.605 --> 29:05.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And, remember, too,
nobody thought
he was going to win, OK,
including people

29:05.577 --> 29:07.279 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the campaign.

29:07.312 --> 29:11.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was talking to -- I'm sure all
of us were
talking to people within Clinton
orbit who

29:11.416 --> 29:16.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were coming into town looking
for houses from
around the country, thinking,
well, I'm certainly

29:16.622 --> 29:19.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to get a job in the
administration,
I have been promised a job in
the administration.

29:19.057 --> 29:20.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That was all set to go.

29:20.058 --> 29:21.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I think that's a big piece
of it.

29:21.860 --> 29:26.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as Tamara pointed out, too,
he's got people,
at least at the Cabinet level,
lined up.

29:26.565 --> 29:30.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Getting them through the
process, which we're
now having another night where
we're going

29:30.636 --> 29:34.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have an all-nighter on the
Senate with
Democrats trying desperately to
block Betsy

29:34.840 --> 29:38.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DeVos, hoping for one more
Republican vote
to sink her nomination.

29:38.176 --> 29:43.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And there are
three Cabinet-level
nominees who have not completed
their ethics

29:43.982 --> 29:45.884 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
process still.

29:45.917 --> 29:49.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, although the Trump
administration complains,
and somewhat rightfully, that
they don't have

29:49.454 --> 29:53.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enough people on hand, even
though they have
named them, there are three
people who haven't

29:53.825 --> 29:57.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
completed that basic process
that, in the
past, would have been done
before they were

29:57.596 --> 29:59.264 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
even named.

29:59.297 --> 30:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And over the weekend,
we had a
secretary of the Army designee
draw because

30:02.134 --> 30:05.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of troubles with untangling from
ethics issues.

30:05.070 --> 30:06.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

30:06.171 --> 30:07.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Right.

30:07.839 --> 30:13.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Amy Walter, Tamara
Keith, Glenn
Thrush, thanks for being with
us.

30:13.912 --> 30:18.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Of course.

30:18.917 --> 30:23.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

30:23.889 --> 30:31.329 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GLENN THRUSH: Great to be here.

30:31.363 --> 30:37.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Most of the focus on
the Affordable
Care Act has been on coverage.

30:37.502 --> 30:41.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But among the goals of the
2,000-page law
is to develop something called
Accountable

30:41.807 --> 30:43.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Care Organizations.

30:43.709 --> 30:46.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They offer doctors and hospitals
a deal.

30:46.278 --> 30:51.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In exchange for better and more
efficient
care for Medicare recipients,
the providers

30:51.149 --> 30:53.552 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
get a share of the savings.

30:53.585 --> 30:56.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Special correspondent Jackie
Judd reports.

30:56.221 --> 31:04.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Creating health
care for the
future sometimes means going
back to the past.

31:04.196 --> 31:10.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nurse practitioner Dana Sheer
makes old-fashioned
house calls to high-risk
patients, like Howard

31:10.702 --> 31:13.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VanVleck, who suffers from a
neurological
disorder.

31:13.772 --> 31:16.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On this day, a cough alarmed his
wife.

31:16.641 --> 31:19.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA VANVLECK, Wife of Howard:
When I called
the doctor's office about it,
they said, can

31:19.211 --> 31:20.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you bring him in?

31:20.212 --> 31:22.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I said, really not.

31:22.080 --> 31:28.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: This visit was
low-tech and quick,
but, if needed, VanVleck can get
an in-home

31:28.720 --> 31:32.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ultrasound, an EKG, even a chest
X-ray.

31:32.190 --> 31:35.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANA SHEER, Nurse Practitioner:
Our program
is really aimed at trying to
figure out ways

31:35.527 --> 31:43.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we can provide really good,
cost-effective,
quality care at a patient's
home, at a place

31:43.201 --> 31:45.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where they can actually thrive
and do better.

31:45.403 --> 31:50.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: How many times
during that year
would he have been in the
hospital if you

31:50.308 --> 31:51.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or a colleague hadn't visited?

31:51.943 --> 31:53.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DANA SHEER: Likely every time.

31:53.779 --> 31:59.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Sheer is part of
the Accountable
Care Organization, or ACO, run
by Partners

31:59.885 --> 32:04.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HealthCare, which collaborates
with several
Massachusetts hospitals.

32:04.256 --> 32:09.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At Mass General, Jason Wasfy
does the once
unthinkable for a cardiologist.

32:09.594 --> 32:11.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He routinely e-mails or
video-chats with patients.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.832 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

32:13.865 --> 32:16.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JASON WASFY, Massachusetts
General Hospital:
There are cases, high
cholesterol, for example,

32:16.735 --> 32:19.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where I don't Actually need to
actually physically
examine the patient.

32:20.005 --> 32:25.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Medicare is not
going to reimburse
Partners for the home visit or
the teleconference.

32:25.243 --> 32:30.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are not covered services,
so why invest
in these programs?

32:30.949 --> 32:37.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because, if they lead to lower
costs to the
government and better care,
Partners may earn

32:37.722 --> 32:39.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
end-of-year bonuses from
Medicare.

32:39.524 --> 32:41.159 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

32:41.193 --> 32:42.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIMOTHY FERRIS, ®MDNM /Manager,
Partners
HealthCare: How are you doing
today?

32:42.527 --> 32:44.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Primary care
physician Tim Ferris
manages the ACO.

32:44.596 --> 32:46.431 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

32:46.464 --> 32:49.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIMOTHY FERRIS: It allows us
essentially to
customize the delivery of
services to specific

32:49.968 --> 32:56.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
needs and not base how we are
delivering that
service on exactly what is paid
for in a fee-for-service

32:56.975 --> 32:58.810 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
system.

32:58.844 --> 33:03.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: An early concern
about ACOs was,
would doctors skimp on care in
order to save

33:03.982 --> 33:04.950 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
money?

33:04.983 --> 33:07.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So far, there is no evidence of
that happening.

33:07.252 --> 33:09.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: This is triggering her
anxiety again.

33:09.521 --> 33:15.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: At Partners, it has
created 26
new programs since launching its
organization,

33:15.760 --> 33:21.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everything from integrating
mental health
services with primary care to
offering diabetes

33:21.299 --> 33:22.634 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
classes.

33:22.667 --> 33:24.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I think we will start with
the data on
the front page here.

33:24.669 --> 33:30.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Teams of primary
care physicians,
nurses and psychologists meet
weekly to coordinate

33:30.876 --> 33:31.843 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
care.

33:31.877 --> 33:32.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: We have to do better.

33:32.878 --> 33:34.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, 81 percent is good,
but...

33:34.679 --> 33:35.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: It's not good enough.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: It's not good enough.

33:37.883 --> 33:41.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Without much
fanfare, Accountable
Care Organizations have become
embedded in

33:41.186 --> 33:42.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the health care system.

33:43.021 --> 33:47.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
While the government
jump-started the movement,
private insurers are also
involved.

33:47.692 --> 33:52.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2012, eight million Americans
got their
care through an ACO.

33:52.497 --> 33:55.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Today, that number is 31
million.

33:55.634 --> 33:58.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's 10 percent of the
population.

33:58.303 --> 34:03.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The new administration has not
weighed in
on the fate of government-run
ACOs.

34:03.441 --> 34:05.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Many experts believe they will
remain in place.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.712 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

34:07.746 --> 34:14.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIMOTHY FERRIS: We are committed
to this journey,
regardless of what happens, that
we have built

34:14.319 --> 34:18.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sufficient confidence that this
is the right
thing to do for our patients.

34:18.890 --> 34:25.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Partners is a major
player among
the nearly 900 ACOs across the
country.

34:25.497 --> 34:31.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And its size helps cushion the
costs of ramping
up and maintaining its
organization.

34:31.403 --> 34:34.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dr. Peter Slavin runs mass
general.

34:34.039 --> 34:35.840 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

34:35.874 --> 34:37.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PETER SLAVIN, President,
Massachusetts General
Hospital: Where we stand to gain
financially

34:37.709 --> 34:41.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is, we have now freed up
capacity within the
hospital that the ACO patients
used to utilize,

34:41.212 --> 34:48.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and we can use that capacity to
serve patients
from other networks, from other
parts of the

34:48.086 --> 34:49.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country, from other parts of the
world.

34:49.587 --> 34:51.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Patients who would
be paying
more for your services?

34:51.656 --> 34:52.991 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

34:53.024 --> 34:54.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER SLAVIN: Patients who would
be paying
more for our services.

34:54.326 --> 34:55.293 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That is correct.

34:55.327 --> 34:58.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JACKIE JUDD: So, what is
Partners' track record?

34:58.163 --> 34:59.331 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Mixed.

34:59.364 --> 35:03.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most quality measures have
improved to varying
degrees.

35:03.101 --> 35:07.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hospital admissions dropped last
year by 6
percent over the previous year.

35:07.872 --> 35:10.742 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The way care is delivered has
been transformed.

35:10.775 --> 35:15.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cost, though, is stuck in
neutral.

35:15.747 --> 35:19.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Partners earned bonuses two
times by spending
less than expected.

35:19.951 --> 35:25.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the other two years, it
didn't qualify
for bonuses and it had to absorb
the expenses

35:25.890 --> 35:29.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of those unreimbursed services.

35:29.294 --> 35:32.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Partners' record mirrors the
national trend
in ACOs.

35:32.664 --> 35:36.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The result is Medicare has saved
only a modest
amount of money.

35:36.434 --> 35:42.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ashish Jha, a doctor and health
policy researcher
at Harvard, was an early
supporter of ACOs

35:42.674 --> 35:44.743 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and he still is.

35:44.776 --> 35:50.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he also is questioning
whether early expectations
for dramatic cost savings and
quality improvements

35:50.515 --> 35:52.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will ever be met.

35:52.350 --> 35:55.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ASHISH JHA, Harvard School of
Public Health:
I guess I thought by sort of
year four, year

35:55.453 --> 35:59.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
five, we would have started
seeing real gains,
kind of nationally.

35:59.157 --> 36:03.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, you would expect
some organizations
to fail, you would expect some
organizations

36:03.161 --> 36:05.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not to do a good job.

36:05.196 --> 36:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I -- maybe I was just being
unrealistic.

36:08.566 --> 36:15.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when I heard the ACO experts
talking five
years ago, I heard points of,
within a couple

36:15.106 --> 36:16.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of years, we're going to start
seeing real
movement.

36:16.908 --> 36:18.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that hasn't happened.

36:18.843 --> 36:24.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Ferris counters
that altering
a complex culture, making big
up-front investments

36:24.549 --> 36:28.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and reorganizing care take time
and certainly
more than four or five years.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.155 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIMOTHY FERRIS: You have to
commit to the
long haul here.

36:32.223 --> 36:38.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we thought, initially, that
we would be
able to make big changes
quickly.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's quite clear that that's
not true.

36:40.498 --> 36:46.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: According to
government analyses,
primary care ACOs are showing
more success

36:46.538 --> 36:48.807 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than the large health systems.

36:48.840 --> 36:53.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coastal Medical in Rhode Island
has 85 primary
care doctors.

36:53.244 --> 37:01.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Since 2012, it has saved
Medicare $24 million
and earned almost half back in
bonuses.

37:01.753 --> 37:08.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CEO, Dr. Alan Kurose, says not
being linked
to a hospital makes a
difference.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.462 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

37:10.495 --> 37:13.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN KUROSE, CEO, Coastal
Medical: There will
be less demand for inpatient
hospital services

37:13.832 --> 37:18.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if we really do coordinated
care, patient-centered
care well.

37:18.736 --> 37:21.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so that hits the bottom line
of a hospital.

37:21.306 --> 37:23.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: We're going to start by
just checking
your oxygen level.

37:24.008 --> 37:28.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Coastal medical
keeps clinics
open every day of the year, and
some have

37:28.079 --> 37:29.047 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
late hours.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: How is everything going?

37:30.882 --> 37:34.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: The practice hired
more support
staff, including pharmacists,
physician's

37:34.719 --> 37:40.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
assistants and nurse
practitioners, because
of the time given to the sickest
patients.

37:40.291 --> 37:43.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ABBE SHUSTER, Nurse Care
Manager: We have
one patient, I call him every
morning just

37:43.361 --> 37:46.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to make sure he is up for the
day.

37:46.064 --> 37:51.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I check on how his pain level,
if he's taken
any of his pain meds yet, has
something in

37:51.336 --> 37:53.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his stomach for the day.

37:53.371 --> 37:57.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have found, by doing
that, that he's
been able to stay in his home
and continue

37:57.809 --> 37:59.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to get his at-home nursing
services.

38:00.011 --> 38:05.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Ironically, many
patients are
not even aware of being part of
an Accountable

38:05.683 --> 38:07.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Care Organization.

38:07.152 --> 38:11.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They just know different
services are available.

38:11.723 --> 38:14.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Brenda Fougera has chronic
medical problems.

38:14.192 --> 38:18.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRENDA FOUGERA, Patient: If I
need a same-day
appointment because I have a
cold, because,

38:18.863 --> 38:20.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with me, with my lungs, they
aren't good.

38:20.899 --> 38:26.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Dr. Hubbard would start me
on certain
things where I didn't end up in
the hospital

38:26.404 --> 38:28.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or end up with pneumonia.

38:28.239 --> 38:33.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Even with its early
success,
Coastal Medical and other ACOs
are still searching

38:33.211 --> 38:38.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for that elusive formula of
better care at
a lower cost.

38:38.183 --> 38:39.884 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

38:39.918 --> 38:45.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN KUROSE: Our experience is
that there
are a lot of smaller buckets of
costs, and

38:45.190 --> 38:48.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you have to work on a lot of
them.

38:48.259 --> 38:49.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you don't need one clinical
initiative.

38:50.028 --> 38:52.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You need a portfolio of clinical
initiatives.

38:52.330 --> 38:58.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Whatever the fate
of Obamacare,
this experiment likely will be
given several

38:58.036 --> 39:05.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more years to prove whether
personalized,
coordinated care really does in
the end save

39:05.210 --> 39:06.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
large amounts of money.

39:06.778 --> 39:16.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Jackie Judd
in Boston.

39:16.654 --> 39:27.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: More than 110 million
viewers tuned
into the Super Bowl last night.

39:27.165 --> 39:32.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a good percentage of them
may have started
tuning out because the game
looked like a

39:32.070 --> 39:33.204 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
blowout.

39:33.238 --> 39:37.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But those who looked away missed
an amazing
comeback.

39:37.075 --> 39:38.409 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our story.

39:38.443 --> 39:40.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, I stayed
with it to the
end.

39:40.311 --> 39:41.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I'm glad I did!

39:41.312 --> 39:43.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And so did Mike Pesca.

39:43.214 --> 39:47.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a sports reporter and the
host of Slate's
daily news and discussion
podcast "The Gist."

39:47.518 --> 39:52.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mike, I watched Patriots players
afterwards,
and they were saying, we never
thought it

39:52.123 --> 39:54.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was over, we always thought we
had a chance.

39:54.359 --> 39:55.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm not sure I believed them.

39:55.693 --> 39:56.661 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Did you?

39:56.694 --> 39:58.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MIKE PESCA, Slate: Yes.

39:58.062 --> 39:59.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Athletes, that's the mind-set.

39:59.697 --> 40:01.499 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the great ones have it.

40:01.532 --> 40:06.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the great ones who play
alongside Tom
Brady with his now five Super
Bowl rings know

40:06.704 --> 40:08.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that that has to be the
attitude.

40:08.673 --> 40:13.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I will have to say that,
going in, it
was the truth that, if Tom Brady
had a chance

40:13.378 --> 40:18.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to throw without being sacked,
without being
hit, without being hurt, we knew
that he could

40:18.082 --> 40:20.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a devastating against this
Falcons defense.

40:20.818 --> 40:24.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He didn't get that chance
through almost three
whole quarters.

40:24.656 --> 40:30.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, when he did get the
chance, the question
is, well, can he slice up this
team in such

40:30.295 --> 40:31.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a concentrated time period?

40:31.829 --> 40:33.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that was the amazing thing.

40:33.398 --> 40:36.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's not that Tom Brady
orchestrated fourth-quarter
comebacks.

40:36.134 --> 40:38.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He has done that six times.

40:38.269 --> 40:43.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's that he orchestrated this
25-point comeback
with -- really just starting
with only minutes

40:43.708 --> 40:44.809 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to go in the third quarter.

40:44.842 --> 40:45.810 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Amazing.

40:45.843 --> 40:47.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

40:47.612 --> 40:51.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I imagine the background to all
this, the
two years of Deflategate and
Brady suspended

40:51.316 --> 40:53.251 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for four games this season.

40:53.284 --> 40:58.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Brady and coach
Belichick,
they said, oh, this stuff wasn't
on our mind.

40:58.222 --> 41:00.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Clearly on the mind of Robert
Kraft and others.

41:00.124 --> 41:03.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE PESCA: Well, it was on
Belichick and
Brady's mind, you could tell.

41:03.561 --> 41:05.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was on the minds of all the
fans.

41:05.330 --> 41:11.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I do think that that Goodell
ruling was
him being a little bit
imperious, imperial,

41:11.636 --> 41:13.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and making a very harsh ruling.

41:13.871 --> 41:18.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tom Brady was suspended for a
quarter of this
season, giving him an extra
incentive, a guy

41:18.409 --> 41:19.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who doesn't need that.

41:19.944 --> 41:23.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, the background with Kraft
and Goodell
is, Kraft is a big Goodell ally.

41:23.648 --> 41:28.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And before this got in the way
and soured
their relationship, Goodell
could always count

41:28.453 --> 41:33.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Kraft to, among things,
approve gigantic
salaries for Goodell.

41:33.057 --> 41:37.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I don't know if this makes
the Patriots
an underdog, especially given
the politics

41:37.762 --> 41:42.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the moment, but to their
fans, this made
this more than just yet another
victory and

41:42.767 --> 41:45.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the most amazing comeback during
NFL history.

41:45.470 --> 41:47.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It made it sweet revenge.

41:47.271 --> 41:51.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so when you
speak, when
you talk of most of all time, of
course, the

41:51.209 --> 41:57.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inevitable talk is greatest of
all time player
with Brady, coach with
Belichick, and dynasty

41:57.148 --> 41:58.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with the Patriots.

41:58.149 --> 41:59.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where do you come down?

41:59.484 --> 42:02.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE PESCA: I have never seen
Otto Graham
play a full game.

42:02.787 --> 42:04.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And most of the people weighing
in haven't
either.

42:04.756 --> 42:06.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he has an impeccable record.

42:06.924 --> 42:13.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then you have to factor in that
the rules
and the offenses of 2016-2017
are light years

42:13.064 --> 42:15.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ahead of what guys like Roger
Staubach did.

42:15.500 --> 42:20.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But no one could -- how could
you say he's
anything less than tied?

42:20.138 --> 42:25.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the Brady-Belichick
combination -- the
NFL chews up coaches.

42:26.010 --> 42:30.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think Bill Belichick is
one of the most
creative minds in any endeavor,
finding so

42:30.448 --> 42:33.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many different ways to win and
outthink the
opponent.

42:33.718 --> 42:38.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For whatever you think of his
countenance
and not smiling, and perhaps
wearing ill-fitting

42:38.923 --> 42:45.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hooded sweatshirts, that guy is
a brilliant
thinker, and he brings
creativity to the game,

42:45.196 --> 42:46.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which I, as a fan, appreciate.

42:46.731 --> 42:50.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Mike, just in our
last minute,
I want to ask you about Atlanta.

42:50.034 --> 42:54.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What an exciting and young team
they were
for about three quarters, and
then what a

42:54.605 --> 42:59.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
devastating loss for the team
and the city
that has hungered for such
things.

42:59.110 --> 43:00.077 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MIKE PESCA: Yes.

43:00.111 --> 43:01.078 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, two points.

43:01.112 --> 43:02.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were on the field for 93
plays.

43:02.980 --> 43:06.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No defense could possibly stick
with another
team.

43:06.250 --> 43:08.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We did think that they had a big
enough buffer.

43:08.352 --> 43:13.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the combination of the
number of plays
the Patriots had, which just
wore down the

43:13.491 --> 43:18.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
defense, and the fact that,
let's be honest,
Atlanta made some terrible
mistakes, including

43:18.196 --> 43:22.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taking some key sacks and not
kicking a field
goal which would have made it a
three-score

43:22.099 --> 43:24.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
game with four minutes and
change left.

43:24.869 --> 43:27.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They will be ruing this for a
long time.

43:27.371 --> 43:31.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And their one Braves
championship back in
the '90s, I don't think will be
enough to

43:31.342 --> 43:33.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sustain this city for much
longer.

43:33.277 --> 43:36.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Mike Pesca, thank
you very
much.

43:36.781 --> 43:43.688 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIKE PESCA: You're welcome.

43:43.721 --> 43:49.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Now to our latest
"ScienceScope"
episode.

43:49.360 --> 43:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A third of the planet's coral
reef ecosystems
are at risk of being damaged by
warming sea

43:55.299 --> 44:01.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
temperatures and the subsequent
coral bleaching,
but can these creatures adapt
and survive?

44:01.906 --> 44:06.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"NewsHour"'s science producer
Nsikan Akpan
and producer Matt Ehrichs take
us on a voyage

44:06.978 --> 44:11.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deep into the Atlantic Ocean,
looking for
answers.

44:17.588 --> 44:18.589 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
coast.

44:18.623 --> 44:22.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This thing is smaller than a
Volkswagen Beetle.

44:22.860 --> 44:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As six-foot swells toss our tiny
submersible,
I think, this was a terrible
idea.

44:28.499 --> 44:33.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then, suddenly, the pod tips
forward.

44:33.204 --> 44:34.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The descent begins.

44:34.939 --> 44:39.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The rocking slowly stops, as the
ocean swallows
us.

44:39.877 --> 44:42.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
All that's left is peace.

44:42.213 --> 44:43.180 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No more e-mails.

44:43.214 --> 44:44.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No claustrophobia.

44:44.615 --> 44:53.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just the whole ocean spread in
front of us
and a scientific quest.

44:53.824 --> 45:00.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"ScienceScope" visited Bermuda
to travel hundreds
of feet underwater with the
privately funded

45:00.565 --> 45:05.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nekton mission and to see the
threats harming
more than a third of the
planet's coral reefs,

45:05.803 --> 45:08.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because some coral may adapt by
going deeper.

45:08.873 --> 45:16.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Nekton is a brand-new
project aimed at
exploring and documenting life
in the deep

45:16.581 --> 45:25.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ocean, but also showing the
public what lives
in the deep ocean, and what it
does for humankind,

45:25.056 --> 45:29.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and also what impacts humans are
having on
the deep sea.

45:29.860 --> 45:34.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: The project plans
to measure
biodiversity and ocean chemistry
at three

45:34.332 --> 45:36.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sites in the Atlantic.

45:36.367 --> 45:42.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The team uses a variety of
tools, among them,
two Triton submersibles called
Nemo and Nomad.

45:42.239 --> 45:47.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're the same type used by
filmmaker and
ocean explorer James Cameron.

45:47.211 --> 45:52.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Capable of diving 1,000 feet,
these minisubs
are equipped with the latest
filming and scientific

45:52.583 --> 45:53.951 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
equipment.

45:53.985 --> 45:57.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will document the vast,
unchartered void
that is the deep sea.

45:57.421 --> 46:08.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Well, at present, about
.0001 percent
of the deep sea has been
explored by scientists

46:08.366 --> 46:09.767 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like myself.

46:09.800 --> 46:17.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our goal is to set up a standard
protocol
for investigating the deep sea.

46:17.141 --> 46:22.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Over the course of
four hours,
we glide across huge portions of
the seafloor.

46:22.747 --> 46:24.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is called a transect.

46:24.348 --> 46:28.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The scientists videotape and
ultimately identify
as many species as possible.

46:28.586 --> 46:32.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: On the limestone, we have
coral garden
habitat.

46:32.957 --> 46:35.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The bright white corals are
hydrocorals.

46:35.660 --> 46:43.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The yellow corals are
gorgonians, and the
wire corals are black corals.

46:43.300 --> 46:48.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Oodles of fish
dart back and
forth in this abyss, while moray
eels stick

46:48.939 --> 46:51.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out their neon green necks from
the sea bed.

46:51.809 --> 46:57.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the team can identify
species even when
they're not physically around
using environmental

46:57.248 --> 46:59.083 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DNA.

46:59.116 --> 47:05.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: So, you can imagine if you
put your hand
in a big glass of water, and a
few cells fall

47:05.056 --> 47:10.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off your hand with your DNA on
them, then
we would be able to take that
water and sequence

47:10.695 --> 47:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it, and find out that you have
been there,
and you have put your hand in
the water.

47:16.067 --> 47:19.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: The scientists
collect water
samples to do the same with
ocean critters,

47:19.904 --> 47:23.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which shed cells with DNA in
many forms, scales,
shells.

47:23.441 --> 47:25.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Poop as well.

47:25.176 --> 47:26.143 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:26.177 --> 47:28.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Poop is a great source of
DNA.

47:28.746 --> 47:33.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Closer to the
surface, Nekton
conducts similar surveys by
relying on research

47:33.918 --> 47:38.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
divers from Project Baseline, a
global citizen
science initiative.

47:38.823 --> 47:43.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
These divers film the
biodiversity, but also
collect physical specimens for
researchers

47:43.360 --> 47:46.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like Gretchen Goodbody-Gringley.

47:46.163 --> 47:52.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She studies how corals migrate
from shallow
water into the deeper, darker
mesophotic zone.

47:52.303 --> 47:57.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Located 131 to more than 500
feet underwater,
this deeper region may one day
serve as a

47:57.908 --> 48:01.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
refuge for corals affected by
bleaching and
other threats.

48:01.045 --> 48:03.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRETCHEN GOODBODY-GRINGLEY, Reef
Ecologist:
Many of the anthropogenic or
human-caused

48:04.014 --> 48:10.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
threats that are impacting
shallow water coral
reefs, such as increases in
seawater temperature,

48:10.588 --> 48:15.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
increases in pollution,
sedimentation and
runoff from the land, these all
impact the

48:15.926 --> 48:20.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shallow water reef more than
they are impacting
the mesophotic reef.

48:20.197 --> 48:25.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Warming waters
cause coral bleaching,
as seen here with mushroom
coral.

48:25.436 --> 48:31.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The coral expels its colorful,
symbiotic algae,
which have become toxic due to
the heat.

48:31.609 --> 48:35.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This coral also expands to 340
percent of
its size.

48:35.379 --> 48:39.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
If this event occurs too
frequently, the coral
won't only bleach.

48:39.416 --> 48:41.185 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It'll die.

48:41.218 --> 48:45.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All corals start as little
larvae that get
swept around by currents before
attaching

48:45.623 --> 48:47.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a single spot.

48:47.491 --> 48:51.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Gringley, Rogers (ph) and
the Nekton team
use these underwater surveys and
environmental

48:51.829 --> 48:57.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DNA to see which shallow water
corals can
also live in the mesophotic zone
and maybe

48:57.668 --> 48:59.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one day use this deeper ocean as
a hideout.

48:59.904 --> 49:03.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRETCHEN GOODBODY-GRINGLEY: So
if you have
high levels of genetic diversity
across geographic

49:03.707 --> 49:08.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
range or across depth range,
this would be
indicative of mixing, and so the
larvae are

49:08.913 --> 49:11.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in fact migrating between zones.

49:11.182 --> 49:15.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: So, from these
teeny-tiny samples,
her team can unlock how
generations of corals

49:15.986 --> 49:17.488 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have migrated.

49:17.521 --> 49:21.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The results will clear up which
coral species
can migrate and which can't.

49:21.492 --> 49:25.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Conservation scientists in the
future can
use this information to best
protect these

49:25.496 --> 49:29.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
critical critters, maybe by
preserving them
in aquariums or [[physically
transplanting

49:29.967 --> 49:32.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them from shallow water to the
mesophotic
zone.

49:32.603 --> 49:37.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: The deep ocean is the most
critical frontier
for humanity, and is also the
least known.

49:37.107 --> 49:41.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The deep ocean is our beating
heart, and if
you didn't know how healthy your
heart was,

49:41.212 --> 49:42.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wouldn't you want to know?

49:42.947 --> 49:45.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Until next time,
I'm Nsikan
Akpan, and this is
"ScienceScope" from the

49:45.916 --> 49:47.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
"PBS NewsHour."

49:47.785 --> 49:53.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Online, you can watch
additional
episodes of "ScienceScope" and
get five important

49:53.290 --> 49:55.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
news stories you might have
missed last week.

49:55.793 --> 49:59.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

49:59.797 --> 50:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A news update before we go.

50:02.600 --> 50:07.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Late today, the Justice
Department filed its
brief with a federal appeals
court defending

50:07.171 --> 50:10.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
President Trump's travel ban.

50:10.140 --> 50:13.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Oral arguments are scheduled for
Tuesday.

50:13.477 --> 50:17.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we want to follow up now on
a story we
reported last week.

50:17.748 --> 50:22.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last Monday, Jane Ferguson
brought us the
story of Abdul Hamid, an Iraqi
who spent seven

50:23.020 --> 50:26.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years helping U.S. troops as a
translator.

50:26.423 --> 50:30.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His plans to bring his family to
the United
States had been dashed by the
immigration

50:30.828 --> 50:32.296 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ban.

50:32.329 --> 50:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the United States government
has changed
its position on his request.

50:35.599 --> 50:40.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He will now be included in the
exemptions
made for Iraqis on special
immigrant visas

50:40.671 --> 50:42.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who worked with the U.S.
military.

50:42.840 --> 50:48.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He hopes to leave Iraq next
week, and he appreciates
the outpouring of support he
received on social

50:48.078 --> 50:51.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
media in response to our story.

50:51.415 --> 50:57.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tune in later tonight on
"Charlie Rose": the
actors and director of the new
film "A United

50:57.288 --> 50:58.889 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Kingdom."

50:58.923 --> 51:00.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

51:00.858 --> 51:01.926 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm John Yang.

51:01.959 --> 51:04.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening.

51:05.029 --> 51:11.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thanks,
and good night.

51:11.235 --> 51:15.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thanks,
and good night.
