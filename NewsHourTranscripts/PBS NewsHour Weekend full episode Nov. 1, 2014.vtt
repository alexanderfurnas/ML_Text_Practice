01:36.763 --> 01:37.931

03:45.025 --> 03:46.860
PUT IN, OUR ECONOMY HAS COME A

03:46.860 --> 03:48.862
LONG WAY THESE PAST SIX YEARS.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.330
OVER THE PAST 55 MONTHS OUR

03:50.330 --> 03:52.299
BUSINESSES HAVE ADDED 10.3

FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SIX YEARS,

03:55.769 --> 03:57.137
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS BELOW

03:57.137 --> 03:58.305
6%.

03:58.305 --> 03:59.239
>> UNDER A NEW MAJORITY, OUR

03:59.239 --> 04:00.807
FOCUS WOULD BE ON PASSING

04:00.807 --> 04:02.209
LEGISLATION THAT IMPROVES THE

04:02.209 --> 04:04.544
ECONOMY, THAT MAKES IT EASIER

04:04.544 --> 04:06.646
FOR AMERICANS TO FIND JOBS, AND

04:06.646 --> 04:08.148
THAT HELPS RESTORE AMERICANS’

04:08.148 --> 04:09.950
CONFIDENCE IN THEIR COUNTRY AND

04:09.950 --> 04:11.251
THEIR GOVERNMENT.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.085
>> Sreenivasan: BOTH PARTIES

04:12.085 --> 04:13.353
ARE INTENSIFYING THEIR EFFORT TO

04:13.353 --> 04:14.721
TURN OUT THE VOTE IN THE DAYS

04:14.721 --> 04:16.089
LEADING UP TO THE ELECTION.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.224
IN WASHINGTON STATE, NORTH OF

04:17.224 --> 04:18.792
SEATTLE, ANOTHER TEEN WHO WAS

04:21.628 --> 04:22.963
FRIDAY HAS DIED.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.065
SHAYLEE CHUCKULNASKIT WAS 14.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.199
THE INCIDENT ALSO CLAIMED THE

04:26.199 --> 04:27.868
LIVES OF TWO OTHER TEENAGE

04:27.868 --> 04:29.169
GIRLS.

04:29.169 --> 04:30.270
THE 15-YEAR-OLD GUNMAN

04:30.270 --> 04:30.904
KILLED HIMSELF AFTER THE

04:30.904 --> 04:31.605
SHOOTINGS.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.305
ACCORDING TO THE SHERIFF,

04:32.305 --> 04:33.540
THE SHOOTER LURED HIS VICTIMS

04:33.540 --> 04:34.708
TO THE CAFETERIA WITH A TEXT

04:34.708 --> 04:36.243
MESSAGE, THEN SHOT THEM.

04:36.243 --> 04:37.644
TWO OTHER VICTIMS REMAIN

04:37.644 --> 04:38.912
HOSPITALIZED.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.147
NEW YORK CITY HAS AGREED TO PAY

04:40.147 --> 04:42.149
$2.25 MILLION TO THE FAMILY OF A

04:42.149 --> 04:43.683
HOMELESS VETERAN WHO WAS FOUND

04:43.683 --> 04:45.252
DEAD IN A CITY JAIL.

04:45.252 --> 04:46.520
JEROME MURDOUGH, A FORMER

04:46.520 --> 04:47.354
MARINE, SUFFERED FROM

04:47.354 --> 04:48.421
SCHIZOPHRENIA.

04:48.421 --> 04:49.823
WHEN HIS BODY WAS DISCOVERED,

04:49.823 --> 04:51.324
THE TEMPERATURE IN HIS CELL WAS

04:51.324 --> 04:53.126
101 DEGREES.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.594
HE HAD NOT BEEN CHECKED ON FOR

04:54.594 --> 04:55.929
AT LEAST FOUR HOURS.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.631
MURDOUGH WAS 56.

04:57.631 --> 04:58.798
AND IN A SIGN OF THE TIMES, AS

04:58.798 --> 04:59.866
AMERICANS GET HEAVIER AND

04:59.866 --> 05:01.334
HEAVIER, A MICHIGAN COMPANY THAT

05:01.334 --> 05:03.503
MANUFACTURES CRASH TEST DUMMIES

05:03.503 --> 05:05.672
SAYS IT IS DEVISING NEW MODELS

05:05.672 --> 05:06.940
THAT WEIGH MORE.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.241
THE IDEA IS TO BETTER REPRESENT

05:08.241 --> 05:10.076
THE AVERAGE BODY IN A CRASH.

05:10.076 --> 05:12.812
ONE OF ITS NEW MODELS WEIGHS 273

05:12.812 --> 05:13.613
POUNDS.

05:13.613 --> 05:14.981
STUDIES SHOW THOSE WHO ARE OBESE

05:14.981 --> 05:16.249
ARE MUCH MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO

05:16.249 --> 05:18.218
INJURIES DURING CRASHES.

05:27.861 --> 05:28.895
>> Sreenivasan: STOCK PRICES

05:28.895 --> 05:30.630
JUST KEEP GOING UP AND UP.

05:30.630 --> 05:31.598
THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE

05:31.598 --> 05:33.200
CLOSED AT A RECORD HIGH

05:33.200 --> 05:34.834
YESTERDAY, AND SO DID A CLOSELY

05:34.834 --> 05:36.770
WATCHED BROADER INDEX, THE S&P

05:36.770 --> 05:37.504
500.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.239
TO HELP EXPLAIN WHAT’S BEHIND

05:39.239 --> 05:40.740
THE LATEST SURGE ON WALL STREET,

05:40.740 --> 05:42.108
WE ARE JOINED NOW VIA SKYPE FROM

HE IS THE HOST OF THE RADIO

05:45.278 --> 05:46.346
PROGRAM, "FULL DISCLOSURE."

05:46.346 --> 05:47.480
A LOT OF PEOPLE ON WALL STREET

05:47.480 --> 05:49.216
ARE TALKING ABOUT THE LATEST

05:49.216 --> 05:50.951
BUYING EVENTS IN JAPAN.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.586
THEIR STOCK INDEX, THE NIKKEI,

05:52.586 --> 05:54.688
WAS UP NEARLY 5% JUST YESTERDAY

05:54.688 --> 05:56.122
AFTER THEIR GOVERNMENT THERE

05:56.122 --> 05:57.857
ANNOUNCED A NEW STIMULUS

05:57.857 --> 05:58.358
PROGRAM.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.527
SO WHAT DID IT DO AND WHY DOES

06:00.527 --> 06:02.362
THAT MATTER HERE?

06:02.362 --> 06:03.597
>> BECAUSE WE’RE SO CONNECTED AT

06:03.597 --> 06:04.130
THIS POINT.

06:04.130 --> 06:05.265
ALL THESE CENTRAL BANKS ACROSS

06:05.265 --> 06:07.434
THE GLOBE ARE FLOODING THE PLANE

06:07.434 --> 06:09.169
WITH MONEY TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE

06:09.169 --> 06:11.104
TO GO OUT AND TAKE RISKS, TAKE

06:11.104 --> 06:12.572
CHANCES.

06:12.572 --> 06:13.740
THE BANK OF JAPAN ACTUALLY GOES

06:13.740 --> 06:15.542
OUT AND BUYS EQUITIES IN THE

06:15.542 --> 06:16.710
JAPANESE STOCK MARKET, WHICH

06:16.710 --> 06:18.678
HAS BEEN MORIBUND FOR SO LONG.

06:18.678 --> 06:19.646
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES, THE

06:19.646 --> 06:20.780
FEDERAL RESERVE HAS KEPT

06:20.780 --> 06:23.883
INTEREST RATES NEAR ZERO FOR THE

06:23.883 --> 06:25.619
BETTER PART OF SIX YEARS NOW,

06:25.619 --> 06:26.686
AND ON TOP OF THAT, THEY HAVE

06:26.686 --> 06:29.256
$3.5 TRILLION OF EMERGENCY BOND

06:29.256 --> 06:30.223
BUYING MEASURES.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.491
SO THERE’S A LOT OF CHEAP MONEY

06:31.491 --> 06:32.859
GOING AROUND STOKING PEOPLE TO

06:32.859 --> 06:35.762
GET INTO REAL ESTATE AND RISKIER

06:35.762 --> 06:37.264
BONDS AND RISKIER ASSETS LIKE

06:37.264 --> 06:37.931
STOCKS.

06:37.931 --> 06:38.732
>> Sreenivasan: SO THIS WEEK WE

06:38.732 --> 06:40.233
LEARNED OUR OWN ECONOMY GREW

06:40.233 --> 06:42.002
3.5% DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF

06:42.002 --> 06:43.436
2014.

06:43.436 --> 06:45.405
HOW MUCH OF A FACTOR IS THAT IN

06:45.405 --> 06:47.741
THE MARKET’S RECENT RISE?

06:47.741 --> 06:48.742
>> THE MARKETS REALLY RIGHT NOW

06:48.742 --> 06:50.110
ARE LOOKING AT THE BIG

06:50.110 --> 06:51.144
INTERVENING VARIABLE, WHICH IS

06:51.144 --> 06:53.513
THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S LARGESS.

06:53.513 --> 06:55.649
LIKE I SAID, SIX YEARS OF

06:55.649 --> 06:56.916
EMERGENCY LOW INTEREST RATES--

06:56.916 --> 06:58.551
CAN ANYBODY REMEMBER WHEN IT

06:58.551 --> 07:00.287
COST 6% OR 7% TO TAKE OUT A

07:00.287 --> 07:02.789
MORTGAGE OR WHEN YOU COULD GET A

07:02.789 --> 07:04.157
LITTLE OVER FOUR POINTS ON A

07:04.157 --> 07:05.525
GOVERNMENT BOND OR TREASURY

07:05.525 --> 07:06.393
BOND?

07:06.393 --> 07:07.394
IT’S JUST NOT REALLY IN THE

07:07.394 --> 07:08.295
INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY.

07:08.295 --> 07:10.764
WHEN YOU GET NOT TOO HOT BUT NOT

07:10.764 --> 07:13.300
TOO COLD ECONOMIC INDICATORS AND

07:13.300 --> 07:14.668
BY EXTENSION THE FEDERAL RESERVE

07:14.668 --> 07:15.635
IS TELEGRAPHING THAT IT’S

07:15.635 --> 07:18.071
GOING TO SIT ON ITS HANDS, MAYBE

07:18.071 --> 07:20.140
WELL INTO 2015, THERE’S THIS

07:20.140 --> 07:21.341
PERCEPTION THERE’S-- THAT

07:21.341 --> 07:22.342
THERE’S MORE ROOM TO RUN FOR THE

07:22.342 --> 07:23.276
MARKET.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.077
>> Sreenivasan: OCTOBER WAS A

07:24.077 --> 07:25.245
PRETTY WILD RIDE ON WALL STREET.

07:25.245 --> 07:26.646
EARLIER LAST MONTH, THE DOW HAD

07:26.646 --> 07:28.615
ITS BIGGEST WEEKLY DECLINE IN

07:28.615 --> 07:29.616
MORE THAN TWO YEARS.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.017
THEN IT CAME ROARING BACK.

07:31.017 --> 07:31.851
WHAT’S BEHIND ALL THIS

07:31.851 --> 07:33.053
VOLATILITY?

07:33.053 --> 07:34.854
>> AGAIN, WHAT’S BEHIND THE LACK

07:34.854 --> 07:36.356
OF VOLATILITY OVER THE PAST

07:36.356 --> 07:37.157
THREE OR FOR YEARS?

07:37.157 --> 07:38.491
WE HAVE DODGED SO MANY BULLETS

07:38.491 --> 07:40.927
FROM 2008 AND 2009, WHERE

07:40.927 --> 07:42.195
THERE WAS AN OUTRIGHT COLLAPSE.

07:42.195 --> 07:42.862
I BELIEVE THE MARKET,

07:42.862 --> 07:45.799
PEAK-TO-TROUGH, FELL 55%, 57%.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.334
AND THEN GREECE COLLAPSES AND

07:47.334 --> 07:49.502
THEN WE HAVE THE DEBT SHOWDOWN

07:49.502 --> 07:50.770
AND DEBT DEBACLE HERE, AND THE

07:50.770 --> 07:51.771
FISCAL CLIFF.

07:51.771 --> 07:53.473
AND NOW YOU HAVE WORRIES ABOUT

07:53.473 --> 07:54.874
ELECTORAL UNCERTAINTY AND THERE

07:54.874 --> 07:56.042
ARE WHISPERS OF GLOBAL

07:56.042 --> 07:56.943
DEFLATION.

07:56.943 --> 07:58.345
THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS AT

07:58.345 --> 08:00.313
PLAY, AND I THINK INVESTORS HAVE

08:00.313 --> 08:01.514
DEVELOPED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

08:01.514 --> 08:02.415
SCAR TISSUE.

08:02.415 --> 08:03.583
THE ONES THAT ARE STILL IN THE

08:03.583 --> 08:06.353
MARKET REALIZE THAT WHEN YOU SEE

08:06.353 --> 08:07.354
SOMETHING APPROACHING A

08:07.354 --> 08:08.388
CORRECTION-- AND WE DIDN’T EVEN

08:08.388 --> 08:09.589
HIT A FULL CORRECTION-- THAT

08:09.589 --> 08:10.824
THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING

08:10.824 --> 08:11.791
TO STEP IN AND BUY.

08:11.791 --> 08:12.459
>> Sreenivasan: SPEAKING OF

08:12.459 --> 08:13.393
PARTICIPATION, WE CAME ACROSS

08:13.393 --> 08:14.627
INTERESTING NUMBERS SHOWING A

08:14.627 --> 08:16.596
SPECIFICALLY LOWER PERCENTAGE OF

08:16.596 --> 08:19.099
AMERICANS OWN STOCK NOW THAN

08:19.099 --> 08:20.300
THEY DID A DOZEN YEARS AGO.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.701
SO WHO DROPPED OUT, AND WHAT ARE

08:21.701 --> 08:23.169
THE BIGGER REPERCUSSIONS?

08:23.169 --> 08:24.571
>> YOU WORRY ABOUT THE SOLVENCY

08:24.571 --> 08:26.139
OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND PEOPLE’S

08:26.139 --> 08:28.742
RETIREMENTS IN GENERAL IN AN ERA

08:28.742 --> 08:30.577
WHERE GOVERNMENT DEBTS MAYBE ARE

08:30.577 --> 08:32.078
NOT SUSTAINABLE.

08:32.078 --> 08:34.881
PEOPLE REALLY EN MASSE LOOKED AT

08:34.881 --> 08:37.384
WHAT HAPPENED IN 2000, WITH Y2K.

08:37.384 --> 08:38.451
THEY GOT THEIR HEARTS BROKEN

08:38.451 --> 08:40.487
WITH THE TECH CRASH; AND AGAIN

08:40.487 --> 08:42.055
IN 2007, WHEN THEY HESITATINGLY

08:42.055 --> 08:43.323
CAME BACK TO THE MARKET, WE GET

08:43.323 --> 08:45.091
THE MOTHER OF ALL ECONOMIC

08:45.091 --> 08:46.292
COLLAPSES WITH THE GREAT

08:46.292 --> 08:47.627
RECESSION AND THE MARKET GETTING

08:47.627 --> 08:48.328
CUT IN HALF.

08:48.328 --> 08:49.796
AND SO IT’S KIND OF LIKE A CASE

08:49.796 --> 08:51.064
OF "FOOL ME THRICE"-- "I’M NOT

08:51.064 --> 08:52.832
GOING TO BE THAT SUCKER."

08:52.832 --> 08:54.334
EVEN WITH THE NUMBERS BEING AS

08:54.334 --> 08:56.369
SPECTACULAR AS THEY ARE IN THIS

08:56.369 --> 08:58.671
FIVE-PLUS-YEAR BULL MARKET,

08:58.671 --> 09:00.140
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE SAYING

09:00.140 --> 09:01.841
NO, I’M NOT GOING BACK TO THAT

09:01.841 --> 09:02.575
ASSET CLASS.

09:02.575 --> 09:03.610
YOU’RE GOING TO HAVE TO SHOW ME

09:03.610 --> 09:05.412
MUCH MORE SECURITY AND MUCH

09:05.412 --> 09:06.913
BETTER RISK REWARD FOR ME TO GET

09:06.913 --> 09:09.416
MY MONEY BACK, AND THAT’S REALLY

09:09.416 --> 09:10.350
NOT HELPING THEIR CASE.

09:10.350 --> 09:11.384
THEY’RE GOING TO NEED THE MARKET

09:11.384 --> 09:12.919
TO HELP THEM INTO RETIREMENT.

09:12.919 --> 09:14.053
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

09:14.053 --> 09:15.121
ROBEN FARZAD, THE HOST OF THE

09:15.121 --> 09:16.689
RADIO PROGRAM "FULL DISCLOSURE,"

09:16.689 --> 09:17.924
THANKS SO MUCH.

09:17.924 --> 09:19.626
>> MY PLEASURE.

09:29.035 --> 09:30.103
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW TO OUR

09:30.103 --> 09:30.804
SIGNATURE SEGMENT.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.338
ELECTION DAY IS, OF COURSE, JUST

09:32.338 --> 09:33.706
THREE DAYS AWAY, AND IT’S STILL

09:33.706 --> 09:35.442
UNCLEAR WHICH PARTY WILL END UP

09:35.442 --> 09:37.076
IN CONTROL OF THE UNITED STATES

09:37.076 --> 09:37.644
SENATE.

09:37.644 --> 09:38.978
THAT MIGHT DEPEND ON WHAT

09:38.978 --> 09:41.247
HAPPENS HERE IN LOUISIANA, WHERE

09:41.247 --> 09:42.615
MOST POLLS SHOW THE DEMOCRAT

09:42.615 --> 09:43.683
INCUMBENT RUNNING SLIGHTLY

09:43.683 --> 09:45.518
BEHIND HER REPUBLICAN

09:45.518 --> 09:46.319
CHALLENGER.

09:46.319 --> 09:47.821
WILL SENATOR MARY LANDRIEU’S

09:47.821 --> 09:49.556
TIES TO PRESIDENT OBAMA HELP

09:49.556 --> 09:50.690
BRING HER DOWN?

09:50.690 --> 09:52.425
OR, LIKE ENDANGERED DEMOCRATS IN

09:52.425 --> 09:54.627
ARKANSAS, COLORADO AND ALASKA,

09:54.627 --> 09:56.463
WILL HER PROMINENT FAMILY NAME

09:56.463 --> 09:58.498
HELP HER RETAIN HER SEAT?

09:58.498 --> 09:59.732
NEWSHOUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

09:59.732 --> 10:01.267
JEFF GREENFIELD TRAVELED HERE

10:01.267 --> 10:03.470
RECENTLY TO EXAMINE LOUISIANA’S

10:03.470 --> 10:05.438
SENATE RACE AND TO EXPLORE HOW

10:05.438 --> 10:07.173
AMERICAN POLITICS BECAME A

10:07.173 --> 10:08.775
FAMILY BUSINESS.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.711
>> Reporter: IT IS A VERY

10:11.711 --> 10:13.213
DIFFERENT PLACE.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.148
ITS TERRAIN.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.050
ITS ARCHITECTURE.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.853
ITS FOOD.

10:19.853 --> 10:22.388
ITS MUSIC.

10:22.388 --> 10:25.492
HOW IT CELEBRATES.

10:25.492 --> 10:27.894
HOW IT MOURNS.

10:27.894 --> 10:28.928
BUT FOR ALL THAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT

10:28.928 --> 10:31.498
LOUISIANA, ITS U.S. SENATE RACE

10:31.498 --> 10:33.166
IS STRIKINGLY SIMILAR TO

10:33.166 --> 10:34.734
CONTESTS FROM ONE END OF THE

10:34.734 --> 10:36.135
COUNTRY TO THE OTHER.

10:36.135 --> 10:37.504
IN SO MANY OF THESE STATES,

10:37.504 --> 10:39.472
DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENTS WITH A

10:39.472 --> 10:41.040
STRONG HISTORY OF FAMILY

10:41.040 --> 10:42.976
POLITICAL SUCCESS FIND

10:42.976 --> 10:45.378
THEMSELVES IN GRAVE PERIL IN

10:45.378 --> 10:47.013
GOOD MEASURE BECAUSE OF THE

10:47.013 --> 10:49.082
PRESIDENT OF THEIR OWN PARTY.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.250
MARY LANDRIEU, SEEKING HER

10:50.250 --> 10:51.651
FOURTH TERM IN THE UNITED STATES

10:51.651 --> 10:53.253
SENATE, HAS BEEN IN ELECTIVE

10:53.253 --> 10:55.688
OFFICE FOR ALMOST 35 YEARS, MORE

10:55.688 --> 10:57.190
THAN HALF HER LIFE.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.191
SHE’S PART OF A FAMILY THAT’S

10:58.191 --> 10:59.492
BEEN IN OFFICE IN THIS STATE FOR

10:59.492 --> 11:02.595
MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY.

11:02.595 --> 11:03.997
HER FATHER, MOON, WAS FIRST

11:03.997 --> 11:05.598
ELECTED TO THE LEGISLATURE IN

11:05.598 --> 11:06.833
1960.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.334
HE LATER SERVED AS MAYOR OF NEW

11:08.334 --> 11:10.069
ORLEANS AND AS HUD SECRETARY

11:10.069 --> 11:11.471
UNDER PRESIDENT CARTER.

11:15.808 --> 11:18.211
25 YEARS AGO, IS NOW MAYOR OF

11:18.211 --> 11:19.045
NEW ORLEANS.

11:19.045 --> 11:20.280
>> MARY GOT ELECTED WHEN SHE WAS

11:20.280 --> 11:22.282
23 YEARS OLD.

11:22.282 --> 11:23.917
I GOT ELECTED WHEN I WAS 27.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.251
I THINK COLLECTIVELY EVERYBODY

11:25.251 --> 11:26.319
IN MY FAMILY SERVED FOR ABOUT

11:26.319 --> 11:27.186
100 YEARS.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.021

11:28.021 --> 11:29.689
FUTURE IS IN JEOPARDY.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.157
SHE’S IN A VERY CLOSE RACE WITH

PHYSICIAN-TURNED-U.S.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.394
CONGRESSMAN BILL CASSIDY, WHOSE

11:34.394 --> 11:36.296
CAMPAIGN SEEKS TO TIE LANDRIEU

11:36.296 --> 11:38.264
TO A MEMBER OF HER POLITICAL

11:38.264 --> 11:39.365
FAMILY.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.034

11:41.034 --> 11:42.235
BUT HE’S CHANGING IT FOR THE

11:42.235 --> 11:44.003
WORSE, AND MARY LANDRIEU GOES

11:44.003 --> 11:45.538
RIGHT ALONG WITH IT.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.040
>> BARACK OBAMA AND MARY

11:47.040 --> 11:48.675

12:06.025 --> 12:07.660
TO WIN, BY ANY STRETCH, BUT THIS

12:07.660 --> 12:10.229
IS BY FAR THE TOUGHEST ELECTION

12:10.229 --> 12:11.297
SHE’S EVER HAD.

AFTER STATE.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.171

13:10.890 --> 13:12.692
INCUMBENTS HELP DEFINE THEM AS

13:12.692 --> 13:14.727
LOCAL CHAMPIONS, RATHER THAN AS

ALLIES OF AN UNPOPULAR

PRESIDENT?

13:17.463 --> 13:18.531
THEY ALSO POINT TO A STRIKING

LIFE.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.769

14:08.247 --> 14:09.482
FAMILY MEMBERS WHO’VE HELD

14:09.482 --> 14:11.350
POLITICAL OFFICE BEFORE THEM.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.985

14:19.726 --> 14:21.828
FORBIDS TITLES OF NOBILITY.

14:21.828 --> 14:23.629
BUT IN FACT, AMERICA HAS HAD A

14:23.629 --> 14:25.164
CLASS OF POLITICAL NOBILITY

14:25.164 --> 14:27.133
ALMOST FROM THE BEGINNING.

14:42.548 --> 14:43.983
ONE GENERATION OF POLITICIANS

14:43.983 --> 14:45.918

14:45.918 --> 14:47.653
MAYBE, SAYS MOON LANDRIEU, IT’S

14:53.693 --> 14:55.394
I’M NOT TRYING TO RAISE POLITICS

14:55.394 --> 14:56.662

14:59.699 --> 15:02.468
YOUR KIDS MOSTLY INCLINE THAT

15:02.468 --> 15:03.603
WAY.

15:03.603 --> 15:06.372
WHEN I RAN, MY CHILDREN WERE

15:06.372 --> 15:07.974
YOUNG SO WE DIDN’T HESITATE TO

15:07.974 --> 15:09.542
TAKE THEM ON DOOR KNOCKING, AND

EMBRACED THESE KIND OF POLITICAL

15:33.032 --> 15:34.133
FAMILIES.

15:34.133 --> 15:35.668

15:35.668 --> 15:36.903
OF A BRAND NAME, AND IT REALLY

15:36.903 --> 15:38.070
HELPS YOU IN THE ELECTORAL

18:27.340 --> 18:29.208
LIKELY TO GET CLOSE TO 10% OF

18:29.208 --> 18:30.743
THE VOTE, WHICH MEANS THAT IT

COUNTRY, WHEN A PERSON’S LIFE IS

20:41.974 --> 20:44.009
AT STAKE LIKE IN CRIMINAL COURT,

20:44.009 --> 20:45.177
THERE IS A RIGHT TO A PUBLIC

20:45.177 --> 20:45.978
DEFENDER.

20:45.978 --> 20:48.047
FOR THESE CHILDREN, THERE IS A

20:48.047 --> 20:50.349
RIGHT TO ACCESS THE SYSTEM, BUT

20:50.349 --> 20:51.550
THERE IS NOT A RIGHT OF BEING

SUPPLIED LEGAL REPRESENTATION.

21:06.232 --> 21:07.933
IT’S VERY SLOW GOING.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.235
THERE AREN’T ENOUGH ATTORNEYS TO

REPRESENT ALL OF THE CHILDREN

WHOSE CASES HAVE TO BE HEARD IN

21:13.038 --> 21:14.974
FEDERAL IMMIGRATION COURT.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.709
AND THAT COURT HAS BEEN WITHOUT

21:16.709 --> 21:18.911
A JUDGE FOR MONTHS NOW, SO THE

21:18.911 --> 21:21.347
ONLY TIME CASES CAN BE HEARD IS

21:21.347 --> 21:23.015
WHEN AN IMMIGRATION JUDGE COMES

21:23.015 --> 21:25.851
TO LOUISIANA FROM ANOTHER STATE.

BORDER.

21:41.934 --> 21:44.203
LIKE JINDAL, SOME LAWMAKERS ALSO

21:44.203 --> 21:45.804
BELIEVE THAT THE CHILDREN SHOULD

21:45.804 --> 21:47.406
