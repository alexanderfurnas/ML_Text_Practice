03:57.300 --> 03:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPARE.

03:58.433 --> 03:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBAMA'S STIMULUS AND HIS

03:59.233 --> 04:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEALTHCARE BILL NEEDED 60 VOTES

04:00.233 --> 04:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE SENATE TO OVERCOME A

04:01.633 --> 04:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FILIBUSTER.

04:02.533 --> 04:05.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE GOT.

04:05.466 --> 04:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THAT'S WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND

04:06.533 --> 04:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT REFLECTS, I THINK, IN PART

04:07.733 --> 04:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICAL POLARIZATION.

04:09.266 --> 04:10.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING TO

04:10.566 --> 04:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REMEMBER-- ALL THOSE BILLS

04:11.966 --> 04:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PASSED BECAUSE MEMBERS OF THE

04:13.566 --> 04:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT'S PARTY IN CONGRESS

04:14.966 --> 04:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE VERY RELUCTANT TO SEE THE

04:16.866 --> 04:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT FAIL.

04:18.733 --> 04:20.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:21.833 --> 04:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU SHOULD PUT FIRST, HOW DOES

04:23.333 --> 04:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT PLAY OUT IN THIS VOTE?

04:25.633 --> 04:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK YOU CAN SEE IT

04:27.066 --> 04:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DRAMATICALLY WITH SENATOR DEAN

04:28.833 --> 04:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HELLER OF NEVADA, WHO IS THE

04:30.100 --> 04:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOST ENDANGERED REPUBLICAN

04:32.533 --> 04:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SENATOR NEXT YEAR IN THE

04:33.666 --> 04:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIDTERMS.

04:35.333 --> 04:36.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THE PRODDING OF THE

04:36.766 --> 04:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR, HE SAID

04:37.833 --> 04:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE'S NO ON THIS BILL BECAUSE OF

04:38.933 --> 04:40.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEDICAID.

04:40.166 --> 04:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WHAT'S HAPPENING?

04:41.100 --> 04:42.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A PRO TRUMP PAC IS GOING TO

04:42.466 --> 04:43.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAUNCH A SEVEN-FIGURE MEDIA BUY

04:43.800 --> 04:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAINST HIM, AND WHAT HAPPENS

04:46.933 --> 04:48.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW IS FOR HIM AND FOR THE

04:48.566 --> 04:50.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER REPUBLICANS WHO EXPRESSED

04:50.866 --> 04:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELUCTANCE, WHAT IT COMES DOWN

04:53.633 --> 04:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO IS MITCH MCCONNELL LOOKING

04:55.166 --> 04:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR WAYS TO PACIFY THEM WITH

04:56.533 --> 04:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCESSIONS AT THE LAST MINUTE.

04:58.533 --> 05:00.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE PROBLEM, OF COURSE,

05:00.000 --> 05:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THAT ANY TIME YOU CONCEDE TO

05:01.866 --> 05:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MODERATES, THE CONSERVATIVES

05:03.633 --> 05:05.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON'T LIKE IT AND VICE VERSA.

05:05.266 --> 05:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: FROM POLITICS

05:07.100 --> 05:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO POLICY, WHEN YOU LOOK INTO

05:08.600 --> 05:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MEAT OF IT, THE HOUSE

05:10.100 --> 05:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERSION OR SENATE VERSION, HUGE

05:12.566 --> 05:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSTITUENCIES THAT ARE GOING

05:15.333 --> 05:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE HURT BY IT-- THE POOR, THE

05:17.000 --> 05:18.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELDERLY.

05:18.966 --> 05:21.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO WINS GOING FORWARD OR IS

05:21.266 --> 05:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS JUST A CALCULATION OF

05:24.600 --> 05:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIGURING OUT THE BARE MINIMUM TO

05:26.366 --> 05:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GET IT OVER THE LINE?

05:28.033 --> 05:30.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK WHAT EVERY

05:30.066 --> 05:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS SAYS THIS

05:31.566 --> 05:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS A BIG DISTRIBUTION AWAY FROM

05:34.600 --> 05:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIDDLE CLASS AND THE POOR

05:36.000 --> 05:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOWARD THE AFFLUENT, WHO GOT

05:37.900 --> 05:39.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIT IN THE OBAMA PLAN BECAUSE

05:39.300 --> 05:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR TAXES WERE INCREASED TO

05:40.933 --> 05:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAY FOR SUBSIDIES.

05:41.733 --> 05:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TWO THINGS TO REMEMBER.

05:44.033 --> 05:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIRST, THE TAX CUTS KICK IN

05:45.366 --> 05:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMMEDIATELY.

05:46.633 --> 05:48.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BITES WITH MEDICAID

05:48.566 --> 05:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPANSION AND REDUCED SUBSIDIES

05:50.433 --> 05:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HIGHER PREMIUMS DON'T BEGIN

05:52.100 --> 05:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO KICK IN UNTIL AFTER THE 2018

05:54.000 --> 05:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIDTERMS.

05:55.700 --> 05:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S A VERY CRITICAL POINT.

05:58.133 --> 05:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SECOND THING I'D SAY IS THAT

05:59.866 --> 06:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR A LOT OF THE REPUBLICAN

06:01.400 --> 06:03.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASE, REPEALING OBAMACARE,

06:03.066 --> 06:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHATEVER THAT MEANS, HAS BECOME

06:05.333 --> 06:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BE ALL AND THE END ALL.

06:06.766 --> 06:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE VINCE LOMBARDI ONCE SAID,

06:09.166 --> 06:10.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WINNING ISN'T EVERYTHING, IT'S

06:10.466 --> 06:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ONLY THING.

06:11.733 --> 06:13.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYTHING THEY CAN CALL OBAMA

06:13.000 --> 06:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPEAL THEY WANT BECAUSE NOT TO

06:14.400 --> 06:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO IT BETRAYS THE CENTRAL

06:16.300 --> 06:17.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROMISE THEY MADE TO THE

06:17.766 --> 06:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICAN BASE.

06:19.333 --> 06:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

06:22.700 --> 06:24.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN A COUPLE OF TWEETS HE SEEMS

06:24.100 --> 06:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE RUSSIAN

06:25.833 --> 06:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERFERENCE IN THE CONTEXT OF

06:27.800 --> 06:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BLAMING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

06:29.100 --> 06:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT,

06:31.033 --> 06:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH IS A DIFFERENT TACTIC

06:32.400 --> 06:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAN WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE AND

06:33.566 --> 06:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION AND PRESIDENT

06:34.766 --> 06:36.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP HAS BEEN PUSHING FOR THE

06:36.166 --> 06:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAST FEW MONTHS.

06:38.600 --> 06:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAYING THERE IS NOTHING TO THE

06:39.966 --> 06:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STORY OF HACKING.

06:41.700 --> 06:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAYBE IT'S THE CHINESE, MAYBE

06:42.766 --> 06:43.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S SOME GUY IN HIS PARENTS'

06:43.666 --> 06:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASEMENT.

06:44.300 --> 06:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW HE'S SAYING OF COURSE THERE

06:45.933 --> 06:47.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS HACKING AND THE REASON THE

06:47.166 --> 06:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T

06:49.500 --> 06:51.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TALK ABOUT IT WAS TO HELP

06:51.700 --> 06:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HILLARY BY NOT TALKING ABOUT IT.

06:53.233 --> 06:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT MAKES NO SENSE.

06:54.900 --> 06:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAD THEY EXPOSED RUSSIAN EFFORT

06:56.300 --> 06:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO PUSH THE ELECTORATE AWAY FROM

06:58.600 --> 07:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HILLARY, THAT WOULD'VE HELPED

07:00.633 --> 07:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HER POLITICALLY AND ONE OF THE

07:01.900 --> 07:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REASONS THEY DIDN'T DO IT, HAD

07:06.500 --> 07:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY RAISED THAT ISSUE, THEY

07:09.000 --> 07:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF

07:10.300 --> 07:11.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICIZING THE STORY IN AN

07:11.900 --> 07:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EFFORT TO HELP HILLARY CLINTON.

07:13.566 --> 07:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK IT'S AN ILLUSTRATION

07:15.400 --> 07:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALSO MORE BROADLY OF HOW TRUMP

07:16.700 --> 07:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
USES SOCIAL MEDIA TO CONVINCE

07:19.233 --> 07:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS MILLIONS OF FOLLOWERS THAT

07:21.366 --> 07:22.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS VERSION OF REALITY IS RIGHT

07:22.866 --> 07:25.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND, BY DEFINITION, ANYONE

07:25.066 --> 07:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUSHING BACK AGAINST THAT STORY

07:26.766 --> 07:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS A PRODUCT OF FAKE NEWS AND I

07:28.766 --> 07:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK THAT'S BECOME A THEME OF

07:31.900 --> 07:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS ADMINISTRATION, THERE'S NO

07:33.566 --> 07:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REASON TO THINK IT'S GOING TO

07:34.666 --> 07:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

PENINSULA.

07:57.400 --> 07:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

08:23.200 --> 08:25.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW VIA SKYPE FROM CAIRO.

08:25.400 --> 08:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TELL US WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

08:26.500 --> 08:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE PRISONS?

08:28.066 --> 08:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: THE PRISONS ARE

08:30.500 --> 08:32.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSIDE DIFFERENT PLACES LIKE

08:32.600 --> 08:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VILLAS, MILITARY CAMPS, PORTS,

08:35.600 --> 08:39.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AIRPORTS, AND DEPENDING ON THE

08:39.000 --> 08:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOCATION OF THE PRISON, THE

08:41.533 --> 08:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONDITIONS ARE DIFFERENT.

08:43.833 --> 08:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IN ONE CITY, FOR EXAMPLE,

08:48.166 --> 08:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S A BIG DETENTION CENTER

08:49.800 --> 08:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SET UP INSIDE THE AIRPORT WHERE

08:52.333 --> 08:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRISONERS ARE HELD INSIDE

08:53.633 --> 08:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHIPPING CONTAINERS.

08:57.800 --> 08:58.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE ARE BLINDFOLDED MOST OF

08:58.866 --> 09:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TIME.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY HAVE ACCESS TO TOILETS FOR

09:02.400 --> 09:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THREE MINUTES A DAY.

09:04.266 --> 09:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS TORTURE EVERY DAY AT

09:05.800 --> 09:09.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NIGHT FROM 11:00 P.M.

09:09.566 --> 09:12.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS, THEY

09:12.900 --> 09:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENTER THE CELLS AND START

09:14.633 --> 09:17.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FLOGGING AND BEATING DETAINEES

09:17.166 --> 09:19.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY SELECT A NUMBER OF THEM

09:19.366 --> 09:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND DRAG THEM OUTSIDE THE CELL

09:20.966 --> 09:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR MORE TORTURE.

09:22.633 --> 09:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT ALSO INCLUDES SEXUAL

09:24.333 --> 09:26.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASSAULTS ACCORDING TO DETAINEES.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: YOU DESCRIBED

09:27.566 --> 09:29.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING IN HERE THAT LOOKS

09:29.300 --> 09:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRAIGHT OUT OF A MEDIEVAL

09:31.700 --> 09:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STORY.

09:32.566 --> 09:34.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A GRILL, WHAT IS THIS?

09:34.266 --> 09:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SOLDIERS TIED AT KNEES

09:35.900 --> 09:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SPUN THEM QUICKLY AND FASTLY

09:39.933 --> 09:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNTIL THEY VOMIT AT THE VERY

09:41.200 --> 09:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
END.

09:42.300 --> 09:43.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS WHAT THEY DESCRIBED

09:43.366 --> 09:45.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO ME.

09:45.266 --> 09:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT I WAS TOLD ALSO THAT DAY,

09:47.600 --> 09:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SEVERELY

09:49.433 --> 09:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TORTURED LIKE SELECTED, LIKE

09:51.500 --> 09:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY SELECT SMALL NUMBER OF

09:52.700 --> 09:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEM.

09:54.133 --> 09:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THEY BECOME LIKE A MODEL

09:55.400 --> 09:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THE REST OF THE PRISONERS.

09:57.100 --> 09:59.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WHENEVER THE TIME FOR THE

09:59.100 --> 10:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERROGATIONS COME, THE PEOPLE

10:01.733 --> 10:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY HAVE ALREADY SEEN WHAT'S

10:03.000 --> 10:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENED TO THE COLLEAGUES, TO

10:04.900 --> 10:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE INMATES, SO THEY START TO

10:06.933 --> 10:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST GIVE WHATEVER CONFESSIONS

10:08.200 --> 10:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE ORDERED TO GIVE.

10:10.333 --> 10:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

FROM THE CONFESSIONS?

10:12.966 --> 10:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP TO THE

U.S. IN ALL THIS?

10:15.700 --> 10:17.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

FOUR TIMES A WEEK.

10:37.766 --> 10:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

INFORMATION.

10:44.133 --> 10:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS KIND OF INFORMATION WILL

10:46.266 --> 10:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE USED LATER IN THE RAIDS

TO YEMENI PRISONS.

11:05.166 --> 11:07.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOWEVER, THEY SAID THAT THEY

RECEIVED REPORTS OF TORTURE AND

11:09.066 --> 11:10.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY LOOKED INTO IT AND THEY

11:10.800 --> 11:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOUND NOTHING.

11:12.666 --> 11:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THIS IS THE KIND OF RESPONSE

11:14.233 --> 11:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE FAMILIES WERE REALLY

11:17.366 --> 11:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
