JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.672 --> 00:07.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.474 --> 00:11.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Donald Trump's
campaign meets with Republican
officials after

00:11.545 --> 00:17.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
backtracking on his
controversial ISIS remarks,
while the world gets a look at
Hillary Clinton's

00:17.451 --> 00:19.286 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tax returns.

00:19.319 --> 00:23.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Then, we sit down with
journalist Scott Anderson
on his epic report in "The New
York Times

00:23.891 --> 00:30.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Magazine" on how the Arab world
came apart
after the 2003 U.S. invasion of
Iraq.

00:30.364 --> 00:33.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT ANDERSON, "The New York
Times Magazine":
I didn't want to write a
40,000-word essay.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But to tell this story, I really
needed to
focus on people.

00:36.970 --> 00:42.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus, from
refugee camps to
the world stage, how the first
ever refugee

00:42.643 --> 00:48.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Olympic team is bringing
awareness and hope
to a global audience.

00:48.148 --> 00:49.383 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it's Friday.

00:49.416 --> 00:53.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Brooks and E.J. Dionne
analyze a full
week of news.

00:53.553 --> 01:00.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:00.494 --> 01:03.297 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:03.330 --> 01:12.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Donald Trump is
winding down
another tough week in the
presidential race,

01:12.839 --> 01:17.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as new polls now put him behind
by double
digits in several key states.

01:17.978 --> 01:22.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His staffers were meeting with
officials of
the Republican National
Committee today.

01:22.716 --> 01:28.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in Erie, Pennsylvania, the
candidate himself
sounded upbeat a day after
acknowledging his

01:28.322 --> 01:30.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
campaign was having trouble.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
We have to win Pennsylvania.

01:32.793 --> 01:35.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We win Pennsylvania, we're going
to win it.

01:35.429 --> 01:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, we're up in Florida,
we're doing
well in Ohio, and I am hearing
we're doing

01:39.666 --> 01:40.634 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
well here.

01:40.667 --> 01:41.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We will find out.

01:41.668 --> 01:43.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:43.537 --> 01:47.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Trump also
insisted again he
was being sarcastic in saying
that President

01:47.641 --> 01:50.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obama founded the Islamic State
group.

01:50.577 --> 01:53.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then he added -- quote --
"but not that
sarcastic."

01:53.647 --> 01:59.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton
reported that she
and former President Clinton
made $10.6 million

01:59.853 --> 02:01.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in income last year.

02:01.121 --> 02:04.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They paid about 34 percent in
federal taxes.

02:04.424 --> 02:08.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will return to the campaign
after the news
summary.

02:08.095 --> 02:12.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
Pentagon confirms
tonight that a U.S. drone attack
has killed

02:12.833 --> 02:15.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a top Islamic State leader in
Afghanistan.

02:15.869 --> 02:20.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hafiz Saeed Khan died in a
strike on July
26.

02:20.941 --> 02:25.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The State Department designated
him a global
terrorist last year.

02:25.445 --> 02:31.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bombings rocked across towns in
Southern Thailand
today, killing at least four
people and wounding

02:31.518 --> 02:33.020 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
dozens more.

02:33.053 --> 02:38.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coordinated attacks hit six
sites, including
the popular island of Phuket.

02:38.291 --> 02:41.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Harry Smith of Independent
Television News
reports.

02:41.795 --> 02:48.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARRY SMITH: The authorities say
they were
small explosions from improvised
devices,

02:48.568 --> 02:54.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but still deadly in their
impact, some filled
with ball bearings and other
shrapnel designed

02:54.541 --> 02:57.044 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to cause maximum casualties.

02:57.077 --> 03:02.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many set off were nearly as busy
with tourists
at times when they might have
been out enjoying

03:02.315 --> 03:04.818 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the nightlife.

03:04.851 --> 03:10.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The blasts also coincided with
the national
holiday to celebrate the
birthday of Thailand's

03:10.157 --> 03:11.858 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
queen.

03:11.892 --> 03:15.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the object was to hit the
country's tourist
trade, it made an immediate
impact.

03:15.228 --> 03:16.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HANNAH HARKNESS, Tourist: I
couldn't believe
it.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.665 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I felt sick.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Couldn't like -- I was
absolutely speechless.

03:20.567 --> 03:22.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I just don't know how to feel.

03:22.769 --> 03:26.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I thought like that I was going
to come to
this place and feel safe.

03:26.473 --> 03:31.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I mean, it's astonishing
what's happening
in little Hua Hin.

03:31.511 --> 03:35.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a place where tourism, and
especially
this weekend with the queen's
birthday, it's

03:35.715 --> 03:37.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
supposed to be a place for
celebration.

03:37.784 --> 03:43.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARRY SMITH: Perhaps to reassure
the thousands
who visit Thailand each year,
police were

03:43.056 --> 03:49.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quick to insist this wasn't an
attack connected
to any global terror network,
insisting instead

03:49.329 --> 03:50.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it was the work of local
insurgents.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

03:52.799 --> 03:53.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRISANA PATANACHAROE, Thai
Police: We are
working round-the- clock in
order to identify

03:53.967 --> 03:58.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the suspects and also the
motives behind the
scenes.

03:58.705 --> 04:04.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARRY SMITH: Insurgent groups in
the historically
Muslim south of Thailand have a
long-running

04:04.211 --> 04:07.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaign for an independent
Islamic state.

04:07.347 --> 04:12.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's often been violent,
thousands have been
killed, but it has never before
targeted tourist

04:12.419 --> 04:14.221 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
areas.

04:14.254 --> 04:18.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The attacks came just a week
after the Thais
voted in a referendum to
strengthen the powers

04:18.458 --> 04:20.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the ruling military regime.

04:20.694 --> 04:25.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The authorities have stepped up
security checks
at all tourist destinations, and
European

04:25.465 --> 04:28.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
embassies have advised their
nationals to
be vigilant.

04:28.535 --> 04:32.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There was no
immediate claim
of responsibility.

04:32.539 --> 04:37.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The man that Turkey's government
blames for
a coup attempt is calling for an
international

04:37.144 --> 04:40.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
investigation before he will
agree to return.

04:40.680 --> 04:45.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkish leaders want the U.S. to
extradite
Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen,
who lives in

04:45.752 --> 04:47.587 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Pennsylvania.

04:47.621 --> 04:52.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Writing today in the French
newspaper Le Monde,
Gulen said -- quote -- "If a
tenth of the

04:52.159 --> 04:58.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
accusations against me are
established, I
pledge to return to Turkey and
serve the heaviest

04:58.165 --> 04:59.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sentence."

04:60.000 --> 05:04.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Russia, President Vladimir
Putin fired
his right-hand man today as part
of an ongoing

05:04.771 --> 05:06.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shakeup of his inner circle.

05:07.007 --> 05:11.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Longtime ally Sergei Ivanov was
dropped from
his post as chief of staff.

05:11.811 --> 05:17.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He'd been one of the most
influential figures
in Russia and was once
considered a likely

05:17.117 --> 05:18.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
successor to Putin.

05:18.785 --> 05:22.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, today, the Russian
president said he
made the decision at Ivanov's
request.

05:22.923 --> 05:26.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through
translator): We have been
working together

05:26.660 --> 05:29.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for many years and it was
successful work.

05:29.462 --> 05:31.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm happy with how you have
handled the tasks.

05:31.598 --> 05:34.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I understand your desire to
choose another
line of work.

05:34.801 --> 05:39.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the past year,
Putin has
replaced several of his more
powerful allies

05:39.339 --> 05:41.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with younger officials.

05:41.575 --> 05:45.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, the U.S.
Department
of Health and Human services has
declared

05:45.512 --> 05:49.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a public health emergency in
Puerto Rico over
the Zika virus.

05:49.849 --> 05:55.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The island has more than 10,000
cases, and
the surgeon general warned that
25 percent

05:55.722 --> 05:59.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the population will be
infected by year's
end.

05:59.426 --> 06:03.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Zika is linked to severe birth
defects.

06:03.063 --> 06:09.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New data shows the cost of
expanding Medicaid
under the Affordable Care Act is
almost 50

06:09.135 --> 06:11.204 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
percent higher than projected.

06:11.238 --> 06:16.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Up to 10 million low-income
Americans have
been added to Medicaid rolls so
far.

06:16.910 --> 06:22.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the agency overseeing the
effort says
it's running nearly $6,400 a
person.

06:22.482 --> 06:27.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That could make it much more
difficult to
expand Medicaid in the 19 states
that have

06:27.420 --> 06:29.856 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not yet done so.

06:29.889 --> 06:35.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street closed out the week
with a subpar
session, after weak data on
retail sales.

06:35.395 --> 06:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 37 points
to close at 18576.

06:40.133 --> 06:45.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose four points, and
the S&amp;P 500
dropped a point.

06:45.472 --> 06:50.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the week, all three indexes
gained a fraction
of a point.

06:50.443 --> 06:54.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at the Summer Olympics, an
upset today
in women's soccer.

06:54.180 --> 07:00.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. team lost to Sweden in
the quarterfinals
on a penalty shoot-out after
regulation play

07:00.954 --> 07:02.522 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ended in a tie.

07:02.555 --> 07:07.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The American women had won gold
in the last
three Olympics.

07:07.360 --> 07:12.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
how Republican
officials are dealing with
Donald Trump; six

07:12.532 --> 07:18.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
lives that reflect the
fracturing of the Middle
East; triumphs and heartbreaks
at the Rio

07:18.938 --> 07:33.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Olympics; and much more.

07:33.353 --> 07:38.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump continues to drive
division in
the Republican Party, as new
polls have him

07:38.558 --> 07:42.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
losing ground in states that
will be key to
victory.

07:42.362 --> 07:44.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We look at where the race stands
now with
Robert Costa.

07:44.831 --> 07:48.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's the national political
reporter with
The Washington Post.

07:48.401 --> 07:51.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Robert Costa, welcome back to
the program.

07:51.671 --> 07:56.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, we know that
Reince Priebus,
who is the chairman of the
Republican Party,

07:56.343 --> 08:00.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made a point of introducing
Donald Trump today
when he spoke in Erie,
Pennsylvania.

08:00.647 --> 08:05.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But at the same time, we have
been mentioning
the polls are slipping for Mr.
Trump.

08:05.885 --> 08:08.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There has been a string of these
controversial
statements.

08:08.688 --> 08:10.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How worried -- or is this party
worried?

08:10.857 --> 08:13.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA, The Washington
Post: Judy, good
to be with you.

08:13.693 --> 08:18.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The relationship between the
party chairman
and the GOP standard-bearer
remains a pivotal

08:18.565 --> 08:23.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one within the GOP, and my
sources tell me
that Priebus made a point today
to travel

08:23.870 --> 08:29.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from New York to Erie,
Pennsylvania, to make
sure he showcased his unity with
Donald Trump,

08:29.042 --> 08:32.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as some people at the party's
upper levels
are saying maybe it's time,
because of these

08:32.645 --> 08:37.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
sliding poll numbers, to
distance Republicans,
especially in swing states, from
Donald Trump.

08:37.584 --> 08:42.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Priebus said today in Erie
that's not true,
the party is not moving away
from Trump, he's

08:42.389 --> 08:44.124 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sticking with the nominee.

08:44.157 --> 08:47.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so what sort
of pressure,
Robert, is there on the
Republican Party,

08:47.861 --> 08:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the leadership of the party
to either work
with Donald Trump or to distance
themselves

08:53.633 --> 08:55.435 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from him?

08:55.468 --> 09:00.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: At the RNC level,
they're intertwined,
the Trump campaign and RNC, when
it comes

09:00.273 --> 09:01.307 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to fund-raising.

09:01.341 --> 09:02.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, they have had a close
relationship.

09:02.909 --> 09:07.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The tensions are really more raw
when it comes
to the congressional ranks.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
House Republicans have a 59-seat
majority.

09:10.116 --> 09:14.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some members there are privately
very edgy,
uncomfortable about what Trump
could mean

09:14.654 --> 09:17.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for them especially if they are
in a swing
district.

09:17.190 --> 09:22.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the Senate, you have
states like Pennsylvania
where Trump was today, Mark Kirk
in Illinois,

09:22.695 --> 09:24.497 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire.

09:24.531 --> 09:28.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're facing very tough races
this fall
and how they align with Trump is
becoming

09:28.601 --> 09:30.403 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their key strategic decision.

09:30.437 --> 09:34.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We also heard --
we heard Donald
Trump just himself acknowledge
in the last

09:34.607 --> 09:40.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
day or so that he's having
problems in some
states, in some of these
important swing states

09:40.380 --> 09:47.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like Ohio, like Florida, but
even in a reliably
Republican state like Utah.

09:47.821 --> 09:52.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is that telling you,
somebody who's been
covering politics for some time,
and what

09:52.959 --> 09:56.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
does it say to Republicans who
are watching
this race so closely?

09:56.629 --> 09:59.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ROBERT COSTA: Utah is a
particularly case.

09:59.799 --> 10:03.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have a new presidential
candidate, an
independent conservative, Evan
McMullin, come

10:03.636 --> 10:05.405 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from Utah.

10:05.438 --> 10:09.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Temperamentally, the Mormon
population of
Utah doesn't always fit with
Donald Trump.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They really like Donald Trump,
according to
most polls.

10:11.978 --> 10:15.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some evangelical communities,
you see Hillary
Clinton, the former secretary of
state, she

10:15.849 --> 10:17.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is gaining in a state like
Georgia.

10:18.017 --> 10:20.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump is trying to adjust to a
general election.

10:20.153 --> 10:24.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's been so rough and tumble
for so long,
throwing punches, that it turns
some swing

10:24.858 --> 10:26.759 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
voters off.

10:26.793 --> 10:30.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But according to my sources in
the Trump campaign,
Trump is adamant that he will
not change,

10:30.563 --> 10:34.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he wants to continue to run
a campaign
from the gut, on his instincts.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what does
that mean, Robert?

10:36.536 --> 10:40.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does that mean we can expect to
hear comments
like the ones in the last few
days, the Second

10:40.607 --> 10:46.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amendment comment that some
people took to
mean he was threatening Hillary
Clinton, and

10:46.579 --> 10:50.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then more recently this comment
that Hillary
Clinton and President Clinton
founded ISIS?

10:50.984 --> 10:56.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: That's always the
peril Trump
finds himself in as a novice
first-time national

10:56.456 --> 10:58.258 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
candidate.

10:58.291 --> 11:02.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He likes to be the outsider,
someone who's
brash and bold in his mind, but
he takes risks

11:02.061 --> 11:04.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in his some of his comments by
being out there
a little bit.

11:04.597 --> 11:08.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The party hopes that he can
control some more
of his incendiary remarks, but
still have

11:08.835 --> 11:12.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that outsider appeal, which they
think is
really Trump's really only path
to the White

11:12.872 --> 11:18.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House, to make these swing
voters and working-class
voters who are disengaged with
the system

11:18.444 --> 11:20.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
feel like they maybe have a
candidate for
themselves.

11:20.380 --> 11:25.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Robert, we
have seen more
-- or at least a number of
prominent Republicans

11:25.685 --> 11:30.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like Senator Susan Collins of
Maine come out
and say they couldn't support
Donald Trump.

11:30.423 --> 11:36.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a letter this week by
former foreign
policy experts in the Republican
Party.

11:36.396 --> 11:42.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then yet another letter went to
the RNC from
Republicans saying, we don't
want you to spend

11:42.101 --> 11:46.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as much money on Donald Trump,
we want you
to spend money on these other
races.

11:46.472 --> 11:51.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this the kind of thing that
the party leadership
has to worry about or can they
just ignore

11:51.044 --> 11:52.812 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it all?

11:52.845 --> 11:56.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: Oh, they're not
ignoring it
at all, Judy, because one of the
things Trump

11:56.316 --> 12:01.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is facing is, he doesn't have an
institutional
history within the Republican
Party.

12:01.054 --> 12:05.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He doesn't have the
relationships going back
years that have sustained other
nominees in

12:05.558 --> 12:08.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
past cycles when they have had a
patch of
rough poll numbers.

12:09.028 --> 12:12.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of Republicans now on
Capitol Hill and
elsewhere, they're saying, if
Trump is going

12:12.465 --> 12:16.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to lose the general election, in
our view,
maybe it's time to walk away,
walk away in

12:16.636 --> 12:21.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a full way, don't even have
money going from
major donors to the nominee, put
it to those

12:21.507 --> 12:23.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
down-ballot race that are more
vulnerable.

12:23.343 --> 12:28.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Trump insists that the RNC
is still going
to work with him and Priebus was
there today,

12:28.548 --> 12:32.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but this is all happening, these
conversations
are circulating within the party
that maybe

12:32.819 --> 12:35.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump isn't going to win and
things have to
be done.

12:35.488 --> 12:39.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, Robert
Costa with
The Washington Post, we thank
you very much.

12:39.892 --> 12:45.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT COSTA: Thank you.

12:45.064 --> 12:57.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the Middle
East and
a conversation about the chaos,
calamity and

12:57.543 --> 13:01.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
political dissolution that now
envelope the
region.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan in New York has
that.

13:03.549 --> 13:09.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The last five
years of tumult
in the Middle East defy easy
explanations.

13:09.255 --> 13:14.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Revolutions that began with much
hope in early
2011 have evolved into disaster
in places

13:14.861 --> 13:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like Syria and Libya and led to
political
upheaval and repression in
Egypt.

13:20.500 --> 13:26.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Iraq, the American-led war
that began in
2003 has morphed into a
many-sided conflict

13:26.773 --> 13:31.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that has once again brought
America back into
the fight there and in Syria.

13:31.711 --> 13:35.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Caught in the middle, millions
of people whose
lives have been upended.

13:35.748 --> 13:41.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An attempt to capture in part
the story of
this cataclysmic time comes now
from journalist

13:41.220 --> 13:46.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scott Anderson and photographer
Paolo Pellegrin,
whose work "Fractured Lands"
comprises the

13:46.559 --> 13:49.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
entirety issue of this Sunday's
"New York
Times Magazine."

13:49.829 --> 13:51.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And Scott Anderson joins me now.

13:51.798 --> 13:55.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're telling one bigger story,
and you're
using six different voices to
get at it.

13:55.401 --> 13:56.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT ANDERSON, "The New York
Times Magazine":
Right.

13:56.602 --> 13:59.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But the big
thesis in a
nutshell.

13:59.138 --> 14:04.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT ANDERSON: I wanted to tell
this kind
of broad story of how we got
here, and to

14:04.143 --> 14:05.445 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a degree where we might be
headed next.

14:05.478 --> 14:09.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to tell this story, I really
needed to
focus in on people.

14:09.515 --> 14:13.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the
characters that
you focus on in Iraq is so
compelling.

14:13.252 --> 14:17.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a young woman who ends up
-- she was
working for the CPA for a little
while, the

14:17.857 --> 14:19.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Provisional Authority.

14:19.759 --> 14:21.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tell us about her arc now.

14:21.327 --> 14:22.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT ANDERSON: Right.

14:22.328 --> 14:24.063 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

14:24.097 --> 14:27.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Khulood al-Zaidi, she was --
she's from a
provincial town in Southern Iraq
from a Shia

14:27.900 --> 14:29.669 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
family.

14:29.702 --> 14:34.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the Americans invaded in
2003, she heard
the talk of democracy and human
rights and

14:34.173 --> 14:36.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
women's empowerment that the CPA
was talking
about.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She became an instant convert.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She worked for the CPA.

14:40.046 --> 14:43.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, when the Americans
left, she was
stranded on the beach, so to
speak.

14:43.816 --> 14:45.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she tried to continue doing
work.

14:45.752 --> 14:51.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She received many death threats
from the militias,
finally ended up having to go
into exile in

14:51.390 --> 14:53.059 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Jordan.

14:53.092 --> 14:57.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And just in the last -- about
six months,
she joined the migrant exodus to
Europe.

14:57.697 --> 15:02.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, now she and one of her
sisters are living
in a little town in Austria, and
they have

15:02.135 --> 15:05.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been given asylum and they're
going to start
a university in September.

15:05.571 --> 15:10.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You find these
characters
kind of at their bridge they're
crossing over,

15:10.309 --> 15:14.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something that changed their
lives forever,
not just the overall invasion,
but something

15:14.480 --> 15:16.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very specific that happened in
each of their
lives.

15:16.349 --> 15:17.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT ANDERSON: Right.

15:17.984 --> 15:20.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There is an
Egyptian character
that you focus on, an activist.

15:20.319 --> 15:21.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT ANDERSON: Right.

15:22.021 --> 15:27.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Laila Soueif is a -- she's a
math professor
at Cairo University, has been an
activist

15:27.994 --> 15:31.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
since the 1970s, leftist, a
feminist.

15:31.364 --> 15:36.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she and her husband, who is
now deceased,
were probably the most --
certainly the most

15:36.502 --> 15:39.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prominent political dissident
couple in Egypt.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And their son
was in the
family business, too.

15:41.641 --> 15:44.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT ANDERSON: And their son
and their two
daughters got in the family
business.

15:44.911 --> 15:50.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Laila was -- during the Tahrir
Square in 2007
was in the front lines.

15:50.349 --> 15:53.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She very early on, though, saw
the danger.

15:53.085 --> 15:58.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The existing political forces,
they were slow
in trying to consolidate after
Mubarak was

15:58.825 --> 16:00.226 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
overthrown.

16:00.259 --> 16:01.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She saw the danger of the
military coming
back in.

16:01.928 --> 16:03.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And now she's living that.

16:03.663 --> 16:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And two of her children are in
prison for
protesting against the Sisi
government.

16:07.066 --> 16:11.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And this was
part of this
ripple effect of the Arab
spring.

16:11.871 --> 16:17.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We thought -- we saw the
incredible act of
Bouazizi, who immolated himself
that caused

16:17.343 --> 16:18.578 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this in Tunisia.

16:18.611 --> 16:21.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And here it was spreading like
wildfire across
the region.

16:21.581 --> 16:26.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we look, three, fours years
later, there's
not that much change.

16:26.452 --> 16:28.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In fact, some things are worse
off.

16:28.254 --> 16:31.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT ANDERSON: I think what
happened in a
lot of these countries is that
there wasn't

16:31.824 --> 16:33.492 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a consensus.

16:33.526 --> 16:35.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These dictators had been around
for so long.

16:35.561 --> 16:42.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so when they did fall,
people tended to
fall back on their tribal or
sectarian allegiances

16:42.268 --> 16:47.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that in a lot of these countries
had always
been people's primary allegiance
anyway.

16:47.440 --> 16:52.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You look at Libya, Syria, Iraq,
these were
all artificial nations that were
created by

16:52.211 --> 16:55.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Western powers at the end of
World War
I.

16:55.214 --> 17:02.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the strong man goes, you
have no tradition
of democracy, no tradition of
political expression.

17:02.521 --> 17:05.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's not even talk about
democracy.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You know, what happens?

17:06.392 --> 17:08.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What takes its place?

17:08.227 --> 17:10.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And you say
that really
it's, in that initial carving
up, there wasn't

17:10.997 --> 17:16.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much attention paid to what is
Kurdistan,
who are their loyalties to, what
is the other

17:16.469 --> 17:19.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rest of Iraq, and should this be
part of one
country?

17:19.171 --> 17:20.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT ANDERSON: Right.

17:20.172 --> 17:21.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Not even little consideration.

17:21.507 --> 17:22.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think it was a strategy.

17:23.009 --> 17:28.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was the same strategy the
colonial powers
used in sub-Saharan Africa.

17:28.648 --> 17:38.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You empower a local tribe or
ethnic group
or religious group to operate as
your local

17:38.724 --> 17:40.526 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
overseers.

17:40.559 --> 17:43.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the majority can never -- is
never going
to rebel against them, and
they're not going

17:43.729 --> 17:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to rebel against you because
they will be
taken over by the majority.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is a pattern that
existed throughout
the region.

17:49.535 --> 17:53.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You begin and
end the story
with bookends from one of your
characters

17:53.205 --> 17:54.707 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from Kurdistan.

17:54.740 --> 17:58.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And near the end, he says, Iraq
is gone, Syria
is gone, it is our time now.

17:58.577 --> 18:03.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT ANDERSON: What they have
always wanted
is a larger Kurdish homeland.

18:03.382 --> 18:10.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But this character in
particular, he sees
no future for living amongst
Arabs, so he

18:10.623 --> 18:12.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sees this as an opportunity.

18:12.391 --> 18:17.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a golden moment, in his
mind, to rid
the area, to basically
ethnically cleanse

18:17.530 --> 18:23.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the entire Kurdistan of the Arab
population
that has moved in.

18:23.269 --> 18:28.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this goes to this idea that
people think,
oh, well, why don't we just
start like bifurcating

18:28.107 --> 18:31.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or trifurcating some of these
countries, and
everyone can go back to having
their little

18:31.143 --> 18:32.111 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
homelands?

18:32.144 --> 18:33.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But everyone is so mixed in now.

18:34.013 --> 18:36.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's like where -- how far
down do you
start subdividing it?

18:36.882 --> 18:40.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the
things that I
noticed in this article is that
you don't

18:40.853 --> 18:45.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just say this is a Shia-Sunni
problem, which
is very easy kind of Western way
to look at

18:45.524 --> 18:48.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Middle East and say, well,
oh, clearly,
these Shia must love those Shia,
they're in

18:48.928 --> 18:51.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cahoots, and they are going to
overthrow this.

18:51.430 --> 18:53.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And you don't -- get into that.

18:53.199 --> 18:56.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT ANDERSON: No, and it's so
much more
complicated, and enjoined to the
idea of how

18:56.102 --> 18:57.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you subdivide it.

18:58.004 --> 19:03.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Iraq, there is lots of very
large tribes
that have a Sunni component and
a Shia component.

19:03.342 --> 19:05.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, what happens?

19:05.544 --> 19:10.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you tried to do a Sunni-Shia
division,
what happens to that tribe?

19:10.449 --> 19:14.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, there are issues with
clans going
back...

19:14.320 --> 19:16.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A couple of
thousand years.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SCOTT ANDERSON: A couple of
thousand years.

19:18.758 --> 19:24.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, and so, when people
start looking
at like a kind of a quick
solution to any

19:24.130 --> 19:29.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this, I think it's just in
for a really
long, very rocky road throughout
the region.

19:29.435 --> 19:33.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, finally,
Syria, you
have multiple characters, and we
just got

19:33.639 --> 19:34.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to a few of them.

19:34.807 --> 19:37.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he's fascinating for a
totally different
reason.

19:37.343 --> 19:43.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT ANDERSON: Yes, Majd
Ibrahim, he is a
23-year-old from Homs, a city in
Central Syria

19:43.149 --> 19:49.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that has probably the most
destroyed city
over the course of the Syrian
civil war.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They call it the Syrian
Stalingrad.

19:51.524 --> 19:57.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the whole time he was --
Majd is a very
Westernized young man.

19:58.030 --> 20:02.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I once asked them, looking at
the Assad regime,
what does your father say about
the Assad

20:02.968 --> 20:03.936 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
regime?

20:03.969 --> 20:04.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What were his views?

20:04.970 --> 20:06.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he said, we never talked
about it.

20:06.205 --> 20:09.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They never once talked politics
around the
dinner table.

20:09.675 --> 20:16.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The security state that existed
in Syria,
and still does, was so firm that
nobody would

20:16.916 --> 20:18.684 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
talk about it.

20:18.717 --> 20:22.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it goes to this idea that if
people can't
even talk about their political
aspirations,

20:22.321 --> 20:26.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when you have a rupture, how can
there be
a consensus of what is going to
take its place?

20:26.559 --> 20:27.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Scott Anderson
of The New
York Times.

20:28.027 --> 20:29.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The piece is fantastic.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the entire "New York Times
Magazine"
this weekend.

20:32.131 --> 20:33.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you for joining us.

20:33.132 --> 20:34.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCOTT ANDERSON: Thank you, Hari.

20:34.967 --> 20:38.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Scott
Anderson's work for
"The New York Times Magazine"
was supported

20:38.070 --> 20:40.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis
Reporting.

20:40.706 --> 20:50.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are a frequent partner of
the "NewsHour."

20:50.749 --> 20:57.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are a frequent partner of
the "NewsHour."

20:57.756 --> 21:02.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now back to the world of
politics, and
to the analysis of Brooks and
Dionne.

21:02.061 --> 21:06.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is New York Times columnist
David Brooks
and Washington Post columnist
E.J. Dionne.

21:06.866 --> 21:07.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Welcome.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mark Shields is away this week.

21:09.668 --> 21:13.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, let's pick up, gentlemen,
with where I
left off a few minutes ago with
Robert Costa

21:13.806 --> 21:15.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of The Washington Post.

21:15.708 --> 21:18.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
David, what a week for Donald
Trump.

21:18.077 --> 21:21.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I guess we all thought maybe
things were going
to slow down, but first there
was the comment

21:21.847 --> 21:26.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the Second Amendment that
-- seen by
some as a threat to Hillary
Clinton, and then

21:26.485 --> 21:27.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the ISIS comments.

21:27.920 --> 21:31.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do we interpret how Donald
Trump is communicating
with everybody?

21:31.757 --> 21:33.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, this isn't a
decision
he is making.

21:33.726 --> 21:35.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a condition he possesses.

21:35.594 --> 21:40.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're not used to talking
about the psychological
mental health of our candidates.

21:40.166 --> 21:42.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in some things, I think it's
not fair
to talk about his mental health,
in terms

21:42.835 --> 21:46.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of how he operates with his kids
in his private
life, but there is a such a
thing as public

21:46.672 --> 21:49.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
psychology and political
psychology.

21:49.675 --> 21:54.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in public, he obviously
displays extreme
narcissism, but most of all, he
displays a

21:54.847 --> 21:58.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
certain manic, hyperactive
attention.

21:58.150 --> 22:04.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so if you graph a Trump
sentence, every
eight-word verse, he's like
associative thinking.

22:04.623 --> 22:09.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there is a term in
psychology called the
flights of thought, where one
word sets off

22:09.228 --> 22:11.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an association, which sets off
an association.

22:11.697 --> 22:16.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as one psychiatrist said,
compare his
speeches to Robin Williams'
monologues, but

22:16.969 --> 22:19.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
without the jokes, but with
insults.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so he's not in control of
his own attention,
I don't believe.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, therefore, you get these
rambling, weird
sentences.

22:24.944 --> 22:27.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You get things he patently
shouldn't be saying.

22:27.246 --> 22:33.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then even this, I'm being
sarcastic about
the sarcasm, I'm obviously being
sarcastic,

22:33.452 --> 22:37.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then maybe a fifth a second
later, he
said, but not that much.

22:37.323 --> 22:40.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So he is contradicting himself
within 12 words.

22:40.192 --> 22:41.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's a condition.

22:41.994 --> 22:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, E.J., how are
we to understand
this, as people trying to
understand this

22:47.600 --> 22:48.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election?

22:48.601 --> 22:50.436 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
E.J.

22:50.469 --> 22:52.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIONNE: Well, I have been
thinking about it,
that there is the English
language and then

22:52.671 --> 22:54.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there's the Trump language.

22:54.573 --> 22:59.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the Trump language, words
change their
meaning day by day depending on
his own political

22:59.411 --> 23:01.146 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
needs.

23:01.180 --> 23:04.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I won't go into the learned
psychological
explanation that David gave, but
there are

23:04.984 --> 23:07.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of people now talking that
way about
him.

23:07.386 --> 23:11.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, politically, he doesn't
seem to care
much about what he says.

23:11.290 --> 23:13.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He gauges the effect.

23:13.125 --> 23:17.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sometimes, in the middle of a
speech, he will
change his direction if the
audience doesn't

23:17.062 --> 23:18.430 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like him.

23:18.464 --> 23:21.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I had a very instructive
trip this week
to York, Pennsylvania.

23:22.001 --> 23:25.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a conservative county,
Southern Pennsylvania,
not far from here.

23:25.504 --> 23:29.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the most interesting
conversations
I had was with Allison Cooper,
the editor

23:29.875 --> 23:31.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of The York Dispatch.

23:31.944 --> 23:37.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And talked about how people in
this very Republican
area -- York City is Democratic,
but the county

23:37.149 --> 23:42.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is very Republican -- are people
who care
about manners and decorum.

23:42.521 --> 23:47.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she spoke about -- what she
said is, common
decency is a core part of who
people are.

23:47.726 --> 23:51.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think in this campaign, we
have talked
about soccer moms, we have
talked about angry

23:51.430 --> 23:56.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
white men, and I think you're
starting to
develop common decency voters
who are just

23:56.635 --> 23:59.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reacting to what Trump says.

23:59.138 --> 24:04.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A Republican county commissioner
I talked
to up to there said that she's
been active

24:04.176 --> 24:06.011 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with veterans.

24:06.045 --> 24:09.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And after what Trump said about
the Khan family
and what he said about the
Purple Heart, she

24:09.581 --> 24:10.549 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
said, I can't vote for him.

24:10.582 --> 24:11.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The convention.

24:11.583 --> 24:13.319 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
E.J.

24:13.352 --> 24:15.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIONNE: And so something deep is
happening,
and it has nothing to do with
ideology or

24:15.087 --> 24:16.455 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
even party.

24:16.488 --> 24:18.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, meanwhile,
David, we're
trying to understand.

24:18.257 --> 24:25.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we just heard Robert Costa
reporting a
few minutes ago, leaders in the
party are

24:25.264 --> 24:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
betwixt and between trying to
figure out,
how do they deal with this?

24:28.133 --> 24:30.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's saying, I'm going to go my
own way.

24:30.436 --> 24:32.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They know they're not going to
separate from
him.

24:32.738 --> 24:36.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But how do we -- again, how do
we understand
the state of his campaign?

24:36.575 --> 24:38.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

24:38.377 --> 24:41.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, Josh Marshall of Talking
Points Memo
points out that, in today's
polling, if you

24:41.146 --> 24:46.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just take the states where
Clinton is up by
10 points or more, she has got
273 electoral

24:46.118 --> 24:47.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
votes, enough to win.

24:47.753 --> 24:49.455 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so that's 10 points more.

24:49.488 --> 24:54.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can we imagine a state where he
moves the
numbers in Wisconsin by 10
points?

24:54.626 --> 24:57.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That would be a huge and
unprecedented gain
at this stage.

24:57.496 --> 25:00.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so it's looking very bad for
him.

25:00.199 --> 25:02.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the Republicans have to
figure out
what to do.

25:02.267 --> 25:06.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so a lot of them are writing
open letters,
but even more are saying things
privately,

25:06.338 --> 25:08.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
let's get the RNC to defund the
campaign.

25:08.874 --> 25:10.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We just cut them off.

25:10.709 --> 25:15.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that either drives him crazy
and he quits,
or else at least we have got
more money for

25:15.414 --> 25:16.382 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our own people.

25:16.415 --> 25:17.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And to me, that's sort of
interesting.

25:17.816 --> 25:19.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Just take away the morality.

25:19.651 --> 25:22.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the morality is, you cut
off funding,
but just on political grounds,
do you think,

25:22.554 --> 25:26.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well, if we spend the money on
Senate campaigns,
at least we can shore those up.

25:26.458 --> 25:31.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the blunt fact is, if Trump
completely
collapses, and gets 38, 40, 42
percent of

25:31.530 --> 25:35.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the vote, then the tsunami is so
big, it probably
sweeps out a lot of the
congressional races,

25:36.001 --> 25:37.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
no matter what they spend on
locally.

25:37.469 --> 25:39.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, where to put the money is an
interesting
question.

25:39.405 --> 25:41.240 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
E.J.

25:41.273 --> 25:43.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIONNE: And Republicans are in a
real catch-22,
a lot of their candidates,
because they know

25:43.776 --> 25:49.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that if they get too close to
Trump, they
could lose a lot of voters in
the middle,

25:49.047 --> 25:54.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my common decency folks, but if
they cut him
off too aggressively, the Trump
constituency

25:54.286 --> 25:56.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is still a very big part of the
Republican
base.

25:56.755 --> 25:57.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There is still a
constituency
out there.

25:57.756 --> 25:58.991 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
E.J.

25:59.024 --> 26:00.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIONNE: And if they lose those
votes, they're
in trouble.

26:00.893 --> 26:04.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why I think you're
seeing timidity
and uncertainty on the
Republican side, because

26:04.730 --> 26:06.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they don't quite know what to do
with Trump.

26:06.665 --> 26:10.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And I would say,
it was interesting,
even after the Second Amendment
comment, and

26:10.135 --> 26:12.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all that, his poll numbers were
flat this
week.

26:12.337 --> 26:14.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In fact, he narrowed a little
with Clinton.

26:14.706 --> 26:18.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's possible we're seeing a
floor and that
he can't -- he can say all sorts
of crazy

26:18.944 --> 26:21.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things, but he's not getting
above or below
where he is.

26:21.680 --> 26:26.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: If the question
is, what are
the options for Republican
leaders, the options

26:26.318 --> 26:27.286 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are what?

26:27.319 --> 26:30.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Just to wait and watch and see
what happens?

26:30.088 --> 26:31.690 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
E.J.

26:31.723 --> 26:34.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIONNE: I think that the way --
partly, it
depends on individual
candidates.

26:34.626 --> 26:38.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are candidates in states
where they
know Trump is going to do very
badly, and

26:38.931 --> 26:41.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're already running away
from Trump.

26:41.600 --> 26:46.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are other candidates who
are, as I said,
worried about this mix of votes
they're going

26:46.572 --> 26:48.207 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to get.

26:48.240 --> 26:51.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, more and more, you're
seeing -- Republicans
for Clinton is a real deal.

26:51.710 --> 26:57.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Clinton Republican is kind
of the Reagan
Democrat of this election at
this point.

26:57.049 --> 27:01.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think more and more the
leadership is
going to look at the threat to
the Senate.

27:01.887 --> 27:07.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Senate is very shaky, their
control there
right -- on the numbers right
now, and say,

27:07.793 --> 27:12.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's not worth propping this guy
up, we have
got to let him go and support
our candidates.

27:12.097 --> 27:15.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meantime, David,
it wasn't
an especially great week for
Hillary Clinton,

27:15.901 --> 27:20.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in that she did -- today, we saw
she put out
her tax returns for the last
year, adding

27:20.305 --> 27:22.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to, I guess, a number of years.

27:22.174 --> 27:25.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But what the Trump camp
continues to say is,
wait a minute, we still want to
see those

27:25.878 --> 27:27.579 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
e-mails.

27:27.613 --> 27:30.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, there were a
couple of leaks
this week that make it look like
there was

27:30.182 --> 27:35.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something going on between the
Clinton Foundation
and Hillary Clinton's staff at
the State Department.

27:35.254 --> 27:39.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And it looks like
they were
soliciting money and then
exchanging access.

27:39.958 --> 27:44.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think that Clinton's
overall past
is not a surprise.

27:44.463 --> 27:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this is contrast, say, the
Obama coterie.

27:47.766 --> 27:51.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Obama coterie doesn't get in
mini-scandals.

27:51.169 --> 27:55.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Clintons' coterie gets in
constant mini-scandals.

27:55.707 --> 27:57.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's never decisive.

27:57.609 --> 28:01.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They never break their, end
their political
careers, but there's just the
whiff of scandal.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this goes back to the Rose
Law Firm.

28:03.048 --> 28:04.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This goes back for decades.

28:04.983 --> 28:09.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is just part of their
pattern, where
what they're doing is probably
not disqualifying.

28:09.221 --> 28:13.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we got rid of everybody in
Washington who
sold access for donations, then
the town would

28:13.992 --> 28:15.027 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be empty.

28:15.060 --> 28:17.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But it's unseemly.

28:17.362 --> 28:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think it rises to the
level of unseemly,
unseemliness, which confirms a
lot of the

28:21.833 --> 28:22.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
mistrust people have.

28:22.968 --> 28:24.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How much of a
problem is it
for her?

28:24.269 --> 28:26.038 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
E.J.

28:26.071 --> 28:28.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIONNE: Well, just to say, I
don't think we
have the evidence yet that they
sold access

28:28.740 --> 28:30.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for contributions.

28:30.042 --> 28:33.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Justice Department
decided not to
look into this.

28:33.845 --> 28:38.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nevertheless, I think the
existence of the
Clinton Foundation is a problem
for her.

28:38.283 --> 28:43.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My notion is that if she were
ever elected
president -- and if I were she,
I would announce

28:43.188 --> 28:46.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it ahead of time -- I would
announce that
for the duration of my
presidency, this is

28:46.959 --> 28:49.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to become the
Eisenhower-Kennedy Foundation.

28:49.962 --> 28:56.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's pick the two popular
presidents when
Bill and Hillary Clinton were
kids or were

28:56.234 --> 28:57.469 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
young.

28:57.502 --> 29:01.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let David and Susan Eisenhower,
Caroline Kennedy
be trustees.

29:01.173 --> 29:07.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just push this aside, because
you can even
borrow from Prince, formerly
known as the

29:07.079 --> 29:08.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Clinton Foundation.

29:08.880 --> 29:13.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you just don't want these
stories coming
out continually, even if there
is nothing

29:13.719 --> 29:15.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
actionable in terms of the law.

29:16.021 --> 29:20.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would just kind of push
this aside,
because you have never had a
chance where

29:20.359 --> 29:24.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a former president -- they all
have these
foundations of one kind of
another -- actually

29:24.396 --> 29:25.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has his spouse in the White
House.

29:25.964 --> 29:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They got to figure out what to
do with this.

29:27.866 --> 29:30.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, meantime,
you do have
-- there was this instance where
Hillary Clinton's

29:30.702 --> 29:34.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chief of staff at the State
Department went
up to New York and was involved
in important

29:34.873 --> 29:37.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
meetings at the Clinton
Foundation.

29:37.275 --> 29:39.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is there something wrong with
that, David?

29:39.311 --> 29:40.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I think minorly.

29:40.679 --> 29:42.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Apparently, she paid her own
way.

29:42.381 --> 29:44.182 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I think minorly.

29:44.216 --> 29:49.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As I say, the way life works,
not only in
Washington, but in every
business that I have

29:49.287 --> 29:54.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ever heard of, is that a friend
wants something
and you want them to give money
to a good

29:54.393 --> 29:58.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cause, and so, you know, people
join boards
of directors to make some
professional connections.

29:58.263 --> 30:01.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is no pure line between
those things.

30:01.400 --> 30:06.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, would it be better if there
was a pure
line in some ideal world?

30:06.471 --> 30:09.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Would it be better if the
Clintons didn't
have a predilection for blurring
every line

30:09.608 --> 30:10.575 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that they could?

30:10.609 --> 30:12.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That would be better.

30:12.377 --> 30:16.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, again, I think it's the
width, but I
don't think it's -- I can't get
super angry

30:16.548 --> 30:18.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about it, to be honest.

30:18.483 --> 30:20.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, E.J., you're
saying it's
-- you don't see anything there
that is actionable,

30:21.019 --> 30:21.987 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
actionable?

30:22.020 --> 30:23.288 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
E.J.

30:23.321 --> 30:25.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIONNE: I don't think we have
seen anything
actionable yet.

30:25.123 --> 30:27.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What the Clinton people are
saying is, look,
every big foundation of this
sort deals with

30:27.826 --> 30:31.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aides, or other problems in the
world, always
have interactions with the State
Department.

30:31.863 --> 30:36.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as I say, people are going
to keep asking
these questions as long as the
Clinton Foundation

30:36.802 --> 30:39.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is around and as long as she is
in public
life.

30:39.571 --> 30:44.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I'm against Trump's wall
with Mexico,
but they need some kind of wall
here to protect

30:44.776 --> 30:47.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
themselves and to kind of push
these stories
away.

30:47.279 --> 30:49.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: It would be a good
experiment
to know how much money they
would actually

30:49.948 --> 30:52.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
raise as the Truman-Kennedy
foundation.

30:52.484 --> 30:53.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It might be $1.29 a year, but...

30:53.485 --> 30:54.453 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
E.J.

30:54.486 --> 30:56.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DIONNE: Lot of love for both Ike
and JFK.

30:56.354 --> 30:58.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Not from foreign
lobbyists.

30:58.123 --> 31:01.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, meantime,
there are Clinton
e-mails still out there.

31:01.293 --> 31:06.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we expect they are going to
be out in
the -- leaked out into the
public arena between

31:06.364 --> 31:08.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
now and the election.

31:08.100 --> 31:11.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both Hillary Clinton and Donald
Trump said
something about their economic
plans this

31:11.703 --> 31:12.671 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
week.

31:12.704 --> 31:15.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
David, do we learn anything from
this?

31:15.407 --> 31:18.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's the bright line between
the two of
them?

31:18.043 --> 31:19.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, there
certainly are bright
lines.

31:19.044 --> 31:20.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was depressed by both of them.

31:20.645 --> 31:22.347 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

31:22.380 --> 31:25.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I think the
country, the economy
has some new, genuine
challenges.

31:25.617 --> 31:28.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have had incredibly laggard
growth.

31:28.453 --> 31:31.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Productivity increases have been
meager and
terrible.

31:31.890 --> 31:34.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hundreds -- millions of people
have dropped
out of the labor force.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These have all happened this
century.

31:36.895 --> 31:41.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to me, what both Clinton and
especially
Trump did was have economic
plans built for

31:42.000 --> 31:47.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
1973, as if we're going to have
labor-rich
manufacturing jobs come back.

31:47.139 --> 31:50.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Labor-rich manufacturing doesn't
exist anymore.

31:50.208 --> 31:54.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Manufacturing jobs are
white-collar, Silicon
Valley programmers or
highly-skilled technicians.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are not going to employ
lots of people.

31:57.682 --> 32:03.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we had two economic plans
that had,
in my view, very limited growth
agendas.

32:03.321 --> 32:06.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Infrastructure is good, but not
it.

32:06.091 --> 32:09.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Very limited productivity
agendas, and really
nothing to help people who are
out of the

32:09.661 --> 32:10.629 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
labor force.

32:10.662 --> 32:12.497 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, they were so unimaginative.

32:12.531 --> 32:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were sort of grab bags, in
Clinton's
case, of either the normal
policies that Democrats

32:15.467 --> 32:19.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been proposing 20 years,
or, in Trump's
case, a mixture of weird things
that are left

32:20.005 --> 32:21.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over from supply-side and
populism.

32:21.606 --> 32:23.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How did you read
all that?

32:23.608 --> 32:25.243 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
E.J.

32:25.277 --> 32:30.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIONNE: I saw -- I thought there
was more
growth and sort of
forward-looking stuff in

32:30.148 --> 32:31.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Clinton plan than David was.

32:31.983 --> 32:36.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was particularly struck that
she began her
speech by talking about the
inventiveness

32:36.655 --> 32:40.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of companies in Michigan and how
they were
taking advantage of change.

32:40.792 --> 32:44.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it reflected this issue that
Democrats
have to deal with.

32:44.596 --> 32:47.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They want to sort of talk about
how things
are a lot better than they were
eight years

32:47.999 --> 32:51.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago -- and they really are --
but if they
say that too much, they look out
of touch

32:51.870 --> 32:56.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with all the people who are
hurting, whereas
Trump, I thought, if you
listened carefully,

32:56.241 --> 32:59.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's giving the words to the
workers and money
to the rich.

32:59.110 --> 33:05.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The tax cuts that he has sort of
make Reagan
look like a -- you know, almost
like a Democrat.

33:05.483 --> 33:12.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, these are steep tax cuts
for the wealthy,
getting rid of the inheritance
tax, the estate

33:12.190 --> 33:14.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tax, which would be particularly
good, as
Hillary Clinton loves to point
out...

33:14.392 --> 33:15.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, he's
trimmed some of
the taxes...

33:15.393 --> 33:16.361 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
E.J.

33:16.394 --> 33:17.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DIONNE: I'm sorry?

33:17.829 --> 33:18.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He's trimmed some
of the tax
changes he's talked about.

33:18.430 --> 33:20.232 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
E.J.

33:20.265 --> 33:23.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIONNE: He trims it, but it's
still a huge
tax cut, with nothing, no talk
of compensation

33:23.301 --> 33:25.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the deficit or anything
else.

33:25.136 --> 33:31.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Hillary had fun saying that
this is really
good for Trump's family and his
friends, but

33:31.643 --> 33:33.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's not clear who it's going to
help.

33:33.445 --> 33:38.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know what the net of
this exchange
is, but I think you're seeing
is, Clinton

33:38.550 --> 33:42.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
is not going to leave
blue-collar voters to
Trump.

33:42.120 --> 33:43.889 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She is fighting for them.

33:43.922 --> 33:48.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a lot of what she's done in
the last two
or three weeks has been to try
to shore up

33:48.126 --> 33:51.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her position in those swing
states with a
lot of blue-collar voters.

33:51.529 --> 33:56.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, well,
we do get
a chance to talk about the
economy again.

33:56.601 --> 34:02.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we wanted to talk about the
wonderful
American results at the
Olympics, these young

34:02.073 --> 34:04.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
athletes who are performing so
well.

34:04.175 --> 34:05.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we're going to save that for
another time.

34:05.477 --> 34:06.978 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
E.J.

34:07.012 --> 34:10.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIONNE: Simone Manuel, Katie
Ledecky, Simone
Biles, they can all run in 2032.

34:10.482 --> 34:11.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

34:11.883 --> 34:14.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's a great lead, because
we have got
the Olympics coming up.

34:14.252 --> 34:21.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Brooks, E.J. Dionne, thank
you very
much.

34:21.993 --> 34:22.961 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
E.J.

34:22.994 --> 34:25.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DIONNE: Thank you.

34:25.864 --> 34:32.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Speaking of
which, to the big
wins and surprising loss at the
Olympics.

34:32.137 --> 34:37.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we near the completion of the
first week
of the Rio games, U.S. Olympians
have often

34:37.208 --> 34:41.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fulfilled and even exceeded
already sky-high
expectations.

34:41.246 --> 34:43.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Even so, there was a big upset
today.

34:43.949 --> 34:46.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown kicks off our
coverage tonight.

34:46.117 --> 34:52.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: First the bad
news, that upset
by Sweden of the U.S. Women's
Soccer Team

34:52.057 --> 34:55.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today, eliminating them from
competition.

34:55.060 --> 34:59.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the first time the women's
team failed
to advance to the semifinals in
a major tournament.

34:59.664 --> 35:05.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, last night, expectations
were sky-high,
and gymnast Simone Biles met
them, as she

35:05.870 --> 35:11.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
literally soared through the
individual all-around
competition to win her second
gold medal,

35:11.409 --> 35:14.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
confirming her place as the best
gymnast in
the world today.

35:14.212 --> 35:16.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And best ever Olympian?

35:16.448 --> 35:19.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many would put Michael Phelps
high on that
list.

35:19.117 --> 35:24.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, the 31-year-old
swimmer won the
200-meter individual medley for
the fourth

35:24.189 --> 35:28.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
consecutive Olympic Games and
his fourth gold
medal in these Games.

35:28.860 --> 35:35.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His astounding career tally now
stands at
22 gold medals, 26 Olympic
medals overall.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there was more history in
the pool.

35:38.069 --> 35:42.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Simone Manuel tied for fist in
the women's
100-meter freestyle, setting a
new Olympic

35:42.941 --> 35:48.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
record and becoming the first
African-American
woman to win an Olympic gold
medal in swimming.

35:48.213 --> 35:49.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SIMONE MANUEL, U.S. Olympic Gold
Medalist:
This medal isn't just for me.

35:49.914 --> 35:50.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's for a whole bunch of people
who have
came before me and have been an
inspiration

35:50.482 --> 35:51.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to me, Maritza, Cullen.

35:51.916 --> 35:53.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's for all the people
after me who believe
they can't do it.

35:53.318 --> 35:55.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I just want to be an
inspiration to others
that you can do it.

35:55.320 --> 35:56.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And for more on
these big events,
we go to Rio and once again to
Christine Brennan,

35:56.621 --> 35:57.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sportswriter and columnist
covering the Games
for USA Today.

35:57.422 --> 35:59.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's also a contributor for
CNN.

35:59.224 --> 36:00.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And hello again, Christine.

36:01.026 --> 36:03.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So let's go in that same order,
if we could.

36:04.029 --> 36:06.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First, the big loss today in
women's soccer.

36:06.965 --> 36:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What happened and how big a
loss?

36:08.400 --> 36:10.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN, USA Today:
It's huge, Jeff.

36:10.769 --> 36:13.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We hear that a lot in the
Olympics, but this
one is a very big deal.

36:13.371 --> 36:18.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. women have never lost
at this round
ever in a World Cup or an
Olympics.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So this is a first.

36:19.544 --> 36:21.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
To go out in the quarterfinals
is stunning.

36:21.613 --> 36:23.048 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What happened?

36:23.081 --> 36:25.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have been having a little
uneven play
throughout the tournament.

36:25.717 --> 36:27.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Goalkeeper Hope Solo has not
been at her best.

36:27.852 --> 36:30.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still, you would think that they
would get
by Sweden.

36:30.622 --> 36:36.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, interestingly, the Swedish
coach, Pia
Sundhage, was the U.S. coach for
two Olympic

36:36.361 --> 36:37.695 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Games.

36:37.729 --> 36:40.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is no one who knows the
Americans better
than Pia Sundhage.

36:40.198 --> 36:44.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, was able to coach her
Swedish team, bunch
up the middle, do a lot of
things, because

36:44.803 --> 36:46.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
she knows the U.S. so well.

36:46.371 --> 36:48.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think that's number one.

36:48.173 --> 36:52.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Number two, some classic
misfires, just not
playing well from some of the
top Americans.

36:52.277 --> 36:57.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, then, when you get to
penalty kicks,
as this game did, of course,
anything goes

36:57.048 --> 36:58.516 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at that point.

36:58.550 --> 37:01.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is the first Olympic
game ever to
be decided by penalty kicks.

37:01.319 --> 37:06.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, again, Hope Solo not as
great as she
has been.

37:06.357 --> 37:09.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I wonder how much the U.S.
team misses
Abby Wambach, of course, the
great star who

37:09.961 --> 37:11.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
retired after the World Cup last
year.

37:11.596 --> 37:13.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But think about this, Jeff.

37:13.465 --> 37:19.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thirteen months ago, this team
was the toast
of the country, just the
favorite of all sports

37:19.237 --> 37:20.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people of the year.

37:20.972 --> 37:25.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now to lose like this, well,
the only
positive I can come up with is
that it shows

37:25.176 --> 37:26.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that the world is catching up.

37:26.945 --> 37:31.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even the U.S. women, kind of
the Johnny
Appleseeds of the sport, sowing
those around

37:31.249 --> 37:35.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the world, would say that, when
they lose,
as devastating as that is,
there's also that

37:35.987 --> 37:40.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plus that around the world
people care more
and more about women's soccer,
thanks in large

37:40.658 --> 37:41.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
part to the U.S. team.

37:41.759 --> 37:43.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK.

37:43.061 --> 37:45.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, turning to some better news
for the U.S.,
Simone Biles.

37:45.730 --> 37:51.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you and I spoke before the
Games started,
we talked about, how could she
live up to

37:51.436 --> 37:52.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the expectations?

37:52.437 --> 37:53.605 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Well, she did.

37:53.638 --> 37:55.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: She did.

37:55.440 --> 37:58.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's one thing for all of us
to say she's
going to win the Olympic gold
medal in the

37:59.010 --> 38:03.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women's all-around, which is
kind of like
winning in the Winter Olympics
the women's

38:03.081 --> 38:04.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
figure skating medal.

38:04.082 --> 38:06.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's just like your name is
known forever.

38:06.151 --> 38:08.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You may never have to buy
yourself another
meal.

38:08.920 --> 38:12.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you are just one of the
stars of all-stars
of an Olympic Games.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's one thing to be everyone
saying you can
do it.

38:14.225 --> 38:16.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the other thing to actually
do it.

38:16.861 --> 38:18.329 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And there were no nerves.

38:18.363 --> 38:20.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This woman just cut right
through it.

38:20.465 --> 38:23.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think she's the greatest
gymnast of all
time, Jeff.

38:23.268 --> 38:25.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think she's that good.

38:25.136 --> 38:32.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's a combination of Mary Lou
Retton, going
back to Nadia Comaneci, then
Olga Korbut.

38:32.410 --> 38:36.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it's almost like she is
standing on
the shoulders of every gymnast
who came before

38:36.714 --> 38:38.383 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
her.

38:38.416 --> 38:42.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she is the culmination of an
entire sport
and the embodiment of an entire
sport.

38:42.921 --> 38:47.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's just that good, three-time
world champ,
now not only the U.S. team gold
medal the

38:47.859 --> 38:51.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
other day, but then the
individual all-around.

38:51.095 --> 38:57.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Simone Biles had the pressure of
the world
on her shoulders, and not only
did she deliver.

38:57.202 --> 39:00.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She was absolutely at her best
at the most
important moment of her life.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What more could you ask for than
that?

39:02.373 --> 39:05.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, so
speaking greatest
ever, then there's Michael
Phelps.

39:05.276 --> 39:11.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, beyond greatest swimmer to
discussion
of greatest Olympian ever, and
doing what

39:11.516 --> 39:13.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he's doing in his fifth
Olympics.

39:13.451 --> 39:15.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: I know.

39:15.253 --> 39:20.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's 31 years old, which I know
to you and
I that doesn't seem that old,
but for swimming

39:20.792 --> 39:22.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's going against teenagers
that are early
20-something.

39:22.794 --> 39:25.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I must admit, I'm surprised.

39:25.597 --> 39:28.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I knew he was going to be good,
and I knew
he might win a gold medal or
two.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think I even said that in our
previous conversation.

39:31.703 --> 39:35.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this is four gold medals,
with one more
chance tonight in the 100
butterfly, which

39:35.340 --> 39:36.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is going to be tough for him.

39:36.341 --> 39:37.809 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's going to be much closer.

39:37.842 --> 39:44.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he had a Katie Ledecky lead
in the 200
individual medley last night.

39:44.148 --> 39:46.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He has won the 200 butterfly.

39:46.484 --> 39:50.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has been the rock star of the
U.S. team
in two relays.

39:50.255 --> 39:56.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this really solidifies, I
think, over
the course of time, '04, '08,
'12 and '16,

39:56.494 --> 39:59.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to beat all comers, as a guy
who's 31.

39:59.797 --> 40:03.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I will say, maybe the
greatest moment
for me watching him was after
that relay.

40:03.768 --> 40:05.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In 70 minutes, he won two gold
medals.

40:05.670 --> 40:09.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But after the relay the other
night, he literally
sat down on the blocks and kind
of slumped

40:09.240 --> 40:13.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over like an old man, like
coming home from
a day of work, that he was
spent.

40:13.811 --> 40:14.912 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He had had it.

40:14.946 --> 40:18.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had thrown every ounce of his
energy into
that.

40:18.549 --> 40:20.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And what an Olympics for a guy.

40:20.418 --> 40:26.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a punctuation point of
all punctuation
points that I didn't even see
coming.

40:26.357 --> 40:28.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He has been that good.

40:28.192 --> 40:32.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, and
then finally
another very touching and
historic story in

40:32.597 --> 40:38.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the pool last night, the victory
by Simone
Manuel, who tied for the gold in
the 100-meter

40:38.703 --> 40:39.937 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
freestyle.

40:39.971 --> 40:44.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: You know,
Jeff, this is
so important.

40:44.208 --> 40:46.044 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The visual says everything.

40:46.077 --> 40:51.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, to me, as great as Katie
Ledecky has
been, as great as Michael Phelps
has been,

40:51.149 --> 40:56.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know if at the end of
the day we don't
come away with Simone Manuel
being that one

40:56.187 --> 41:02.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
image, because in basically a
lily-white sport,
a sport of suburban kids, which
is fine, all

41:02.994 --> 41:05.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of a sudden, you have an
African-American
woman becoming the first
African-American

41:05.396 --> 41:10.268 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
woman to win an Olympic gold
medal in swimming.

41:10.301 --> 41:17.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what that message is, as a
role model,
this is a sport that obviously
-- the skill

41:17.442 --> 41:22.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of learning to swim that many
swimmers talk
about, they have got to get into
the urban

41:22.046 --> 41:23.514 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
areas.

41:23.548 --> 41:26.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have got to get into the
places where
kids aren't able to go to pools.

41:26.751 --> 41:31.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Boy, Simone Manuel, this could
be the victory
for the ages in terms of her
ability to speak

41:31.956 --> 41:36.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to those issues, and for the
sport of swimming
just could be able to branch out
in ways it

41:36.794 --> 41:40.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hasn't, because, right now, it's
been kind
of contained into one
demographic.

41:40.698 --> 41:44.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to see that moment and that
tie with the
Canadian, and the way they
reacted to each

41:44.402 --> 41:46.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other, to me, that's what the
Olympics is
all about.

41:46.938 --> 41:49.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Christine Brennan
in Rio, thanks
so much.

41:50.007 --> 41:52.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Jeff, thank
you very much.

41:52.276 --> 41:56.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And we turn to
another big
story of these Games, away from
the medal

41:56.748 --> 41:58.549 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
podiums.

41:58.583 --> 42:01.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Across the globe today, there
are some 65
million people who've been
forced from their

42:01.886 --> 42:04.389 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
homes, an unprecedented number.

42:04.422 --> 42:07.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ten refugees are now on the
world stage in
Rio.

42:07.925 --> 42:14.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He didn't win the 100 meter
butterfly yesterday,
not even close, but 25-year-old
Rami Anis,

42:14.866 --> 42:21.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Syrian refugee now living in
Belgium, did
get a standing ovation;
18-year-old Yusra

42:21.539 --> 42:27.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mardini, also from Syria, won a
preliminary
heat in her race before failing
to advance

42:27.178 --> 42:28.646 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
further.

42:28.679 --> 42:32.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still, by the very special terms
she'd set
for herself, this was a victory.

42:32.250 --> 42:36.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YUSRA MARDINI, Refugee Olympic
Team: For the
refugees in Brazil, and all the
refugees around

42:37.021 --> 42:42.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the world, we are going to
represent you guys
in a really good picture.

42:43.027 --> 42:47.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I hope you are going to
learn from our
story that you have to move on,
because life

42:47.932 --> 42:52.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will never stop with your
problems or anything.

42:52.270 --> 42:57.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I hope that everyone will
continue to
achieve their dreams.

42:57.041 --> 43:01.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Just last year,
both Yusra
Mardini and Rami Anis made the
dangerous voyage

43:01.979 --> 43:07.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
across the Aegean Sea that's
become a symbol
of an international refugee
crisis.

43:07.919 --> 43:12.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Mardini's trip, the motor
failed and she
and her sister, also a swimmer,
were the only

43:12.690 --> 43:19.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ones strong enough to swim the
crowded boat
to safety.

43:20.031 --> 43:24.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One week ago, to a resounding
welcome, the
two young Syrians and eight
other athletes

43:24.836 --> 43:28.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made history as the first ever
Refugee Olympic
Team.

43:28.840 --> 43:34.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Filippo Grandi, U.N. high
commissioner for
refugees, was there, and spoke
with us yesterday

43:34.345 --> 43:36.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from his Geneva headquarters.

43:36.214 --> 43:38.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI, United Nations
High Commissioner
for Refugees: I was so nervous,
like if I

43:38.416 --> 43:40.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was going to give an exam, I can
tell you.

43:40.885 --> 43:45.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we had to wait for the whole
ceremony,
because they were the last but
one team to

43:45.623 --> 43:48.626 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
enter before the hosts, Brazil.

43:48.659 --> 43:51.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And when they entered, the
emotion was unlimited.

43:51.262 --> 43:56.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The UNHCR worked
with the International
Olympic Commission to create the
team, holding

43:56.868 --> 44:01.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tryouts in refugee camps such as
the huge
Kakuma camp in Kenya.

44:01.639 --> 44:05.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those who made the cut got the
help of world-class
coaches to prepare for Rio.

44:05.643 --> 44:12.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: We started
talking about that
project in the midst of the most
negative

44:12.316 --> 44:18.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
global discussion on refugees
and migrants
during the Europe crisis.

44:18.189 --> 44:24.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it was really a reversal of
that approach,
that vision.

44:24.996 --> 44:27.465 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It was positive.

44:27.498 --> 44:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It emphasized achievement.

44:29.166 --> 44:31.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It emphasized contributions by
refugees.

44:31.802 --> 44:37.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Five runners who
fled war in
South Sudan as children made it
to Rio; 21-year-old

44:37.174 --> 44:43.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yiech Pur Biel made his Olympics
debut this
afternoon in the 800-meter
competition.

44:43.347 --> 44:49.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anjelina Nadai Lohalith will run
on Saturday
in the 1,500 meter race;
28-year-old James

44:49.754 --> 44:54.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nyang Chiengjiek will run the
400-meter dash
Saturday well.

44:54.425 --> 44:59.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Paulo Lokoro, 24 years old, is a
middle-distance
runner who escaped the war in
2006.

44:59.664 --> 45:01.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He runs next Tuesday.

45:01.933 --> 45:06.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rose Nathike Lokonyen made the
team despite
having to run barefoot in
tryouts in the refugee

45:06.737 --> 45:08.272 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
camp.

45:08.306 --> 45:10.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROSE NATHIKE LOKONYEN, Refugee
Olympic Team:
We compete among the refugees.

45:10.608 --> 45:14.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then it happened that some of
us, we ran without
shoe.

45:14.946 --> 45:17.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Like me, I was just running
barefoot.

45:17.315 --> 45:21.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Filippo Grandi
visited the
five as they trained in Kenya,
and it was

45:21.285 --> 45:26.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there he became convinced this
refugee team
could both compete with
world-class athletes,

45:26.390 --> 45:28.326 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and have an impact beyond Rio.

45:28.359 --> 45:32.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: We knew that
these were people
coming from hardship, often
living in difficult

45:32.430 --> 45:37.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conditions in refugee camps,
having gone through
very difficult situations.

45:37.635 --> 45:42.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, for them to step up to those
technical
levels would be difficult.

45:42.273 --> 45:47.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But we knew that would
compensate by enthusiasm,
by commitment, and by the strong
message that

45:47.778 --> 45:50.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they would bring to the Olympic
Games.

45:50.414 --> 45:56.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The oldest member
of the refugee
team is 36-year-old marathoner
Yonas Kinde.

45:56.087 --> 46:00.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He fled Ethiopia in 2013, and
now has asylum
in Luxembourg.

46:01.025 --> 46:05.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And filling out the group, two
refugees from
the Democratic Republic of
Congo, who competed

46:05.696 --> 46:11.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in judo earlier this week;
28-year-old Yolande
Mabika lost her parents to war
and first took

46:11.736 --> 46:15.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
up judo in a center for
displaced children
in Kinshasa.

46:15.573 --> 46:21.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She lost her first-round match
on Wednesday;
24-year-old Popole Misenga won
his first bout

46:21.379 --> 46:24.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
before losing to a world
champion from South
Korea.

46:24.782 --> 46:28.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Misenga's mother was killed when
he was 9,
and he's not seen his siblings
since.

46:28.486 --> 46:32.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
POPOLE MISENGA, Refugee Olympic
Team (through
translator): I am here, in
Brazil.

46:32.623 --> 46:37.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I'm participating in the
Olympics, and I thank
God for that.

46:37.895 --> 46:42.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If my brother can see me on TV,,
to know your
brother is here in Brazil,
striving to maybe

46:42.800 --> 46:48.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see him, be one day together, I
send him hugs
wherever he is, and I am
thinking of him here

46:48.205 --> 46:49.407 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Brazil.

46:49.440 --> 46:52.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I hope to bring all my
family close to
me, to see them.

46:52.209 --> 46:53.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's been such a long time.

46:53.978 --> 46:58.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The two judo
competitors have
received asylum in Brazil three
years ago.

46:58.849 --> 47:03.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Olympic host nation, a land
of immigrants,
has welcomed many recent
asylum-seekers.

47:03.421 --> 47:09.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hanan Dacka, a 12-year-old
Syrian refugee,
was chosen as an Olympic
torchbearer in the

47:09.593 --> 47:12.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
capital city of Brasilia earlier
this year.

47:12.396 --> 47:17.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a symbolic moment greeted
warmly by
onlookers, just as an
international audience

47:17.435 --> 47:20.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
has embraced the refugee
athletes at the Rio
Games.

47:20.871 --> 47:22.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But will it last?

47:22.540 --> 47:26.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Filippo Grandi hopes the world
sees beyond
these 10 to the millions of
others.

47:26.610 --> 47:33.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: Refugees are not
just a number,
are not just 60 million people,
all the same.

47:33.517 --> 47:40.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Refugees, each refugee is an
individual with
a profoundly difficult personal
history.

47:40.858 --> 47:50.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I hope that the personal
histories of
these 10 athletes will
illustrate this important

47:50.134 --> 47:55.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
characteristic of refugees that
is too often
forgotten, because too often we
concentrate

47:55.272 --> 48:01.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on big numbers, on the
consequences of flows
of millions of people and the
impact that

48:01.512 --> 48:03.280 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they have.

48:03.314 --> 48:07.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we forget that each one of
them is a person
with a history that needs to be
addressed

48:07.118 --> 48:08.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
individually as well.

48:08.953 --> 48:13.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The hope, that
is, is for an
Olympic moment that goes beyond
gold medals.

48:13.424 --> 48:20.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm Jeffrey Brown for the "PBS
NewsHour."

48:20.164 --> 48:31.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, to
another of our
Brief But Spectacular episodes,
where we ask

48:31.709 --> 48:34.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interesting people to describe
their passion.

48:34.311 --> 48:39.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier, we heard what was
driving the recent
chaos witnessed in the Middle
East.

48:39.183 --> 48:45.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now we hear a more personal take
from photojournalist
Lynsey Addario, whose work
appears regularly

48:45.256 --> 48:49.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in The New York Times, "National
Geographic,"
and "TIME" magazine.

48:49.794 --> 48:54.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Having covered conflict around
the globe,
from the Taliban in Afghanistan
to turmoil

48:54.765 --> 49:00.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in Libya, where she was
kidnapped in 2011,
she writes her experiences in a
memoir, "It's

49:00.638 --> 49:02.373 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What I Do."

49:02.406 --> 49:04.341 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
LYNSEY ADDARIO,
Author/Photographer, "It's
What I Do": "If your pictures
aren't good

49:04.375 --> 49:05.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
enough, you're not close
enough."

49:05.810 --> 49:07.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's a classic Robert Capa
quote.

49:07.444 --> 49:09.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He was a very famous war
photographer.

49:09.680 --> 49:10.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's the truth.

49:10.881 --> 49:12.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We cannot do our jobs from
further back.

49:13.017 --> 49:14.985 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I have to care.

49:15.019 --> 49:20.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I have to bring myself
emotionally closer
to the subject.

49:20.057 --> 49:25.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I believe in these stories.

49:25.629 --> 49:26.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I believe they have to be told.

49:26.964 --> 49:29.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so I force myself to go to
these places.

49:29.300 --> 49:32.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not an adrenaline rush and
it's not an
addiction.

49:32.970 --> 49:39.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been kidnapped twice,
once in Garma,
which is a village outside
Fallujah, by Sunni

49:39.109 --> 49:41.178 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
insurgents, and once in Libya.

49:41.212 --> 49:43.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was sure we were about to die.

49:43.480 --> 49:45.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And all I can think about is
really?

49:45.749 --> 49:48.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this where I'm going to see
the end of
my life?

49:48.752 --> 49:50.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What am I doing here?

49:50.988 --> 49:52.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why is it so important for me to
be here?

49:53.023 --> 49:58.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have to ask myself those
questions,
because a big part of this job
is knowing

49:58.262 --> 50:02.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that we might die at any given
time.

50:02.900 --> 50:05.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People always ask, like, are you
stoic when
you're shooting?

50:05.836 --> 50:07.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I am anything but stoic.

50:07.671 --> 50:12.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I'm watching someone die, I
become very
overwhelmed with emotion, and
I'm crying as

50:12.710 --> 50:14.511 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm shooting.

50:14.545 --> 50:18.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it would be really
strange if I didn't
cry when I saw the things I see,
because I

50:18.716 --> 50:26.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see some of the most horrific
things and some
of the most beautiful things.

50:26.457 --> 50:29.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Being a war photographer comes
with great
sacrifice.

50:29.293 --> 50:31.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's almost impossible to have a
personal
life.

50:31.428 --> 50:37.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The amount of psychological and
physical trauma
that each one of us carries with
us from covering

50:37.167 --> 50:41.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
war over many, many years is
extraordinary.

50:41.171 --> 50:46.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I first started doing this
job, I had
a really hard time reconciling
the fact that

50:46.510 --> 50:50.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
life went on outside of these
war zones, and
I would come back to New York,
and everyone

50:50.547 --> 50:52.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was at a bar getting drunk and
having fun.

50:52.883 --> 50:55.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I was so confused.

50:55.552 --> 51:00.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't understand why no one
cares, and people
aren't out on the street
protesting.

51:00.157 --> 51:05.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had to make a decision at some
point that
if I was going to lead this
life, I had to

51:06.030 --> 51:12.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not leave behind the things I
have seen, but
be present when I go home to be
with my family

51:12.102 --> 51:14.438 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and my husband and my son.

51:14.471 --> 51:16.373 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have to be there for them.

51:16.407 --> 51:24.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was so frustrated by people
being so dismissive
of the deeper reasons why anyone
would cover

51:24.448 --> 51:26.050 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
war.

51:26.083 --> 51:30.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's about educating people,
policy-makers,
talking about human rights
abuses.

51:30.354 --> 51:34.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once a photographer starts
seeing the impact
of his or her work, it's
impossible to turn

51:34.925 --> 51:35.893 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
away.

51:35.926 --> 51:39.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, it's impossible to stop
doing it.

51:39.196 --> 51:45.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My name is Lynsey Addario, and
this is my
Brief But Spectacular take on
life as a photojournalist.

51:45.769 --> 51:48.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

And a reminder about some
upcoming programs
from our PBS colleagues.

52:16.800 --> 52:20.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gwen Ifill is preparing for
"Washington Week,"
which airs later tonight.

52:20.104 --> 52:21.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's a preview:

52:21.105 --> 52:22.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Hi, Judy.
