00:17.818 --> 00:19.586
>> WHEN THE GOVERNMENT

00:19.586 --> 00:21.521
INTRODUCED FREE PRIMARY SCHOOL,

00:21.521 --> 00:23.323
IT WAS LIKE EVERY CHILD WANTED

TO JOIN SCHOOL.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.327
>> Sreenivasan: AND, ALEX KATZ,

THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.409
THE UNITED STATES IS CALLING ON

SETTLEMENT TO THE FOUR-AND-HALF-

00:45.545 --> 00:47.781
YEAR-OLD SYRIAN CIVIL WAR.

00:47.781 --> 00:49.516
THE U.S. WANTS SYRIAN PRESIDENT

00:49.516 --> 00:51.418
BASHAR AL-ASSAD TO BE REPLACED,

00:51.418 --> 00:53.620
BUT RUSSIA SUPPORTS ASSAD,

00:53.620 --> 00:55.255
RECENTLY BEGAN RE-ARMING HIS

00:55.255 --> 00:56.823
TROOPS, AND DEPLOYING FIGHTER

00:56.823 --> 00:57.624
JETS AND HELICOPTERS TO A SYRIAN

00:57.624 --> 00:59.826
BASE YESTERDAY.

00:59.826 --> 01:01.328
IN LONDON TODAY, AFTER

01:01.328 --> 01:02.996
CONFERRING WITH BRITAIN'S

01:02.996 --> 01:04.097
FOREIGN MINISTER, SECRETARY OF

STATE JOHN KERRY CALLED ON

01:05.299 --> 01:06.600
RUSSIA AND IRAN AND ANY OTHER

01:06.600 --> 01:07.834
COUNTRIES WITH INFLUENCE OVER

01:07.834 --> 01:10.737
SYRIA TO PUSH FOR NEGOTIATIONS.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.006
>> WE'RE PREPARED TO NEGOTIATE,

01:13.006 --> 01:14.141
IS ASSAD PREPARED TO NEGOTIATE?

01:14.141 --> 01:15.909
REALLY NEGOTIATE?

01:15.909 --> 01:18.111
IS RUSSIA PREPARED TO BRING HIM

01:18.111 --> 01:19.479
TO THE TABLE AND ACTUALLY FIND

01:19.479 --> 01:21.548
THE SOLUTION TO THIS VIOLENCE?

01:21.548 --> 01:23.283
>> Sreenivasan: BECAUSE THE U.S.

01:23.283 --> 01:25.185
ALSO HAS A MILITARY PRESENCE IN

01:25.185 --> 01:27.020
THE REGION, THE U.S. AND RUSSIAN

01:27.020 --> 01:28.922
DEFENSE SECRETARIES HAVE BEGUN

01:28.922 --> 01:30.090
TALKING TO AVOID A DIRECT

01:30.090 --> 01:30.791
CONFLICT BETWEEN U.S. AND

01:30.791 --> 01:32.726
RUSSIAN FORCES.

01:32.726 --> 01:34.594
FOR A YEAR, THE U.S. HAS

01:34.594 --> 01:35.629
LAUNCHED AIRSTRIKES ON ISLAMIC

01:35.629 --> 01:36.363
STATE, OR ISIS, MILITANTS INSIDE

01:36.363 --> 01:37.664
SYRIA."

01:37.664 --> 01:38.765
NEW YORK TIMES" CORRESPONDENT

01:38.765 --> 01:39.766
MICHAEL GORDON IS TRAVELING WITH

01:39.766 --> 01:40.968
SECRETARY KERRY.

01:40.968 --> 01:41.702
HE JOINS ME NOW VIA SKYPE, FROM

01:41.702 --> 01:44.871
LONDON.

01:44.871 --> 01:45.639
THERE'S BEEN AN ESCALATION OF

01:45.639 --> 01:47.507
MILITARY ACTIVITY FROM RUSSIA

01:47.507 --> 01:48.608
INTO SYRIA.

01:48.608 --> 01:50.310
WHAT DOES THE U.S. PLAN TO DO

01:50.310 --> 01:50.911
ABOUT IT?

01:50.911 --> 01:52.412
>> WELL, BASICALLY, THE UNITED

01:52.412 --> 01:55.315
STATES TRIED TO STOP IT.

01:55.315 --> 01:57.484
ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO, THE

01:57.484 --> 01:58.452
RUSSIANS BEGAN FLOWING EQUIPMENT

01:58.452 --> 02:03.023
TO AN AIRBASE SOUTH OF LATVIA.

02:03.023 --> 02:04.057
AND INITIALLY THE AMERICANS

02:04.057 --> 02:06.093
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON.

02:06.093 --> 02:10.430
BUT THEY'VE DEPLOYED HOUSING

02:10.430 --> 02:12.065
NOW, THEY'VE DEPLOYED MORE THAN

02:12.065 --> 02:13.233
200 MARINES TO PROTECT THE BASE,

02:13.233 --> 02:17.204
SOME TANKS, SOME ARTILLERY, SOME

02:17.204 --> 02:18.105
ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIES.

02:18.105 --> 02:19.740
NOW THEY HAVE AIR DEFENSE AND

02:19.740 --> 02:22.542
SEVERAL AIRCRAFT ARMED WITH

02:22.542 --> 02:23.210
AIR-TO-AIR MISSILES.

02:23.210 --> 02:24.678
AND THE HOPE INITIALLY WAS TO

02:24.678 --> 02:25.912
STOP IT, AND THE OBAMA

02:25.912 --> 02:27.280
ADMINISTRATION TRIED TO GET

02:27.280 --> 02:29.182
STATES IN THE REGION TO CLOSE

02:29.182 --> 02:31.184
THEIR AIR SPACE, BUT IRAQ DIDN'T

02:31.184 --> 02:33.086
GO ALONG, AND THE RUSSIANS ARE

02:33.086 --> 02:34.254
THERE, AND NOW THEY

02:34.254 --> 02:35.922
ARE TRYING TO MAKE THE BEST OF

02:35.922 --> 02:36.390
IT.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.424
>> Sreenivasan: THE RUSSIANS

02:37.424 --> 02:39.426
SAY THESE ARE PRIMARILY

02:39.426 --> 02:41.561
DEFENSIVE POSITIONS OR POSTURES,

02:41.561 --> 02:42.229
RIGHT?

02:42.229 --> 02:46.099
>> WELL, THE RUSSIANS ARE

02:46.099 --> 02:48.969
DEPLOYING SYSTEMS TO SYRIA WITH

02:48.969 --> 02:50.904
AN EYE TOWARD, THEY SAY,

02:50.904 --> 02:52.272
FIGHTING THE ISLAMIC STATE.

02:52.272 --> 02:54.741
SO, YES, THEY'VE DEPLOYED FORCE

02:54.741 --> 02:57.110
PROTECTION AROUND THIS BASE, BUT

02:57.110 --> 02:59.980
THEY'RE GOING THERE, OSTENSIBLY,

02:59.980 --> 03:03.116
TO HELP THE ASSAD REGIME FIGHT

03:03.116 --> 03:04.718
THE ISLAMIC STATE MILITANTS.

03:04.718 --> 03:08.288
SO IT'S NOT A PURELY DEFENSIVE

03:08.288 --> 03:08.989
CONFIGURATION.

03:08.989 --> 03:10.123
AND THE CONCERN THAT THE

03:10.123 --> 03:11.358
AMERICANS HAVE IS SINCE THEY

03:11.358 --> 03:12.559
COULDN'T STOP THEM FROM GETTING

03:12.559 --> 03:14.861
THERE AND THE RUSSIAN IGNORED

03:14.861 --> 03:17.464
THEIR WARNINGS, HOW DO YOU

03:17.464 --> 03:18.565
DECONFLICT SO THE RUSSIAN

03:18.565 --> 03:21.168
AIRCRAFT AND THE AMERICAN-LED

03:21.168 --> 03:22.736
AIR CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE ISLAMIC

03:22.736 --> 03:23.837
STATE DON'T BUMP INTO EACH OTHER

03:23.837 --> 03:25.939
AND YOU DON'T HAVE AN INCIDENT.

03:25.939 --> 03:26.973
>> Sreenivasan: SO THAT MEANS

03:26.973 --> 03:28.241
THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE

03:28.241 --> 03:29.709
COORDINATION ON FIGURING OUT

03:29.709 --> 03:30.811
WHEN THERE ARE PERHAPS RUSSIAN

03:30.811 --> 03:32.479
BOOTS ON THE GROUND AND WHEN

03:32.479 --> 03:34.614
THERE ARE AMERICAN DRONES FLYING

03:34.614 --> 03:35.715
OVERHEAD, MAYBE GOING AFTER THE

03:35.715 --> 03:37.050
SAME ISIL TARGETS.

03:37.050 --> 03:40.487
>> THE AMERICANS HAVE WAR PLANES

03:40.487 --> 03:42.155
OVERHEAD, NOT JUST DRONES.

03:42.155 --> 03:43.590
AND NOT ONLY THE AMERICANS NOW.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.659
THERE ARE ARAB NATIONS INVOLVED,

03:45.659 --> 03:47.260
TURKEY AIR FORCE IS INVOLVE, THE

03:47.260 --> 03:49.396
BRITS HAVE A DRONE, THE FRENCH

03:49.396 --> 03:50.297
MAY JOIN IN.

03:50.297 --> 03:52.032
SO YOU HAVE AIRCRAFT THAT ARE

03:52.032 --> 03:53.433
OPERATING, AND NOT JUST DRONES,

03:53.433 --> 03:56.570
OVER SYRIA, CARRYING OUT AIR

03:56.570 --> 03:58.538
STRIKES, AND YOU ARE-- THESE ARE

03:58.538 --> 04:00.407
NOT REALLY RUSSIAN BOOTS ON THE

04:00.407 --> 04:01.007
GROUND.

04:01.007 --> 04:02.709
THESE ARE RUSSIAN-- PRESUMABLY

04:02.709 --> 04:05.612
IT'S GOING TO BE RUSSIAN

04:05.612 --> 04:06.012
AIRPOWER.

04:06.012 --> 04:08.181
IT HASN'T TAKEN ANY ACTION YET.

04:08.181 --> 04:10.317
AND THEY WILL HAVE TO DECONFLICT

04:10.317 --> 04:12.185
SO THEY DON'T GET IN EACH

04:12.185 --> 04:13.520
OTHER'S WAY AND DON'T HAVE AN

04:13.520 --> 04:14.020
INCIDENT.

04:14.020 --> 04:15.355
THE AMERICAN CONCERN GOES WELL

04:15.355 --> 04:16.022
BEYOND THAT.

04:16.022 --> 04:17.724
THEY'RE WORRIED THAT THERE'S A

04:17.724 --> 04:19.426
HIDDEN RUSSIAN AGENDA HERE--

04:19.426 --> 04:23.563
PERHAPS NOT SO HIDDEN-- THAT THE

04:23.563 --> 04:24.931
RUSSIANS MAY BE THERE TO PROP UP

04:24.931 --> 04:26.700
BASHAR AL-ASSAD, AND KEEP HIM IN

04:26.700 --> 04:28.768
POWER, AT LEAST FOR A DURATION,

04:28.768 --> 04:29.970
AND THAT THE RUSSIANS MAY ALSO

04:29.970 --> 04:32.005
BE THIS IN THE EVENT THAT ASSAD

04:32.005 --> 04:33.106
IS OVERTHROWN THEY WANT TO

04:33.106 --> 04:33.940
INFLUENCE AND HELP DETERMINE

04:33.940 --> 04:36.543
WHAT THE NEW LEADERSHIP OF THE

04:36.543 --> 04:37.511
COUNTRY LOOKS LIKE.

04:37.511 --> 04:38.845
>> Sreenivasan: AND KEEPING

04:38.845 --> 04:40.747
ASSAD IN POWER IS STILL IN

04:40.747 --> 04:41.915
DIRECT OPPOSITION TO WHAT THE

04:41.915 --> 04:43.517
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WANTS,

04:43.517 --> 04:46.486
RIGHT?

04:46.486 --> 04:47.220
>> YES.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.522
BUT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

04:48.522 --> 04:50.090
HASN'T DONE VERY MUCH TO GET

04:50.090 --> 04:51.591
ASSAD OUT OF POWER.

04:51.591 --> 04:54.494
ALL OF THE AIR STRIKES IN SYRIA

04:54.494 --> 04:56.930
ARE NOT AIMED AT ANY OF ASSAD'S

04:56.930 --> 04:57.264
FORCES.

04:57.264 --> 04:58.565
THEY'RE AIMED AT THE ISLAMIC

04:58.565 --> 05:00.267
STATE, AND, INDEED, THE

05:00.267 --> 05:01.935
PENTAGON'S TRAINING PROGRAM THAT

05:01.935 --> 05:04.070
HAS FAILED SO MISERABLY, ONE

05:04.070 --> 05:06.540
REASON IT FAILED IS THE REBELS

05:06.540 --> 05:08.041
WHO ARE BEING RECRUITED WERE

05:08.041 --> 05:09.476
BEING TOLD THEY COULDN'T FIGHT

05:09.476 --> 05:10.510
THE ASSAD REGIME.

05:10.510 --> 05:11.711
THEY WERE THERE ONLY TO FIGHT

05:11.711 --> 05:12.746
THE ISLAMIC STATE.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.781
WELL, SURPRISE, SURPRISE, NOT A

05:14.781 --> 05:16.550
LOT OF SYRIANS WANTED TO JOIN

05:16.550 --> 05:18.151
FOR THAT REASON ALONE.

05:18.151 --> 05:18.818
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

05:18.818 --> 05:19.686
MICHAEL GORDON OF THE "NEW YORK

05:19.686 --> 05:21.555
TIMES" JOINING US HAVE A SKYPE

05:21.555 --> 05:22.255
FROM LONDON TODAY.

05:22.255 --> 05:22.923
THANKS SO MUCH.

05:22.923 --> 05:27.427
>> OKAY, THANK YOU.

05:27.427 --> 05:28.261
>> Sreenivasan: THE SYRIAN CIVIL

05:28.261 --> 05:29.362
WAR HAS CAUSED FOUR MILLION

05:29.362 --> 05:30.397
PEOPLE TO FLEE FOR NEIGHBORING

05:30.397 --> 05:31.731
LEBANON, JORDAN, AND TURKEY, AND

05:31.731 --> 05:32.999
INCREASINGLY FOR EUROPE.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.267
NOW, MORE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE

05:34.267 --> 05:35.302
TIGHTENING BORDERS.

05:35.302 --> 05:36.469
CROATIA AND SLOVENIA, WHICH

05:36.469 --> 05:40.574
BORDER HUNGARY AND AUSTRIA, ARE

05:40.574 --> 05:41.308
NOW AT THE CENTER OF A REFUGEE

05:41.308 --> 05:42.075
LOGJAM.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.109
CROATIA HAS SEEN 20,000 MIGRANTS

05:43.109 --> 05:44.477
AND REFUGEES ARRIVE IN THE PAST

05:44.477 --> 05:46.279
FEW DAYS, WITH MANY CONTINUING

05:46.279 --> 05:47.280
ONTO SLOVENIA TO GET TO AUSTRIA

05:47.280 --> 05:49.282
AND WESTERN EUROPE.

05:49.282 --> 05:51.084
BUT TODAY, SLOVENIA SUSPENDED

05:51.084 --> 05:52.018
TRAINS FROM CROATIA TO SLOW THE

05:52.018 --> 05:54.154
ARRIVALS.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.855
LAST NIGHT, SLOVENIAN POLICE

05:55.855 --> 05:57.357
USED PEPPER SPRAY TO STOP

05:57.357 --> 05:58.158
MIGRANTS AT ITS BORDER WITH

05:58.158 --> 05:59.759
CROATIA.

05:59.759 --> 06:01.194
TURKEY'S COAST GUARD TODAY

06:01.194 --> 06:02.596
RESCUED TWO HUNDRED SYRIAN

06:02.596 --> 06:04.164
REFUGEES IN THE AEGEAN SEA.

06:04.164 --> 06:06.099
THEY WERE AIMING FOR GREECE,

06:06.099 --> 06:08.301
WHILE ITALIAN SHIPS RESCUED

06:08.301 --> 06:09.536
4,000 MIGRANTS FROM LIBYA ABOARD

FISHING BOATS AND RUBBER RAFTS.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.506
470,000 REFUGEES HAVE CROSSED

06:13.506 --> 06:14.307
THE AEGEAN AND MEDITERRANEAN

06:14.307 --> 06:16.309
SEAS THIS YEAR.

06:16.309 --> 06:17.911
2,800 HAVE DIED TRYING.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.346
EUROPEAN LEADERS MEET AGAIN ON

06:19.346 --> 06:20.880
WEDNESDAY IN BRUSSELS TO DEBATE

06:20.880 --> 06:21.915
HOW TO HANDLE ASYLUM SEEKERS

06:21.915 --> 06:23.950
ACROSS THE CONTINENT.

06:23.950 --> 06:25.452
JAPAN IS REVERSING 70 YEARS OF

06:25.452 --> 06:26.920
MILITARY RESTRAINT BY CLEARING

06:26.920 --> 06:27.854
THE WAY FOR TROOP DEPLOYMENTS

06:27.854 --> 06:29.623
OVERSEAS.

06:29.623 --> 06:30.890
TODAY, THE JAPANESE PARLIAMENT

06:30.890 --> 06:32.425
APPROVED A CONTROVERSIAL POLICY

06:32.425 --> 06:34.394
TO ALLOW ITS MILITARY TO DEFEND

06:34.394 --> 06:36.229
ALLIES IN OTHER NATIONS, EVEN

06:36.229 --> 06:38.331
WHEN JAPAN IS NOT UNDER ATTACK.

06:38.331 --> 06:40.166
PRIME MINISTER SHINZO ABE, WHO

06:40.166 --> 06:41.568
PUSHED FOR THE POLICY, CALLS

06:41.568 --> 06:43.436

OPPONENTS CALL THE NEW POLICY"

06:50.677 --> 06:52.379
UNCONSTITUTIONAL."

06:52.379 --> 06:53.880
THE U.S. ARMY IS POISED TO HAVE

06:53.880 --> 06:54.814
ITS FIRST OPENLY GAY CIVILIAN

06:54.814 --> 06:56.016

MORE THAN 250 TIMES.

19:32.371 --> 19:36.575
>> ADA'S LIKE A PERFECT MODEL.

19:36.575 --> 19:37.676
PICASSO WOULD HAVE JUMPED AT

19:37.676 --> 19:39.311
HER.

19:39.311 --> 19:39.979
HER MEASUREMENTS WAS MISS

19:39.979 --> 19:42.181
AMERICA.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.583
ADA LITERALLY STOPPED THE

19:44.583 --> 19:45.351
TRAFFIC THE FIRST TIME SHE CAME

19:45.351 --> 19:47.686
IN A BATHING SUIT.

19:47.686 --> 19:48.654
SHE USED TO-- SHE GOES ON A

19:48.654 --> 19:50.856
BEACH, GUYS FALL OVER.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.558
>> Reporter: THE COLBY COLLEGE

19:52.558 --> 19:53.859
MUSEUM, IN MAINE, HOUSES THE

19:53.859 --> 19:55.494
LARGEST KATZ COLLECTION

19:55.494 --> 19:57.730
ANYWHERE: 850 WORKS.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.432
COLBY NOW HAS AN EXHIBIT

19:59.432 --> 20:00.533
FOCUSING ON KATZ'S EARLY WORK,

20:00.533 --> 20:02.568
FROM THE 1950s.

20:02.568 --> 20:06.238
DIANA TUITTE IS THE CURATOR.

20:06.238 --> 20:08.874
>> I THINK THAT WHAT ALEX SEEMED

20:08.874 --> 20:10.309
TO KNOW COMING OUT OF ART SCHOOL

20:10.309 --> 20:11.944
WAS THAT HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE

20:11.944 --> 20:12.611
DOING WHAT ANYONE ELSE WAS

20:12.611 --> 20:15.081
DOING.

20:15.081 --> 20:16.849
INITIALLY, KATZ PAINTED FROM

20:16.849 --> 20:18.384
PHOTOGRAPHS-- LIKE THESE FIGURES

20:18.384 --> 20:19.318
IN A FIELD, OR THESE FOUR

20:19.318 --> 20:20.920
CHILDREN.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.822
THEN, WHILE TAKING ART CLASSES

20:22.822 --> 20:23.823
IN MAINE, KATZ SAYS, HE FOUND

20:23.823 --> 20:25.324
HIS EYES.

20:25.324 --> 20:27.293
>> I LIKE THE LIGHT.

20:27.293 --> 20:29.328
THE FURTHER NORTH YOU GET, THE

20:29.328 --> 20:30.229
LESS WHITE LIGHT YOU HAVE AND

20:30.229 --> 20:31.864
THE MORE COLOR.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.566
AND I THOUGHT THE COLOR AROUND

20:33.566 --> 20:34.600
HERE, YOU KNOW, IS JUST REALLY

20:34.600 --> 20:36.836
MARVELOUS.

20:36.836 --> 20:37.536
AND THAT WAS A BIG REASON FOR

20:37.536 --> 20:39.171
COMING HERE.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.539
>> Reporter: HE'S COME BACK TO

20:40.539 --> 20:41.841
COASTAL MAINE FOR THE PAST 61

20:41.841 --> 20:43.309
SUMMERS.

20:43.309 --> 20:45.277
HE BUILT A STUDIO OVERLOOKING A

20:45.277 --> 20:46.479
POND AND OFTEN FINDS SUBJECT

20:46.479 --> 20:53.752
MATTER RIGHT OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.

20:53.752 --> 20:54.520
WHEN KATZ HAS AN IDEA, HE FIRST

20:54.520 --> 20:55.387
DRAWS A SKETCH AND THEN PAINTS A

20:55.387 --> 20:56.322
SMALL STUDY.

20:56.322 --> 20:57.423
WHEN HE RETURNS TO MANHATTAN IN

20:57.423 --> 20:58.290
SEPTEMBER, KATZ TRANSFORMS THE

20:58.290 --> 21:00.659
STUDIES INTO A LARGE CANVASS.

21:00.659 --> 21:03.963
SO THIS... BECOMES THIS.

21:03.963 --> 21:06.232
KATZ WORKS FAST, APPLYING

21:06.232 --> 21:07.766
DIFFERENT COLORS AND LAYERS OF

21:07.766 --> 21:10.035
WET PAINT ON TOP OF EACH OTHER.

21:10.035 --> 21:12.104
I WATCHED HIM COMPLETE THIS 15-

21:12.104 --> 21:13.539
FOOT-BY-11-FOOT PAINTING OF

21:13.539 --> 21:15.641
TREES IN JUST 90 MINUTES.

21:15.641 --> 21:18.611
HE HAS REALLY TRANSCENDED ANY

21:18.611 --> 21:21.680
ART MOVEMENT AND CONTINUES TO

21:21.680 --> 21:23.115
REALLY BE INFLUENTIAL FOR YOUNG

21:23.115 --> 21:27.353
PAINTERS TODAY.

21:27.353 --> 21:28.954
>> WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS THAT

21:28.954 --> 21:31.090
IT'S LIKE AN EXPLOSION OF

21:31.090 --> 21:32.858
DIFFERENT PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED

21:32.858 --> 21:33.826
IN MY WORK THAN WERE, LIKE, TEN

21:33.826 --> 21:34.793
YEARS AGO.

21:34.793 --> 21:35.494
>> Reporter: WHY DO YOU THINK

21:35.494 --> 21:36.295
THAT IS?

21:36.295 --> 21:37.363
>> I THINK LONGEVITY IS PART OF

21:37.363 --> 21:40.166
IT.

21:40.166 --> 21:42.801
AND I THINK THE BIG CHANGE FROM

21:42.801 --> 21:45.804
THE ABSOLUTISM OF MODERN ART TO

21:45.804 --> 21:47.640
THE OPEN AREA WE ARE IN NOW.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.176
I FIT.

21:50.176 --> 21:51.110
I THINK IN A SENSE THE WORLD

21:51.110 --> 21:55.181
CAUGHT UP WITH ME.

21:55.181 --> 21:55.981
>> Reporter: MOST PEOPLE YOUR

21:55.981 --> 21:56.448
AGE SLOW DOWN.

21:56.448 --> 21:57.216
>> WELL, I AIN'T MOST PEOPLE.

21:57.216 --> 22:02.454
AM I?

22:19.838 --> 22:21.740
LATER, THE HURRICANE SEASON OF

22:21.740 --> 22:23.809
2005 IS UNFORGETTABLE.

22:23.809 --> 22:25.444
FIRST, IN AUGUST, HURRICANE

22:25.444 --> 22:26.779
KATRINA HIT THE LOUISIANA AND

22:26.779 --> 22:29.081
MISSISSIPPI GULF COAST.

22:29.081 --> 22:30.749
THEN IN SEPTEMBER, AN EVEN

22:30.749 --> 22:32.017
STRONGER STORM MADE LANDFALL:

22:32.017 --> 22:33.752
HURRICANE RITA.

22:33.752 --> 22:35.321
CHARLIE WHINHAM, FROM LOUISIANA

SOUTHWESTERN LOUISIANA WITH THIS

22:39.558 --> 22:41.460
LOOK BACK.

22:41.460 --> 22:42.728
>> Reporter: NOW WHILE KATRINA

22:42.728 --> 22:44.029
GARNERED ALL OF THE HEADLINES

22:44.029 --> 22:45.464
AND FOR VERY GOOD REASON,

22:45.464 --> 22:47.299
HURRICANE RITA DID ITS DAMAGE AS

22:47.299 --> 22:48.234
WELL, CAUSING $12 BILLION WORTH

22:48.234 --> 22:50.035
OF DAMAGE.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.537
AND FOLKS AROUND THIS PART OF

22:51.537 --> 22:53.239
THE COUNTRY CONSIDER HURRICANE

22:53.239 --> 22:55.140
RITA AS "THE FORGOTTEN STORM."

22:55.140 --> 22:56.642
MANY COASTAL COMMUNITIES WERE

22:56.642 --> 22:58.611
SIMPLY WASHED AWAY.

22:58.611 --> 22:59.445
FORTUNATELY, NO ONE IN CAMERON

22:59.445 --> 23:01.880
PARISH DIED.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.515
RITA WAS THE FOURTH STRONGEST

23:03.515 --> 23:05.651
ATLANTIC HURRICANE ON RECORD.

23:05.651 --> 23:07.519
KATRINA RANKED SIXTH.

23:07.519 --> 23:09.221
BUT KATRINA HIT A LARGER

23:09.221 --> 23:11.390
POPULATED AREA KILLING AN

23:11.390 --> 23:13.192
ESTIMATED 1,836 PEOPLE ACROSS

23:13.192 --> 23:15.060
THE GULF COAST AND CAUSING

23:15.060 --> 23:17.963
$108 BILLION IN DAMAGES.

23:17.963 --> 23:19.498
IN TEXAS, RITA PROMPTED THE

23:19.498 --> 23:20.599
LARGEST EVACUATION IN U.S.

23:20.599 --> 23:22.468
HISTORY.

23:22.468 --> 23:24.169
THE COMBINATION OF SEVERE

23:24.169 --> 23:26.272
GRIDLOCK AND EXCESSIVE HEAT LED

23:26.272 --> 23:28.407
TO 107 EVACUATION-RELATED

23:28.407 --> 23:29.308
FATALITIES, ACCORDING TO THE

23:29.308 --> 23:32.378
HOUSTON CHRONICLE.

23:32.378 --> 23:34.079
TEN YEARS AFTER RITA, THERE

23:34.079 --> 23:34.747
REMAINS SIGNS OF HOPE AND

23:34.747 --> 23:36.315
PROGRESS.

23:36.315 --> 23:37.916
SOUTH CAMERON HIGH SCHOOL RE-

23:37.916 --> 23:39.585
OPENED IN 2010.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.287
THE NEW SCHOOL IS 19 FEET ABOVE

23:41.287 --> 23:43.155
GROUND, BUILT TO WITHSTAND

23:43.155 --> 23:43.989
HURRICANE FORCE WINDS AND

23:43.989 --> 23:46.091
FLOODING.

23:46.091 --> 23:47.826
IN 2006, THE SOUTH CAMERON

23:47.826 --> 23:50.195
MEMORIAL HOSPITAL RECEIVED A TWO

23:50.195 --> 23:51.730
MILLION DOLLAR GRANT FROM THE

23:51.730 --> 23:53.499
BUSH-CLINTON KATRINA FUND.

23:53.499 --> 23:55.467
IT IS ONE OF THE MANY FINANCIAL

23:55.467 --> 23:56.235
PIECES OF THE PUZZLE TO KEEP

23:56.235 --> 23:58.103
THIS PLACE OPEN.

23:58.103 --> 23:59.705
THERE IS ALSO RENEWED HOPE THAT

23:59.705 --> 24:00.839
JOBS FROM THE OIL AND GAS

24:00.839 --> 24:02.808
INDUSTRY WILL RETURN.

24:02.808 --> 24:04.910
CAMERON PARISH BOASTS A PAIR OF
