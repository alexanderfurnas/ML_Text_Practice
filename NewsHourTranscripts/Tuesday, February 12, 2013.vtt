AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY, ALL  
WE KNOW IS THERE'S BEEN A TEST.

10:04.527 --> 10:05.922
AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY, ALL  
WE KNOW IS THERE'S BEEN A TEST. 
WE HAVE A VERY ROUGH ESTIMATE OF

WE KNOW IS THERE'S BEEN A TEST. 
WE HAVE A VERY ROUGH ESTIMATE OF
HOW BIG THE BANG WAS.

10:07.057 --> 10:08.655
WE HAVE A VERY ROUGH ESTIMATE OF
HOW BIG THE BANG WAS.           
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS WHETHER

10:08.657 --> 10:10.385
HOW BIG THE BANG WAS.           
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS WHETHER   
THE DEVICE WAS MADE FROM

10:10.388 --> 10:12.417
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS WHETHER   
THE DEVICE WAS MADE FROM        
PLUTONIUM OR HIGHLY ENRICHED

10:12.418 --> 10:12.782
THE DEVICE WAS MADE FROM        
PLUTONIUM OR HIGHLY ENRICHED    
URANIUM.

10:12.784 --> 10:14.248
PLUTONIUM OR HIGHLY ENRICHED    
URANIUM.                        
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A MINOR

10:14.250 --> 10:15.947
URANIUM.                        
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A MINOR        
TECHNICAL ISSUE BUT IT ACTUALLY

10:15.949 --> 10:18.077
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A MINOR        
TECHNICAL ISSUE BUT IT ACTUALLY 
HAS HUGELY IMPORTANT POLICY

10:18.079 --> 10:18.511
TECHNICAL ISSUE BUT IT ACTUALLY 
HAS HUGELY IMPORTANT POLICY     
CONSEQUENCES.

10:18.512 --> 10:19.909
HAS HUGELY IMPORTANT POLICY     
CONSEQUENCES.                   
NORTH KOREA ONLY HAS A SMALL

10:19.911 --> 10:21.041
CONSEQUENCES.                   
NORTH KOREA ONLY HAS A SMALL    
AMOUNT OF PLUTONIUM.

10:21.043 --> 10:22.506
NORTH KOREA ONLY HAS A SMALL    
AMOUNT OF PLUTONIUM.            
IT ACTUALLY WOULD BE VERY, VERY

10:22.508 --> 10:24.470
AMOUNT OF PLUTONIUM.            
IT ACTUALLY WOULD BE VERY, VERY 
HARD FOR IT TO PRODUCE MORE.

10:24.473 --> 10:25.968
IT ACTUALLY WOULD BE VERY, VERY 
HARD FOR IT TO PRODUCE MORE.    
SO PART OF THE REASON WHY NORTH

10:25.971 --> 10:27.934
HARD FOR IT TO PRODUCE MORE.    
SO PART OF THE REASON WHY NORTH 
KOREA WANTS TO SHIFT TO URANIUM

10:27.935 --> 10:29.798
SO PART OF THE REASON WHY NORTH 
KOREA WANTS TO SHIFT TO URANIUM 
IS BECAUSE IT WOULD ALLOW IT TO

10:29.801 --> 10:32.828
KOREA WANTS TO SHIFT TO URANIUM 
IS BECAUSE IT WOULD ALLOW IT TO 
INCREASE ITS ARSENAL RELATIVELY

10:32.831 --> 10:33.162
IS BECAUSE IT WOULD ALLOW IT TO 
INCREASE ITS ARSENAL RELATIVELY 
QUICKLY.

10:33.164 --> 10:35.026
INCREASE ITS ARSENAL RELATIVELY 
QUICKLY.                        
SO IF THIS TURNS OUT TO BE A

10:35.029 --> 10:36.992
QUICKLY.                        
SO IF THIS TURNS OUT TO BE A    
HIGHLY ENRICHED URANIUM TEST,

10:36.993 --> 10:38.823
SO IF THIS TURNS OUT TO BE A    
HIGHLY ENRICHED URANIUM TEST,   
THEN NORTH KOREA HAS

10:38.825 --> 10:40.188
HIGHLY ENRICHED URANIUM TEST,   
THEN NORTH KOREA HAS            
DEMONSTRATED ITS ABILITY TO

10:40.189 --> 10:41.186
THEN NORTH KOREA HAS            
DEMONSTRATED ITS ABILITY TO     
EXPAND ITS ARSENAL.

10:41.189 --> 10:42.684
DEMONSTRATED ITS ABILITY TO     
EXPAND ITS ARSENAL.             
SO A LOT OF COUNTRIES INCLUDING
