JUDY WOODRUFF: Now back
to the controversies
swirling around Donald Trump
Jr. and the president's

00:05.233 --> 00:07.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
top campaign aides.

00:07.366 --> 00:11.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The e-mail exchange published
by Donald Trump Jr. on Tuesday
reignited a legal debate about

00:13.533 --> 00:17.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
whether members of the
Trump campaign engaged
in unlawful activity.

00:17.700 --> 00:20.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We get two perspectives
now, from Bob Bauer.

00:20.900 --> 00:25.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He served as White House
counsel to President
Obama from 2009 to 2011.

00:25.033 --> 00:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is now a lawyer in private
practice in Washington.

00:29.833 --> 00:34.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And Jed Shugerman, He's
a professor at Fordham
University Law School.

00:34.700 --> 00:37.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Gentlemen, we thank you
both for being with us.

00:37.333 --> 00:39.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Bob Bauer, to you first.

00:39.466 --> 00:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know the president's son was
told that the Russian government
had incriminating information

00:45.033 --> 00:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on Hillary Clinton that it
wanted to share with him.

00:47.766 --> 00:50.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Did he break a law
by pursuing that?

00:50.233 --> 00:53.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BOB BAUER, Former White
House Counsel: In my view,
we have some evidence.

00:53.966 --> 00:56.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't have all the evidence.

00:56.466 --> 01:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would suspect the
congressional investigating
committee and the special
counsel will continue

01:02.600 --> 01:05.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to dig into questions raised
by the facts disclosed by The
New York Times and by Donald

01:06.700 --> 01:08.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump Jr. himself.

01:08.666 --> 01:12.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this is highly suggestive
of a potential violation
of the law on two counts.

01:12.900 --> 01:17.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Number one, it demonstrates
that the campaign as a whole
had the intent to court support,

01:19.833 --> 01:24.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
receive support, solicit
support from a foreign national
source, in this case, the Russia

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Second, in my view, the
meeting itself could constitute
illegal solicitation of support

01:31.400 --> 01:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from a foreign national
under campaign finance law.

01:33.466 --> 01:38.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it both has broad legal
significance, and on that one
specific issue of liability,

01:38.066 --> 01:40.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has a more concrete
significance.

01:40.100 --> 01:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you're
tying it to campaign
finance, is that right?

01:44.633 --> 01:46.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
BOB BAUER: Yes.

01:46.633 --> 01:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm talking here about a statute
that has been on the books
for many years that Congress

01:49.900 --> 01:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tightened in 2002 that prohibits
receiving and soliciting
contributions from a foreign

01:57.666 --> 02:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
national or providing
the foreign national with
substantial assistance
in trying to influence

02:02.066 --> 02:04.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a U.S. election.

02:04.100 --> 02:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jed Shugerman,
listening to this, and I
know you have been looking at

02:07.500 --> 02:12.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the laws with regard to this
today, does this sound like
something that fits under that

02:13.233 --> 02:15.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
legal definition?

02:15.300 --> 02:16.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JED SHUGERMAN, Fordham
University Law School:
Yes, I have been looking
at this quite a bit

02:16.500 --> 02:17.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and I have been
reading Bob's work.

02:17.966 --> 02:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Bob is -- generally, he's
a terrific expert on this.

02:20.566 --> 02:25.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think I disagree with
him and how far to apply
campaign finance law.

02:25.033 --> 02:28.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm very sympathetic to
his perspective here.

02:28.333 --> 02:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, I think we're
getting into some dangerous
territory with applying
federal election law

02:34.200 --> 02:36.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
too broadly at this stage.

02:36.266 --> 02:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
News keeps breaking every day,
so I'm just saying, what we
know now, to argue that this

02:39.866 --> 02:44.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
meeting itself is a violation
of the campaign finance law
raises a couple of questions.

02:46.900 --> 02:51.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
First of all, it raises
the danger of applying
and criminalizing
contacts between anyone

02:53.366 --> 02:55.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in a campaign with
a foreign national.

02:55.633 --> 02:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let me give you a hypothetical.

02:57.700 --> 03:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Imagine if there was a Web site
that published what purported
to be the birth certificate

03:04.033 --> 03:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of President Obama from Kenya,
and an Obama staffer went
and met with Kenyan nationals

03:09.900 --> 03:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to find out about the
veracity of that document.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Under this interpretation,
that would still be a thing of
value, but would we criminalize

03:18.766 --> 03:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Obama campaign for checking?

03:20.900 --> 03:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, similarly, would we say
of the Romney campaign, you
can't do opposition research

03:26.600 --> 03:27.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by investigating?

03:27.266 --> 03:28.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

03:28.200 --> 03:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JED SHUGERMAN: Yes, go ahead.

03:30.200 --> 03:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I was just
going to say, let me just
stop you there on that point.

03:32.233 --> 03:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What about that, Bob Bauer,
that there's a danger here
in making this cover any kind

03:37.566 --> 03:40.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of information that is
shared with a campaign
by a foreign entity?

03:40.033 --> 03:43.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BOB BAUER: Well, that's
not the case at all here.

03:43.400 --> 03:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're not talking about a
casual conversation with some
information that the campaign is

03:50.033 --> 03:52.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
looking for it sort
of acquires by talking
to a foreign national.

03:52.733 --> 03:57.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We're talking about an
operational link between
a foreign government
and a campaign, one in

03:59.766 --> 04:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which the foreign government is
stating its intention to provide
ongoing support, dispatches

04:02.700 --> 04:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of its emissaries, if we're
to understand the facts as
so far presented in the news,

04:09.166 --> 04:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dispatches one of its emissaries
from Moscow to Washington, D.C.

04:12.233 --> 04:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on top of all that, not
only does the campaign indicate
that it's anxious for the

04:16.133 --> 04:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
help, but, as you recall,
Donald Trump Jr. even suggests
in one of his e-mails that he

04:20.766 --> 04:24.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would like to discuss timing,
that if the information is as
good as advertised, he would

04:24.533 --> 04:26.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
like to see it released
later in the summer.

04:26.833 --> 04:31.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The campaign finance
laws clearly distinguish
between the kind of
speech that I think that

04:33.900 --> 04:37.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Professor Shugerman is
legitimately concerned
about from this kind of
operational relationship

04:37.066 --> 04:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by a strong supporter
for a campaign engaged
in very specific
activities on its behalf.

04:41.433 --> 04:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jed Shugerman,
it is the case that the e-mail
to Donald Trump Jr. said the

04:47.833 --> 04:51.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russian government wants
to help your campaign.

04:51.066 --> 04:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JED SHUGERMAN: All of this is
indicative or suggestive of
what we might find out later.

04:58.033 --> 05:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think if we carefully read
the e-mails, I think it's hard
to make the leap that this

05:02.433 --> 05:03.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is like a coordination.

05:03.633 --> 05:05.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's indications there.

05:05.100 --> 05:07.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I understand where Bob
Bauer is coming from.

05:07.500 --> 05:11.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think we have to be
careful, though, because if you
read the e-mail from a little

05:11.900 --> 05:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bit of perspective of how could
this be applied in the future
and can we have line-drawing

05:16.500 --> 05:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here, it's hard to see where
this e-mail doesn't lead to some
effect of applying this to any

05:22.966 --> 05:25.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
kind of contact
between a government...

05:25.133 --> 05:27.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me
now ask both of you.

05:27.033 --> 05:29.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I will come to you,
Jed Shugerman first.

05:29.133 --> 05:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The word collusion, colluding
has been thrown around a lot in
the last few weeks about whether

05:35.333 --> 05:38.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Trump campaign was colluding
with Russian officials.

05:38.433 --> 05:41.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is there some legal
connection there?

05:41.700 --> 05:43.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that an issue?

05:43.733 --> 05:46.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JED SHUGERMAN: Well,
the word collusion is
more of a political
word than a legal word.

05:46.600 --> 05:49.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There is no statute
against collusion.

05:49.266 --> 05:52.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And -- but I think the
word we might turn to in
the law is conspiracy.

05:52.500 --> 05:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is where we're headed.

05:54.433 --> 05:58.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there is a lot of other
information that is coming
out day by day that points

05:59.233 --> 06:01.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to this conspiracy.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we may have conspiracy.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think what we're getting
closer towards is a violation
of 1986 law of computer hacking,

06:09.266 --> 06:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because I think, if you look
at the timing, there are just
too many coincidences about

06:11.600 --> 06:16.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what the Trump campaign was
doing before and after this June
3 e-mail about President Trump

06:16.266 --> 06:18.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
himself.

06:18.266 --> 06:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just -- my point here is,
I think we need to be careful
in analyzing each step.

06:22.233 --> 06:24.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

06:24.300 --> 06:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JED SHUGERMAN: I think there is
evidence that's pointing towards
crimes, but I think we need

06:26.833 --> 06:30.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to be careful when we
make interpretations
of these statutes.

06:30.066 --> 06:32.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well,
we certainly want
to be careful here.

06:32.100 --> 06:36.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we know we're speculating,
but we do think it's important
to ask these questions.

06:38.300 --> 06:39.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bob Bauer, just quickly on
the conspiracy question?

06:39.533 --> 06:42.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BOB BAUER: Well, I think
there is a basis here.

06:42.833 --> 06:45.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I don't disagree
with Professor Shugerman.

06:45.033 --> 06:46.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is going to be an
ongoing investigation.

06:46.800 --> 06:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is not the only evidence
that will be taken into account.

06:50.133 --> 06:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And certainly, if, in fact,
there is apparently a violation
of the campaign finance laws,

06:57.100 --> 07:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the evidence is beginning
to point in that direction,
then, yes, the prosecutors

07:00.200 --> 07:04.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could certainly develop a
conspiracy charge or an aiding
and abetting charge based on

07:04.566 --> 07:06.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

07:06.700 --> 07:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If I could just add one more
point, this is not a statute
that is subject to the same

07:10.400 --> 07:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
free speech considerations that
Professor Shugerman outlines
that apply in the domestic

07:14.966 --> 07:17.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
U.S. context.

07:17.033 --> 07:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, for example, it was
very clear from the testimony
of FBI director nominee Chris

07:22.900 --> 07:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wray, who was asked about this,
that, in his view, this sort
of communication between the

07:26.000 --> 07:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian government
and a campaign is a
national security matter.

07:29.400 --> 07:33.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he said any meeting
like that shouldn't have
been taken unless the
campaign had consulted

07:33.900 --> 07:36.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with what he called
its legal advisers.

07:36.200 --> 07:41.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I think it was clear
from the FBI director's
remarks here this is a
national security issue,

07:43.033 --> 07:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the free speech considerations
are different, and the
implications are legal.

07:45.133 --> 07:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
gentlemen, we are going
