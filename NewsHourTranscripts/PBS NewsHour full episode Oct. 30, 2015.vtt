JUDY WOODRUFF: Good
evening. I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:08.442 --> 00:13.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: The
U.S. ramps up its role in Syria,
putting special operations

00:13.714 --> 00:18.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
forces on the ground to bolster
the fight against ISIS.

00:18.285 --> 00:23.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then: a look at organized
labor's role in this year's race
for the White House.

00:23.490 --> 00:27.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON RALSTON, "Ralston Reports":
Withholding their endorsement, I
think they actually pushed

00:27.327 --> 00:30.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary into the position they
want on the so-called Cadillac
tax in Obamacare, which

00:30.731 --> 00:33.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they want repealed.

00:33.100 --> 00:37.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.
Mark Shields and David Brooks
are here to analyze another

00:37.170 --> 00:39.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
full week of news.

00:39.806 --> 00:45.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:45.178 --> 00:49.383 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:49.383 --> 01:01.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Shipwrecks off
the Greek islands claimed more
migrant lives today, 31 in all,

01:01.228 --> 01:05.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most of them children. That made
50 dead in three days, as the
weather worsens in the

01:05.299 --> 01:08.068 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Aegean Sea.

01:08.068 --> 01:13.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The deadliest incident today was
near the island of Kalymnos,
where 19 people drowned

01:13.807 --> 01:19.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trying to cross from Turkey.
Disturbing scenes were repeated
on Lesbos, where more bodies

01:19.579 --> 01:24.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
washed ashore, including several
babies and other children.
Volunteers helped remove them

01:24.618 --> 01:27.287 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for burials.

01:27.287 --> 01:31.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, in Athens, Greek
Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras
blasted Europe for its handling

01:31.925 --> 01:34.394 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the crisis.

01:34.394 --> 01:40.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEXIS TSIPRAS, Greek Prime
Minister (through translator): I
want to say that, as a member

01:40.434 --> 01:44.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the European leadership, I
feel shame, shame both for the
inability of Europe to

01:44.905 --> 01:49.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deal effectively with this human
drama, but also for the quality
of discussion.

01:49.176 --> 01:54.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In addition to
the dead, the Greek coast guard
said that it rescued nearly

01:54.247 --> 02:00.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
600 people in the last 24 hours.
Many of the migrants and
refugees have fled Syria,
Afghanistan,

02:00.120 --> 02:03.323 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Iraq.

02:03.323 --> 02:08.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama says he's ready
to sign a two-year federal
budget deal that won approval

02:08.028 --> 02:15.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the U.S. Senate early today.
It passed 64 to 35, in spite of
conservative opposition,

02:15.402 --> 02:21.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and just in time to avert a
federal default next week. The
package includes $80 billion

02:21.008 --> 02:25.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in new spending. It also
prevents a cut in Social
Security disability benefits and
a

02:25.679 --> 02:30.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
major hike in Medicare premiums.

02:30.450 --> 02:35.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the presidential campaign,
Democrat Hillary Clinton worked
to consolidate support among

02:35.455 --> 02:41.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
black voters in a swing across
the South. In Atlanta, she vowed
to end disparities between

02:41.328 --> 02:47.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crack and powder cocaine prison
sentences, and called for other
reforms.

02:47.067 --> 02:50.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: As
president, I will work with
Congress to

02:50.737 --> 02:57.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pass legislation to ban racial
profiling by federal, state, and
local law enforcement.

02:57.577 --> 03:00.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:00.747 --> 03:03.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: It is
wrong, it is demeaning, and it
doesn't keep us safe or

03:03.216 --> 03:07.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
help solve crime. It's time for
us to put that practice behind
us.

03:07.421 --> 03:13.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton also won
a key endorsement from New York
City Mayor Bill de Blasio.

03:13.393 --> 03:18.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also today, the Republican
National Committee suspended its
partnership with NBC News for

03:18.532 --> 03:25.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a presidential primary debate in
February. GOP candidates
complained that CNBC moderators

03:25.739 --> 03:32.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
asked off-topic or -- quote --
"gotcha questions" during this
week's face-off in Colorado.

03:32.446 --> 03:38.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The last British detainee at
Guantanamo Bay has returned home
after being held for nearly

03:38.351 --> 03:45.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
14 years. Shaker Aamer is a
Saudi national who was married
to a British woman. He arrived

03:45.158 --> 03:49.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back in Britain on a private
plane, hours after being
released from the U.S. military

03:49.830 --> 03:55.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prison in Cuba. He was suspected
of links to al-Qaida, but never
charged. With Aamer's

03:55.869 --> 04:01.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
departure, 112 detainees
remain at Guantanamo.

04:01.608 --> 04:07.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New research is out that shows
breast cancer no longer strikes
black women less often than

04:07.481 --> 04:13.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whites. A study published this
week found the two races are now
diagnosed at the same

04:13.186 --> 04:19.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rate. That could be linked to
stepped-up screenings and higher
obesity rates in black
populations.

04:19.493 --> 04:24.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At the same time,
African-American women are still
more likely to die of the
disease. The

04:24.231 --> 04:29.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
study appears in "C.A.," a
cancer journal for clinicians.

04:29.703 --> 04:36.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Stocks fell on Wall Street
today, but managed to post their
best monthly gain in four years.

04:36.009 --> 04:43.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 92 points, to close at
17663. The Nasdaq fell more than

04:43.350 --> 04:47.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
20 points, and the S&amp;P 500
dropped 10. For the week, the
indexes were all up less than

04:47.821 --> 04:50.624 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a percent.

04:50.624 --> 04:56.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
American boots on the ground in
Syria; labor unions'

04:56.596 --> 05:14.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
waning influence on politics; a
tax increase threatens a Greek
speciality, and much more.

05:14.414 --> 05:19.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The United States steps up its
mission in Syria, part of a
coalition aimed at dismantling

05:19.819 --> 05:24.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Islamic State, as leaders
from the U.S., Russia and Iran
meet in Vienna trying to find

05:24.791 --> 05:28.795 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
a political end
to the civil war.

05:28.795 --> 05:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Confirmation that commandos are
going into Northern Syria came
at the day's White House

05:32.933 --> 05:34.501 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
briefing.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary: The core of our
military strategy inside of

05:36.703 --> 05:39.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Syria is to build up the
capacity of local forces.

05:39.973 --> 05:44.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Spokesman Josh
Earnest gave few details on
whether the U.S. effort will

05:44.010 --> 05:47.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
aid Kurdish or Arab
fighters or both.

05:47.948 --> 05:52.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST: The president did
make a decision to intensify
that support by offering a small

05:52.986 --> 05:59.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
number of U.S. special
operations military personnel to
offer them some advice and
assistance

05:59.192 --> 06:02.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on the ground as they
take the fight to ISIL.

06:02.596 --> 06:07.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That small
number, Earnest said, is fewer
than 50. And he insisted they

06:07.334 --> 06:10.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will not be on a combat mission.

06:10.537 --> 06:16.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST: The responsibility
that they have is not to lead
the charge to take a hill.

06:16.109 --> 06:19.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It still means that they're in a
dangerous situation. It still
means that they will have

06:19.846 --> 06:24.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all of the equipment that they
need to protect themselves if
necessary.

06:24.084 --> 06:30.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: U.S. special
operations troops have conducted
raids inside Syria, but this

06:30.924 --> 06:37.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will be their first sustained
presence. It comes amid Russia's
month-old air campaign

06:37.430 --> 06:44.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in support of Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad. And it marks a
shift for President Obama.

06:44.271 --> 06:48.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had said repeatedly he
wouldn't commit ground troops in
Syria.

06:48.908 --> 06:54.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The military developments came
as Secretary of State John Kerry
was in Vienna for talks

06:54.748 --> 07:00.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on a diplomatic solution in
Syria. There was no agreement on
the future of Assad, but the

07:00.854 --> 07:06.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S., Russia and other nations
directed the U.N. to try again
to bring Syria's government

07:06.826 --> 07:09.929 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
and opposition
groups to the table.

07:09.929 --> 07:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: The United States
position is, there is no way
that President

07:13.833 --> 07:20.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Assad can unite and govern
Syria, and we believe that
Syrians deserve a different
choice. And

07:20.840 --> 07:31.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our goal is to work with Syria's
many factions to develop that
choice. But we can't allow

07:31.818 --> 07:37.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that difference to get in the
way of the possibility of
diplomacy to end the killing and
to find

07:37.157 --> 07:38.525 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the solution.

07:38.525 --> 07:43.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The ministers
will hold another round of talks
in two weeks.

07:43.763 --> 07:50.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, the killing in Syria
continued apace. Opposition
activists said a government

07:50.804 --> 07:58.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rocket barrage in a Damascus
suburb left at least 57 dead and
many more wounded.

07:58.845 --> 08:02.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We take a closer look at the
decision to send special
operations forces to Syria with
Greg

08:02.415 --> 08:05.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jaffe, who covers the Pentagon
for The Washington Post.

08:05.719 --> 08:09.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Greg, welcome back
to the program.

08:09.089 --> 08:12.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the White House is saying
that these special operations
forces are there to help what
they

08:12.359 --> 08:18.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
call moderates in the opposition
forces. What does that mean? Who
is that?

08:18.331 --> 08:22.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG JAFFE, The Washington Post:
You know, it's primarily a
Kurdish group called the

08:22.102 --> 08:27.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YPG up north, along with some --
what they call the Syrian-Arab
coalition, which is a

08:27.407 --> 08:32.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coalition, sort of, of Arab
fighters who are fighting
alongside the Kurds up in the
north.

08:32.946 --> 08:38.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What's the
significance of singling out
those two groups to help them?

08:38.118 --> 08:42.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG JAFFE: You know, I think
the first thing is, I think they
-- we feel like they share

08:42.756 --> 08:47.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our values or at least our
goals. They're sort of moderate
Syrian forces, and they have

08:47.727 --> 08:50.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
shown some success.

08:50.096 --> 08:54.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think that's what the
administration is trying to
build on here. The YPG in
particular,

08:54.167 --> 08:58.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
backed by kind of American
airstrikes, has been able to
take back some ground from the

08:58.004 --> 09:02.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Islamic State. So, in a place
where they haven't seen a lot of
success, it's something.

09:02.776 --> 09:06.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, when they
say advice and assistance, which
is how the White House described

09:06.980 --> 09:10.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it, what does that mean? Exactly
what are they going to be doing
for them?

09:10.316 --> 09:15.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG JAFFE: You know, the
Pentagon officials we spoke to
said that they primarily would

09:15.021 --> 09:18.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be at the headquarters level.
So, they won't be on the front
lines. They won't be calling

09:18.758 --> 09:21.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in airstrikes from what we call
sometimes first point of cover
and concealment. They

09:21.594 --> 09:24.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will be further back than that.

09:24.798 --> 09:29.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think a big part of what
they do is assess the forces,
figure out what they need,

09:29.636 --> 09:35.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what equipment, weaponry the
U.S. can help provide them and
then also help them plan

09:35.041 --> 09:37.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the operation, make sure that
they have folks in the right
places, that they're
coordinating

09:37.811 --> 09:40.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as best as possible
with U.S. airpower.

09:40.547 --> 09:44.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So the mission
here is mainly anti-ISIS or
anti-Assad?

09:44.784 --> 09:51.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG JAFFE: No, it's anti-ISIS.
I think that's the complicating
factor of the Russians being

09:51.024 --> 09:54.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
involved as well, because I
think a lot of the forces that
we have worked with in the

09:54.961 --> 10:00.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
north are looking south to help
their brethren who feel kind of
battered by the Assad regime

10:00.033 --> 10:02.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and by Russia, but I think
that's a fight that we have
decided we don't want to pick

10:02.635 --> 10:04.771 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right now.

10:04.771 --> 10:09.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Greg Jaffe,
we heard the White House
spokesman, Josh Earnest, say
this

10:09.542 --> 10:12.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is not a combat mission. He said
it's not a major departure from
what the U.S. has been

10:12.512 --> 10:14.948 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
doing.

10:14.948 --> 10:18.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How different is it from what
the U.S. has been doing? And
have there been covert
operations

10:18.084 --> 10:20.687 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like this already going on?

10:20.687 --> 10:26.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GREG JAFFE: Well, there
certainly have some been raids
that are covert. Have there been

10:26.059 --> 10:29.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
folks on the ground doing
advising and assisting on sort
of a long-term basis? Not that
we

10:29.762 --> 10:33.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
know of.

10:33.233 --> 10:37.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So it does seem like a
departure. Look, it's not a lot
of troops. I think it's less
than

10:37.770 --> 10:41.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
50. But, emotionally, it's a big
deal. We haven't had boots on
the ground in Syria before,

10:41.407 --> 10:43.309 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and now we do.

10:43.309 --> 10:46.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Greg Jaffe at The
Washington Post, we thank you.

10:46.079 --> 10:49.182 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
GREG JAFFE: Yes,
thanks for having me.

10:49.182 --> 10:53.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, just how
significant a move is this
decision to send these special

10:53.353 --> 10:59.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forces into Syria? And what
impact will it have on trying to
end the war diplomatically?

10:59.626 --> 11:05.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For that, we turn to former U.S.
Ambassador to Russia Michael
McFaul, and Joshua Landis.

11:05.732 --> 11:09.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's the director for Middle
East studies at the University
of Oklahoma.

11:09.168 --> 11:12.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we welcome you both
back to the program.

11:12.138 --> 11:14.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Ambassador McFaul, let
me start with you.

11:14.774 --> 11:21.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Before I ask about these
diplomatic talks in Vienna, what
effect do you think this
operation,

11:21.548 --> 11:25.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this announcement of putting
special operations forces into
Iraq is going to have on any
effort

11:25.652 --> 11:28.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to resolve Syria diplomatically?

11:28.388 --> 11:31.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MCFAUL, Former U.S.
Ambassador to Russia: Well, I
think it will be in the margins,

11:31.824 --> 11:34.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but not a direct effect.

11:34.727 --> 11:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it really does have to
do with the desire by the Obama
administration to be more

11:40.066 --> 11:46.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
effective against ISIL. As
Secretary Kerry said today,
under Operation Inherent
Resolve,

11:46.172 --> 11:53.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have now attacked -- they
have had 7,300 airstrikes, to
little effect. And now I think

11:53.046 --> 11:56.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're doubling down, in
particular with the actors that
they think have been most

11:56.015 --> 11:59.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
effective before.

11:59.218 --> 12:04.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But it was a station
identification for our Russian
interlocutors and for everybody
else

12:04.924 --> 12:09.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we are involved in Syria
and that our people and our
partners in Syria have to be

12:09.195 --> 12:12.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
part of a negotiated process.

12:12.231 --> 12:17.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Joshua Landis,
how do you see this move by the
U.S. to put less than 50

12:17.070 --> 12:20.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
special operations troops in? Is
it going to have an effect on
resolving what's going

12:20.640 --> 12:22.775 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on in Syria?

12:22.775 --> 12:25.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSHUA LANDIS, University of
Oklahoma: It's not going to
resolve anything. It's going

12:25.545 --> 12:31.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to have a slight effect, but
America is saying that we're
here.

12:31.217 --> 12:37.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They have had a lot of
criticism, President Obama's had
a lot of criticism, not only
internally,

12:37.023 --> 12:43.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because 50 intelligence people
said that his administration was
trying to gin up a success

12:43.396 --> 12:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against ISIS, and it wasn't
having a success against ISIS.
So I think he's responding to

12:47.700 --> 12:52.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the internal criticism he's had
in the United States, but also
in the region.

12:52.438 --> 12:57.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Saudi Arabia and others are
saying Russia's moved into the
region because Obama's got

12:57.343 --> 13:01.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a very light footprint, and that
there's a power vacuum, and,
therefore, Russia is going

13:01.848 --> 13:04.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to come in and displace
the United States.

13:04.984 --> 13:10.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think he's trying to turn
up the heat a little bit without
getting America fundamentally

13:10.757 --> 13:16.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stuck in a third war in the
Middle East, because he's
discovered how difficult it is
to get

13:16.496 --> 13:22.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out of Iraq or Afghanistan, and
he doesn't want to leave the
next president with a real

13:22.101 --> 13:24.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
American presence in Syria.

13:24.704 --> 13:27.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So it's doing a little
bit, but not a lot.

13:27.874 --> 13:31.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, let me ask
you both separately then about
this meeting in Vienna wrapped

13:31.477 --> 13:36.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up today, two days. These were
representatives of 17 countries,
plus the U.N. and the E.U.

13:36.916 --> 13:42.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They basically came out with an
agreement, they said, to launch
a new peace effort involving

13:42.255 --> 13:45.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Syrian government,
Syrian opposition groups.

13:45.892 --> 13:50.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you read -- Ambassador
McFaul, how do you read what
they're saying in Vienna?

13:50.096 --> 13:54.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MCFAUL: Well, first of
all, it's always good to talk,
it's always good to negotiate,

13:54.901 --> 13:59.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as opposed to not talking.

13:59.272 --> 14:04.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Second point, I think the hidden
news in the statement today was
that they said they're

14:04.143 --> 14:10.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to explore modalities for
a cease-fire, but not against
ISIS. And if they do that,

14:10.650 --> 14:17.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's a big objective, it's a
big success for the
administration, because, before,
the

14:17.290 --> 14:21.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian forces were attacking
the folks that we were
supporting in Syria, and not
really

14:21.761 --> 14:26.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attacking ISIL. So that would be
a breakthrough, in and of
itself.

14:26.032 --> 14:31.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But to your bigger question of
will this be a resolution, this
is just the start of what

14:31.604 --> 14:38.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would be a very long process. If
you saw the exchanges about
should Assad stay or go, we

14:38.111 --> 14:43.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were all reminded that we have a
long ways to go before you get a
process in place.

14:43.182 --> 14:47.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was part of Geneva I and
Geneva II, the failed processes
before. I guess this is now

14:47.587 --> 14:53.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Vienna I. And, you know, I'm
skeptical that it will be easy
to do, but I applaud the efforts

14:53.559 --> 14:55.528 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for trying.

14:55.528 --> 15:00.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Joshua Landis, do
you see -- getting back to what
the ambassador said a moment

15:00.199 --> 15:03.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago, do you see this as a
potential breakthrough in here
somewhere in dealing with Assad,
President

15:03.603 --> 15:05.404 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Assad?

15:05.404 --> 15:10.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSHUA LANDIS: Well, like the
ambassador said, the two sides
are worlds apart.

15:10.510 --> 15:14.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What they do agree on is that
there has to be a political
solution. What the Russians

15:14.914 --> 15:20.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Assad believe a political
solution is that, essentially,
Assad will conquer the

15:20.086 --> 15:25.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country, and they will kick out
the jihadists, and they will
have a political solution with

15:25.725 --> 15:30.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the more moderate militias by
bringing them back in from the
cold and having them accept

15:30.196 --> 15:34.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an Assad regime again.

15:34.433 --> 15:40.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America, of course, sees a
political solution as Assad
stepping down, having regime
change

15:40.072 --> 15:47.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that will bring eventually a
semi-ascendancy to Syria. And
those -- the two sides couldn't

15:47.246 --> 15:52.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
farther apart on this. So, I
don't think we're going to see a
resolution any time soon.

15:52.485 --> 15:57.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What will see is, in a sense,
the United States has said that
Russia is getting into a swamp

15:57.590 --> 16:04.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Syria. The big question is,
do they work for a cease-fire or
does America and its allies,

16:04.564 --> 16:09.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey,
throw in more arms, TOW missiles
to fight the Russians and

16:09.602 --> 16:13.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
make sure that they
sink in that swamp?

16:13.005 --> 16:17.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or do they not throw in those
weapons and allow Russia to
really dominate Eastern Syria

16:17.410 --> 16:20.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- Western Syria, excuse me.

16:20.980 --> 16:25.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes. There are
some real options there for the
parties to consider.

16:25.318 --> 16:30.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, Ambassador McFaul, where do
you see the U.S. going from
here? Do you see Ambassador

16:30.990 --> 16:36.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kerry -- I'm sorry -- Secretary
Kerry engaging, putting the U.S.
more on the line in Syria

16:36.495 --> 16:38.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in order to find a solution?

16:38.564 --> 16:42.468 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
MICHAEL MCFAUL:
Well, two things.

16:42.468 --> 16:47.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, I want to stress the
importance of this possible
cease-fire, because, before,

16:47.473 --> 16:51.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the Russian attacks were
primarily against moderate
Syrian groups that we were
supporting.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

16:53.179 --> 16:56.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MCFAUL: And we just
couldn't let that go on. We just
cannot allow the Russians to

16:56.716 --> 17:01.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
kill the people we're
supporting. So that could be an
achievement.

17:01.320 --> 17:05.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With respect to the second
thing, yes, Secretary Kerry,
he's going to fight for this.
He's

17:05.358 --> 17:10.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to be engaged. It's the
way he does business. And there
is no doubt in my mind

17:10.396 --> 17:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that if he sees even a glimmer
of hope, he's going to try to
get these parties together

17:13.633 --> 17:17.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and work towards a
political transition.

17:17.503 --> 17:21.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My heart's with him. My head
suggests that it's going to be a
long, difficult fight.

17:21.340 --> 17:23.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you both
seem to agree on that.

17:23.809 --> 17:28.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joshua Landis, you both are
saying they're very far apart,
but there are some possibilities

17:28.381 --> 17:32.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here. What are the possibilities
that you see both sides working
on that could turn

17:32.084 --> 17:34.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this into something positive?

17:34.520 --> 17:40.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSHUA LANDIS: Well, it really
comes down to this -- these more
moderate militias that

17:40.159 --> 17:45.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are in the west of the country
that Assad wants to take. That's
Aleppo and it's Idlib.

17:45.598 --> 17:51.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Russia thinks -- and the
Syrians are all saying, you
know, people in Damascus are
telling

17:51.137 --> 17:53.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me, we're going to take Aleppo
in three months. Within a year,
you are going to see us mopping

17:53.072 --> 17:55.675 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up in this area.

17:55.675 --> 17:59.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They think they're going to do
this. Now, it's quite clear,
from what the ambassador

17:59.345 --> 18:03.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said, that America is not going
to allow that to happen. If
they're really going to support

18:03.149 --> 18:07.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their allies in that region,
they're going to have to send in
more arms in order to scuttle

18:07.386 --> 18:11.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Russians' plans and to suck
them into the swamp, so that
they will come back in

18:11.057 --> 18:16.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a year's time on bended knee and
say, OK, let's talk cease-fire.

18:16.429 --> 18:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question of where that
cease-fire is going to be, what
lines are going to be drawn
between

18:20.933 --> 18:27.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
sort of Sunni Syria and
regime-dominated Syria is what
it's all about today. And that's
going

18:27.206 --> 18:30.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to -- a lot of that's going
to depend on military power.

18:30.343 --> 18:34.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Huge challenge,
and a lot of questions
remaining. And we thank you both

18:34.613 --> 18:37.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for helping us at least explore
this as it gets under way.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ambassador McFaul, Joshua
Landis, thank you.

18:39.885 --> 18:45.424 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
JOSHUA LANDIS:
Pleasure. Thank you.

18:45.424 --> 18:50.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MCFAUL: Thank you.

18:50.997 --> 18:57.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now a look at
the power of organized labor in
politics.

18:57.169 --> 19:01.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Union membership is down, and
their influence is waning.

19:01.073 --> 19:06.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as political director Lisa
Desjardins reports, Democrats
still vie for their
endorsements.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Welcome to
one of 2016's front lines.

19:09.582 --> 19:10.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PROTESTER: When I say
union, you say power.

19:10.916 --> 19:12.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PROTESTER: Union!

19:12.018 --> 19:13.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PROTESTERS: Power!

19:13.152 --> 19:14.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PROTESTER: Union!

19:14.253 --> 19:16.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PROTESTERS: Power!

19:16.922 --> 19:24.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The complex
fight over unions. The drumbeat
was literal in Las Vegas
recently,

19:24.096 --> 19:28.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the city's powerful Culinary
Union marched to the Trump
Hotel, which has blocked unions.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PROTESTERS: We are one!

19:30.903 --> 19:35.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But this is
about more than Trump. It is
about union survival. In the

19:35.775 --> 19:41.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
nation as a whole, union
membership peaked long ago, in
1954, when more than one in
three

19:41.781 --> 19:48.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of all wage and salary workers
were union members. It declined
to 20 percent in 1983,

19:48.521 --> 19:51.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and then has kept sliding
down to 11.1 percent.

19:51.290 --> 19:53.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIA ELENA DURAZO, Union
Organizer: We're the only
organized force.

19:53.926 --> 19:57.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Longtime union
organizer Maria Elena Durazo.

19:57.630 --> 20:03.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIA ELENA DURAZO: I think,
unfortunately, unions have lost
so much strength and membership,

20:03.736 --> 20:08.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that our influence isn't what it
once was, but who else besides
unions fights for raising

20:08.574 --> 20:10.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the minimum wage?

20:10.776 --> 20:15.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This is the
complex part. While unions
represent fewer voters, they

20:15.314 --> 20:19.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and their fight for wages
remain critical to Democrats.

20:19.785 --> 20:25.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
While some unions have made
endorsements of candidates, some
major ones have not yet.

20:25.057 --> 20:30.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those includes the Teamsters
with 1.4 million members and
also the AFL-CIO with 12.5
million

20:30.863 --> 20:35.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
members, both organizations
known for turning out voters.
And the expectation is, if they

20:35.401 --> 20:39.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pick any candidate, it
will be a Democrat.

20:39.138 --> 20:42.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And those Democratic campaigns
are furiously fighting to get
their support.

20:42.508 --> 20:45.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
At that local rally
in Las Vegas...

20:45.277 --> 20:49.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: I'm here
in support of Local 226.

20:49.248 --> 20:53.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: ... Hillary
Clinton made an unannounced
visit. Just a month earlier,

20:53.385 --> 20:59.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her opponent Martin O'Malley
also stopped by a Culinary Union
protest. And Bernie Sanders,

20:59.492 --> 21:02.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he held a town hall with a
pivotal local chapter in March.
Why the contention?

21:02.995 --> 21:08.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON RALSTON, "Ralston Reports":
Culinary Union is by far the
biggest, most influential union,

21:08.234 --> 21:13.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
55,000 or so members, but, even
more importantly, the Culinary
Union is the Latino turnout
organization.

21:13.539 --> 21:18.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Jon Ralston,
veteran reporter and the host of
Nevada's premier political

21:18.244 --> 21:24.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talk show, "The Ralston Report,"
says where unions are growing is
also where the Democratic

21:24.016 --> 21:28.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Party is growing, with Hispanic
workers. And Nevada's Culinary
Union is using that leverage

21:28.921 --> 21:31.390 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with candidates.

21:31.390 --> 21:34.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON RALSTON: The Culinary is
doing something very smart, I
think. They've essentially --
withholding

21:34.994 --> 21:39.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their endorsement, I think they
actually pushed Hillary into the
position they want on the

21:39.165 --> 21:42.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so-called Cadillac tax in
Obamacare, which they want
repealed.

21:42.768 --> 21:48.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That so-called
Cadillac tax would tax extensive
and expensive insurance

21:48.707 --> 21:54.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plans that unions fought for. In
recent months, Clinton came out
against the tax. And in another

21:54.480 --> 21:59.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pro-union stance, she told Judy
Woodruff she opposes the
Trans-Pacific Partnership.

21:59.618 --> 22:03.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Now
looking back on it, it doesn't
have the results we thought

22:03.389 --> 22:07.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it would have in terms of access
to the market, more exports, et
cetera.

22:07.793 --> 22:11.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Her opponent
Bernie Sanders, meantime, has
filed nearly a half-dozen bills

22:11.797 --> 22:16.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to help unions and has railed
against such trade deals.

22:16.135 --> 22:18.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate: These
trade agreements, among other
things,

22:18.204 --> 22:24.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have contributed to the fact
that we have lost almost 60,000
factories since 2001 and

22:24.877 --> 22:29.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
millions of decent-paying jobs.
And I think enough is enough.

22:29.748 --> 22:33.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But while
Democrats hope for union
support, some key union leaders

22:33.419 --> 22:35.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have questions for them.

22:35.988 --> 22:41.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
J. David Cox is president of the
American Federation of
Government Employees. He watched

22:41.026 --> 22:44.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Democrats' debate in Las
Vegas and he noticed something.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
J. DAVID COX, President,
American Federation of
Government Employees: I heard
all five

22:46.498 --> 22:51.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the candidates on stage talk
about the need to raise wages in
this country. But the

22:51.670 --> 22:56.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one thing I didn't hear them
say was the word union.

22:56.642 --> 23:01.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It's as if,
even while asking for their
support, Democrats fear union is

23:01.447 --> 23:04.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a politically dirty,
unpopular word.

23:04.083 --> 23:07.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, indeed, back at the
protest in Las Vegas:

23:07.686 --> 23:13.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I just
wanted to come by and lend my
voice to all of yours, to wish

23:13.525 --> 23:15.060 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
you well in this
effort to organize.

23:15.060 --> 23:18.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Clinton
actually didn't say union there
either. But she did win over
voter

23:18.364 --> 23:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and housekeeper Carmen Llarull.

23:20.866 --> 23:24.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARMEN LLARULL, Protester: It's
a big thing. When I see her, I
say, oh, my God, she is

23:24.837 --> 23:32.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here. So, this rally today is a
win for us, because she just
walked with us.

23:32.278 --> 23:35.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But organizer
Durazo held on to her union's
leverage.

23:35.881 --> 23:41.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIA ELENA DURAZO: It's great
that she was here. We want to
see more of this from her

23:41.620 --> 23:44.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and from any of the other
candidates. And when they show
interest in our future, we

23:44.890 --> 23:47.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will show interest
in their future.

23:47.893 --> 23:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And the future
question is a big one for
unions, an existential one.

23:54.800 --> 23:59.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As they work to expand with
immigrant and other worker
groups and try to push Democrats

23:59.538 --> 24:04.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the left, unions fear a
potential crushing blow should a
Republican win the White House.

24:04.343 --> 24:09.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In the union debate, 2016
could be a defining fight.

24:09.848 --> 24:15.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Lisa Desjardins.

24:15.788 --> 24:27.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

24:27.232 --> 24:32.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
what a drinking tradition has to
do with the Greek debt crisis;

24:32.404 --> 24:37.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and why some co-ops under the
Affordable Care Act are going
bust.

24:37.109 --> 24:42.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, there is a new
speaker of the U.S. House of
Representatives, and the
political

24:42.348 --> 24:46.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
landscape may be shifting in the
Republican race for the White
House.

24:46.985 --> 24:50.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For that and more, we turn to
the analysis of Shields and
Brooks. That's syndicated
columnist

24:50.089 --> 24:52.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mark Shields and New York
Times columnist David Brooks.

24:52.591 --> 24:53.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to you, gentlemen.

24:53.192 --> 24:54.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy.

24:54.626 --> 24:57.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Friday before
Halloween. Thank you for being
here.

24:57.930 --> 25:03.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, let's talk about the lead
story tonight, Mark, and that is
the decision by the
administration

25:03.335 --> 25:08.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to send less than 50 special
operations troops into Syria.
They say, it's not a change,
there

25:08.741 --> 25:11.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
won't be -- they won't
be involved in combat.

25:11.877 --> 25:14.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But does this make it any
clearer what the
administration's strategy is in
Syria?

25:14.847 --> 25:18.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: No.

25:18.083 --> 25:22.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's -- well, taking them at
their word that they won't be
involved in combat, Judy,

25:22.588 --> 25:29.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
obviously, they are now in
harm's way. And it increases the
risk or exposure of capture

25:29.828 --> 25:32.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and all that that could mean.

25:32.898 --> 25:36.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. My view is,
you can leave the Middle East,
but it won't leave you. And

25:36.902 --> 25:39.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so the president's tried to
withdraw from the Middle East
and withdraw separately from

25:39.805 --> 25:45.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Afghanistan, and, as a result,
there has been a void and a
chaos and the destruction of

25:45.711 --> 25:48.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these two countries, of Syria
and Iraq, as we formerly knew
them, a continued crisis

25:48.080 --> 25:50.916 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Afghanistan.

25:50.916 --> 25:54.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so he's begun to look around
and seeing the situation
deteriorating, and he's trying

25:54.887 --> 25:58.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to adjust. And, to his credit,
he's trying to adjust in a way
that's politically embarrassing,

25:58.991 --> 26:01.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
because he made these
statements, we will not put
combat -- we will not put boots
on

26:01.427 --> 26:05.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the ground. He said
it bluntly in Syria.

26:05.130 --> 26:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he's doing the right thing.
The question is, is there a
strategy? And I still don't

26:08.600 --> 26:12.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see what the strategy is. Are we
willing to tolerate Assad? Are
we just trying to get

26:12.704 --> 26:16.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISIS? Are we trying to get
Assad? Who are we actually
trying to get?

26:16.141 --> 26:21.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then it's -- the steps are
so small. And so it looks like
the classic case of mission

26:21.780 --> 26:25.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
creep. And what happens if one
of these guys gets captured?
What happens if a Russian bomb

26:25.451 --> 26:29.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lands on them? You can imagine
the world the day after that.

26:29.888 --> 26:33.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so one would feel more
comfortable if there was some
plausible road forward, rather

26:33.592 --> 26:37.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than what you get this feeling
is, of a series of tactical
mission creeps.

26:37.296 --> 26:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you think
there is a strategy that the
administration is just not
sharing

26:41.533 --> 26:44.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with us, Mark? Do you think
that is what is going on?

26:44.770 --> 26:47.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, that may
very well be the case. I'm
always willing to admit my own

26:47.673 --> 26:50.142 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ignorance.

26:50.142 --> 26:58.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But four dozen American special
forces doesn't seem to be a
particular answer. This is --
you

26:58.183 --> 27:04.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
know, David is right.
Acknowledging the stakes is good
for any president to do. But we
have

27:04.356 --> 27:09.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drawn red lines. We have said
what was intolerable. Assad had
to go.

27:09.895 --> 27:16.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Now we're looking at an
election. And I hope Geneva is
successful. I hope that there is

27:16.034 --> 27:21.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an election. I hope he's voted
out and that he leaves. But I
don't see a master strategy

27:21.440 --> 27:23.675 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at work.

27:23.675 --> 27:27.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking of
master strategies and bringing
it all the way back home, we

27:27.112 --> 27:31.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do have a new speaker of the
House of Representatives. Paul
Ryan was elected this week.

27:31.316 --> 27:36.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had said for days that he
wasn't interested, but he
finally came around and he won a
big

27:36.655 --> 27:40.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- David, a big majority of the
Republicans. I guess only nine
voted against him. I guess

27:40.859 --> 27:46.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my -- but my question is, he
said in his speech yesterday the
House is broken, we're going

27:46.465 --> 27:48.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to start doing things
differently, we're going to work
with the other party.

27:48.901 --> 27:52.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is that something
he can deliver on?

27:52.170 --> 27:55.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Well,
temperamentally, he's sort of
fit for it. He had a nice line
in

27:55.574 --> 27:59.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there, that he said, if we have
clarity, we will have more
charity.

27:59.311 --> 28:03.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is both sides of him.
He has certain convictions, a
pretty conservative guy. But

28:03.949 --> 28:09.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he is also a really nice guy who
does get along with people and
who is a very charitable

28:09.288 --> 28:11.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
guy. And so I think,
temperamentally, he's well
suited for the moment, as much
as anybody

28:11.757 --> 28:14.860 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
can be.

28:14.860 --> 28:18.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he does believe in certain
things. And I think, if there is
-- can be small agreements

28:18.964 --> 28:24.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the next couple of months,
or 18 months, whatever it is, he
will go for it. But I don't

28:24.336 --> 28:29.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
expect that to happen. I think
the big news of Paul Ryan's
ascension is that it's possible

28:29.374 --> 28:35.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the Republican Party, after
really veering off into some
very dangerous political
territory,

28:35.013 --> 28:38.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now as its most prominent
spokesperson has Paul Ryan, a
very mainstream, popular,
admirable,

28:38.417 --> 28:41.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and attractive figure.

28:41.119 --> 28:45.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It may, if the presidential race
turns out a certain way, have
Marco Rubio. And Ryan

28:45.724 --> 28:50.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Rubio is a generational
shift and probably quite an
excellent leadership team as the

28:50.062 --> 28:51.563 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
two faces of the
Republican Party.

28:51.563 --> 28:55.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So you're tying
it to the presidential.

28:55.367 --> 29:00.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But just for a minute keeping it
in the House, Mark, is he --
he's saying, I want to work

29:00.138 --> 29:04.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the Democrats. I want to
work -- he said, I want to do
some bipartisan things. But
that's

29:04.176 --> 29:06.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
exactly what the most
conservative -- the Freedom
Caucus says they don't want to
do.

29:06.411 --> 29:09.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, I
agree with David.

29:09.715 --> 29:15.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paul Ryan is liked by Democrats
who have worked with him. If you
like somebody and agree with

29:15.721 --> 29:20.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their politics, you say he's a
person of convictions. If you
don't like what the person
stands for,

29:20.759 --> 29:26.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you can say he's an ideologue.
Democrats say that Paul Ryan is
an ideologue and that he

29:26.164 --> 29:31.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
does -- that he's
open to discussion.

29:31.570 --> 29:39.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's -- two things. I
thought he was quite cute in
saying that he -- on the budget
agreement

29:39.344 --> 29:43.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that was reached, two years,
which really makes his
speakership a lot more palatable

29:43.181 --> 29:45.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and possible success...

29:45.283 --> 29:45.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which Boehner,
the former speaker...

29:45.917 --> 29:50.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Which John Boehner
was the architect of and forged.

29:50.522 --> 29:56.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He didn't -- he condemned the
process, but he endorsed the
product. He voted for it,

29:56.261 --> 30:00.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, while condemning the
process, which was sort of a bow
to the right and to the

30:00.365 --> 30:02.901 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Freedom Caucus.

30:02.901 --> 30:08.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's a generational switch.
We have had -- now for eight
years, we have had Nancy

30:08.840 --> 30:15.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pelosi as the Democratic House
leader and John Boehner as the
Republican House leader,

30:15.080 --> 30:18.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
switching back and forth on the
speakership, Harry Reid, who is
going to retire, as the

30:18.684 --> 30:21.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Democratic leader in the
Senate, and Mitch McConnell.

30:21.753 --> 30:30.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this really is a major
generational -- generational
shift. I think, Judy, quite
bluntly -- David

30:30.028 --> 30:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mentioned the presidential -- I
think the Republicans are in
such dire circumstances

30:34.566 --> 30:42.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right now presidentially, right
-- they're on the cusp of
offering the nation two people

30:42.240 --> 30:47.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are, frankly, unelectable,
in Ben Carson and Donald Trump,
in my judgment, in the general

30:47.512 --> 30:53.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
election, that Paul Ryan as the
face of that party is very
important.

30:53.552 --> 30:57.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's going to have a tough task.
I mean, if either Trump or
Carson is the nominee, then

30:57.689 --> 31:00.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think the Republicans
could lose the House.

31:00.292 --> 31:04.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, pick up on
this theme of a generational
change, because you had

31:04.062 --> 31:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- and my question, David, is
coming off this debate this
week, where we didn't hear as

31:07.833 --> 31:13.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much from Donald Trump and Ben
Carson, and there just seemed to
be, you know, a sense

31:13.939 --> 31:18.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Marco Rubio did well, the
senator from Florida, Ted Cruz,
the senator from Texas,

31:18.677 --> 31:21.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're -- what are they,
both 44, 45 years old.

31:21.313 --> 31:22.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're of the generation
you just spoke about.

31:22.848 --> 31:24.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Right.

31:24.249 --> 31:28.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think it matters in two
ways. The first way is, there
are a lot of people who

31:28.386 --> 31:32.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grew up in the age of Reagan.
And Reagan's solutions are
sufficient, so let's cut
marginal

31:32.657 --> 31:37.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tax rates, let's pretend we're
going to cut the size of
government, and that's our
policy.

31:37.028 --> 31:40.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Marco Rubio, frankly, and
Paul Ryan grew up in a different
era. They grew up in an

31:40.999 --> 31:45.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
era where there were structural
changes in the economy that were
structural break -- fissures

31:45.036 --> 31:48.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the economy, such that you
could have growth, but no wage
growth. And so they understand

31:48.273 --> 31:51.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's not enough to
just cut taxes.

31:51.643 --> 31:56.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they have -- they, both
Ryan and Rubio, Cruz a little
less so, but have specific
targeted

31:56.114 --> 31:59.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
policies like wage subsidies and
stuff like that designed to get
money directly to the

31:59.985 --> 32:02.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lower middle class, the people
who have seen their wages
stagnant.

32:02.420 --> 32:06.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there's an ideological
shift. And then we just happened
to have the fact that Ryan

32:06.158 --> 32:12.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Rubio in particular, Cruz a
bit less, but also, they're so
wonky. Pelosi, Boehner,

32:12.998 --> 32:19.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
McConnell, these are political
people. Paul Ryan comes out of
Empower America, a think

32:19.905 --> 32:22.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tank. He's a think tank guy who
just happens to have some
political skills. Rubio is a

32:22.073 --> 32:24.476 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bit of the same.

32:24.476 --> 32:28.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so they're the wonkiest pair
we have had leading a party, if
they become that, of our

32:28.513 --> 32:30.348 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lifetime.

32:30.348 --> 32:34.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, at this
point, Mark, is -- you just said
a minute ago the Republican

32:34.319 --> 32:37.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Party is on the verge of
something, of coming apart.

32:37.956 --> 32:41.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think, Judy,
people comfort themselves.
Republicans say, oh, it's like

32:41.960 --> 32:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
2012, when we switched from Rick
Perry to Herman Cain to Mitt
Romney, then to Newt Gingrich,

32:47.766 --> 32:50.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
then to Rick Santorum,
then back to Mitt Romney.

32:50.235 --> 32:54.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No, it isn't like 2012. Now
we're looking at -- we're going
into a year from the election,

32:54.973 --> 33:00.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a year from the election, and we
have at the top, at the very
summit, we have Ben Carson,

33:00.712 --> 33:05.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Dr. Ben Carson, retired
neurosurgeon, and Donald Trump.

33:05.483 --> 33:10.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, if you think about it, in
that debate -- and David can
talk on it -- I thought Rubio

33:10.622 --> 33:14.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had a good night, but, I mean,
Donald Trump shows an
indifference to truth that
borders

33:14.226 --> 33:16.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on contempt. I mean,
when asked by...

33:16.561 --> 33:18.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What
are you referring...

33:18.363 --> 33:22.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: When asked by
Becky Quick, who said, you know,
you have said that Marco Rubio

33:22.734 --> 33:28.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was Mark Zuckerberg's favorite
senator, or basically his
servant, "Where do you get this

33:28.273 --> 33:29.774 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
kind of stuff?"

33:29.774 --> 33:34.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Well, it turns out
it's on his Web site.

33:34.212 --> 33:38.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Ben Carson says, I believe
we should tithe. That's the
taxing -- our tax system should

33:38.817 --> 33:42.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be based on tithing, said --
well, you have said that it
should be 10 percent, Dr.
Carson.

33:42.954 --> 33:46.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"I never said 10 percent." Now,
and Leviticus apparently says 15
percent. He's changed it

33:46.892 --> 33:47.592 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to 15 percent.

33:47.592 --> 33:49.294 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

33:49.294 --> 33:54.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: But, I mean, it's
just -- these are -- quite
candidly, they have candidates

33:54.032 --> 33:58.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who appeal to many Republicans.
And I'm not faulting them for
appealing to them.

33:58.670 --> 34:05.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Axelrod, Barack Obama's
architect, said that, in the
summer, you're in the beauty

34:05.710 --> 34:09.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
suit, the bathing suit
competition. You're kind of
looking and who do you like?
Then

34:09.347 --> 34:12.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you move into the talent
test competition.

34:12.350 --> 34:17.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We're in the talent test
competition now. And these two
are still at the top. And the

34:17.989 --> 34:24.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only establishment candidate who
really offers a potential help
is Marco Rubio.

34:24.429 --> 34:31.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I thought Ted Cruz had the best
night of anybody in the room. I
mean, he just showed himself

34:31.236 --> 34:36.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be brilliant and agile, and I
thought just as gifted a knifer
as anybody I have ever

34:36.074 --> 34:36.308 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
seen.

34:36.308 --> 34:37.909 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

34:37.909 --> 34:39.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Republicans just
like the bathing suits a little
more this year.

34:39.244 --> 34:39.644 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, they do.

34:39.644 --> 34:41.212 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

34:41.212 --> 34:43.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: So, I think it's
going to be cold. It will be a
little colder. It will

34:43.048 --> 34:45.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be December. They will be
in their bathing suits.

34:45.684 --> 34:50.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they can't nominate this
guy. Major parties do not
nominate people like Carson and
Trump.

34:50.455 --> 34:54.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These guys are so incompetent.
Whenever the actual subject is
running the country, they

34:54.292 --> 34:56.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just disappear from the debates.

34:56.728 --> 34:59.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I just have to feel -- I
have had no evidence for this.
And I have said this for six
months

34:59.664 --> 35:01.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
now, that they're
about to collapse.

35:01.499 --> 35:03.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Not that we're
keeping track. Not that we're
keeping track.

35:03.301 --> 35:04.703 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

35:04.703 --> 35:08.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: The emerald path
will get to Oz, the curtain will
come down, and Marco

35:08.239 --> 35:09.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Rubio will emerge triumphant.

35:09.307 --> 35:10.675 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

35:10.675 --> 35:13.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We have heard
you mention this before.

35:13.478 --> 35:15.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But what about...

35:15.080 --> 35:17.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I think it will --
I do think it will be Cruz and
Rubio at the end of the

35:17.315 --> 35:20.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
day. I think Cruz will inherit
the -- and Republicans are
really angry.

35:20.151 --> 35:24.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They think the country is going
down the tubes. And so they have
to express that somehow.

35:24.356 --> 35:28.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are expressing it now. And
I think -- but those voters will
eventually wind up with

35:28.193 --> 35:30.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cruz, and then the mainstream
voters will wind up with
somebody like Rubio or Kasich

35:30.829 --> 35:33.431 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or who knows.

35:33.431 --> 35:36.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I just can't imagine. A
major American party doesn't
nominate Donald Trump. I just

35:36.601 --> 35:37.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can't believe it. I will have
to go to Canada after that.

35:37.802 --> 35:39.170 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

35:39.170 --> 35:41.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But what about
Mark's point about -- you get to
react.

35:41.673 --> 35:43.341 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

35:43.341 --> 35:47.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But what about
Mark's point about -- some of
the candidates were asked

35:47.545 --> 35:51.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
questions, and then it turns out
later what they said didn't hold
out? So, what about...

35:51.583 --> 35:57.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. There was the
Carson moment with the dietary
supplement thing.

35:57.522 --> 36:02.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They -- I think the questioners
were not prepared for the
brazenness of the lies. Now, I
don't

36:02.594 --> 36:06.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
totally blame Donald Trump for
not knowing what's on his Web
page. I can't imagine he

36:06.097 --> 36:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ever read his Web page. He's
not into that sort of stuff.

36:08.900 --> 36:11.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But there was a certain
brazenness to it.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

36:12.670 --> 36:14.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And that's been
true of this year, that you --
somehow, there is no political

36:14.172 --> 36:15.707 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
price.

36:15.707 --> 36:19.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that's what Donald Trump
-- that is why he is a bit of a
game-changer, because

36:19.310 --> 36:23.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he has said eight million things
that are normally disqualifying,
but because the electorate

36:23.748 --> 36:28.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is so angry, at least that part
of the electorate, they say,
well, you know, he says all this

36:28.386 --> 36:30.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
crazy stuff, but we need
somebody who can really shake
things up. So they are willing

36:30.321 --> 36:32.457 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to tolerate it.

36:32.457 --> 36:34.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I still don't think they are
going to tolerate it at the end
of the day. That's my religion

36:34.793 --> 36:36.928 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right now.

36:36.928 --> 36:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Just take just
quick exception to David's
laudatory testimonial and
tribute

36:41.733 --> 36:46.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to Paul Ryan and to Marco Rubio.

36:46.504 --> 36:51.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans still are addicted
to the idea that once won them
the presidency. And that

36:51.376 --> 36:56.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was Ronald Reagan, cutting taxes
by a third, double the defense
budget and all the rest

36:56.514 --> 37:00.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of it. And they still pay lip
service, unbelievably, to a
balanced budget, as they are
offering

37:00.618 --> 37:03.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
supply-side tax cuts.

37:03.922 --> 37:08.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The two are just polar opposites
and mutually exclusive, but they
still talk in those terms:

37:08.293 --> 37:12.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Oh, yes, we will have a balanced
budget amendment as well.

37:12.430 --> 37:17.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And supply-side -- I think it's
been proved at this point that
supply-side basically helps

37:17.969 --> 37:19.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
those who are already
well-supplied.

37:19.737 --> 37:21.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is
all about cutting taxes.

37:21.539 --> 37:26.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It really is. And
I just think they all come back
to that.

37:26.678 --> 37:30.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Even Rubio, who is more
different and more creative, it
comes back to top -- cutting

37:30.949 --> 37:32.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the rate on the top.

37:32.851 --> 37:34.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: A little less
emphasis on that from Rubio.

37:34.452 --> 37:36.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

37:36.454 --> 37:39.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: When taxes were up
at 50 percent, you can cut them
down and it may have a big

37:39.491 --> 37:42.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
effect. Now they're in the 30s.
It has less effect. Rubio
acknowledges that.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But their budgets don't add up.
I totally concede that point.

37:44.028 --> 37:45.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: OK.

37:45.730 --> 37:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, next week,
we will get out the calculator
and figure it out.

37:47.866 --> 37:48.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:48.900 --> 38:02.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Brooks,
Mark Shields, thank you both.

38:02.680 --> 38:06.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now we head to Greece, a country
that's been inundated by a surge
of refugees washing up

38:06.584 --> 38:08.853 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on its shores.

38:08.853 --> 38:13.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time, Greece is
still reeling from a financial
crisis. The government has

38:13.525 --> 38:17.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been forced to cut spending and
raise revenue. Many citizens
aren't happy, especially with

38:17.862 --> 38:21.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a tax hike on a beloved
national drink.

38:21.099 --> 38:24.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has that story.

38:24.502 --> 38:30.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In a barn full
of pungent fumes, Demetrios
Papafigos is distilling,

38:30.608 --> 38:33.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
applying the techniques of monks
who created this
quintessentially Greek elixir in
the

38:33.611 --> 38:36.981 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
14th century.

38:36.981 --> 38:43.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This alcohol time capsule, in
the central town of Tyrnavos, is
at the heart of the latest

38:43.855 --> 38:49.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tax dispute in a country that's
broke and under intense pressure
to extract as much

38:49.427 --> 38:56.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
revenue as possible from its
citizens. Brewed from fermented
grape skins, it's a powerful,

38:56.367 --> 39:01.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
clear type of brandy, similar to
Italy's grappa, called tsipouro.

39:01.940 --> 39:08.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEMETRIOS PAPAFIGOS, Brewer
(through translator): Tsipouro
provides the grape growers with
supplementary

39:08.646 --> 39:11.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
income. Without it, the
vineyards would have to be
uprooted. The vineyards wouldn't
survive

39:11.482 --> 39:13.718 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
otherwise.

39:13.718 --> 39:18.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have only survived thanks
to production of tsipouro,
because, during difficult times,

39:18.590 --> 39:21.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when bad weather destroyed the
crop, we could even distill
damaged grapes and make some

39:21.392 --> 39:23.628 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
money.

39:23.628 --> 39:27.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Fellow grape
farmers from this close-knit
community have joined Papafigos

39:27.098 --> 39:33.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for lunch, washed down,
of course, with tsipouro.

39:33.938 --> 39:38.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the European Union gets its
way, the tsipouro makers will
have to pay double the alcohol

39:38.943 --> 39:44.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
excise duty, which is currently
applied. At the moment, the
liquor enjoys a low taxation

39:44.716 --> 39:50.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rate because it's considered to
be a traditional speciality, not
one that's mass produced.

39:50.688 --> 39:54.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Antonis Giamelides, the
technical director of the local
cooperative, is deeply
concerned.

39:54.892 --> 39:58.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTONIS GIAMELIDES, Cooperative
Technical Director: It's a crazy
situation. We don't

39:58.363 --> 40:06.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know what will happen tomorrow.
If the excise taxes go up at
that level, then it will destroy

40:06.371 --> 40:12.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all the wine production in
Greece, because these people
will not be producing any grapes

40:12.176 --> 40:14.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
anymore, because it
will not be profitable.

40:14.646 --> 40:21.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: At the moment,
there's no sign as to whether
Greece plans to obey the

40:21.953 --> 40:25.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
European Union. But, if it does,
the tax increase will be
implemented within the next
month

40:25.957 --> 40:28.559 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or so.

40:28.559 --> 40:33.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The European Union argues
tsipouro doesn't warrant the
lower rate, and claims small
home

40:33.731 --> 40:39.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brewers are cheating the system
by supplying restaurants on an
industrial scale. But the

40:39.304 --> 40:43.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Greeks are worried that
manufacturers in neighboring
Albania and Bulgaria will flood
the market

40:43.541 --> 40:47.211 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with black market tsipouro.

40:47.211 --> 40:50.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Silas Rapsaniotis, president of
the cooperative, warns that it
won't just be the farmers who

40:50.515 --> 40:52.917 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
will suffer.

40:52.917 --> 40:57.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SILAS RAPSANIOTIS, Cooperative
President (through translator):
There will be no profit for any

40:57.588 --> 41:02.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the businesses. The industry
will close down. It will be a
huge catastrophe here.

41:02.660 --> 41:07.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will stop being the poor
man's drink. It won't be drunk
at lunchtime, and it will have

41:07.098 --> 41:09.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a negative knock-on effect for
other connected businesses.
There will be shops such as
restaurants

41:09.534 --> 41:12.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that will close down.

41:12.603 --> 41:18.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In one of many
working-class districts in
Athens, the Greek capital, this

41:18.743 --> 41:22.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
teetotaling vegetarian
correspondent went in search
through meat and fish markets
for

41:22.613 --> 41:24.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Hellenic equivalent
of moonshine.

41:24.882 --> 41:30.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you think people will drink
less if the tax goes up?

41:30.321 --> 41:30.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COSTAS KARAGIANNIS,
Business Owner: Of course.

41:30.988 --> 41:33.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Costas
Karagiannis runs a lunch joint
in the city's main market, where

41:33.658 --> 41:37.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tsipouro is a staple.

41:37.595 --> 41:42.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
COSTAS KARAGIANNIS: The
customers will have to pay, more
expensive. And this time in
Greece,

41:42.800 --> 41:45.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's too difficult
to pay anything.

41:45.670 --> 41:50.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the
reasons a tax on tsipouro
strikes such a nerve is because

41:50.608 --> 41:55.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's not the fancy stuff. It's a
commoner's drink. People have it
with meat and cheese

41:55.546 --> 42:00.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the middle of the day. It's
part of the Greek circle of
life.

42:00.318 --> 42:03.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At this pavement cafe not far
from the market, these
pensioners were making the most
of the

42:03.888 --> 42:07.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
circle of life at
11:00 in the morning.

42:07.692 --> 42:12.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We'd
rather give up food than
tsipouro. Tsipouro is drunk when

42:12.930 --> 42:17.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the child is born, at its
baptism, at its wedding, and
even at his funeral.

42:17.435 --> 42:21.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): For
us, tsipouro is the best drink
of all.

42:21.105 --> 42:25.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: At the booze
shop next door, the owner was
quickly decanting four pints

42:25.910 --> 42:31.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the home brew for a taverna
owner who was expecting a rush
at lunchtime. The rough stuff

42:31.082 --> 42:35.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
is cheaper than bottled
tsipouro, but even so, this man
doesn't think his customers can

42:35.253 --> 42:37.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
take the extra tax hit.

42:37.321 --> 42:39.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: I think all restaurants
are going to close.

42:39.223 --> 42:41.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Why?

42:41.592 --> 42:47.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Because the prices are
too high, about the tax, yes.

42:47.198 --> 42:51.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We asked the
Greek Finance Ministry for an
interview, but no one was

42:51.235 --> 42:55.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
available. However, the
country's former chief tax
inspector, Harry Theocharis, did
talk

42:55.540 --> 42:59.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to us, and was sympathetic
to the grape farmers.

42:59.010 --> 43:02.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARRY THEOCHARIS, Former Chief
Greek Tax Inspector: Any tax at
this point in time which is a
drag

43:02.046 --> 43:08.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on growth is a problem, because
Greece's problem is jobs. That's
our number one problem, and

43:08.019 --> 43:12.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we need to do anything in our
power in order to create more
investment and more jobs.

43:12.089 --> 43:16.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Do you think
that a tax like this will create
an incentive for a larger

43:16.360 --> 43:18.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
black market in this?

43:18.796 --> 43:23.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARRY THEOCHARIS: It's possible.
We already do have a big black
market, due to the way

43:23.868 --> 43:26.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that we license those
small producers.

43:26.604 --> 43:30.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How crucial is
this to the overall financial
health of the country?

43:30.875 --> 43:35.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARRY THEOCHARIS: This is a very
small, small issue. I think it
starts with the commission

43:35.980 --> 43:43.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
taking us to court in order to
have a level, fair playing
field, so this has nothing to

43:43.788 --> 43:48.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do with the actual austerity. It
is not a measure that is done
because of that.

43:48.893 --> 43:54.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And that last
answer gives hope to the people
of Tyrnavos. Under their

43:54.131 --> 43:59.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interpretation of European
rules, Greece can refuse to
implement the tax increase. They

43:59.871 --> 44:03.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just hope that, after giving in
to Europe over so many financial
issues, the government

44:03.641 --> 44:07.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Athens will be prepared
to fight for tsipouro.

44:07.078 --> 44:12.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTONIS GIAMELIDES: That's our
tradition. That's our kind of
living, right? So, if we

44:12.683 --> 44:15.953 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
lose that, we're
losing everything.

44:15.953 --> 44:20.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In Greece,
tsipouro is known as the tear of
the land. But will this part

44:20.525 --> 44:25.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the land soon be in tears?
The key question for the
government is whether collecting
extra

44:25.763 --> 44:31.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
taxes makes good short-term
sense, or is bad for the economy
in the long term.

For the "PBS NewsHour," Hari
Sreenivasan, Athens, Greece.

44:42.280 --> 44:52.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the second
part of our look at the
Affordable Care Act and health

44:52.089 --> 44:56.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
insurance coverage, as
year three gets under way.

44:56.427 --> 45:01.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This weekend marks the beginning
of open enrollment in the health
exchanges, and we're looking

45:01.365 --> 45:06.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at some of the questions about
costs and coverage. One
development this fall that's
turning into

45:06.370 --> 45:11.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a concern for some consumers, a
series of collapses of an
alternative to traditional

45:11.108 --> 45:15.346 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
insurance plans known as co-ops.

45:15.346 --> 45:18.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nearly a half of them, which
were created through the
Affordable Care Act, are now
shutting

45:18.516 --> 45:20.384 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
down.

45:20.384 --> 45:26.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I sat down to discuss this all
yesterday with Mary Agnes Carey
of Kaiser Health News.

45:26.424 --> 45:28.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Mary Agnes Carey
is with us again.

45:28.392 --> 45:29.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, welcome back.

45:29.327 --> 45:31.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARY AGNES CAREY, Kaiser
Health News: Thanks.

45:31.796 --> 45:37.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, let's focus
on these -- this thing called
co-ops. Remind us exactly what

45:37.134 --> 45:40.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they are. And what did the
administration want them to
accomplish?

45:40.671 --> 45:44.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: As they were
negotiating the Affordable Care
Act, Democrats wanted

45:44.508 --> 45:48.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a public option. They wanted a
uniform option available to
everyone across the country for

45:48.279 --> 45:51.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
health insurance. That
wasn't going to happen.

45:51.315 --> 45:55.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, as an alternative, they
created these independent,
nonprofit co-ops that were to

45:55.920 --> 46:00.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
be an alternative to the
traditional insurer. And it was
to be an option for consumers.

46:00.391 --> 46:04.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And they had --
they believed this was going to
cover a chunk of the uninsured

46:04.528 --> 46:05.363 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out there?

46:05.363 --> 46:07.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARY AGNES CAREY:
They absolutely did.

46:07.565 --> 46:12.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But they ran into a few
roadblocks. For example, in a
budget deal a few years ago, the
funding

46:12.103 --> 46:15.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for co-ops was cut. There
recently was an announcement
from the Department of Health

46:15.840 --> 46:22.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Human Services they couldn't
give these companies and others
as much as anticipated

46:22.046 --> 46:24.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to help offset some of the
higher-cost cases. And that's
where some of the co-ops got
into

46:24.815 --> 46:26.784 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
trouble.

46:26.784 --> 46:31.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some of them were very popular.
They were low-cost alternatives.
That meant sometimes

46:31.389 --> 46:35.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sicker beneficiaries came to
them. And that's where some of
the financial problems happened.

46:35.359 --> 46:39.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's look,
Mary Agnes, at a gentleman. He's
-- his name is Edward

46:39.797 --> 46:44.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Azria. He lives in New York. He
was in a co-op in Brooklyn, but
then it collapsed. Let's

46:44.902 --> 46:46.971 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
hear from him.

46:46.971 --> 46:50.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EDWARD AZRIA, New York Resident:
The premium and the deductibles
were good, certainly for

46:50.975 --> 46:55.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my needs, because I'm not
habitually in the doctor's
office for anything.

46:55.513 --> 47:00.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it was easy to maintain,
coming out and starting out on
my own, to take that monthly

47:00.151 --> 47:05.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
payment where it was, without
having it be too heavy of a
burden going forward. And they

47:05.189 --> 47:07.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
provided everything
that I needed.

47:07.358 --> 47:12.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My biggest worry is that, to
stay within the same price
point, if it's even going to be

47:12.129 --> 47:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
possible, is the level of
services going to be diminished
because they have to make up

47:15.866 --> 47:21.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for it? The price point of the
co-op was obviously too good to
be true.

47:21.105 --> 47:24.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, it is going to be
interesting to see what they
actually do come up with and if
they're

47:24.308 --> 47:27.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to cut the services
to make up for it.

47:27.545 --> 47:32.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Mary Agnes,
what does the administration do
for someone like Mr. Azria?

47:32.416 --> 47:36.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: HHS Secretary
Sylvia Burwell had a briefing
with reporters. She was asked

47:36.087 --> 47:38.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a few questions about the
co-ops. She said, they're going
to have special outreach to

47:38.589 --> 47:40.558 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these folks.

47:40.558 --> 47:45.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're talking about 500,000
people or more in the 10 co-ops
that have folded that are

47:45.629 --> 47:50.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to be out there looking
for plans, reaching out to them,
explaining to them how to look,

47:50.067 --> 47:54.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how to navigate for their plans.
And also they're trying to
investigate what they might

47:54.739 --> 47:59.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be able to do, they being the
Department of Health and Human
Services, either
administratively

47:59.376 --> 48:03.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or through the legislative
process, to try to grant some
relief to some of these co-ops,

48:03.114 --> 48:06.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because of course there are some
that are still struggling
financially.

48:06.383 --> 48:10.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And do they think
they are going to be able to
find an option for someone

48:10.354 --> 48:12.123 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
like him at the
same price point?

48:12.123 --> 48:14.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARY AGNES CAREY: I
think they could.

48:14.358 --> 48:18.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to remember that, in
the Affordable Care Act, there
are different tiers of coverage,

48:18.195 --> 48:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bronze, silver, gold, and
platinum. If he's interested in
a lower monthly premium, a
bronze

48:22.833 --> 48:26.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plan might work for him. It may
not be the exact same plan he
had in his co-op, which

48:26.337 --> 48:29.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he obviously really liked.

48:29.273 --> 48:33.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, again, that's where,
whether you go on to
healthcare.gov yourself, or you
get assistance

48:33.644 --> 48:37.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from a broker or an insurance
agent, or work with many of the
community groups that are

48:37.882 --> 48:42.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kind of on the ground trying to
help people find coverage, he's
going to have to get in

48:42.052 --> 48:47.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there and look, what's covered,
are my doctors covered, are my
prescription drugs covered,

48:47.291 --> 48:50.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how much does this plan cost in
the premium, in the
out-of-pocket costs, what's the
total

48:50.928 --> 48:53.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
package, and how does it compare
to what he had and what he can
afford?

48:53.998 --> 48:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Explain again,
Mary Agnes, why a number of
these co-ops just didn't make

48:56.700 --> 48:58.469 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

48:58.469 --> 49:03.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: They had
basically had solvency issues,
financial solvency issues.

49:03.274 --> 49:08.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they were the lower price
point, that tended to attract
sicker beneficiaries. That would

49:08.245 --> 49:12.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drive up their costs. They had
anticipated fairly large
payments from the federal
government

49:12.850 --> 49:17.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to help offset the cost
of those sicker folks.

49:17.021 --> 49:22.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, of course, as we mentioned
earlier, there was a change and
their funding was cut early

49:22.193 --> 49:26.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on in inception of the co-ops.
And then, secondly, there was
another legislative change that

49:26.764 --> 49:30.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
adjusted the amount of money
that the federal government
could pay them.

49:30.501 --> 49:35.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a program that says, if you
have a lot of healthier
beneficiaries, you pay in, and

49:35.539 --> 49:37.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that is the insurers pay in and
that money is distributed to the
insurance plans that

49:37.908 --> 49:40.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
take care of the sicker folks.

49:40.945 --> 49:44.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The insurers, including many of
these co-ops, expected a much
more generous payment from

49:44.949 --> 49:48.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the administration than they're
receiving. And that has hurt
their bottom line.

49:48.319 --> 49:51.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what can the
administration do to shore them
up, or can -- or is there

49:51.255 --> 49:53.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
-- are there options?

49:53.457 --> 49:56.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: Well, for 10
of them at this point, they're
folding. They can't enroll

49:56.327 --> 50:00.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people in 2016. There are
23 co-ops. Ten are gone.

50:00.664 --> 50:05.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for the other 13, perhaps
the administration could do
something, whether it's through
their

50:05.236 --> 50:09.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
own administrative power or
through working with Congress,
because, remember, this is

50:09.373 --> 50:12.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
affecting people's constituents.
So, members of Congress are
hearing about this. There's

50:12.843 --> 50:15.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually two congressional
hearings that are going to
happen next week.

50:15.713 --> 50:19.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I expect there will be
greater focus on this, looking
at the co-ops that are still

50:19.149 --> 50:21.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
functioning and can
they help them.

50:21.652 --> 50:27.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, as we wrap
up, remind us again, when is
this third annual enrollment

50:27.157 --> 50:30.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
period coming up? And any other
advice for people who are
looking at whether or not they

50:30.561 --> 50:32.796 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
should sign up?

50:32.796 --> 50:35.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARY AGNES CAREY: Open
enrollment starts November the
1st, but you can get on
healthcare.gov

50:35.933 --> 50:38.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now and do some window shopping.

50:38.769 --> 50:44.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you want health insurance to
start January 1, you need to
enroll by December the 15th.

50:44.275 --> 50:47.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People always kind of forget
that. There is an administrative
period that needs to happen

50:47.411 --> 50:51.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get your coverage going. And
you can enroll through the end
of January.

50:51.515 --> 50:55.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, another piece of advice,
don't wait until the deadline.
Everyone -- we all love to wait

50:55.085 --> 50:56.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for the deadline,
but don't do that.

50:56.353 --> 50:57.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's me.

50:57.655 --> 51:01.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: Yes. Me, too.
I'm a reporter. That's what we
live by.

51:01.125 --> 51:04.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it would be important. If
you're interested in this, I
would encourage people to get on

51:04.461 --> 51:09.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
early and check it out. And if
you need in-person assistance,
get it. Look for a local
enrollment

51:09.366 --> 51:13.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
event. Call the 800 number on
healthcare.gov. Get the help
that you need.

51:13.103 --> 51:15.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So you can call
that number and get help?

51:15.673 --> 51:17.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: You can call
that number and get help.

51:17.708 --> 51:21.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say they have -- they being
-- the Department of Health and
Human Services says they have

51:21.245 --> 51:25.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
improved the functionality of
not only the Web site, but to
make sure those lines, those

51:25.549 --> 51:28.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
toll-free lines, are answered

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online: Much has been discussed
around Congress' budget

51:52.142 --> 51:57.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and debt deal that's been sent
to President Obama's desk. But
our Making Sense columnist

Larry Kotlikoff warns that the
bill cuts Social Security
benefits for millions of
Americans.

52:04.254 --> 52:07.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What exactly are those cuts? He
spells them out in today's
column, which you can find

Gwen Ifill is preparing for
"Washington Week," which airs
later tonight. Here's a preview.

52:34.451 --> 52:41.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's the revenge of
the 40-somethings. Paul Ryan,
Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, each had

52:41.658 --> 52:46.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a breakthrough week. But what
does that mean for Trump,
Carson, Bush, and the House
Freedom

52:46.730 --> 52:51.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Caucus? An intraparty fight
could define Republican politics
for a generation. Plus, boots on

52:51.969 --> 52:54.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the ground in Syria.

52:54.138 --> 52:58.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will delve into all that
tonight on "Washington Week" --
Judy.

JUDY WOODRUFF: On tomorrow's
edition of "PBS NewsHour
Weekend," will a new
desalination

53:04.048 --> 53:07.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
plant help to solve
California's water crisis?

53:07.918 --> 53:15.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: This facility will create
an opportunity to learn as to
what large-scale desalination

53:15.259 --> 53:18.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
could mean to Southern
California and the rest of the
state, for that matter. We have

53:18.595 --> 53:21.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
got the largest reservoir in
the world at our doorstep.

53:21.832 --> 53:26.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE TAIBBI: That all sounds
good, a drought-proof supply of
fresh water. But critics say
there

53:26.136 --> 53:30.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are still questions about desal
and the bandwagon is filling up
way too fast.

53:30.574 --> 53:34.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: We're sort of sticking
ourselves in the cycle. You
can't really desal yourself out

53:34.478 --> 53:37.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a drought, because what
you're doing is partly
contributing to the exacerbation
of

53:37.714 --> 53:39.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
climate change and
droughts long-term.

53:39.683 --> 53:44.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MIKE TAIBBI: Even with a
sufficient design, the plant
will burn from 840 megawatts of

53:44.655 --> 53:49.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
power per day, about the same
amount of electricity used to
power nearly 30,000 homes.

53:49.827 --> 53:55.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You can see the
whole story tomorrow night on
"PBS NewsHour Weekend."

53:55.332 --> 53:58.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:58.202 --> 53:59.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Have a great weekend. Thank
you, and good night.
