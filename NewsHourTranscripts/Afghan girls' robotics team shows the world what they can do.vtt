JUDY WOODRUFF: But first: An
all-girls team from Afghanistan
finally made it to the U.S.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this week to participate
in a robotics competition.

00:08.333 --> 00:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their visas were denied twice
by American officials, until
criticism prompted President

00:13.333 --> 00:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump to intervene
and reverse the decision.

00:16.433 --> 00:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The girls joined high school
students from more than 150
other countries, many of whom

00:21.333 --> 00:25.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
had never seen or
made a robot before.

00:25.200 --> 00:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown will look at some
of the immigration policy issues
this is raising once again.

00:29.733 --> 00:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we start with special
correspondent Kavitha Cardoza
of our partner Education Week.

00:34.733 --> 00:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She spoke to some of the Afghan
girls and other international
students in Washington,

00:38.833 --> 00:40.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
D.C.

00:40.133 --> 00:42.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's part of our weekly
series Making the Grade.

00:42.733 --> 00:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Hundreds
of high school students
arrived in Washington
from across the globe,

00:50.033 --> 00:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
robotics teams from Jamaica to
Jordan, Canada to Australia.

00:53.933 --> 00:56.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There was even one
representing refugees.

00:56.400 --> 01:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But none of the students had a
more unlikely journey, perhaps,
than the crowd favorite.

01:02.333 --> 01:04.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Team Afghanistan.

01:04.666 --> 01:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA:
Sixteen-year-old Kawsar
Roshan, one of the six girls,
says this was her proudest

01:09.533 --> 01:11.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
moment.

01:11.500 --> 01:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAWSAR ROSHAN, Student (through
translator): I was very happy,
and I was proud when the

01:14.400 --> 01:16.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people supported us.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm happy when people feel
that Afghans can do something.

01:19.300 --> 01:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: This robotics
competition is part of an
effort to get more young people,

01:26.100 --> 01:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
particularly from
underrepresented countries,
to enter STEM fields.

01:28.033 --> 01:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a term used to include
science, technology,
engineering and math.

01:32.666 --> 01:37.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A few months ago, all teams
received boxes containing
hundreds of identical parts, and

01:39.733 --> 01:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the students had to figure
out how to take the wheels and
gears, sensors and sprockets,

01:45.500 --> 01:48.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and create a robot.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FATEMAH QADERYAN, Student
(through translator):
We have an old computer,
but often it doesn't

01:49.966 --> 01:51.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
work.

01:51.533 --> 01:54.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KAVITHA CARDOZA:
Fatemah Qaderyan is from
the Herat province.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Almost 40 percent of
school-age children don't
have access to education.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even when they do, there's
often a shortage of
teachers and textbooks.

02:03.133 --> 02:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For many Afghan girls, Fatemah
says even getting to school can
be a challenge, because they

02:08.900 --> 02:10.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
need a man's permission.

02:10.333 --> 02:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FATEMAH QADERYAN (through
translator): We can't go alone.

02:12.666 --> 02:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we need someone to support
us, like a man, to get us to
the school, or other places

02:17.100 --> 02:19.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we want to go.

02:19.100 --> 02:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Their
coach, Alireza Mehraban, says
technology is hard to come by.

02:24.600 --> 02:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALIREZA MEHRABAN, Coach: We
don't have equipment of robotic.

02:27.266 --> 02:29.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We don't have it.

02:29.366 --> 02:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: He says even
though these girls were chosen
from more than 150 students,

02:35.400 --> 02:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because the team has no
experience in robotics, some
doubted their abilities.

02:37.533 --> 02:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALIREZA MEHRABAN: They say you
can't, because it's impossible.

02:40.033 --> 02:44.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For girls in Afghanistan,
can't do this, really.

02:44.066 --> 02:45.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's too hard for us.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: And what did
you say when they said that?

02:47.666 --> 02:49.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALIREZA MEHRABAN: We
say, we can do it.

02:49.633 --> 02:52.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Just we say, we can do it.

02:52.066 --> 02:54.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Just give us a chance.

02:54.100 --> 02:58.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Then, after
they built their robot, their
visas were denied twice.

02:58.466 --> 03:01.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They were not given
any explanation.

03:01.133 --> 03:05.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FATEMAH QADERYAN (through
translator): When we
applied and were rejected,
we are so disappointed.

03:05.066 --> 03:08.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We are crying a lot
for six or seven hours.

03:08.400 --> 03:11.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Mehraban can
hardly believe they're here.

03:11.266 --> 03:14.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WOMAN: How do you feel
when everyone cheers
team Afghanistan?

03:14.700 --> 03:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALIREZA MEHRABAN: What I have
to say, because the feeling
like I'm so happy, so happy.

03:20.566 --> 03:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I can't describe it best.

03:22.600 --> 03:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Really, I can't describe
it best, because a feeling
like I can't control myself.

03:28.833 --> 03:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Eighty percent
of these teams are made up
of boys, a gender gap that is

03:32.500 --> 03:35.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reflected in STEM
fields worldwide.

03:35.433 --> 03:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the inequality in education
is far bigger than just STEM
subjects and Afghanistan.

03:42.433 --> 03:44.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Around the world, more than
60 million girls don't have
access to any education.

03:44.766 --> 03:49.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The reasons vary, from wars,
to cultural mores, to something
as simple as distance.

03:51.966 --> 03:55.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Melissa Lemus is
with team Honduras.

03:55.233 --> 03:58.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MELISSA LEMUS, Student (through
translator): Some of my friends
live about two hours from

03:58.500 --> 04:01.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the high school, or
they have to take a bus.

04:01.300 --> 04:05.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: While Gregine
Kumba Natt with team Liberia
says often they don't have

04:05.900 --> 04:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
electricity during the day.

04:07.933 --> 04:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREGINE KUMBA NATT, Student: We
need to charge the robots, but
in our country, we have poor

04:11.733 --> 04:13.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
electricity.

04:13.766 --> 04:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We couldn't charge our phones
either, and because of that,
usually, we don't practice

04:18.200 --> 04:19.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at day.

04:19.133 --> 04:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We practice in the night hour.

04:21.166 --> 04:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: And like many
countries here, Ruby Balami
from team Nepal says her school

04:28.100 --> 04:31.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't have a science lab, so,
initially, she was nervous when
she saw teams from developed

04:32.800 --> 04:34.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
countries, such as
Japan and the U.S.

04:34.800 --> 04:39.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUBY BALAMI, Student: We think
that they are much competitive,
and it was a scary thing,

04:41.166 --> 04:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but, coming here, making them
friends, now we have -- feel
much more better, and now

04:47.866 --> 04:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we are much more confident.

04:50.433 --> 04:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Some
last-minute tinkering
and intense discussions,
and then it was showtime.

04:59.433 --> 05:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Each country's team was paired
with two others, often not
speaking the same language.

05:04.333 --> 05:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Learning to collaborate and
communicate is part of the goal,
says Dean Kamen, the founder

05:10.466 --> 05:12.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the competition,
FIRST Global Challenge.

05:12.433 --> 05:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEAN KAMEN, Founder, FIRST
Global Challenge: You're the
first generation on this planet

05:16.233 --> 05:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that could grow up with
all of its kids knowing
each other, working
together, creating value,

05:23.266 --> 05:28.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
so that you could all
have better lives, we
can have a better world.

05:29.700 --> 05:31.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's the
important thing here.

05:31.966 --> 05:36.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Fatemah
loved meeting students
from other countries.

05:36.533 --> 05:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She says she knows people think
of Afghanistan as a place of
violence and poverty, but she

05:42.400 --> 05:44.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wants to change that perception.

05:44.466 --> 05:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FATEMAH QADERYAN (through
translator): War like a habit
for us, because bomb blasting

05:50.166 --> 05:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and counterblasting and
killing people so normal for
us, because we see it a lot.

05:55.266 --> 05:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: She believes
the only way that can
change is through education.

05:57.633 --> 06:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her mother stopped at grade
six, and even now more than
three million children, mostly

06:03.733 --> 06:05.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
girls, are not
enrolled in school.

06:05.233 --> 06:09.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But someday, Fatemah wants to
get a Ph.D. in computer science.

06:09.866 --> 06:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FATEMAH QADERYAN (through
translator): Because I
need this, our country
needs this, to have

06:16.333 --> 06:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
women educated, to be new
generation in the future.

06:19.333 --> 06:23.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I want to show the world
what Afghan girls, or
young girls, can do.

06:23.400 --> 06:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We can show them, when we have
a creative idea, we can do it.

06:27.466 --> 06:32.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: For
the "PBS NewsHour" and
Education Week, I'm Kavitha
Cardoza in Washington,

06:32.933 --> 06:35.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
D.C.

06:35.066 --> 06:38.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: As Kavitha said,
the visa question for the Afghan
girls gained national attention

06:39.900 --> 06:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the direct intervention
by President Trump.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Alan Gomez from USA Today
joins me now to talk about
that part of the story.

06:46.433 --> 06:49.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Alan, was this a
special case, an outlier?

06:49.700 --> 06:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What, if anything, does it
tell us about the current
situation with visas?

06:54.066 --> 06:58.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ALAN GOMEZ, USA Today:
Well, absolutely, this
was a complete outlier.

06:58.533 --> 07:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Understand that the Trump
administration has made clear
throughout its time that it will

07:02.400 --> 07:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
handle any visa application
on a case-by-case basis,
exceptions can always be made.

07:09.333 --> 07:13.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But this case definitely
represents a very
sharp departure from
what has been a pretty

07:15.366 --> 07:19.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
clear strategy from
this administration to
limit, to restrict, to
in some cases completely

07:20.366 --> 07:22.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
suspend immigration from
terror-prone countries.

07:22.666 --> 07:26.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, understand that, you know,
we're still dealing with the
travel ban that the president

07:26.966 --> 07:31.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has been trying to implement
now for months that is directed
at six countries that have

07:31.166 --> 07:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been labeled as having very
close ties to terrorism.

07:34.066 --> 07:39.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has completely suspended
the refugee program, all in
the name of national security.

07:41.466 --> 07:44.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Afghanistan has
never been on any of
those lists of countries,
but, you know, I think

07:44.866 --> 07:49.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it would be pretty easy to make
a case that Afghanistan has a
bit of history with terrorism,

07:51.833 --> 07:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so that's why this case makes
it -- is so, so surprising
that it's threes girls from

07:54.833 --> 07:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Afghanistan that have been
allowed into the country.

07:57.466 --> 08:02.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, I wonder,
do we even know yet why they
were denied visas originally?

08:04.833 --> 08:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ: No, the State
Department generally
discuss individual
cases and why it makes

08:07.633 --> 08:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
individual determinations.

08:10.433 --> 08:15.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But when you think about
the overall posture of
this administration to
seriously scrutinize

08:17.433 --> 08:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
any visas, any visa applications
that are coming from countries
with those ties to terrorism,

08:22.800 --> 08:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it follows that trend of
denying a lot of those visas
from people coming from those

08:25.033 --> 08:27.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
countries.

08:27.100 --> 08:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, so
this case raises some -- plays
into some larger confusions

08:28.766 --> 08:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and that continuing controversy.

08:30.800 --> 08:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to ask you about one
other development in the visa
world that came yesterday.

08:34.833 --> 08:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The government announced they're
adding 15,000 new H-2B visas.

08:39.833 --> 08:41.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now, explain what's
going on there.

08:41.966 --> 08:43.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ALAN GOMEZ: Yes.

08:43.933 --> 08:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's just another example
of why it's so difficult to
try to figure out sort of

08:46.600 --> 08:50.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
what direction this
administration is going
when it comes to the
legal immigration system

08:50.600 --> 08:52.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the United States.

08:52.666 --> 08:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just a couple of months ago,
to give you some background,
the president ordered a total

08:56.033 --> 08:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
review of the H-1B visa program.

08:59.533 --> 09:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are visas dedicated
to foreigners who are
trained in science,
technology, engineering,

09:04.200 --> 09:06.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mathematics.

09:06.233 --> 09:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're used by technology
companies to bring in computer
scientists and programmers.

09:09.133 --> 09:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Trump administration
ordered a review of the program
because they believe that there

09:13.133 --> 09:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is too much fraud and that
these technology companies are
abusing that program to just

09:17.500 --> 09:18.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
import cheaper labor.

09:18.900 --> 09:20.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, we had that
as the background.

09:20.733 --> 09:22.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They talk about
American workers first.

09:22.566 --> 09:25.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that's sort of the
posture that they have
been proceeding under.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's H-1.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's the H-1.

09:27.566 --> 09:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, this is H-2, which
is for temporary workers.

09:29.533 --> 09:32.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALAN GOMEZ: Right.

09:32.033 --> 09:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, all of a sudden,
yesterday, we get this
announcement that they
are going to approve

09:34.566 --> 09:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
15,000 additional new
visas for H-2B visas, and
these are dedicated to
lower-skilled workers.

09:42.566 --> 09:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Think about people who work
in fisheries, in hotels, in
construction, in resorts, and

09:49.000 --> 09:51.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those are the kind of workers
that they're going to allow in.

09:51.066 --> 09:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The argument from the Trump
administration is that these
companies, a lot of them were

09:55.133 --> 09:58.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in very desperate need of
the labor, that they couldn't
find American workers to do

09:58.866 --> 10:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that job, so they needed to
bring in these additional
workers to do it.

10:02.133 --> 10:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, again, it sort of goes
against what the administration
has been arguing for all these

10:06.900 --> 10:11.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
months, that they are going
to limit the immigration
system to help American
workers and to reduce

10:13.366 --> 10:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the competition that they're
facing here in the country.

10:14.766 --> 10:16.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: All
right, ever evolving.

10:16.433 --> 10:18.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Alan Gomez, USA Today,
thanks very much.

10:18.366 --> 10:18.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALAN GOMEZ: Thank you.
