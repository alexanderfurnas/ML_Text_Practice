WEBVTT

00:01.100 --> 00:02.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and now for an opposing
view we turn to

00:02.366 --> 00:04.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Senator Mike Lee of
Utah he was one of

00:04.833 --> 00:07.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
22 Republican
senators who signed a

00:07.833 --> 00:09.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
letter to President
Trump last week

00:09.400 --> 00:11.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
urging him to withdraw
from the Paris

00:11.866 --> 00:14.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
agreement senator
Lee welcome to the

00:14.066 --> 00:17.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
program I believe you
just heard the the

00:17.033 --> 00:19.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
response of California
Governor Jerry

00:19.366 --> 00:22.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Brown who argues this
is a fundamentally

00:22.200 --> 00:24.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wrong decision he
said it's going to set

00:24.866 --> 00:26.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
back the cause of
fighting climate

00:26.466 --> 00:30.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
change yeah I think
he's wrong I think I

00:30.766 --> 00:32.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
disagree with every
word every syllable

00:32.666 --> 00:34.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he uttered including
the words but and

00:34.600 --> 00:37.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and look this was a
right decision this

00:37.533 --> 00:40.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was the right thing
to do when President

00:40.033 --> 00:41.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Obama entered into
this agreement a

00:41.800 --> 00:43.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
couple of years ago
he didn't submit it

00:43.533 --> 00:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the United States Senate for

00:46.233 --> 00:49.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ratification as a
treaty he didn't do

00:49.133 --> 00:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that because he knew there was

00:50.400 --> 00:52.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
absolutely no way
he could get the

00:52.166 --> 00:54.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
two-thirds supermajority
vote necessary

00:54.033 --> 00:55.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in order to get this
ratified in order

00:55.966 --> 00:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to make it law of the land as a

00:57.333 --> 00:59.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
governing treaty he
didn't do that and

00:59.466 --> 01:01.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
consequently was
entirely foreseeable

01:01.400 --> 01:03.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that when a different
president from a

01:03.866 --> 01:05.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
different party with
a different point

01:05.200 --> 01:07.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of view came along
he would not move

01:07.666 --> 01:08.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
forward with it

01:08.900 --> 01:10.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president Trump did
that today because

01:10.566 --> 01:12.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he decided this was
not in the interests

01:12.633 --> 01:14.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the United States
of America he did

01:14.133 --> 01:15.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the right thing
senator one of the

01:15.833 --> 01:17.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
arguments that we
heard Governor Brown

01:17.400 --> 01:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and others making today is that

01:18.900 --> 01:20.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
President Trump
and those who are

01:20.566 --> 01:22.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pushing this decision today

01:22.166 --> 01:24.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
don't understand the
way the climate and

01:24.966 --> 01:28.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
jobs the economy
interact that in fact

01:28.166 --> 01:30.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
when you do less to
fight climate change

01:30.700 --> 01:34.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as this as what the
president in effect

01:34.233 --> 01:36.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is doing he's missing
a chance for the

01:36.500 --> 01:38.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
United States to
move ahead with clean

01:38.300 --> 01:41.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
energy technology so
in other words that

01:41.533 --> 01:43.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that what he's done
is going to cost

01:43.233 --> 01:46.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
jobs rather than
increase them you know

01:46.333 --> 01:48.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I would flip it on
him I would point out

01:48.866 --> 01:51.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
quite to the contrary
what has brought

01:51.433 --> 01:53.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
down emissions book
from stationary

01:53.966 --> 01:55.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sources like power
plants and from

01:55.766 --> 01:58.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mobile sources
like automobiles is

01:58.000 --> 02:00.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
innovation improvements
in technology

02:00.566 --> 02:01.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that have occurred
as a result of free

02:01.833 --> 02:04.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
market forces and in
the absence I would

02:04.300 --> 02:07.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
add of anything like
a treaty comparing

02:07.566 --> 02:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the Paris agreement so this

02:09.733 --> 02:11.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has happened through
innovation through

02:11.133 --> 02:14.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
free market forces
I think quite the

02:14.000 --> 02:15.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
opposite of what
Governor Brown was

02:15.633 --> 02:17.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
saying that when
the government gets

02:17.466 --> 02:19.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
involved it tends to
squelch innovation

02:19.466 --> 02:22.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and in that innovation
is needed for us

02:22.066 --> 02:23.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to control emissions

02:23.033 --> 02:24.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
let me quote something that your

02:24.533 --> 02:27.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
predecessor the former
EPA Administrator

02:27.166 --> 02:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gina not your
predecessor I'm sorry the

02:29.633 --> 02:31.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
former EPA Administrator
Gina McCarthy

02:31.600 --> 02:33.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has said today she
said this is an

02:33.900 --> 02:35.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
embarrassing day for
the United States

02:35.866 --> 02:37.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
she went on to say
make no mistake

02:37.233 --> 02:38.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because of this
reckless decision our

02:38.733 --> 02:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
businesses will lose investment

02:40.800 --> 02:42.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
opportunities we
will seed technology

02:42.833 --> 02:45.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
breakthroughs to
countries that will

02:45.133 --> 02:47.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
take over our
leadership role and the

02:47.300 --> 02:48.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rest of the world
will question whether

02:48.900 --> 02:51.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the u.s. can be
trusted yeah that's

02:51.866 --> 02:53.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pretty apocalyptic
I think that's

02:53.533 --> 02:54.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
apocalyptic to the
point of straining

02:54.966 --> 02:57.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
credulity look these
are smart people

02:57.666 --> 03:00.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but they are not
omniscient and I think

03:00.700 --> 03:02.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their prophecies of
doom and gloom are

03:02.833 --> 03:04.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
entirely unwarranted
and in fact I think

03:04.766 --> 03:06.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they're inappropriate
again we have to

03:06.766 --> 03:08.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
get back to the fact
that this power the

03:08.366 --> 03:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
power to enter into binding

03:09.533 --> 03:11.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
international
agreements this is a

03:11.300 --> 03:13.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
shared power this is
something that was

03:13.666 --> 03:16.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
decided should be a
shared power at the

03:16.466 --> 03:18.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Constitutional
Convention some 230 years

03:18.666 --> 03:21.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ago as I explained
in my new book that

03:21.333 --> 03:23.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
came out this week
we called written out

03:23.466 --> 03:26.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of history the these
powers that are

03:26.900 --> 03:28.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
vested in the federal
government have to

03:28.733 --> 03:30.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be clearly enumerated
they have to be

03:30.933 --> 03:34.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
limited and we
can't give excessive

03:34.000 --> 03:36.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
unfettered power to
a president to act

03:36.533 --> 03:40.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
alone to bind an
entire country to a set

03:40.200 --> 03:41.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of principles a set
of rules that the

03:41.833 --> 03:44.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president him or
herself makes that's

03:44.400 --> 03:46.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what we would be
allowing presidents to

03:46.066 --> 03:47.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do if we said any
time a president like

03:47.666 --> 03:50.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
President Obama
wants to subject an

03:50.133 --> 03:51.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
entire country to
a new set of rules

03:51.733 --> 03:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that president can do so without

03:54.100 --> 03:56.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
submitting that
international agreement

03:56.300 --> 03:58.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to the Senate for
treaty ratification

03:58.266 --> 04:00.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
well senator maybe
this is along those

04:00.000 --> 04:02.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lines but I'm now
reading comments even

04:02.066 --> 04:03.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from some Republicans
who have a problem

04:03.833 --> 04:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with this decision a Republican

04:05.633 --> 04:08.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
congressman from
Florida Carlos Cabello

04:08.033 --> 04:10.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was interviewed I
heard just within the

04:10.100 --> 04:11.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hour

04:11.333 --> 04:12.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he's saying this is
a mistake he said

04:12.533 --> 04:13.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm already seeing
the impact of climate

04:13.900 --> 04:16.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
change on my part
of the state and we

04:16.833 --> 04:19.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
need to move forward
with technology to

04:19.433 --> 04:21.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
address it I'm going
to quickly quote

04:21.066 --> 04:22.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the four

04:22.266 --> 04:24.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republican Treasury
Secretary Henry

04:24.566 --> 04:26.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Paulson who said
he's dismayed and

04:26.566 --> 04:28.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
disappointed he said
by moving ourselves

04:28.133 --> 04:31.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to the sidelines of
an evolving global

04:31.033 --> 04:33.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
conversation he said
we've left a void

04:33.200 --> 04:35.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for others to fill
regrettably this

04:35.400 --> 04:37.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
undermines us
credibility weakens our

04:37.933 --> 04:42.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ability to lead in
other areas yeah I

04:42.300 --> 04:44.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
look I completely
disagree the fact that

04:44.166 --> 04:45.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you can point to
some people who call

04:45.900 --> 04:47.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
themselves Republicans
who disagree with

04:47.633 --> 04:49.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this decision
doesn't change this

04:49.766 --> 04:51.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
analysis and I
notice there wasn't a

04:51.533 --> 04:53.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
corresponding push
back to the person

04:53.333 --> 04:55.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who preceded me you
didn't push back

04:55.100 --> 04:57.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
like this to Governor
Brown I understand

04:57.533 --> 05:00.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that you might disagree
personally with

05:00.133 --> 05:02.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what senator did
today senator but that

05:02.333 --> 05:04.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
doesn't make it I'm
sorry I'd like to

05:04.433 --> 05:06.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
answer your question
and that doesn't

05:06.633 --> 05:08.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mean that this was
wrong this was the

05:08.833 --> 05:10.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
right thing to do
the president put

05:10.633 --> 05:14.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people before this
Paris agreement he

05:14.466 --> 05:17.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
put Pittsburgh before
Paris he did the

05:17.000 --> 05:19.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
right thing senator
just to set the

05:19.366 --> 05:21.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
record straight I
quoted president

05:21.200 --> 05:24.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trump's several times
back to Governor

05:24.000 --> 05:25.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Brown in my interview
with him just as

05:25.600 --> 05:28.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I've quoted some who
critic criticized

05:28.266 --> 05:30.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the president's
decision in my interview

05:30.500 --> 05:33.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with you finally
senator Lee but I want

05:33.200 --> 05:34.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to be clear the reason
I made that point

05:34.633 --> 05:37.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is you didn't try
to identify some

05:37.333 --> 05:39.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Democrats who might
have supported this

05:39.033 --> 05:41.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you quoted the
President himself and

05:41.166 --> 05:43.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what I'm saying is
you're pushing back

05:43.033 --> 05:45.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on me in a way you
didn't put push back

05:45.233 --> 05:47.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on him that's fine
that's your right to

05:47.033 --> 05:49.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do that as a
reporter well let me

05:49.000 --> 05:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
finally ask you senator the the

05:51.433 --> 05:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
president said he's open to

05:52.733 --> 05:54.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
renegotiation we're
already hearing from

05:54.833 --> 05:57.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
European officials
that it's the this is

05:57.300 --> 05:59.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an accord not open
for renegotiation so

05:59.733 --> 06:02.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
how do you how do
you foresee moving

06:02.166 --> 06:05.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ahead in that direction
well if they're

06:05.266 --> 06:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
saying that this is not open for

06:06.600 --> 06:09.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
renegotiation and
this negotiation was

06:09.733 --> 06:11.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
itself something
that couldn't get

06:11.433 --> 06:12.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
through the United
States Senate and

06:12.666 --> 06:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that's why President Obama never

06:13.900 --> 06:15.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
submitted it to the
Senate for treaty

06:15.600 --> 06:17.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ratification then
we are at an impasse

06:17.733 --> 06:19.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and we will proceed
we will proceed by

06:19.866 --> 06:21.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the way I should add
as a global leader

06:21.866 --> 06:25.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in environmental
regulation we are a

06:25.000 --> 06:27.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
global leader in the
rule of law we have

06:27.333 --> 06:28.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
brought down emissions
in this country

06:28.800 --> 06:30.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
through our legal
system and through

06:30.600 --> 06:32.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
technological innovation
we can do this

06:32.966 --> 06:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on our own we don't have to have

06:34.433 --> 06:36.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the permission of
countries all over the

06:36.366 --> 06:37.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
world to do that
we've done it pretty

06:37.966 --> 06:39.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
well we've done it
much better than a

06:39.733 --> 06:41.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lot of our would-be
partners in this

06:41.266 --> 06:44.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
agreement Senator
Mike Lee of Utah thank

06:44.500 --> 06:47.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

talking with us thank

06:47.300 --> 06:48.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
