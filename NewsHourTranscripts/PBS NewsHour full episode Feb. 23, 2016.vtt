GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill.
Judy Woodruff is on assignment.

00:07.875 --> 00:09.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:09.810 --> 00:12.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
For many years, it's been clear
that the detention

00:12.880 --> 00:17.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
facility at Guantanamo Bay
doesn't advance
our national security.

00:17.484 --> 00:22.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: President Obama
gives Congress
a plan to shut down the
controversial Guantanamo

00:22.756 --> 00:26.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bay detention center, and
Congress pushes
back.

00:26.593 --> 00:32.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead: Republicans get
ready for tonight's
caucuses in Nevada, one week out
from Super

00:32.065 --> 00:33.934 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Tuesday.

00:33.967 --> 00:38.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the first in our two-part
series on how
Los Angeles is working to
improve its special

00:38.939 --> 00:44.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
education programs after a court
case exposed
a broken system nearly 20 years
ago.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHARYN HOWELL, Special Education
Director,
Los Angeles Unified School
District: What

00:46.880 --> 00:50.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have been working on for a
number of years
is to convince people that
students with disabilities

00:50.951 --> 00:54.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are all of our responsibility.
They don't
belong to the Division of
Special Education.

00:54.554 --> 00:57.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:57.991 --> 01:02.296 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:02.329 --> 01:15.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: From President Obama
today came
a fresh appeal to -- quote --
"close a chapter

01:15.175 --> 01:21.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at Guantanamo." From Republicans
came an outright
refusal. It all focused on a
fight that's

01:21.148 --> 01:24.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gone at least as long as he's
been president.

01:24.284 --> 01:28.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
For many years, it's been clear
that the detention

01:28.088 --> 01:35.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
facility at Guantanamo Bay
doesn't advance
our national security. It
undermines it.

01:35.262 --> 01:40.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For the president,
it may be his
final chance to keep a 2008
campaign promise:

01:40.801 --> 01:43.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shutting down the military
prison at Guantanamo.

01:43.270 --> 01:47.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BARACK OBAMA: It's
counterproductive to our
fight against terrorists,
because they use

01:47.474 --> 01:54.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it as propaganda in their
efforts to recruit.
It drains military resources,
with nearly

01:54.114 --> 02:01.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
$450 million spent last year
alone to keep
it running, and more than $200
million in

02:01.588 --> 02:07.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
additional costs needed to keep
it open going
forward for less than 100
detainees.

02:07.427 --> 02:15.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: At its peak in 2003,
Guantanamo
held 680 detainees. Today, 91
prisoners remain

02:15.969 --> 02:21.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the detention facility; 35
are expected
to be transferred out by this
summer.

02:21.708 --> 02:27.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president's new proposal
would send the
remaining detainees to an
unspecified facility

02:27.247 --> 02:33.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inside the United States. It
speaks of 13
potential sites, including
civilian prisons

02:33.220 --> 02:35.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and military bases, but makes no
recommendation.

02:35.989 --> 02:41.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: The notion of
having terrorists
held in the United States,
rather than in

02:41.428 --> 02:48.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some distant place, can be
scary. But part
of my message to the American
people here

02:48.235 --> 02:53.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, we're already holding a
bunch of really
dangerous terrorists here in the
United States,

02:53.040 --> 02:59.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because we threw the book at
them, and there
have been no incidents. We have
managed it

02:59.513 --> 03:01.248 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
just fine.

03:01.281 --> 03:05.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Then-President
George W. Bush
first ordered foreign terror
suspects held

03:05.452 --> 03:07.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at Guantanamo after 9/11.

03:07.320 --> 03:12.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Guantanamo will be
closed no
later than one year from now.

03:12.225 --> 03:17.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But in one of his
first acts as
president, Mr. Obama signed an
executive order

03:17.097 --> 03:24.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to shut it down. Today, he
pointed out that,
early on, the decision appeared
to have bipartisan

03:24.438 --> 03:26.206 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
backing.

03:26.239 --> 03:33.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: My predecessor,
President Bush,
to his credit, said he wanted to
close it.

03:33.313 --> 03:38.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was one of the few things
that I and my
Republican opponent, Senator
John McCain,

03:38.785 --> 03:40.554 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agreed on.

03:40.587 --> 03:43.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But McCain and
others have never
backed this president's
solution, and have

03:43.690 --> 03:48.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even passed a law that would bar
moving detainees
to American soil.

03:48.862 --> 03:51.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell underscored
that point today.

03:51.731 --> 03:54.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader:
We will review President Obama's
plan. But

03:54.468 --> 03:59.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since it includes bringing
dangerous terrorists
to facilities in U.S.
communities, he should

03:59.539 --> 04:05.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know that the bipartisan will of
Congress
has already been expressed
against that proposal.

04:05.712 --> 04:11.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Presidential
candidates also weighed
in. Democratic Senator Bernie
Sanders welcomed

04:11.284 --> 04:15.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president's announcement.
And Hillary
Clinton has said she too
supports shutting

04:15.455 --> 04:17.157 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the prison down.

04:17.190 --> 04:20.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Republicans, including
front-runner Donald
Trump, roundly rejected the
plan.

04:20.827 --> 04:24.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
This morning, I watched
President Obama talking

04:24.397 --> 04:29.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about Gitmo, right, Guantanamo
Bay, which,
by the way, which, by the way,
we are keeping

04:29.703 --> 04:31.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
open, which we are keeping open.

04:31.304 --> 04:33.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

04:33.073 --> 04:35.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And we're going to
load it up
with some bad dudes, believe me.
We're going

04:35.709 --> 04:37.544 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to load it up.

04:37.577 --> 04:41.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The president said
he is clear-eyed
about the tough odds he faces
getting Congress

04:41.248 --> 04:46.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to agree with him. But the White
House has
not ruled out trying to close
Guantanamo through

04:46.319 --> 04:48.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
executive action.

04:48.288 --> 04:53.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will hear from senators on
both sides of
the issue after the news
summary.

04:54.027 --> 04:58.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: Senate
Republicans
made it official: There will be
no hearings

04:58.565 --> 05:04.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and no vote on anyone President
Obama nominates
for the Supreme Court. Majority
Leader Mitch

05:04.037 --> 05:09.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
McConnell said nearly all of his
members support
that decision, and he said that
he won't even

05:09.242 --> 05:11.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
agree to meet with a nominee.

05:11.511 --> 05:16.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The announcement gave new life
to the partisan
war of words that has erupted
over the future

05:16.283 --> 05:18.018 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the court.

05:18.051 --> 05:21.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R), Texas:
It's up to the
American people in this next
election, no

05:21.421 --> 05:26.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
matter who they choose, to make
the nomination
for this important seat on the
Supreme Court.

05:26.593 --> 05:32.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Justice Scalia served for 30
years. So, this
clearly extends far beyond
President Obama's

05:32.165 --> 05:34.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
term of office.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. CHARLES SCHUMER (D), New
York: Today's
effort by Senator McConnell to
get every member

05:36.269 --> 05:41.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Judiciary Committee to
sign a letter
saying they won't do hearings is
an effort

05:41.541 --> 05:48.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make this issue go away. It
won't. The
American people won't let it. We
won't let

05:48.782 --> 05:50.584 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

05:50.617 --> 05:53.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: President Obama has
said he still
plans to nominate a replacement
for the late

05:53.520 --> 05:56.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Justice Antonin Scalia, and he's
urged the
Senate to act.

05:56.990 --> 06:03.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scalia died this month in Texas,
and the Associated
Press reported today he had
coronary artery

06:03.230 --> 06:07.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disease, diabetes and other
ailments. Texas
officials relied on those
findings, by the

06:07.901 --> 06:12.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Supreme Court's physician, in
deciding against
an autopsy.

06:12.272 --> 06:17.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There may be new evidence that
the Zika virus
can be transmitted through
sexual contact.

06:17.577 --> 06:22.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention
said today it's investigating 14
possible

06:22.215 --> 06:27.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cases in the U.S. All involve
women whose
male partners recently returned
from places

06:28.021 --> 06:32.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
affected by Zika. The virus has
been linked
to birth defects, and is
typically spread

06:32.659 --> 06:34.561 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by mosquitoes.

06:34.594 --> 06:39.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Syrian government and its
main opposition
group signed on today to a
proposed cease-fire,

06:39.466 --> 06:44.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but with conditions. Damascus
said it will
continue attacking terror
groups, and the

06:44.070 --> 06:47.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rebels insisted on an end to
sieges and bombardments.

06:47.107 --> 06:52.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, at a Senate hearing,
Secretary
of State John Kerry acknowledged
skepticism

06:52.679 --> 06:57.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that any truce will hold. But he
said this
is the only viable diplomatic
option.

06:57.217 --> 07:01.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: It may
be too late to keep it as a
whole Syria if

07:01.788 --> 07:06.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we wait much longer. So that's
what at issue
here, and I'm not going to vouch
for this.

07:06.192 --> 07:11.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not going to say this
process is sure
to work, because I don't know.
But I know

07:11.464 --> 07:16.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that this is the best way to try
to end the
war, and it's the only
alternative before

07:16.603 --> 07:19.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
us if indeed we're going to have
a political
settlement.

07:19.205 --> 07:24.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The United States
and Russia proposed
the cease-fire. Kerry said the
U.S. is considering

07:24.244 --> 07:27.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
plan B options if it fails.

07:27.447 --> 07:31.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The flood of migrants and
refugees pouring
out of Syria and other countries
and into

07:31.418 --> 07:36.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Europe has reached dramatic new
levels. The
International Organization for
Migration said

07:36.923 --> 07:43.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today more than 110,000 people
have landed
in Greece and Italy just since
January 1.

07:43.496 --> 07:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It took six months to reach that
total last
year.

07:46.566 --> 07:51.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Top U.S. military and diplomatic
officials
fired new criticism today at
China's actions

07:51.871 --> 07:57.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the South China Sea. The
commander of U.S.
forces in the Pacific told
senators that Beijing

07:57.310 --> 08:02.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is seeking hegemony over Eastern
Asia. And
he said newly installed missile
batteries

08:03.016 --> 08:06.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and radar systems on disputed
islands pose
a serious threat.

08:06.920 --> 08:11.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADM. HARRY HARRIS, Commander,
U.S. Pacific
Command: In my opinion, China is
clearly militarizing

08:11.224 --> 08:16.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the South China Sea, and you
would have to
believe in a flat Earth to think
otherwise.

08:16.229 --> 08:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are actions that are
changing, in my
opinion, the operational
landscape in the

08:20.233 --> 08:22.001 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
South China Sea.

08:22.035 --> 08:26.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Secretary of State
Kerry also
complained of militarization by
China. Later,

08:26.906 --> 08:29.909 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he met with the visiting Chinese
foreign minister.

08:29.943 --> 08:34.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The price of oil headed south
again today,
after gains in recent days, and
Wall Street

08:34.314 --> 08:39.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
went down with it. The Dow Jones
industrial
average lost nearly 190 points
to close at

08:39.619 --> 08:47.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
16431. The Nasdaq fell 67
points, and the
S&amp;P 500 gave up 24.

08:47.360 --> 08:52.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And chocolate maker Mars has
issued a candy
recall, after finding bits of
plastic in a

08:52.298 --> 08:57.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Snickers bar in Germany. The
recall includes
Snickers, as well as Milky Way
and Mars bars,

08:57.771 --> 09:03.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
among others. It covers 55
countries, including
Germany, but the company didn't
specify all

09:03.109 --> 09:05.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the other countries affected.

09:05.645 --> 09:10.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the future
of the Guantanamo Bay detention
center; Nevada

09:10.150 --> 09:16.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
votes in the last GOP contest
before Super
Tuesday; alarming new
predictions on rising

09:16.990 --> 09:29.002 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sea levels; and much more.

09:29.035 --> 09:34.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama's pledge to
close the Guantanamo
Bay detention center faced
immediate roadblocks

09:34.407 --> 09:36.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on Capitol Hill today.

09:36.242 --> 09:41.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For two views on that debate, we
turn first
to Republican Senator Cory
Gardner of Colorado,

09:41.047 --> 09:45.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of the states where the
administration
has considered building a
replacement prison.

09:45.518 --> 09:47.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He joins us from Capitol Hill.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Gardner, is this plan,
the president's
plan, a nonstarter for you?

09:50.623 --> 09:53.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. CORY GARDNER (R), Colorado:
Well, I think
it's not obstruction from the
Capitol Hill

09:53.460 --> 09:57.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the president is facing.
It's own law
that he signed that he's facing,
a law that

09:57.530 --> 10:01.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clearly states no dollars shall
be expended
on the transfer or to assist in
the transfer

10:01.568 --> 10:04.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Guantanamo Bay detainees from
Gitmo to
the United States.

10:05.004 --> 10:09.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, your objection
is not to the
closure of Guantanamo, per se,
but to the

10:09.409 --> 10:11.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shifting of the detainees to
somewhere else?

10:11.744 --> 10:13.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. CORY GARDNER: Well, I think
there's two
separate questions.

10:13.646 --> 10:17.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Guantanamo Bay is a
tailor-made facility
for terrorists, and that's where
they should

10:17.050 --> 10:22.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stay. I also recognize that the
law the president
signed just last month, late
last year, fully

10:22.689 --> 10:27.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states, clearly states that the
president
shall not spend money to assist
in the transfer

10:27.360 --> 10:31.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- transfer. So, their own law
-- the very
law that he signed prohibits his
actions of

10:31.197 --> 10:32.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
transfer.

10:32.999 --> 10:35.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, what changed in
this debate,
for people who have been
watching it, between

10:35.602 --> 10:39.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what President Bush believed
when he left
office and what President Obama
is trying

10:39.906 --> 10:41.741 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do now?

10:41.774 --> 10:43.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. CORY GARDNER: Well, I can't
speak for
anybody else, but I was in the
state legislature

10:43.910 --> 10:48.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Colorado, and I was concerned
about terrorists
being transferred then from
Guantanamo Bay

10:48.848 --> 10:50.650 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Colorado.

10:50.683 --> 10:54.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I made it very clearly, as a
state legislator
during the presidency of George
W. Bush, that

10:54.521 --> 10:58.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there could be this transfer.
And so I have
long held the view that we
should keep the

10:58.758 --> 11:02.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Guantanamo Bay terrorists in
Guantanamo Bay,
and not in our backyards in
Colorado.

11:02.428 --> 11:05.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, let's talk a
little bit
about the price tag, because
taxpayers want

11:05.398 --> 11:10.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to know about that. It costs
about $445 million
to keep Guantanamo Bay open, to
maintain it.

11:10.637 --> 11:14.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would cost $475 million,
according to the
price tag the president put out
today, to

11:14.741 --> 11:19.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
build a new facility. Doesn't it
make more
sense just fiscally to try to
build something

11:19.679 --> 11:21.447 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
new?

11:21.481 --> 11:23.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. CORY GARDNER: I think
there's a lot of
ways that this president could
cut spending.

11:23.383 --> 11:26.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if the president wants to
cut spending,
then we can start cutting
billions of dollars

11:26.419 --> 11:29.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
across federal agencies in
duplicative, wasteful
spending.

11:29.722 --> 11:33.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for this president to say
that he's going
the hide behind fiscal
responsibility, and

11:33.326 --> 11:37.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's what he wants to close
Obama -- close
Guantanamo Bay for, I think
that's just a

11:37.997 --> 11:41.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
misnomer. I think he's just
trying to throw
a red herring out there while
he's fulfilling

11:41.568 --> 11:43.503 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a red -- a campaign pledge.

11:43.536 --> 11:47.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: What he says is a
red herring
is what you suggested before,
which is that

11:47.307 --> 11:51.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's recidivism, that there
is worry about
security if you were to take the
remaining

11:51.678 --> 11:55.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prisoners and bring them to this
-- to our
soil.

11:55.281 --> 11:59.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you know -- what can you tell
me about
past evidence that this is true,
that this

11:59.385 --> 12:01.154 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
exists?

12:01.187 --> 12:03.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. CORY GARDNER: Well, I think
there are
evidence -- there is evidence of
people leaving

12:03.156 --> 12:08.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Guantanamo Bay, going back on to
the battlefield.
There is a recidivist count that
we have seen,

12:08.394 --> 12:10.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and it's well-documented.

12:10.296 --> 12:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have also heard from law
enforcement officials,
though. It's not just me. It's
not just the

12:13.700 --> 12:17.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coloradans I interact with each
and every
day. It's law enforcement. It's
their locally

12:17.437 --> 12:21.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
elected sheriffs. Over 40
sheriffs in Colorado
have written a letter to the
president of

12:21.975 --> 12:25.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United States saying, don't
bring these
Guantanamo Bay detainees to
Colorado.

12:25.244 --> 12:28.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Don't bring terrorists back to
the state.
I have heard from federal law
enforcement

12:28.781 --> 12:32.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in Colorado who are very
concerned about what
impact this would have on local
communities.

12:33.019 --> 12:36.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it's not just something
that a Republican
or Democrat is saying. It's what
we're hearing

12:36.823 --> 12:40.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from law enforcement. It's what
we're hearing
from people at town meetings and
tele-town

12:40.226 --> 12:41.961 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
halls.

12:41.995 --> 12:44.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People are very concerned about
the impact
this would have on their
community and their

12:44.130 --> 12:45.898 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
safety.

12:45.932 --> 12:49.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Some of the
president's defenders
say that he should use executive
action to

12:49.402 --> 12:53.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
force this to happen, that, in
fact, it's
unconstitutional for Congress to
stop the

12:53.473 --> 12:58.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president from deciding where
our military
assets should be deployed. What
do you say

12:58.411 --> 13:00.113 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to that?

13:00.146 --> 13:02.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. CORY GARDNER: Well, again,
I think Congress
has a right, as we did, passed a
law, the

13:02.949 --> 13:06.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president signed it, to state
that no money
shall be expended. We have the
power of the

13:06.219 --> 13:08.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
purse. This is something the
president cannot
overcome.

13:08.588 --> 13:12.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he tries to do it, this will
be -- this
will end up in court, spending
millions of

13:12.458 --> 13:16.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dollars that he's talking about
saving now
on a costly court battle, all
because he wants

13:16.496 --> 13:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to fulfill a campaign pledge.
Look, the president
didn't put forward a serious
plan today. He

13:20.366 --> 13:22.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
put forward eight pages worth of
a document.

13:22.869 --> 13:27.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The iPhone user agreement is
longer than eight
pages. The plan that he put
forward to close

13:27.140 --> 13:32.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Guantanamo Bay is less detailed
than an iPhone
user agreement. I think that
speaks to what

13:32.078 --> 13:35.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president is trying to do
with more of
a talking-point document than an
actual plan.

13:35.581 --> 13:38.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Senator Gardner,
while I have
you, let me ask you about
something else that

13:38.217 --> 13:41.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happened on Capitol Hill today
that goes to
this question of presidential
prerogative,

13:41.788 --> 13:43.556 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I guess.

13:43.589 --> 13:47.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's about the naming of a
Supreme Court
justice or a nominating --
nomination of a

13:47.293 --> 13:52.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Supreme Court justice to succeed
Antonin Scalia.
Your party leader, Mitch
McConnell, and the

13:52.398 --> 13:57.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
head of the Judiciary Committee
have both
said that they will not only not
have hearings,

13:57.036 --> 13:59.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but they won't even meet with
anybody the
president sends.

13:59.706 --> 14:04.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If the president were to
nominate a judge
from Colorado, would you give
them the courtesy

14:05.011 --> 14:06.746 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of a meeting?

14:06.779 --> 14:08.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. CORY GARDNER: Well, look, I
think the
next president ought to choose
the Supreme

14:08.281 --> 14:11.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Court nominee. And I think that
is only fair
to the nominee themselves.

14:11.551 --> 14:14.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that is only fair to
the integrity
of the Supreme Court. Now, this
is a very

14:14.921 --> 14:19.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
serious issue. And I think it's
what Joe Biden
stated in 1992, what Chuck
Schumer stated

14:19.826 --> 14:22.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in 2007. The next president
ought to be making
this decision.

14:22.995 --> 14:26.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But would you
personally refuse
to meet any nominee, even if
they were from

14:26.199 --> 14:28.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your state?

14:28.034 --> 14:29.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. CORY GARDNER: Well, again,
I think this
nominee should be chosen by the
American people.

14:29.836 --> 14:32.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I would like to make sure
that the
next president gets the
opportunity to make

14:32.705 --> 14:33.873 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that decision.

14:33.906 --> 14:35.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I guess we will
leave that there,
then.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Senator Cory Gardner of
Colorado, thank you
very much.

14:36.809 --> 14:38.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEN. CORY GARDNER: Thanks for
having me, Gwen.

14:38.644 --> 14:41.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And now we turn to a
member of
the Democratic leadership,
Senator Dick Durbin

14:41.814 --> 14:43.616 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Illinois.

14:43.649 --> 14:47.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Durbin, I know you heard
what Senator
Gardner just had to say. Is what
the president

14:47.487 --> 14:49.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
proposed today, does it have a
prayer?

14:49.388 --> 14:53.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. RICHARD DURBIN (D),
Illinois: Well, it
appears that the Republican
reaction to Guantanamo

14:54.026 --> 14:57.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is virtually the same reaction
to the Supreme
Court nomination. They have just
said they

14:57.997 --> 14:59.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wouldn't consider it.

14:59.899 --> 15:05.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Think about this. We have had
about 800 detainees
at Guantanamo since 9/11. Five
hundred of

15:05.171 --> 15:11.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
them were released and
transferred by President
Bush, 500 of the 800. President
Obama has

15:11.544 --> 15:13.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
released or transferred 147.

15:13.446 --> 15:20.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are 91 left. We are
spending $5 million
a year to keep these 91
prisoners at Guantanamo.

15:20.987 --> 15:26.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For what reason? We have over
500 convicted
terrorists in federal prisons
across America.

15:26.192 --> 15:28.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, let me ask you
the same
question I just tried with
Senator Gardner,

15:28.995 --> 15:35.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is, what is different now
than happened
when Senator -- when President
Bush, George

15:35.168 --> 15:37.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
W. Bush, said he wanted to close
Guantanamo?

15:37.203 --> 15:39.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is the different -- what
makes the difference?

15:39.972 --> 15:44.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. RICHARD DURBIN: Well,
Senator McCain
challenged the administration,
the White House,

15:44.043 --> 15:46.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
come up with a plan on what you
do with these
detainees.

15:46.779 --> 15:51.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president is trying to meet
that with
this proposal today. Now, the
details have

15:51.484 --> 15:56.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been left out in terms of where
it might be,
for obvious reasons. But I
think, ultimately,

15:56.422 --> 15:59.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that this is an nonstarter for
the Republicans
in Congress.

15:59.425 --> 16:02.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just like the Supreme Court
nominee, they
don't want any part of it. They
don't want

16:02.528 --> 16:03.896 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to discuss it.

16:03.930 --> 16:05.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But isn't the where
it might be
kind of a key detail?

16:05.998 --> 16:07.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. RICHARD DURBIN: It's an
important part
of it.

16:07.900 --> 16:11.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But keep in mind, if these
prisoners, detainees,
are brought back to the United
States and

16:11.571 --> 16:16.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tried in our courts, they would
join, as I
said earlier, 500 convicted
terrorists currently

16:16.742 --> 16:22.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
serving time in federal prisons.
There's been
no incidents of an escape from
the supermax

16:22.114 --> 16:26.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prisons, for example, across the
United States.
So, it isn't a question of
safety.

16:26.352 --> 16:30.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have to ask my fiscally
conservative Republican
friends, do you really think
it's right to

16:30.790 --> 16:35.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spend $5 million a year on each
detainee,
so that you can beat your chests
and have

16:35.394 --> 16:37.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bragging rights about how tough
we are?

16:37.263 --> 16:42.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, is this a moral
fight we're
witnessing, or a practical
fight, or neither?

16:42.268 --> 16:45.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. RICHARD DURBIN: Well, I
think what the
president has said -- and I
agree with -- Guantanamo

16:45.805 --> 16:49.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has become a very negative
symbol of the United
States.

16:49.175 --> 16:54.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You see over and over again in
propaganda
films being used by terrorists
those depictions

16:54.180 --> 16:58.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the early detainees in their
orange jumpsuits.
That is the sort of thing that
inflames many

16:58.517 --> 17:04.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people. The president is trying
to put an
end to that problem and that
issue. And he's

17:04.090 --> 17:07.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to do it with the help of
Congress,
but, unfortunately, the
Republicans don't

17:07.326 --> 17:09.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
want any part of it.

17:09.195 --> 17:12.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, what seems to
inflame people
-- politicians domestically is
the idea that

17:12.798 --> 17:20.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president is leaving open
the possibility
of using executive action to
force this action.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you argue that that is
even necessary
or constitutional?

17:23.476 --> 17:25.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEN. RICHARD DURBIN: I wouldn't
assume that.

17:25.344 --> 17:30.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, I think that's taking
it to an extreme
by some. The president came
through and said

17:30.082 --> 17:34.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Congress, join me in doing
this together.
We have seen the reaction from
everybody involved.

17:34.954 --> 17:38.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They don't want to join the
president either
to fill the Supreme Court
nomination or to

17:38.591 --> 17:40.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
deal with Guantanamo.

17:40.359 --> 17:44.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: If these -- these
folks are to
be released from an island
prison, why not

17:44.897 --> 17:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- why continue to detain them
at all, if
they're worthy of release?

17:48.134 --> 17:50.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. RICHARD DURBIN: Because
some of them
are dangerous. And some of them
should not

17:50.937 --> 17:52.805 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be released.

17:52.838 --> 17:57.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
About 35 of 91 remaining, the
president believes
can be safely transferred to
another country,

17:57.677 --> 18:02.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just as President Bush did, just
as President
Obama did. But some of them are
too dangerous.

18:02.148 --> 18:06.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They need to be tried. They need
to be incarcerated.
We need to keep our country
safe.

18:06.485 --> 18:10.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president is not saying turn
them all
loose at all. He's very careful
in choosing

18:10.389 --> 18:12.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those that could be a danger to
the United
States.

18:12.325 --> 18:16.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Is the president
suggesting actually
closing Guantanamo, or merely --
or just moving

18:16.729 --> 18:18.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the problem elsewhere?

18:18.497 --> 18:23.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If the concern about
international concerns
about our treatment of these
prisoners is

18:23.035 --> 18:28.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the real one, why wouldn't those
concerns
continue to exist if this
supermax prison

18:28.941 --> 18:32.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was built in your home state,
even though
that's been ruled out,
apparently?

18:32.311 --> 18:34.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEN. RICHARD DURBIN: Guantanamo
is a symbol.

18:34.747 --> 18:38.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And much as we may not like,
that it's being
used against us. And the
president has said

18:38.317 --> 18:42.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that over and over again. What
he said is,
keep America safe. Detain these
prisoners

18:42.922 --> 18:49.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where they can be held safely,
but don't continue
to spend $5 million a year per
prisoner to

18:49.462 --> 18:51.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
maintain Guantanamo.

18:51.297 --> 18:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I do have to ask you
what I asked
-- ended with Senator Gardner,
which is this

18:54.533 --> 18:59.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decision by the Republican
leadership not
to hold hearings, not to even
hold meetings

18:59.672 --> 19:01.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with anyone the president
nominates.

19:01.707 --> 19:03.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This has never happened before.
What's your
reaction to it?

19:03.709 --> 19:07.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. RICHARD DURBIN: There is no
constitutional
precedent for what the
Republicans announced

19:07.246 --> 19:09.048 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

19:09.081 --> 19:12.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not only did they say, we won't
consider the
president's nominee, we won't
have hearing,

19:12.551 --> 19:16.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we won't have a vote. Senator
McConnell, the
Republican leader, said, "I
won't even meet

19:16.222 --> 19:17.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with this nominee."

19:18.024 --> 19:22.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's never happened before in
history. The
Constitution, which we have
sworn to uphold,

19:22.261 --> 19:28.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is very clear when it comes to
Article 2,
Section 2. The president shall
appoint a nominee

19:28.167 --> 19:32.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to fill a vacancy on the Supreme
Court. And
the Senate shall, by advice and
consent, vote

19:32.471 --> 19:34.306 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on that nominee.

19:34.340 --> 19:38.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are not vague words.
They're words that
impose a responsibility on the
Senate, which

19:38.944 --> 19:40.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Republican leader is
ignoring.

19:40.446 --> 19:43.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And we will be
following that
story very closely, of course.

19:43.749 --> 19:47.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois,
thank you
very much.

19:47.319 --> 19:58.964 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEN. RICHARD DURBIN: Thank you
too.

19:58.998 --> 20:03.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now to the campaign trail, where
the men and
woman who would be president are
in the midst

20:03.469 --> 20:05.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of a critical week.

20:05.204 --> 20:08.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as political director Lisa
Desjardins
reports, they have already
embarked on the

20:08.808 --> 20:12.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all-important hunt for
convention delegates.

20:12.511 --> 20:19.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: If anything,
the war of words
between Ted Cruz and Donald
Trump has heated

20:19.118 --> 20:25.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up ahead of tonight's GOP
caucuses in Nevada.
The charge from Cruz today, in
Fernley, Nevada:

20:25.091 --> 20:26.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that Trump can't be trusted.

20:26.959 --> 20:31.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
Look, I frankly don't care what
position Donald

20:31.464 --> 20:35.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decides to support today or
tomorrow or the
next day. They change every day.
I don't care

20:35.501 --> 20:41.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what they are. But pick one and
defend it
and don't pretend, whenever
people suddenly

20:41.340 --> 20:43.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
point out what you said, oh,
never mind.

20:43.476 --> 20:48.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But in Sparks,
Nevada today,
the front-runner kept up his
attacks, that

20:48.180 --> 20:49.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Cruz is the dishonest one.

20:49.949 --> 20:53.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
He's like a little baby, soft,
weak, little

20:53.319 --> 20:58.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
baby, by comparison. But, for
lying, he's
the best I have ever seen.

20:58.224 --> 21:03.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Beyond charge
and countercharge,
the fight increasingly has a new
focus, the

21:03.129 --> 21:08.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only race that matters, the
delegate count,
where Trump has a big lead.
After the three

21:08.167 --> 21:13.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contests so far, he's amassed 67
delegates,
according to the Associated
Press. That's

21:13.606 --> 21:20.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
far shy of the 1,237 needed to
win the nomination,
but it puts him well ahead of
his two closest

21:20.412 --> 21:23.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rivals, Cruz and Florida senator
Marco Rubio.

21:23.549 --> 21:29.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rubio, though, is now riding a
wave of Republican
endorsements. And in his final
pitch to Nevadans

21:29.755 --> 21:33.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today, he stressed his ability
to unify the
party and the country.

21:33.159 --> 21:35.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
If you make me president of the
United States,

21:35.928 --> 21:38.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not going to tell everyone
is going to
agree with me. That doesn't even
exist in

21:38.898 --> 21:39.698 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
my home.

21:39.732 --> 21:41.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

21:41.534 --> 21:44.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: I am telling
you that I
will never divide you against
each other to

21:44.603 --> 21:45.204 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
win an election.

21:45.237 --> 21:47.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

21:47.072 --> 21:51.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As for the
Democrats, the
name of their game is also the
delegate count.

21:51.510 --> 21:55.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After their first three races,
Hillary Clinton
and Bernie Sanders are just
about even in

21:55.881 --> 21:59.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
delegates earned from votes,
again according
to AP analysis.

21:59.552 --> 22:05.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But add the superdelegates.
Those are Democratic
Party leaders who get an
automatic convention

22:05.658 --> 22:10.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vote. They have gone heavily to
Clinton so
far, giving her a whopping
overall delegate

22:10.863 --> 22:12.698 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lead.

22:12.731 --> 22:17.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders is pressing ahead with
delegate-rich
Super Tuesday on the horizon,
his first stop

22:17.503 --> 22:20.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today, one of the states that
will vote on
March 1, Virginia.

22:20.206 --> 22:23.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
All over this country, including
Virginia,

22:23.042 --> 22:26.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we are closing, closing, closing
that gap.
And with your help, we are going
to win here

22:26.712 --> 22:27.479 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Virginia.

22:27.513 --> 22:29.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
This is Johnson Controls. When
the auto industry

22:33.352 --> 22:35.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was going under...

22:35.054 --> 22:38.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Clinton, too,
was looking
toward the Super Tuesday states,
making a

22:38.157 --> 22:44.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
splash on Minnesota's airwaves,
the target,
a Wisconsin company that she
says moved profits

22:44.230 --> 22:46.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out of the U.S. to dodge taxes.

22:46.131 --> 22:51.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: It's an
outrage. If
I'm president, when companies
walk out on

22:51.136 --> 22:53.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
America, they will pay a price.

22:53.272 --> 22:57.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Clinton and
Sanders make
back-to-back appearances tonight
at a CNN

22:57.076 --> 23:02.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
town hall, before facing off in

For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa

GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

23:15.561 --> 23:20.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
successes and
hurdles in improving special
education; how

23:20.866 --> 23:26.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states are working to fight
opioid abuse;
and pushing boundaries through
modern dance.

23:26.939 --> 23:33.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, a trio of new
studies provide
new alarm about rising sea
levels, and the

23:33.145 --> 23:36.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prospect of further flooding

23:42.454 --> 23:43.656 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

23:43.689 --> 23:46.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan is here with
more on the
story.

23:46.158 --> 23:51.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Scientists say
this is more
definitive proof that human
actions are contributing

23:51.897 --> 23:56.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to sea level rise. Already,
coastal cities
like Charleston, South Carolina,
and Miami,

23:56.368 --> 24:00.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Florida, for example, are facing
more flood
days than in decades past.

24:00.673 --> 24:05.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The global climate conversation
is working
toward keeping temperature rise
limited to

24:05.411 --> 24:11.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two degrees Celsius, and even
under that scenario,
as this animation shows, cities
like Washington,

24:11.350 --> 24:15.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
D.C., and its well-known
landmarks could look
very different one day, albeit
several hundred

24:15.854 --> 24:17.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
years in the future.

24:17.623 --> 24:22.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One study estimated that sea
rise level could
be as much as four feet higher
by the end

24:22.061 --> 24:25.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of this century under more dire
scenarios.

24:25.064 --> 24:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Benjamin Strauss is with Climate
Central,
a research organization that
worked on some

24:28.067 --> 24:29.835 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of this.

24:29.868 --> 24:32.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Benjamin, when you see your
graphs at
the very end of it, there's this
almost hockey

24:32.538 --> 24:36.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stick effect. What is it that
caused that
acceleration of sea level rise?

24:36.775 --> 24:42.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN STRAUSS, Climate
Central: The sea
level is extremely sensitive to
global temperature.

24:42.081 --> 24:47.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And by burning fossil fuels and
putting carbon
in the atmosphere, we have
heated up the planet

24:47.386 --> 24:49.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a great deal over the last
century.

24:49.188 --> 24:53.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, how do we
know in these
models -- how do you build these
models to

24:53.158 --> 24:58.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
figure out what sea level rise
was like going
back 2,000 years? There wasn't
somebody with

24:58.197 --> 25:01.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a stick saying, here it is at
2.5 feet, here
it is at three.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BENJAMIN STRAUSS: Yes, it's
true.

25:03.402 --> 25:10.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there was a lot of detective
work involved.
Scientific teams around the
world have been

25:10.442 --> 25:16.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
studying coastal marshes, taking
cores, looking
for clues about where things
grew, at what

25:16.715 --> 25:23.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
times. And this study is
special, in that
it went beyond each of the
individual studies

25:23.288 --> 25:30.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we have seen in the past,
and integrated
them all, to put together one
picture out

25:30.396 --> 25:31.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of all of that detective work.

25:31.630 --> 25:33.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, let's talk
a little
bit about impacts.

25:33.532 --> 25:39.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Take a city like Charleston, a
low-lying city
already that we know is facing
some of these

25:39.405 --> 25:43.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
floods. What's it likely to be
like going
forward, say, to the end of this
century?

25:43.542 --> 25:50.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN STRAUSS: Well, really,
the sharp
increase in floods caused by us
that we have

25:50.516 --> 25:56.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seen over the last several
decades is only
just the beginning.

25:56.355 --> 26:00.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're a few inches into a
problem that's going
to be measured in feet this
century. And I'm

26:01.026 --> 26:06.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
afraid to say we can expect
floods and flooding
to accelerate a great deal more,
even in the

26:06.598 --> 26:11.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
next two or three decades, than
in the -- than
what we have already seen in the
last two

26:11.770 --> 26:13.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or three decades.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: As we
mentioned, the climate
conferences that happen around
the world,

26:15.774 --> 26:20.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're really trying to figure
out this two-degree
Celsius target, but your
forecasts and your

26:20.712 --> 26:25.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
predictions and your models are
showing that
even at two degrees Celsius,
there's a tremendous

26:25.851 --> 26:31.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amount of increase in sea level
rise, and
a lot of coastal cities are
impacted by this.

26:31.323 --> 26:33.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BENJAMIN STRAUSS: Yes.

26:33.125 --> 26:40.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the long run, two degrees
Celsius warming
probably is not -- a lot of
today's coastal

26:40.666 --> 26:46.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
cities are probably not
compatible with that,
whether you're talking about
Miami or Shanghai

26:46.505 --> 26:48.640 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or London.

26:48.674 --> 26:55.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But two degrees is a great deal
better than
our current path. So there's
some solace in

26:55.514 --> 27:02.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that. And how quickly sea level
rises will
play a large role in how well we
can adapt.

27:02.321 --> 27:08.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would also say that if we can
end up being
more ambitious than two degrees
Celsius and

27:08.427 --> 27:16.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cut warming down to 1.5 degrees
in the long
run, the impact there would be
about half

27:16.335 --> 27:22.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of what we could expect from two
degrees Celsius.
So that last half degree makes a
big difference.

27:22.074 --> 27:25.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This
conversation about
two degrees or a half-a-degree
here or half-a-degree

27:25.410 --> 27:29.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there, often, it gets mired in
politics, it
gets mired in lifestyle changes,
and you start

27:29.948 --> 27:32.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thinking globally and different
countries.

27:32.417 --> 27:38.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, reading your data at
some point is
an incredibly sort of sad and
dire prediction.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is there any way through this?

27:40.425 --> 27:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN STRAUSS: Yes, well, it
is sad, and
it's a difficult line of work,
in a way.

27:47.666 --> 27:53.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I take some solace. First of
all, there's
a lot we can do to adapt and to
deal with

27:53.238 --> 27:59.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change over time. And I take
some solace in
knowing all people are mortal.
Right? But

27:59.044 --> 28:02.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we still live our lives. We
still have meaningful
lives.

28:02.714 --> 28:09.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are some places on our
coasts now which
we now know are especially
mortal because

28:09.354 --> 28:14.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of sea level rise. It won't stop
them from
making contributions for the
next decades

28:14.927 --> 28:22.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or the next century, but, over
time, we're
going to have to either build
tall walls and

28:22.200 --> 28:27.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
live beneath -- you know, in the
bottom very
deep bowls, which is a
frightening prospect,

28:27.706 --> 28:29.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or else we're going to have the
move.

28:29.474 --> 28:31.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Ben
Strauss of
Climate Central, thanks so much
for joining

28:31.643 --> 28:32.411 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

28:32.444 --> 28:37.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BENJAMIN STRAUSS: Yes, thank
you.

28:37.182 --> 28:49.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's been four
decades since a
groundbreaking law known as the
Individuals

28:49.094 --> 28:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Disabilities Education Act,
IDEA, took
effect. Today, it helps ensure
that more than

28:54.633 --> 28:59.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
six million students with
disabilities have
the right to a free and
appropriate public

28:59.838 --> 29:01.506 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
education.

29:01.540 --> 29:04.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in many places, it's been a
struggle
getting schools to comply with
the law, and

29:04.309 --> 29:08.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nearly 100 class-actions have
been filed.

29:08.180 --> 29:12.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent John
Tulenko, with our
partners at Education Week,
follows the impact

29:12.250 --> 29:18.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of one such case in California.
That's part
of our weekly Tuesday night look
at education,

29:18.190 --> 29:19.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Making the Grade.

29:19.958 --> 29:25.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Los Angeles,
California, is
the nation's second largest
school system.

29:25.497 --> 29:30.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And like other big cities across
the country,
it's been the site of a pitched
legal battle

29:30.268 --> 29:32.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over special education.

29:32.838 --> 29:38.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The story begins in the early
1990s with a
student named Chanda Smith, who
was dyslexic

29:38.777 --> 29:40.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and by high school could barely
read.

29:40.612 --> 29:45.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHANDA SMITH, California: It's
just like a
bunch of words just scribbling
on the paper,

29:45.417 --> 29:52.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just everything just scribbling
or just -- it
was very overwhelming. My mom
told the teachers

29:52.891 --> 29:59.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and everything. But after the
third grade,
I never got any help.

29:59.231 --> 30:04.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Now 39 and a
mother of four,
Chanda continues to struggle
with a learning

30:04.936 --> 30:06.772 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
disability.

30:06.805 --> 30:11.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHANDA SMITH: It's affected me a
lot. It's
hard for me to get a job. And
I'm always having

30:11.043 --> 30:16.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
big worries, because I have to
take care of
my family. And it's kind of sad
because, when

30:16.982 --> 30:21.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have to go up to my
10-year-old, "Can you
read this for mommy?" You know,
I have a grandson

30:21.653 --> 30:25.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now. I want to be able to read
him a story.
And that's something that I
can't do.

30:25.490 --> 30:30.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I feel like it's been taken away
from me.
For what reason? So, you know,
it's really

30:30.896 --> 30:32.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hard and emotional.

30:32.631 --> 30:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ROSTETTER, Independent
Monitor, Los
Angeles Unified School District:
Chanda was

30:34.466 --> 30:39.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lost. They hadn't identified
her. They didn't
know where her records were. And
so they weren't

30:39.404 --> 30:43.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
providing adequate -- adequate
service to
her. They were virtually
providing no services

30:43.475 --> 30:45.243 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to her.

30:45.277 --> 30:48.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Chanda's story was
a familiar
one to David Rostetter. He's a
court-appointed

30:48.880 --> 30:53.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
monitor charged with ensuring
schools in Los
Angeles and elsewhere comply
with special

30:53.852 --> 30:55.687 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
education laws.

30:55.721 --> 30:58.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ROSTETTER: I have had a
lot of superintendents
around the country, I will go to
them and

30:58.323 --> 31:03.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say, you know, this is really
bad over here.
I mean, this is a budding
lawsuit and it's

31:03.929 --> 31:09.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
patently illegal. And their
answer will actually
be, literally be: "I will deal
with it when

31:09.134 --> 31:11.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we get sued about it. Thanks for
your advice,
Dave."

31:11.536 --> 31:16.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: That was the case
for Chanda
Smith. Despite repeated requests
for help,

31:16.374 --> 31:22.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
L.A. Unified did nothing until
1993, when
Chanda's mother took action. A
single case

31:22.147 --> 31:27.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of neglect turned into a
class-action lawsuit
that exposed a woefully broken
system.

31:27.753 --> 31:33.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thousands of students were not
identified
or misidentified. Nearly one
third of all

31:33.091 --> 31:37.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
special education teachers were
unlicensed.
And procedures for tracking
student records

31:38.029 --> 31:44.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were nonexistent. The lawsuit
pushed Los Angeles
into a settlement agreement,
imposing federal

31:44.102 --> 31:47.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
court oversight until the
problems could be
fixed.

31:47.572 --> 31:49.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That was nearly 20 years ago.

31:49.474 --> 31:52.811 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Good morning to you.

31:52.844 --> 31:58.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Today, much has
changed for
the district's 80,000 students
with special

31:58.483 --> 32:04.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
needs. Evaluations for services,
for example,
take less than 90 days.

32:04.589 --> 32:10.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most special education teachers
are certified.
Academic performance for
students with disabilities

32:10.262 --> 32:16.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has improved, and the graduation
rate is up,
although it's still short of the
rate for

32:16.234 --> 32:19.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
students with disabilities
nationwide.

32:19.404 --> 32:23.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The biggest change, to Sharyn
Howell, who
directs special education
services here, has

32:23.942 --> 32:25.644 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been in people's attitudes.

32:25.677 --> 32:27.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHARYN HOWELL, Special Education
Director,
Los Angeles Unified School
District: I see

32:27.479 --> 32:31.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a much different conversation
than I used
to see about our students. And
it really is

32:31.550 --> 32:37.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about people wanting them to
perform academically
and having expectations for
them.

32:37.689 --> 32:42.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we have been working on for
a number
of years is to convince people
that students

32:42.227 --> 32:45.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with disabilities are all of our
responsibility.
They don't belong to the
Division of Special

32:45.730 --> 32:47.499 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Education.

32:47.532 --> 32:52.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Most simply need
extra help
and are already in regular
classrooms. Those

32:52.070 --> 32:55.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with greater needs are just
beginning to make
the transition.

32:55.640 --> 33:00.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the last three years, the
district's been
moving these students from 18
special education

33:00.946 --> 33:04.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
centers into neighborhood
schools like Grand
View Elementary.

33:04.049 --> 33:06.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALFREDO ORTIZ, Principal, Grand
View Boulevard
Elementary: What used to be two
separate communities,

33:06.852 --> 33:09.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
now we have become one
community, an integrated
community.

33:09.821 --> 33:14.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Principal Alfredo
Ortiz has
managed an influx of new
students from the

33:14.226 --> 33:15.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
school next door.

33:15.660 --> 33:18.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALFREDO ORTIZ: We have McBride,
which is a
special education center.

33:18.196 --> 33:22.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: McBride was one of
the schools
exclusively for students with
disabilities.

33:22.467 --> 33:24.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was separated by a chain-link
fence.

33:24.870 --> 33:28.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALFREDO ORTIZ: And, as you can
tell, the fence
has come down. So now we're one
campus.

33:28.940 --> 33:33.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Eighty-nine
students from McBride
and other schools moved into
Grand View, increasing

33:34.012 --> 33:38.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
its special education population
by 50 percent.

33:38.450 --> 33:42.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most of the new students spend
the majority
of their day in classes like
Maria Ventura's.

33:42.954 --> 33:49.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She teaches eight students on
the autism spectrum.
To help develop their social
skills, every

33:49.895 --> 33:53.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
morning, she invites
kindergartners to her
classroom for a shared lesson.

33:53.265 --> 33:58.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIA VENTURA, Special Education
Teacher:
This is circle time. As a
kindergarten teacher,

33:58.370 --> 34:03.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I used to do that. And so when
becoming special
ed, I collaborated with another
kinder teacher

34:03.241 --> 34:08.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and said, you know what, bring
me your kids,
so that my kids can use them as
a model.

34:08.046 --> 34:11.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now you can't even tell the
difference between
my kids and the gen-ed kids,
because they

34:11.783 --> 34:15.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have learned by watching their
peers, oh,
this is how I need to sit in a
class.

34:16.021 --> 34:20.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Looking around the
room, I noticed
that nearly half the students
with autism

34:20.225 --> 34:21.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
weren't participating.

34:21.693 --> 34:25.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're bringing them together,
but maybe they're
still staying apart.

34:25.497 --> 34:30.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIA VENTURA: Well, I can't
force it on them.
It's basically their demeanor
and how they

34:30.769 --> 34:35.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do it. For example, Sean and
Austin and Marigold,
they're much more open to
change. Depending

34:35.307 --> 34:39.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on David's temperament, if he's
not having
a good day, I don't want to
force it. We slowly

34:39.544 --> 34:44.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bring them in when they're
ready, because,
if we rush them, then it
actually goes against

34:44.582 --> 34:47.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what we're trying to do. We
wanted to make
a good experience for them.

34:47.719 --> 34:48.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN TULENKO: Right.

34:48.286 --> 34:48.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARIA VENTURA: Yes.

34:48.987 --> 34:50.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: So it takes time.

34:50.155 --> 34:52.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARIA VENTURA: Exactly. It does
take time.

34:52.724 --> 34:57.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: However, Grand
View's elective
classes are fully integrated,
including physical

34:57.762 --> 35:06.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
education, gardening and
cooking. All this
has been a huge transition for
teachers.

35:06.338 --> 35:11.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSALIND BERGSTROM, Kindergarten
Teacher:
To meet everyone's need, you
know, it is -- it's

35:11.109 --> 35:18.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of work. But we have a
physical therapist,
occupational therapist, speech
therapist.

35:18.283 --> 35:20.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I work with the resource
teacher to meet
their needs.

35:20.986 --> 35:25.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: But it seemed some
teachers
were having to spend most of
their time focusing

35:25.523 --> 35:27.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on the students with
disabilities.

35:27.359 --> 35:34.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ROSTETTER: Yes, there are
kids who demand
extraordinary instructional
time. And one

35:34.332 --> 35:39.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the problems that L.A. is
experiencing
is a lot of these regular
education teachers

35:39.604 --> 35:42.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and special education teachers
are just learning
how you do integration.

35:42.874 --> 35:48.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: It's still a work
in progress,
but principal Ortiz says he's
seeing the benefits.

35:48.580 --> 35:56.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALFREDO ORTIZ: It's amazing how
the kids,
their interactions have evolved.
If a child

35:56.221 --> 36:01.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
needs help, we have gen-ed kids
who say, hey
I will take you, I will go with
you. It's

36:01.426 --> 36:02.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
creating leadership.

36:02.994 --> 36:09.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Seeing all these
children playing
together was undeniably unique.

36:09.300 --> 36:12.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have never seen anything like
that.

36:12.871 --> 36:18.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ROSTETTER: That is a
fundamental statement.
You never saw anything like that
because you

36:18.743 --> 36:25.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't grow up and go to a
school where that
occurred. Socially, people with
disabilities,

36:25.550 --> 36:31.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
particularly people with
physical disabilities
have been erased from our
environment.

36:31.456 --> 36:35.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so now these kids are going
to grow up
with each other. And they're
going to make

36:35.060 --> 36:39.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
friends with each other. And,
hopefully, we
will end up with a group of kids
as they go

36:39.130 --> 36:43.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into middle school and high
school expect
to be with each other.

36:43.268 --> 36:50.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: But not everyone's
happy with
the changes.

36:50.842 --> 36:55.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brandon, can tell me whether you
understand
me?

36:55.980 --> 37:00.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brandon Buschini is one of the
few students
still attending dedicated
special education

37:00.485 --> 37:05.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
centers. His mother is fighting
any plans
to move him.

37:05.757 --> 37:10.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDA HILTON, Mother: The
district tells parents
that this is still a gift for
their child

37:10.562 --> 37:17.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and that they should be
included, and that
this is -- socializing them is
important.

37:17.836 --> 37:22.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they really hang their hat
on that, vs.
educating them and providing
what they really

37:22.240 --> 37:24.075 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
need.

37:24.109 --> 37:27.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: In our next
report, fears about
including students with the
greatest needs

37:27.679 --> 37:32.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the unfinished business of
fixing special
education in Los Angeles.

37:32.217 --> 37:43.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm John Tulenko of Education
Week, reporting
for the "PBS NewsHour."

37:43.795 --> 37:56.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now to the problem
of opioid abuse
and proposals by governors to
tackle it.

37:56.774 --> 37:58.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Judy Woodruff has the story.

37:58.643 --> 38:03.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The dimension of
the problem
is becoming ever larger. The
federal government

38:03.882 --> 38:09.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reported that opioids, which
includes prescription
painkillers and heroin, were
involved in more

38:09.454 --> 38:13.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than 28,000 deaths in the U.S.
in 2014.

38:13.825 --> 38:18.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This past week, leading voices
at the National
Governors Association called for
new limits

38:19.030 --> 38:24.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for some painkillers like
OxyContin and for
greater drug monitoring of those
prescription

38:24.769 --> 38:26.504 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
drugs.

38:26.538 --> 38:30.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The epidemic has hit a number of
states very
hard, including Massachusetts,
where more

38:30.241 --> 38:35.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than 1,200 people died of opiate
overdoses
in 2014.

38:35.647 --> 38:40.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Governor Charlie Baker has
proposed legislation
that would limit practitioners
from prescribing

38:40.585 --> 38:45.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than three days' worth of
opiates to
patients when they're using them
for the first

38:45.223 --> 38:49.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time. Governor Baker also is the
head of the
Health Committee for the
Governors Association,

38:49.928 --> 38:51.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and he joins me now.

38:51.963 --> 38:53.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And thank you for being here.

38:53.698 --> 38:56.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How did this get to be such a
high priority
for you, Governor Baker?

38:56.067 --> 38:59.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. CHARLIE BAKER (R),
Massachusetts: Well,
when I was campaigning for
governor in 2014,

38:59.237 --> 39:04.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I literally couldn't go anywhere
without somebody
having a story to tell me about
this.

39:04.309 --> 39:09.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all the stories were for the
most part
stories that ended tragically,
in the death

39:09.314 --> 39:11.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a family member or a close
friend or a
co-worker.

39:11.583 --> 39:16.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you hear this enough over
and over and
over again, and you start to
realize that

39:16.087 --> 39:21.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's just everywhere. And I --
when I took
office, I talked about this in
my inaugural

39:21.392 --> 39:26.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
address and said, you know, we
have more people
dying of opioid overdoses in
Massachusetts

39:26.931 --> 39:31.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than car accidents and gunshots
combined,
four people a day. There has to
be a better

39:31.803 --> 39:33.638 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
way here.

39:33.671 --> 39:35.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you're
proposing a number
of things to do about this in
your state and

39:35.907 --> 39:38.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
through the Governors
Association.

39:38.409 --> 39:43.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A big part of that is this --
what we just
mentioned, limiting to three
days the prescription.

39:43.448 --> 39:46.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How did you decide on three days
vs. two days
or four days or more?

39:46.818 --> 39:50.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. CHARLIE BAKER: Well, the --
first of
all, the overall proposal -- and
we have a

39:50.355 --> 39:52.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
good working relationship with
our legislature
on this.

39:52.890 --> 39:56.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think they have already
done two separate
bills on this, and I believe
they will do

39:56.661 --> 40:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a third. But it's a prevention
and education
piece, an intervention piece, a
treatment

40:02.233 --> 40:05.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
piece, and recovery piece. You
got to -- our
view is, you got to do all of
them.

40:05.770 --> 40:09.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But on the prevention and
education piece,
we picked three days for first
prescriptions,

40:09.907 --> 40:15.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of acute pain, you have a
wisdom tooth
out, you break a finger,
something like that.

40:15.713 --> 40:20.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our approach to this was to take
the CDC preliminary
recommendation, which was three
days.

40:20.418 --> 40:26.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, the Mass Medical Society,
after we proposed
three days, proposed seven.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is your
state society.

40:27.458 --> 40:29.327 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOV. CHARLIE BAKER: Correct.

40:29.360 --> 40:33.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that seven-day proposal
ended up in the
House version of the bill.
They're now conferencing

40:33.097 --> 40:36.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the two of them. But my guess
is, we will
end up with some sort of a limit
on first

40:36.434 --> 40:38.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prescriptions, which I think is
a good thing.

40:38.369 --> 40:42.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Then, I saw the
American Medical
Association, which is the
national organization,

40:42.440 --> 40:47.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is saying -- I read their
statement today.
They're saying it's arbitrary,
and surrounding

40:47.845 --> 40:52.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
circumstances are clinically
vague. They say,
how do you define major surgery?

40:52.216 --> 40:55.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In other words, they're raising
some questions
about the three days.

40:55.119 --> 40:59.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. CHARLIE BAKER: Well, I
think whether
it's the CDC three days or the
seven days,

40:59.190 --> 41:04.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mass Medical Society, my view on
this is,
we need to separate acute pain
from chronic

41:04.862 --> 41:06.564 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pain.

41:06.597 --> 41:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's no reason to give
somebody who has
their wisdom teeth out 30 pills.
There's no

41:08.966 --> 41:15.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reason to give somebody who has
a minor procedure
60 pills. The stories about this
that I heard

41:15.206 --> 41:20.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as I travel, still, as I travel
around the
commonwealth are overwhelming.
It's like an

41:20.812 --> 41:22.714 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
avalanche.

41:22.747 --> 41:27.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remember, 5 percent of the
world's population
in the U.S. We consume 80
percent of the world's

41:27.185 --> 41:30.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opioids. There's something that
is inherently
not right about that.

41:30.388 --> 41:35.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What are you
hearing back right
now from the pharmaceutical
industry and from

41:35.626 --> 41:37.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the medical community broadly?

41:37.395 --> 41:39.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. CHARLIE BAKER: Well, the
interesting
thing is, you know, most of the
practicing

41:39.530 --> 41:44.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
docs I talk to -- and I talk to
a lot of them
-- tell me that they believe
having some limit

41:44.936 --> 41:47.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on first prescriptions is a good
idea.

41:47.238 --> 41:52.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The dentists I know feel the
same way. And,
in fact, we got the medical
schools in Massachusetts

41:52.343 --> 41:57.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the dental schools to
incorporate for
the first time a core
requirement that, for

41:57.849 --> 42:02.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
graduation, you have to pass a
class in pain
management and addiction, which
has never

42:02.086 --> 42:03.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
been true before.

42:03.888 --> 42:08.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a lot of interest in
this issue and
a lot of belief that something
needs to be

42:08.593 --> 42:10.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
done on the part of the health
care community.

42:10.395 --> 42:14.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I saw that
President Obama,
that the White House said that
the president

42:14.599 --> 42:22.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had declined to endorse the
Governors Association
proposal. He said words to the
effect, limiting

42:22.340 --> 42:28.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prescriptions should be part of
a comprehensive
approach, that, sometimes --
painkillers are

42:28.713 --> 42:33.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sometimes, he said, the only
realistic treatment
option for people in rural
communities.

42:33.117 --> 42:35.019 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What about that?

42:35.052 --> 42:37.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. CHARLIE BAKER: Well, I
think his overarching
notion of it being part of a
comprehensive

42:37.255 --> 42:39.023 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
plan is correct.

42:39.056 --> 42:42.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ours is prevention, education,
intervention,
treatment, and recovery. I think
you got to

42:42.326 --> 42:46.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
play with all those. But he also
said at this
meeting -- and I thought this
was an interesting

42:47.031 --> 42:52.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
perspective as well. He said,
states are many
times the laboratories of
democracy. You folks

42:52.870 --> 42:56.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
should try a variety of
different solutions,
and if you come up with
something that ends

42:56.374 --> 43:01.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up becoming kind of the standard
around the
country and a whole bunch of
states, then

43:01.446 --> 43:04.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we, the federal government,
might choose to
just follow you, which I think
is fine.

43:04.949 --> 43:07.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mentioned
other legs to
the stool.

43:07.919 --> 43:13.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What about the provisions to
educate and train
doctors, physicians,
differently?

43:13.991 --> 43:16.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GOV. CHARLIE BAKER: I think
that's a big part
of it.

43:16.394 --> 43:20.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I hear from doctors all the time
who tell
me that they don't necessarily
feel they have

43:20.398 --> 43:24.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had the training that they
should have on
this. And most -- you know, the
three biggest

43:24.769 --> 43:30.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prescribing groups currently can
graduate
from medical school without ever
taking a

43:30.374 --> 43:32.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
course in pain management.

43:32.176 --> 43:36.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is no requirement that you
take a course
in pain management as an
in-service part of

43:36.280 --> 43:40.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your continuing education as a
physician.
We're trying to change that in
Massachusetts.

43:40.117 --> 43:45.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, this is a very
complicated issue.
I get that. But I think the more
we can do

43:45.223 --> 43:52.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to create an opportunity for
both existing
soon-to-be doctors and dentists
and nurses

43:52.663 --> 43:58.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and physician assistants and
current ones
to get smarter about this, we
should take.

43:58.035 --> 44:02.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about the
other part of
the argument, Governor Baker,
that so much

44:02.340 --> 44:08.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of narcotic abuse, opiate abuse
is on the
part of people who just are
stealing drugs,

44:08.112 --> 44:13.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who just are addicts, and they
didn't get
into it because of a bad
prescription, but

44:13.851 --> 44:18.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have fallen into it and
there need to
be other methods to get to them?

44:18.155 --> 44:21.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. CHARLIE BAKER: Well, I
certainly think
treatment and recovery are a big
part of this,

44:21.626 --> 44:26.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that we need to treat this
as a public
health issue, and in many cases
for the disease

44:26.797 --> 44:28.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that it is.

44:28.599 --> 44:31.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are a whole series of
elements in
what we're doing already in
Massachusetts

44:31.302 --> 44:35.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and what we're proposing to do
going forward
that factor into that as well.

44:35.606 --> 44:39.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're also working with a bunch
of the local
pharmacies to make sure that
they have drop

44:39.277 --> 44:45.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
boxes and where people can take
unused medicine
back and deposit it safely.

44:45.816 --> 44:51.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's no silver bullet to
this, but I also
believe that we will never
change this 25

44:51.689 --> 44:58.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
percent per year increase in
deaths, prescriptions
and overdoses unless we do some
things to

44:58.529 --> 45:06.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disrupt this trend line. And I
think you got
to bring every tool to the table
here, prevention,

45:06.771 --> 45:09.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
education, treatment, recovery,
and intervention.

45:09.874 --> 45:13.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you're not willing to
chase all that
stuff in a pretty serious way,
it's probably

45:13.511 --> 45:17.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not going to get any better. I
know I'm not
going to consider success to be
taking the

45:17.949 --> 45:23.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
increase in deaths from 25
percent to 20.
I want to take that number. I
want to flatten

45:23.187 --> 45:26.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the number out and start to
drive it in the
opposite direction.

45:26.157 --> 45:28.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Too many people are losing too
many people.

45:28.960 --> 45:32.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Massachusetts
Governor Charlie
Baker, we thank you.

45:32.163 --> 45:34.031 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOV. CHARLIE BAKER: Thank you.

45:34.065 --> 45:38.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And you can tune in
later tonight
for "Frontline"'s two-hour
documentary "Chasing

45:38.769 --> 45:43.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Heroin." It paints a larger
picture of opioid
abuse, from pharmaceutical
companies' push

45:43.207 --> 45:48.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to popularize painkillers, to
personal stories
of heroin addiction. Check your
local listings

45:49.013 --> 46:01.459 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for the time.

46:01.492 --> 46:06.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Finally tonight: A dance company
steeped in
tradition takes bold new steps,
and finds

46:06.397 --> 46:08.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
direction under a new leader.

46:08.933 --> 46:11.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our look.

46:11.535 --> 46:23.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Revelations," a
dance set
to gospel songs and spirituals,
over five

46:23.781 --> 46:28.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decades, it's become an American
classic,
and still the showpiece of the
renowned Alvin

46:28.953 --> 46:35.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ailey American Dance Theater.
It's opened
the eyes and minds of many,
including, in

46:35.826 --> 46:39.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the 1980s, a teenager living in
one of Miami's
poorest neighborhoods.

46:39.063 --> 46:46.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT BATTLE, Artistic
Director, Alvin Ailey
American Dance Theater: I saw
myself. I saw

46:46.904 --> 46:52.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
possibility. Although the
curtain went down,
I went up.

46:52.710 --> 46:59.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Years later,
Robert Battle
heads the company that helped
change his own

46:59.417 --> 47:00.651 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

47:00.685 --> 47:02.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How did you see your task when
you took over
the company?

47:02.653 --> 47:05.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROBERT BATTLE: Wow. That's just
to survive.

47:05.923 --> 47:07.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: First survive.

47:07.658 --> 47:09.460 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBERT BATTLE: First survive.

47:09.493 --> 47:12.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Battle is just
the third leader
of a company that was founded by
Alvin Ailey

47:13.030 --> 47:20.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 1958 as a troupe celebrating
African-American
culture, and then led to even
greater international

47:20.204 --> 47:25.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heights by Judith Jamison, a
renowned dancer
in the company who was tapped by
Ailey to

47:25.676 --> 47:27.044 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
take over.

47:27.078 --> 47:30.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Five years ago, Jamison picked
Battle to replace
her.

47:30.147 --> 47:33.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT BATTLE: I think she
thought that this
was right for the company, that
I would sort

47:33.718 --> 47:36.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of push the boundaries of what
people thought
was possible.

47:36.854 --> 47:42.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In his prominent
new role,
Battle has opened up about his
own boundary-pushing,

47:42.093 --> 47:46.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including in a new children's
book. He barely
knew his birth mother, was taken
in by an

47:46.931 --> 47:49.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
uncle and aunt and raised by a
cousin.

47:49.600 --> 47:55.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was severely bow-legged as a
child and
wore metal knee braces until he
was 6. Bullied

47:55.539 --> 48:01.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in his dangerous Liberty City
neighborhood,
he turned to martial arts for
confidence,

48:01.178 --> 48:05.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then, and forevermore, to
the arts, music
and then dance.

48:05.616 --> 48:11.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT BATTLE: Sometimes, I
think young people
see people in certain successful
positions,

48:11.722 --> 48:14.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they think, I don't have the
tools for
that.

48:15.025 --> 48:17.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what I'm saying is, you do
have the tools
for that.

48:17.862 --> 48:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What made you
think you did,
when you look back at that young
child you

48:22.266 --> 48:24.001 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
were?

48:24.034 --> 48:28.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT BATTLE: I don't know. I
always felt
that I was guided. I always felt
this sort

48:28.139 --> 48:32.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of maybe -- some people would
call it this
third eye. I always felt that
the sense that

48:32.510 --> 48:38.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was looking down over myself
within the
context of the rest of the
world.

48:38.816 --> 48:43.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I had this sense that I
was supposed
to do something. I remember that
early on,

48:43.354 --> 48:50.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from growing up in church,
watching the preacher
preach. And something about
that, and watching

48:50.094 --> 48:55.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the rest of the congregation
respond and be
uplifted, I wanted to do
something like that.

48:55.065 --> 48:58.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, I used to imitate the
preacher. I
would put on my bathrobe at
home.

48:58.936 --> 49:02.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My great uncle would always tape
the services,
and I would learn the sermon.

49:02.740 --> 49:03.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Really?

49:03.474 --> 49:05.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT BATTLE: Yes.

49:05.309 --> 49:08.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Leading the
congregation, but
also the performative side to
that as well

49:08.946 --> 49:09.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
clearly attracted you.

49:10.014 --> 49:11.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBERT BATTLE: Yes. Yes. Yes.

49:11.816 --> 49:16.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what's interesting, and the
flip side
is, I was painfully shy. I
didn't like school

49:16.987 --> 49:27.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because I didn't like being sort
of an extrovert.
But when I took on these sort of
roles, I

49:28.032 --> 49:29.867 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
could be bold.

49:29.900 --> 49:34.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I'm thinking of
the child wearing
the leg braces, right, to
straighten your

49:34.238 --> 49:35.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
legs, and then dance.

49:35.739 --> 49:39.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT BATTLE: Yes. Yes. And it
comes from
the restriction, and then...

49:39.777 --> 49:41.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Take the braces
off and start
going.

49:41.745 --> 49:46.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT BATTLE: Yes, yes. It's
not enough to
walk. You have to run, leap
even.

49:46.317 --> 49:50.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Often, when young people say to
me, you know,
I want to be a dancer, I want to
be like that,

49:50.754 --> 49:56.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I said, well, start where you
are, start exactly
where you are. If you want to be
a dancer,

49:56.660 --> 50:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
consider yourself a dancer, and
move from
that space. Your imagination
costs you nothing,

50:02.299 --> 50:08.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but can cost you everything if
you don't use
it.

50:08.138 --> 50:15.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Fast forward, the
problem is
how to leap into the future
while holding

50:15.079 --> 50:16.947 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
onto the past.

50:16.981 --> 50:22.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Battle is doing this by bringing
new dances
to the company from a varied
group of choreographers,

50:22.786 --> 50:28.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
including recently at
Washington's Kennedy
Center Ronald Brown's "Open
Door," a vibrant

50:28.325 --> 50:39.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Latin jazz romp, and a very
different dance
choreographed by Battle himself,
titled "No

50:39.637 --> 50:45.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Longer Silent," set to the music
of Erwin
Schulhoff, a German composer who
was silenced

50:45.676 --> 50:47.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and then killed by the Nazis.

50:47.344 --> 50:50.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT BATTLE: Sometimes, I feel
a little
bit of guilt when I go to take
my seat in

50:50.848 --> 50:55.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the back of the theater to watch
the audience
consume this work.

50:55.352 --> 50:56.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Guilt?

50:56.854 --> 50:58.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT BATTLE: yes, because I
don't want to
bring them down, you know?

50:58.956 --> 51:02.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Are you also a
little afraid
of how they're going to accept
it?

51:02.059 --> 51:07.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT BATTLE: Yes. Yes. And I'm
very sensitive
to that. I see everything when
I'm sitting

51:07.197 --> 51:11.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the back of the house. I can
see if somebody's,
like, looking down at their
phone, or somebody's

51:11.769 --> 51:16.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tilting their head not in a way
of interest,
but in a way of saying, what's
going on up

51:16.540 --> 51:17.808 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there?

51:17.841 --> 51:18.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You really sit
back there and
watch for this?

51:18.943 --> 51:21.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT BATTLE: I try not to, but
I can't help
it.

51:21.045 --> 51:24.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. But this
goes back to
what we were talking about
earlier, where

51:24.114 --> 51:25.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you have got an audience, you
have got a tradition.

51:25.582 --> 51:28.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you're also -- you feel it's
important
to give them something else.

51:28.686 --> 51:33.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT BATTLE: Yes, definitely.
Definitely.
And I have to make my own
statement about

51:33.290 --> 51:39.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how I see the world. I have to.
In some ways,
I would rather be silent.

51:39.697 --> 51:44.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I was a kid, I had a high
speaking voice.
And so every time I said
anything, people

51:44.868 --> 51:51.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would laugh, you know, the other
students.
He talks like a girl, you know?
So, I didn't

51:51.408 --> 51:53.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
want to talk in front of people.

51:53.210 --> 51:59.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm still that person. But what
I know is,
it is necessary, that I'm here
for a reason,

51:59.917 --> 52:03.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to tell stories that celebrate
our common
humanity.

52:03.721 --> 52:08.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Robert Battle
says his newest
dance, the first he's
choreographed since

52:08.759 --> 52:14.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
taking over the company,
reflects part of
his own story. He calls it
"Awakening."

52:14.331 --> 52:19.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Alvin Ailey American Dance
Theater is
now in the midst of a 20-city
North American

52:19.570 --> 52:21.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tour running through May.

52:21.905 --> 52:25.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm

from Robert
Battle about the connection
between dance,

issues on

On the "NewsHour" online: Our
jobs guru follows
up on a column he wrote about
employers rescinding

52:53.504 --> 52:59.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
job offers. It led one reader to
ask, is it
ever advisable to quit without
giving notice?

52:59.943 --> 53:04.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
