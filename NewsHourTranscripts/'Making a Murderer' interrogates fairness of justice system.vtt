GWEN IFILL: Netflix has
announced its video
streaming service will soon be
available globally,

00:07.908 --> 00:12.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leading to a wider audience for
its movies
and original programming.

00:12.112 --> 00:17.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is no bigger hit on
Netflix right now
than "Making a Murderer," the
story of a brutal

00:17.751 --> 00:23.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
case in Wisconsin that raises
troubling questions
about our criminal justice
system.

00:23.056 --> 00:25.225 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the story.

00:25.259 --> 00:29.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a warning: If you have not
seen the series,
like me, there are some spoilers
ahead.

00:30.030 --> 00:35.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: "Making a
Murderer" is the
new blockbuster true crime
series on Netflix.

00:35.269 --> 00:41.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 10 hour-long episodes,
filmmakers Laura
Ricciardi and Moira Demos tell
the story of

00:41.108 --> 00:46.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Steven Avery, a Wisconsin man
who spent 18
years locked up for a sexual
assault he didn't

00:46.713 --> 00:48.482 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
commit.

00:48.515 --> 00:52.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, after his release, Avery
was arrested
for a new crime, the gruesome
murder of a

00:52.853 --> 00:54.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
young photographer named Teresa
Halbach.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEVEN AVERY, Suspect: I didn't
do it.

00:56.356 --> 00:57.224 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Who did it?

00:57.257 --> 00:59.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEVEN AVERY: I don't know.

00:59.226 --> 01:03.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The series
documents, in
incredible detail, the
investigation and prosecution

01:03.463 --> 01:08.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Avery, and his young nephew,
Brendan Dassey.
Both men were found guilty, are
now serving

01:08.835 --> 01:11.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
life sentences for Halbach's
death.

01:11.672 --> 01:16.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The series raises some troubling
questions
about how investigators and
prosecutors pursued

01:16.310 --> 01:21.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the case. For example, was
then-16-year-old
Brendan Dassey coerced into
making a false

01:21.248 --> 01:21.915 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
confession?

01:21.949 --> 01:23.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Who shot her in the head?

01:24.017 --> 01:25.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRENDAN DASSEY, Suspect: He did.

01:25.886 --> 01:31.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Was crucial
evidence linking
Avery to the crime in fact
planted by police?

01:31.458 --> 01:36.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And were police trying to frame
him because
Avery was suing them for $36
million over

01:36.897 --> 01:41.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his earlier wrongful conviction
in the sexual
assault case?

01:42.002 --> 01:47.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Making a Murderer" was released
in its entirety
just before Christmas, and it's
quickly become

01:47.975 --> 01:53.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a runaway success for Netflix.
Tens of thousands
of viewers are so convinced of
Steven Avery's

01:53.747 --> 01:58.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Brendan Dassey's innocence
that they have
signed online petitions to
President Obama

01:58.418 --> 02:02.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and to the governor of
Wisconsin, demanding
the men be pardoned immediately.

02:02.356 --> 02:07.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, I spoke with the
filmmakers, Ricciardi
and Demos, who spent 10 years
documenting

02:07.361 --> 02:08.628 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this story.

02:08.662 --> 02:11.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what was it that first
attracted you two
to this story?

02:11.298 --> 02:15.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOIRA DEMOS, Filmmaker, "Making
a Murderer":
Here was a man who had been
clearly failed

02:15.302 --> 02:21.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by our justice system in the
mid-'80s, and
here he was now thrown back into
the system,

02:21.308 --> 02:25.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and we were in a position where
we could follow
that case as it unfolded.

02:25.612 --> 02:31.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not really about the
question of, did
Steven do this or he did not do
this, but

02:31.318 --> 02:37.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really, can we trust, we can
rely on these
verdicts? And what we felt like
that offered

02:37.758 --> 02:42.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and what Steven's experiences
offered us was
this amazing window into the
system.

02:42.829 --> 02:47.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The prosecutor
in this murder
case, Ken Kratz, has been on a
full-bore media

02:47.300 --> 02:52.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
blitz recently, denouncing the
series, saying
it's extremely misleading, and
rejecting the

02:52.472 --> 02:54.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
allegation that Steven Avery was
framed.

02:54.474 --> 02:59.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEN KRATZ, Prosecutor: This
wasn't a documentary
at all. This was a defense
piece. It was generated

02:59.513 --> 03:04.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by and for Steven Avery by his
defense team.

03:04.184 --> 03:10.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If some of the evidence that was
selected,
I would call it handpicked or
cherry-picked,

03:10.223 --> 03:15.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over an 18-month period, didn't
fit with the
narrative, didn't fit with the
conclusion

03:15.562 --> 03:22.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Mr. Avery was the product
of a conspiracy
or some planted evidence, it's
my belief that

03:22.202 --> 03:26.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the filmmakers just wouldn't
include that
information.

03:26.173 --> 03:30.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Kratz argues
that several
crucial pieces of evidence were
either glossed

03:30.977 --> 03:35.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over by the Netflix series or
left out altogether,
for example, the fact that
Steven Avery called

03:35.916 --> 03:40.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the murder victim several times
on the day
that she disappeared, or the
fact that Steven

03:40.253 --> 03:45.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Avery's own DNA showed up on the
victim's
car keys, on the hood of her
car, and inside

03:45.692 --> 03:47.461 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
her car.

03:47.494 --> 03:51.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the prosecutor says that
you guys,
the filmmakers, didn't include
certain pieces

03:51.565 --> 03:56.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of evidence because -- quote --
"You didn't
want to muddy up a perfectly
good conspiracy

03:56.203 --> 03:58.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
movie with what actually
happened."

03:58.238 --> 04:03.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOIRA DEMOS: I guess I would say
he didn't
want to muddy up a perfectly
good prosecution

04:03.176 --> 04:04.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with what actually happened.

04:04.945 --> 04:12.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, we included the evidence
that Kratz
himself spoke about in press
conferences as

04:12.352 --> 04:17.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being the most damning pieces of
evidence
of Avery's guilt, the most
significant physical

04:17.524 --> 04:24.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
pieces evidence. We were
following his lead
of what to include. And, of
course, we couldn't

04:24.764 --> 04:27.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
include everything from a
six-week trial.

04:27.467 --> 04:32.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now the things he is saying
are the proof
of Steven's guilt were not the
things he was

04:32.539 --> 04:34.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hanging his case on.

04:34.441 --> 04:37.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURA RICCIARDI, Filmmaker,
"Making a Murderer":
Well, I have said before that we
had no horse

04:37.110 --> 04:44.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this race. We -- whether
Steven Avery committed
the horrible crime with which he
was charged

04:44.284 --> 04:48.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or not was of no consequence to
us as documentarians.

04:48.788 --> 04:53.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: "Making a
Murderer" is just
the latest in a recent line of
extremely popular

04:53.793 --> 04:56.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reexaminations of old criminal
cases.

04:56.863 --> 05:01.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, there was "Serial,"
the blockbuster
podcast that, in its first
season, scrutinized

05:01.801 --> 05:07.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the late '90s conviction of a
Maryland teenager
for the murder of his
ex-girlfriend, and HBO's

05:07.807 --> 05:12.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
popular miniseries "The Jinx,"
which looked
into the crimes of accused
murderer Robert

05:12.445 --> 05:14.247 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Durst.

05:14.281 --> 05:19.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Your series obviously comes in a
long line
of these true crime cases of
late. And I wonder

05:19.686 --> 05:24.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why they are so, so popular with
their audiences.
Why do you think these stories
speak to us

05:24.791 --> 05:26.693 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
so strongly?

05:26.726 --> 05:32.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOIRA DEMOS: I guess, not
always, but quite
often, true crime revolves a
marginal character,

05:32.933 --> 05:39.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an underdog, so to speak. And I
think most
people feel like underdogs in
their own lives.

05:39.673 --> 05:43.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they can attach to that
feeling.

05:43.443 --> 05:49.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, of course, this is
true crime. This
is real life. And there is
something very

05:49.883 --> 05:54.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immediate about that. The fact
that people
can do something with the
feelings they have

05:54.554 --> 05:59.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after they watch, I think, just
adds a layer
of intensity to it.

05:59.626 --> 06:03.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As for those
pardons, President
Obama can't do anything about
this, because

06:03.863 --> 06:06.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
these weren't federal
convictions.

06:06.366 --> 06:10.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wisconsin's governor, Scott
Walker, could
do something, but he recently
threw cold water

06:10.203 --> 06:11.972 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the idea.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. SCOTT WALKER (R),
Wisconsin: Just because
a documentary on TV says
something doesn't

06:14.207 --> 06:16.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mean that is actually what the
evidence shows.

06:16.443 --> 06:21.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For now,
Steven Avery remains
in jail for life. Brendan Dassey
won't be

06:21.514 --> 06:23.750 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
eligible for parole until 2048.

06:23.783 --> 06:26.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham.
