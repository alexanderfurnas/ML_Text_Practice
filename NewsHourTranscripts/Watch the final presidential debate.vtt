00:01.902 --> 00:01.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: I know more about
ISIS than the generals,

00:01.535 --> 00:04.204 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
believe me.

00:04.204 --> 00:03.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: I have
sat at that table in the
Situation

00:03.437 --> 00:05.339 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Room.

00:05.339 --> 00:05.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Nobody knows
the system better than me.

00:05.672 --> 00:08.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I alone can fix it.

00:08.175 --> 00:11.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I'm
going to close my campaign
focused on opportunities for
kids

00:11.111 --> 00:12.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and fairness for families.

00:12.679 --> 00:15.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: Hillary
failed on the economy.

00:15.048 --> 00:18.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Everything she touched
didn't work out.

00:18.151 --> 00:21.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Even if
you're totally opposed to Donald
Trump, you may still have

00:21.355 --> 00:26.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some questions about me.

00:26.994 --> 00:36.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:36.236 --> 00:37.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:37.804 --> 00:41.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Gwen Ifill is away tonight.

00:41.475 --> 00:46.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Welcome to this "PBS NewsHour"
special coverage of the final
presidential debate between
Democrat

00:46.246 --> 00:49.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hillary Clinton and
Republican Donald Trump.

00:49.549 --> 00:55.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The stage is set at the
University of Nevada, Las Vegas,
at a time when the most recent

00:55.489 --> 01:01.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
polls, both national and in
battleground states, show a
surge in support for Clinton,
while

01:01.595 --> 01:07.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump's numbers have been
slipping, especially since the
release of the 2005 video where

01:07.134 --> 01:12.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's heard using lewd language,
boasting about being sexually
aggressive.

01:12.406 --> 01:17.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The debate moderator, Chris
Wallace of FOX News, announced
ahead of time that there will

01:17.511 --> 01:23.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be six topics tonight, not
necessarily in this order, debt
and entitlement, immigration,

01:23.583 --> 01:30.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the economy, the Supreme Court,
foreign hot spots, and fitness
to be president.

01:30.190 --> 01:35.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To watch it all, joining me here
at this table in Washington, our
regular "NewsHour" contributors,

01:35.562 --> 01:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
syndicated columnist Mark
Shields, New York Times
columnist David Brooks, and Amy
Walter

01:39.633 --> 01:41.935 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of The Cook Political Report.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, we're at the third one.

01:43.704 --> 01:46.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it will all be
over after this one.

01:46.239 --> 01:48.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
David, do you expect
them to go high or low?

01:48.875 --> 01:49.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: You promise
it will be over?

01:49.876 --> 01:51.778 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:51.778 --> 01:55.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: No, I expect her
to go high, him to go low.

01:55.582 --> 01:58.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's behind, and so he's got
to try some desperate move.

01:58.719 --> 02:03.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the trick for her will be to
see if she can be strong enough
to rebut whatever he

02:03.123 --> 02:05.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says, while still projecting
some sense of positivity that
will attract some people to

02:05.258 --> 02:07.728 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
her.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My big question, though, for the
country is, do we want to take a
shower after this is

02:09.029 --> 02:10.864 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
over?

02:10.864 --> 02:11.732 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Will we feel better about
our country or worse?

02:11.732 --> 02:14.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Low
or high, Mark?

02:14.668 --> 02:21.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think Donald
Trump won the nomination going
away and prevailed in the

02:21.108 --> 02:27.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
debates by exposing and playing
to the vulnerabilities and
perceived weaknesses of his
opponents.

02:27.581 --> 02:30.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has to have concluded after
-- and he rattled them.

02:30.317 --> 02:32.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he bullied them.

02:32.853 --> 02:36.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he has to have concluded,
after two debates, that that
hasn't worked with Hillary
Clinton.

02:36.423 --> 02:40.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After 26 debates with Barack
Obama, she's far more formidable
than anybody he faced

02:40.360 --> 02:41.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the Republican primaries.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I don't know.

02:43.597 --> 02:44.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think he's just going to
throw everything today.

02:44.031 --> 02:46.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy?

02:46.266 --> 02:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: And that's the challenge
for the third debate

02:46.700 --> 02:49.236 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
too.

02:49.236 --> 02:52.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Your home always told, you never
get a second chance to make a
good first impression.

02:52.506 --> 02:58.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His first debate performance, I
think, in many ways sealed the
fate of his entire candidacy.

02:58.578 --> 03:04.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, he can try to come back in
the third debate and go after
Hillary Clinton more
aggressively.

03:04.284 --> 03:05.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I don't know that that's
going to make much of a
difference, although this is
what

03:05.986 --> 03:09.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a Republican strategist told
me he needs to do tonight.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He just put in all caps,
"E-mails, foundation, failed
record, e-mails, foundation,
failed

03:11.324 --> 03:15.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
record, e-mails, foundation,
failed record."

03:15.128 --> 03:16.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is, I think, what you're
going to hear from Donald Trump.

03:16.963 --> 03:19.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: Good evening from the
Thomas and Mack Center at the
University of Nevada, Las

03:19.099 --> 03:22.002 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Vegas.

03:22.002 --> 03:28.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm Chris Wallace of Fox News,
and I welcome you to the third
and final of the 2016
presidential

03:28.308 --> 03:32.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debates between Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton and Donald
J. Trump.

03:32.746 --> 03:36.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WALLACE: This debate is
sponsored by the Commission on
Presidential Debates.

03:36.850 --> 03:42.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The commission has designed the
format: Six roughly 15-minute
segments with two-minute

03:42.556 --> 03:46.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
answers to the first question,
then open discussion for the
rest of each segment.

03:46.993 --> 03:50.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Both campaigns have
agreed to those rules.

03:50.964 --> 03:55.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the record, I decided the
topics and the questions in each
topic.

03:55.469 --> 03:59.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
None of those questions has been
shared with the commission or
the two candidates.

03:59.806 --> 04:03.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The audience here in the hall
has promised to remain silent.

04:03.176 --> 04:07.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No cheers, boos, or other
interruptions so we and you can
focus on what the candidates

04:07.481 --> 04:10.050 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have to say.

04:10.050 --> 04:15.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALLACE: No noise, except right
now, as we welcome the
Democratic nominee for
president,

04:15.622 --> 04:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Clinton, and the
Republican nominee for
president, Mr. Trump.

04:27.100 --> 04:36.810 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

04:36.810 --> 04:38.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Secretary Clinton,
Mr. Trump, welcome.

04:38.512 --> 04:39.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's get right to it.

04:39.880 --> 04:44.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The first topic is
the Supreme Court.

04:44.518 --> 04:48.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You both talked briefly about
the court in the last debate,
but I want to drill down

04:48.788 --> 04:52.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on this, because the next
president will almost certainly
have at least one appointment
and

04:52.859 --> 04:56.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
likely or possibly two
or three appointments.

04:56.930 --> 05:00.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: Which means that you
will, in effect, determine the
balance of the court for what

05:00.567 --> 05:03.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
could be the next
quarter century.

05:03.603 --> 05:07.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First of all, where do you want
to see the court take the
country?

05:07.807 --> 05:13.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And secondly, what's your view
on how the Constitution should
be interpreted?

05:13.280 --> 05:20.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do the founders' words mean what
they say or is it a living
document to be applied flexibly

05:20.353 --> 05:22.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
according to changing
circumstances?

05:22.856 --> 05:24.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In this segment, Secretary
Clinton, you go first.

05:24.424 --> 05:25.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have two minutes.

05:25.792 --> 05:27.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Thank you
very much, Chris.

05:27.027 --> 05:30.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And thanks to UNLV
for hosting us.

05:30.697 --> 05:36.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, I think when we talk
about the Supreme Court, it
really raises the central issue

05:36.136 --> 05:40.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this election, namely, what
kind of country are we going to
be?

05:40.207 --> 05:43.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What kind of opportunities will
we provide for our citizens?

05:43.743 --> 05:48.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What kind of rights
will Americans have?

05:48.281 --> 05:54.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I feel strongly that the
Supreme Court needs to stand on
the side of the American

05:54.120 --> 05:59.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people, not on the side of the
powerful corporations and the
wealthy.

05:59.893 --> 06:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For me, that means that we need
a Supreme Court that will stand
up on behalf of women's

06:06.900 --> 06:13.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rights, on behalf of the rights
of the LGBT community, that will
stand up and say no to

06:13.707 --> 06:21.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Citizens United, a decision that
has undermined the election
system in our country because

06:21.715 --> 06:27.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the way it permits dark,
unaccountable money to come into
our electoral system.

06:27.787 --> 06:31.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have major disagreements with
my opponent about these issues
and others that will be

06:31.491 --> 06:35.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
before the Supreme Court.

06:35.395 --> 06:41.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I feel that at this point in
our country's history, it is
important that we not reverse

06:41.701 --> 06:48.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
marriage equality, that we not
reverse Roe v. Wade, that we
stand up against Citizens

06:48.842 --> 06:54.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United, we stand up for the
rights of people in the
workplace, that we stand up and
basically

06:54.047 --> 06:58.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
say: The Supreme Court
should represent all of us.

06:58.752 --> 07:04.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's how I see the court, and
the kind of people that I would
be looking to nominate

07:04.491 --> 07:09.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the court would be in the
great tradition of standing up
to the powerful, standing up

07:09.729 --> 07:13.333 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
on behalf of our
rights as Americans.

07:13.333 --> 07:16.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I look forward to
having that opportunity.

07:16.536 --> 07:20.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would hope that the Senate
would do its job and confirm the
nominee that President

07:20.440 --> 07:23.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Obama has sent to them.

07:23.443 --> 07:27.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the way the Constitution
fundamentally should operate.

07:27.547 --> 07:31.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president nominates, and
then the Senate advises and
consents, or not, but they go

07:31.618 --> 07:33.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
forward with the process.

07:33.987 --> 07:35.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Secretary
Clinton, thank you.

07:35.655 --> 07:36.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Mr. Trump,
same question.

07:36.990 --> 07:40.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Where do you want to see the
court take the country?

07:40.360 --> 07:43.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And how do you believe the
Constitution should be
interpreted?

07:43.663 --> 07:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, first of all, it's
great to be with you, and thank
you, everybody.

07:47.233 --> 07:50.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Supreme Court: It's
what it's all about.

07:50.370 --> 07:57.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our country is so, so -- it's
just so imperative that we have
the right justices.

07:57.043 --> 08:03.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Something happened recently
where Justice Ginsburg made some
very, very inappropriate

08:03.550 --> 08:06.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
statements toward me and toward
a tremendous number of people,
many, many millions of people

08:06.753 --> 08:08.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that I represent.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.457 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And she was forced to apologize.

08:10.457 --> 08:13.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And apologize she did.

08:13.360 --> 08:17.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But these were statements that
should never, ever have been
made.

08:17.063 --> 08:21.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need a Supreme Court that in
my opinion is going to uphold
the Second Amendment, and

08:21.901 --> 08:26.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all amendments, but the Second
Amendment, which is under
absolute siege.

08:26.639 --> 08:33.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I believe if my opponent should
win this race, which I truly
don't think will happen, we

08:33.546 --> 08:37.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will have a Second Amendment
which will be a very, very small
replica of what it is right

08:37.217 --> 08:39.819 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

08:39.819 --> 08:43.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I feel that it's absolutely
important that we uphold,
because of the fact that it

08:43.590 --> 08:47.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is under such trauma.

08:47.794 --> 08:54.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I feel that the justices that I
am going to appoint -- and I've
named 20 of them -- the

08:54.367 --> 08:57.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
justices that I'm going to
appoint will be pro-life.

08:57.670 --> 09:00.273 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
They will have a
conservative bent.

09:00.273 --> 09:03.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They will be protecting
the Second Amendment.

09:03.176 --> 09:08.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are great scholars in all
cases, and they're people of
tremendous respect.

09:08.681 --> 09:14.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They will interpret the
Constitution the way the
founders wanted it interpreted.

09:14.888 --> 09:18.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I believe that's
very, very important.

09:18.057 --> 09:23.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think we should have
justices appointed that decide
what they want to hear.

09:23.963 --> 09:31.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's all about the Constitution
of -- of -- and so important,
the Constitution the way it

09:31.104 --> 09:33.673 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was meant to be.

09:33.673 --> 09:35.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And those are the people
that I will appoint.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALLACE: Mr. Trump, thank you.

09:38.077 --> 09:41.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WALLACE: We now have about 10
minutes for an open discussion.

09:41.014 --> 09:47.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to focus on two issues
that, in fact, by the justices
that you name could end up

09:47.787 --> 09:51.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
changing the existing
law of the land.

09:51.157 --> 09:54.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First is one that you mentioned,
Mr. Trump, and that is guns.

09:54.661 --> 09:58.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Clinton, you said last
year, let me quote, "The Supreme
Court is wrong on the

09:58.765 --> 10:01.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Second Amendment."

10:01.201 --> 10:06.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now, in fact, in the 2008
Heller case, the court ruled
that there is a constitutional

10:06.039 --> 10:10.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right to bear arms, but a right
that is reasonably limited.

10:10.777 --> 10:14.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those were the words of the
Judge Antonin Scalia who wrote
the decision.

10:14.380 --> 10:16.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's wrong with that?

10:16.249 --> 10:17.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CONTENT FROM PHILIPS
Patient-centered healthcare is
coming

10:17.784 --> 10:18.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Discover how value-based care
can lead to greater efficiency
and better patient outcomes.

10:18.184 --> 10:18.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, first of all, I
support the Second Amendment.

10:18.918 --> 10:21.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I lived in Arkansas for
18 wonderful years.

10:21.855 --> 10:24.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I represented upstate New York.

10:24.591 --> 10:28.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I understand and respect the
tradition of gun ownership.

10:28.094 --> 10:31.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It goes back to the
founding of our country.

10:31.464 --> 10:37.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I also believe that there
can be and must be reasonable
regulation.

10:37.837 --> 10:40.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because I support the Second
Amendment doesn't mean that I
want people who shouldn't have

10:40.840 --> 10:46.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
guns to be able to threaten you,
kill you or members of your
family.

10:46.746 --> 10:52.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so when I think about what
we need to do, we have 33,000
people a year who die from

10:52.152 --> 10:54.787 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
guns.

10:54.787 --> 10:58.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we need comprehensive
background checks, need to close
the online loophole, close the

10:58.892 --> 11:01.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
gun show loophole.

11:01.861 --> 11:06.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's other matters that I
think are sensible that are the
kind of reforms that would make

11:06.799 --> 11:11.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a difference that are not in any
way conflicting with the Second
Amendment.

11:11.070 --> 11:13.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You mentioned the
Heller decision.

11:13.740 --> 11:18.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what I was saying that you
referenced, Chris, was that I
disagreed with the way the

11:18.711 --> 11:25.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
court applied the Second
Amendment in that case, because
what the District of Columbia

11:25.251 --> 11:30.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was trying to do was to protect
toddlers from guns and so they
wanted people with guns to

11:30.924 --> 11:34.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
safely store them.

11:34.027 --> 11:38.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the court didn't accept that
reasonable regulation, but
they've accepted many others.

11:38.264 --> 11:43.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I see no conflict between
saving people's lives and
defending the Second Amendment.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Let me bring
Mr. Trump in here.

11:45.939 --> 11:51.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bipartisan Open Debate
Coalition got millions of votes
on questions to ask here, and
this

11:51.578 --> 11:56.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was, in fact, one of the top
questions that they got.

11:56.316 --> 11:59.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How will you ensure the Second
Amendment is protected?

11:59.185 --> 12:03.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You just heard Secretary
Clinton's answer.

12:03.189 --> 12:06.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does she persuade you that,
while you may disagree on
regulation, that, in fact, she

12:06.559 --> 12:09.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
supports a Second Amendment
right to bear arms?

12:09.362 --> 12:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, the D.C. vs. Heller
decision was very strongly --
and she was extremely

12:13.733 --> 12:14.701 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
angry about it.

12:14.701 --> 12:16.369 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I watched.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, she was very,
very angry when upheld.

12:18.838 --> 12:21.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Justice Scalia
was so involved.

12:21.474 --> 12:24.544 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And it was a
well-crafted decision.

12:24.544 --> 12:28.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Hillary was extremely
upset, extremely angry.

12:28.448 --> 12:31.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And people that believe in the
Second Amendment and believe in
it very strongly were very

12:31.918 --> 12:34.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
upset with what she had to say.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WALLACE: Well, let me bring
in Secretary Clinton.

12:35.221 --> 12:38.024 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Were you extremely upset?

12:38.024 --> 12:45.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, I was upset
because, unfortunately, dozens
of toddlers injure themselves,
even

12:45.098 --> 12:50.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kill people with guns, because,
unfortunately, not everyone who
has loaded guns in their

12:50.770 --> 12:54.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
homes takes appropriate
precautions.

12:54.540 --> 12:58.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there's no doubt that I
respect the Second Amendment,
that I also believe there's an

12:58.578 --> 13:01.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
individual right to bear arms.

13:01.914 --> 13:06.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is not in conflict with
sensible, commonsense
regulation.

13:06.786 --> 13:11.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, you know, look, I
understand that Donald's been
strongly supported by the NRA.

13:11.557 --> 13:13.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The gun lobby's on his side.

13:13.726 --> 13:17.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're running millions of
dollars of ads against me.

13:17.330 --> 13:21.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I regret that, because what
I would like to see is for
people to come together and

13:21.301 --> 13:26.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say: Of course we're going to
protect and defend the Second
Amendment.

13:26.406 --> 13:30.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we're going to do it in a
way that tries to save some of
these 33,000 lives that we

13:30.476 --> 13:32.945 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lose every year.

13:32.945 --> 13:37.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: Let me bring Mr. Trump
back into this, because, in
fact, you oppose any limits

13:37.617 --> 13:41.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on assault weapons, any limits
on high- capacity magazines.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You support a national
right to carry law.

13:43.790 --> 13:45.758 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Why, sir?

13:45.758 --> 13:49.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, let me just tell
you before we go any further.

13:49.295 --> 13:53.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Chicago, which has the
toughest gun laws in the United
States, probably you could say

13:53.700 --> 13:57.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by far, they have more gun
violence than any other city.

13:57.970 --> 14:01.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we have the toughest laws,
and you have tremendous gun
violence.

14:01.374 --> 14:06.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I am a very strong supporter
of the Second Amendment.

14:06.079 --> 14:08.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I am -- I don't know if
Hillary was saying it in a
sarcastic manner, but I'm very
proud

14:08.915 --> 14:12.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to have the endorsement
of the NRA.

14:12.251 --> 14:15.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it's the earliest
endorsement they've ever given
to anybody who ran for
president.

14:15.822 --> 14:19.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So I'm very honored
by all of that.

14:19.292 --> 14:24.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are going to appoint justices
-- this is the best way to help
the Second Amendment.

14:24.397 --> 14:29.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are going to appoint justices
that will feel very strongly
about the Second Amendment,

14:29.335 --> 14:32.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that will not do damage
to the Second Amendment.

14:32.972 --> 14:39.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: Well, let's pick up on
another issue which divides you
and the justices that whoever

14:39.479 --> 14:42.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ends up winning this election
appoints could have a dramatic
effect there, and that's the

14:42.548 --> 14:43.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
issue of abortion.

14:43.483 --> 14:44.917 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRUMP: Right.

14:44.917 --> 14:47.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Mr. Trump,
you're pro-life.

14:47.553 --> 14:52.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I want to ask you
specifically: Do you want the
court, including the justices
that

14:52.959 --> 14:57.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you will name, to overturn Roe
v. Wade, which includes -- in
fact, states -- a woman's right

14:57.463 --> 14:59.999 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to abortion?

14:59.999 --> 15:03.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, if that would
happen, because I am pro-life,
and I will be appointing
pro-life

15:03.669 --> 15:06.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
judges, I would think that that
will go back to the individual
states.

15:06.539 --> 15:07.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: But I'm asking
you specifically.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Would you like to...

15:09.709 --> 15:11.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: If they overturned it,
it will go back to the states.

15:11.477 --> 15:15.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: But what I'm asking
you, sir, is, do you want to see
the court overturn -- you

15:15.081 --> 15:17.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just said you want to see the
court protect the Second
Amendment.

15:17.683 --> 15:20.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you want to see the court
overturn Roe v. Wade?

15:20.553 --> 15:23.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, if we put another
two or perhaps three justice on,
that's really what's going

15:23.956 --> 15:27.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be -- that will happen.

15:27.660 --> 15:30.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that'll happen
automatically, in my opinion,
because I am putting pro-life
justices on

15:30.797 --> 15:33.332 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the court.

15:33.332 --> 15:36.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will say this: It will go back
to the states, and the states
will then make a determination.

15:36.969 --> 15:39.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?

15:39.472 --> 15:44.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, I strongly
support Roe v. Wade, which
guarantees a constitutional
right to

15:44.744 --> 15:49.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a woman to make the most
intimate, most difficult, in
many cases, decisions about her
health

15:49.348 --> 15:52.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
care that one can imagine.

15:52.485 --> 15:55.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And in this case, it's not
only about Roe v. Wade.

15:55.988 --> 16:00.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is about what's happening
right now in America.

16:00.059 --> 16:08.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So many states are putting very
stringent regulations on women
that block them from

16:08.234 --> 16:13.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exercising that choice to the
extent that they are defunding
Planned Parenthood, which,

16:13.573 --> 16:19.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of course, provides all kinds of
cancer screenings and other
benefits for women in our
country.

16:19.912 --> 16:23.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald has said he's in favor of
defunding Planned Parenthood.

16:23.049 --> 16:26.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He even supported shutting the
government down to defund
Planned Parenthood.

16:26.652 --> 16:30.356 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
I will defend
Planned Parenthood.

16:30.356 --> 16:35.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I
will defend women's rights to
make their own health care

16:35.094 --> 16:36.429 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
decisions.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton...

16:38.231 --> 16:41.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: And we have come too
far to have that turned back
now.

16:41.434 --> 16:45.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, indeed, he said women
should be punished, that there
should be some form of
punishment

16:45.538 --> 16:49.075 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for women who obtain abortions.

16:49.075 --> 16:52.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I could just not be more
opposed to that kind of
thinking.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: I'm going to give you a
chance to respond, but I want to
ask you, Secretary

16:55.882 --> 16:59.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton, I want to explore how
far you believe the right to
abortion goes.

16:59.352 --> 17:04.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have been quoted as saying
that the fetus has no
constitutional rights.

17:04.824 --> 17:09.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You also voted against a ban on
late-term, partial-birth
abortions.

17:09.562 --> 17:12.064 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

17:12.064 --> 17:19.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Because Roe v. Wade
very clearly sets out that there
can be regulations on

17:19.972 --> 17:26.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
abortion so long as the life and
the health of the mother are
taken into account.

17:26.646 --> 17:31.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when I voted as a senator, I
did not think that that was the
case.

17:31.484 --> 17:38.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The kinds of cases that fall at
the end of pregnancy are often
the most heartbreaking,

17:38.224 --> 17:41.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
painful decisions for
families to make.

17:41.327 --> 17:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have met with women who toward
the end of their pregnancy get
the worst news one could

17:47.633 --> 17:52.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get, that their health is in
jeopardy if they continue to
carry to term or that something

17:52.939 --> 17:58.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terrible has happened or just
been discovered about the
pregnancy.

17:58.244 --> 18:02.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do not think the United States
government should be stepping in
and making those most

18:02.281 --> 18:05.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
personal of decisions.

18:05.484 --> 18:10.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So you can regulate if you are
doing so with the life and the
health of the mother taken

18:10.656 --> 18:12.124 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into account.

18:12.124 --> 18:13.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Mr. Trump,
your reaction?

18:13.826 --> 18:15.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And particularly on this issue
of late-term, partial-birth
abortions.

18:15.161 --> 18:17.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Well, I think
it's terrible.

18:17.730 --> 18:22.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you go with what Hillary is
saying, in the ninth month, you
can take the baby and

18:22.601 --> 18:29.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rip the baby out of the womb of
the mother just prior to the
birth of the baby.

18:29.141 --> 18:35.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, you can say that that's OK
and Hillary can say that that's
OK.

18:35.081 --> 18:40.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's not OK with me, because
based on what she's saying, and
based on where she's

18:40.119 --> 18:44.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going, and where she's been, you
can take the baby and rip the
baby out of the womb

18:44.523 --> 18:47.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the ninth month
on the final day.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's not acceptable.

18:49.228 --> 18:52.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, that is not
what happens in these cases.

18:52.231 --> 18:58.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And using that kind of scare
rhetoric is just terribly
unfortunate.

18:58.504 --> 19:00.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You should meet with some of the
women that I have met with,
women I have known over the

19:00.973 --> 19:04.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
course of my life.

19:04.110 --> 19:09.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This is one of the worst
possible choices that any woman
and her family has to make.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I do not believe the
government should be making it.

19:12.885 --> 19:17.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, I've had the great
honor of traveling across the
world on behalf of our country.

19:17.323 --> 19:21.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I've been to countries where
governments either forced women
to have abortions, like they

19:21.827 --> 19:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
used to do in China, or forced
women to bear children, like
they used to do in Romania.

19:27.433 --> 19:32.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I can tell you: The
government has no business in
the decisions that women make

19:32.605 --> 19:36.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
with their families in
accordance with their faith,
with medical advice.

19:36.142 --> 19:37.343 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And I will stand
up for that right.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: All right.

19:39.145 --> 19:41.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But just briefly, I want to
move on to another segment...

19:41.447 --> 19:46.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: And, honestly, nobody has
business doing what I just said,
doing that, as late

19:46.652 --> 19:50.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as one or two or three or
four days prior to birth.

19:50.122 --> 19:51.257 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Nobody has that.

19:51.257 --> 19:52.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: All right.

19:52.725 --> 19:56.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let's move on to the
subject of immigration.

19:56.062 --> 20:00.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is almost no issue
that separates the two of you
more than the issue of
immigration.

20:00.066 --> 20:02.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Actually, there are a lot of
issues that separate the two of
you.

20:02.401 --> 20:05.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mr. Trump, you want
to build a wall.

20:05.838 --> 20:09.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Clinton, you have
offered no specific plan for how
you want to secure our southern

20:09.208 --> 20:11.043 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
border.

20:11.043 --> 20:14.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Trump, you are calling
for major deportations.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Clinton, you say that
within your first 100 days as
president you're going to

20:17.683 --> 20:23.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
offer a package that includes
a pathway to citizenship.

20:23.089 --> 20:25.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The question, really, is, why
are you right and your opponent
wrong?

20:25.958 --> 20:27.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mr. Trump, you go first
in this segment.

20:27.293 --> 20:29.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have two minutes.

20:29.595 --> 20:32.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, first of all, she
wants to give amnesty, which is
a disaster and very unfair

20:32.298 --> 20:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to all of the people that are
waiting on line for many, many
years.

20:34.500 --> 20:37.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We need strong borders.

20:37.570 --> 20:43.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the audience tonight, we have
four mothers of -- I mean, these
are unbelievable people

20:43.943 --> 20:46.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that I've gotten to know over a
period of years whose children
have been killed, brutally

20:46.979 --> 20:50.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
killed by people that came
into the country illegally.

20:50.483 --> 20:54.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have thousands of mothers
and fathers and relatives all
over the country.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're coming in illegally.

20:56.522 --> 20:58.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Drugs are pouring in
through the border.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have no country if
we have no border.

21:00.426 --> 21:01.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hillary wants to give amnesty.

21:01.727 --> 21:04.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She wants to have open borders.

21:04.930 --> 21:09.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The border -- as you know, the
Border Patrol agents,
16,500-plus ICE last week,
endorsed

21:09.735 --> 21:11.504 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
First time they've ever
endorsed a candidate.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.840 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It means their job is tougher.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But they know what's going on.

21:16.609 --> 21:17.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They know it better
than anybody.

21:17.776 --> 21:20.446 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They want strong borders.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They feel we have to
have strong borders.

21:22.081 --> 21:24.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was up in New Hampshire
the other day.

21:24.650 --> 21:28.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The biggest complaint they have
-- it's with all of the problems
going on in the world,

21:28.721 --> 21:32.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many of the problems caused by
Hillary Clinton and by Barack
Obama.

21:32.725 --> 21:36.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of the problems -- the
single biggest problem is heroin
that pours across our southern

21:36.195 --> 21:37.963 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
border.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's just pouring and
destroying their youth.

21:39.398 --> 21:42.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's poisoning the blood of
their youth and plenty of other
people.

21:42.468 --> 21:45.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have to have strong borders.

21:45.871 --> 21:48.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have to keep the drugs
out of our country.

21:48.574 --> 21:50.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are -- right now, we're
getting the drugs, they're
getting the cash.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We need strong borders.

21:53.045 --> 21:55.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We need absolute -- we
cannot give amnesty.

21:55.748 --> 21:58.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now, I want to build the wall.

21:58.117 --> 21:59.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We need the wall.

21:59.752 --> 22:02.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the Border Patrol, ICE,
they all want the wall.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We stop the drugs.

22:03.422 --> 22:06.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We shore up the border.

22:06.559 --> 22:10.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of my first acts will be to
get all of the drug lords, all
of the bad ones -- we

22:10.129 --> 22:13.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have some bad, bad people in
this country that have to go
out.

22:13.432 --> 22:17.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to get them out;
we're going to secure the
border.

22:17.269 --> 22:19.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And once the border is secured,
at a later date, we'll make a
determination as to the

22:19.738 --> 22:22.007 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rest.

22:22.007 --> 22:24.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we have some bad hombres
here, and we're going to get
them out.

22:24.443 --> 22:26.879 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALLACE: Mr. Trump, thank you.

22:26.879 --> 22:29.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Same question to you,
Secretary Clinton.

22:29.582 --> 22:32.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Basically, why are you right
and Mr. Trump is wrong?

22:32.685 --> 22:37.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Well, as he was
talking, I was thinking about a
young girl I met here in Las
Vegas,

22:37.823 --> 22:43.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Carla, who is very worried that
her parents might be deported,
because she was born in

22:43.796 --> 22:46.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this country but they were not.

22:46.699 --> 22:49.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They work hard, they do
everything they can to give her
a good life.

22:49.668 --> 22:51.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And you're right.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't want to rip
families apart.

22:53.172 --> 22:57.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't want to be sending
parents away from children.

22:57.309 --> 23:02.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I don't want to see the
deportation force that Donald
has talked about in action in

23:02.348 --> 23:03.949 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our country.

23:03.949 --> 23:06.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have 11 million
undocumented people.

23:06.986 --> 23:12.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have 4 million American
citizen children, 15 million
people.

23:12.057 --> 23:16.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said as recently as a few
weeks ago in Phoenix that every
undocumented person would

23:16.161 --> 23:17.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be subject to deportation.

23:17.563 --> 23:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now, here's what that means.

23:20.366 --> 23:26.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It means you would have to have
a massive law enforcement
presence, where law enforcement

23:26.038 --> 23:30.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
officers would be going school
to school, home to home,
business to business, rounding

23:30.542 --> 23:34.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
up people who are undocumented.

23:34.713 --> 23:40.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we would then have to put
them on trains, on buses to get
them out of our country.

23:40.252 --> 23:46.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that is an idea that is
not in keeping with who we are
as a nation.

23:46.058 --> 23:49.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it's an idea that
would rip our country apart.

23:49.728 --> 23:52.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have been for border
security for years.

23:52.898 --> 23:56.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I voted for border security
in the United States Senate.

23:56.402 --> 24:01.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And my comprehensive immigration
reform plan of course includes
border security.

24:01.974 --> 24:06.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I want to put our resources
where I think they're most
needed: Getting rid of any
violent

24:06.312 --> 24:08.847 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
person.

24:08.847 --> 24:12.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Anybody who should be deported,
we should deport them.

24:12.785 --> 24:15.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When it comes to the wall that
Donald talks about building, he
went to Mexico, he had

24:15.921 --> 24:17.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a meeting with the
Mexican president.

24:17.356 --> 24:19.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Didn't even raise it.

24:19.858 --> 24:22.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He choked and then got into a
Twitter war because the Mexican
president said we're not

24:22.661 --> 24:25.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
paying for that wall.

24:25.597 --> 24:30.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think we are both a nation
of immigrants and we are a
nation of laws and that we can

24:30.302 --> 24:33.138 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
act accordingly.

24:33.138 --> 24:36.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why I'm introducing
comprehensive immigration reform
within the first 100 days

24:36.342 --> 24:38.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with the path to citizenship.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Thank you,
Secretary Clinton.

24:39.411 --> 24:40.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I want to follow up...

24:40.546 --> 24:41.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Chris, I think it's...

24:41.246 --> 24:42.715 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WALLACE: OK.

24:42.715 --> 24:44.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: I think I should
respond to that.

24:44.350 --> 24:46.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First of all, I had a very good
meeting with the president of
Mexico.

24:46.352 --> 24:49.188 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Very nice man.

24:49.188 --> 24:51.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will be doing very much
better with Mexico on trade
deals.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.959 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Believe me.

24:53.959 --> 24:56.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The NAFTA deal signed by her
husband is one of the worst
deals ever made of any kind,

24:56.428 --> 24:57.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
signed by anybody.

24:57.730 --> 24:59.331 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's a disaster.

24:59.331 --> 25:02.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.

25:02.134 --> 25:07.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary Clinton fought for the
wall in 2006 or thereabouts.

25:07.606 --> 25:11.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, she never gets anything
done, so naturally the wall
wasn't built.

25:11.877 --> 25:14.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But Hillary Clinton
wanted the wall.

25:14.246 --> 25:14.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Well, let me --
wait, wait, sir, let me...

25:14.813 --> 25:16.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: We are a country of laws.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We either have --
and by the way...

25:18.183 --> 25:19.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Now, wait.

25:19.184 --> 25:20.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'd like to hear from...

25:20.652 --> 25:22.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Well -- well, but
she said one thing.

25:22.121 --> 25:23.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: I'd like to hear -- I'd
like to hear from Secretary
Clinton.

25:23.021 --> 25:25.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: I voted for border
security, and there are...

25:25.457 --> 25:27.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: And the wall.

25:27.426 --> 25:31.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: There are some limited
places where that was
appropriate.

25:31.029 --> 25:36.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There also is necessarily going
to be new technology and how
best to deploy that.

25:36.902 --> 25:41.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it is clear, when you look
at what Donald has been
proposing, he started his
campaign

25:41.974 --> 25:47.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bashing immigrants, calling
Mexican immigrants rapists and
criminals and drug dealers, that

25:47.880 --> 25:53.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he has a very different view
about what we should do to deal
with immigrants.

25:53.552 --> 26:00.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, what I am also arguing is
that bringing undocumented
immigrants out from the shadows,

26:00.092 --> 26:04.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
putting them into the formal
economy will be good, because
then employers

26:04.129 --> 26:06.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
them and undercut
Americans' wages.

26:06.832 --> 26:08.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Donald knows a
lot about this.

26:08.500 --> 26:12.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He used undocumented labor
to build the Trump Tower.

26:12.438 --> 26:16.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He underpaid undocumented
workers, and when they
complained, he basically said
what a

26:16.675 --> 26:20.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lot of employers do: "You
complain, I'll get you
deported."

26:20.746 --> 26:26.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to get everybody out of
the shadows, get the economy
working, and not let employers

26:26.051 --> 26:29.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like Donald exploit undocumented
workers, which hurts them, but
also hurts American

26:29.455 --> 26:30.722 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
workers.

26:30.722 --> 26:32.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Mr. Trump?

26:32.458 --> 26:34.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: President Obama has
moved millions of people out.

26:34.193 --> 26:36.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Nobody knows about it,
nobody talks about it.

26:36.762 --> 26:38.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But under Obama, millions of
people have been moved out of
this country.

26:38.797 --> 26:41.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They've been deported.

26:41.300 --> 26:45.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She doesn't want to say that,
but that's what's happened, and
that's what happened big league.

26:45.871 --> 26:49.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As far as moving these people
out and moving -- we either have
a country or we don't.

26:49.775 --> 26:51.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're a country of laws.

26:51.109 --> 26:53.445 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We either have a
border or we don't.

26:53.445 --> 26:56.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, you can come back in and
you can become a citizen.

26:56.515 --> 26:58.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But it's very unfair.

26:58.150 --> 26:59.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have millions of people
that did it the right way.

26:59.818 --> 27:00.819 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They're on line.

27:00.819 --> 27:03.188 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They're waiting.

27:03.188 --> 27:05.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to speed up the
process, big league, because
it's very inefficient.

27:05.491 --> 27:09.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But they're on line and they're
waiting to become citizens.

27:09.228 --> 27:12.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Very unfair that somebody runs
across the border, becomes a
citizen, under her plan,

27:12.331 --> 27:14.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you have open borders.

27:14.867 --> 27:17.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You would have a disaster on
trade, and you will have a
disaster with your open borders.

27:17.503 --> 27:20.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: I want to...

27:20.005 --> 27:23.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRUMP: But what she doesn't say
is that President Obama has
deported millions and millions
of

27:23.442 --> 27:25.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people just the way it is.

27:25.244 --> 27:26.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Secretary
Clinton, I want to...

27:26.778 --> 27:28.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: We will not
have open borders.

27:28.313 --> 27:29.882 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That is...

27:29.882 --> 27:30.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Well, let
me -- Secretary...

27:30.949 --> 27:31.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: That is a rank
mischaracterization.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton...

27:33.418 --> 27:36.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: We will have secure
borders, but we'll also have
reform.

27:36.755 --> 27:38.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And this used to be
a bipartisan issue.

27:38.457 --> 27:39.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Ronald Reagan was the
last president...

27:39.892 --> 27:40.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Secretary
Clinton, excuse me.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Secretary Clinton.

27:42.895 --> 27:45.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: ... to sign immigration
reform, and George W. Bush
supported it, as well.

27:45.898 --> 27:50.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, I
want to clear up your position
on this issue, because in

27:50.002 --> 27:55.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a speech you gave to a Brazilian
bank, for which you were paid
$225,000, we've learned

27:55.240 --> 27:58.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from the WikiLeaks, that you
said this, and I want to quote.

27:58.810 --> 28:03.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"My dream is a hemispheric
common market with open trade
and open borders."

28:03.181 --> 28:04.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So that's the question...

28:04.716 --> 28:06.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Thank you.

28:06.585 --> 28:07.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALLACE: That's the question.

28:07.719 --> 28:09.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Please quiet, everybody.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is that your dream,
open borders?

28:11.924 --> 28:14.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, if you went on to
read the rest of the sentence, I
was talking about

28:14.159 --> 28:17.563 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
energy.

28:17.563 --> 28:23.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, we trade more energy
with our neighbors than we trade
with the rest of the world
combined.

28:23.068 --> 28:28.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I do want us to have an
electric grid, an energy system
that crosses borders.

28:28.941 --> 28:31.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think that would be a
great benefit to us.

28:31.276 --> 28:36.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But you are very clearly
quoting from WikiLeaks.

28:36.048 --> 28:41.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what's really important
about WikiLeaks is that the
Russian government has engaged

28:41.253 --> 28:46.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in espionage against Americans.

28:46.058 --> 28:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have hacked American
websites, American accounts of
private people, of institutions.

28:54.266 --> 29:00.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then they have given that
information to WikiLeaks for the
purpose of putting it on the
Internet.

29:00.939 --> 29:05.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This has come from the highest
levels of the Russian
government, clearly, from Putin
himself,

29:05.978 --> 29:12.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in an effort, as 17 of our
intelligence agencies have
confirmed, to influence our
election.

29:12.250 --> 29:18.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: So I actually think the
most important question of this
evening, Chris, is, finally,

29:18.857 --> 29:25.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will Donald Trump admit and
condemn that the Russians are
doing this and make it clear

29:25.297 --> 29:32.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he will not have the help
of Putin in in this election,
that he rejects Russian

29:32.638 --> 29:37.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
espionage against Americans,
which he actually encouraged in
the past?

29:37.209 --> 29:39.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Those are the questions
we need answered.

29:39.344 --> 29:41.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We've never had anything like
this happen in any of our
elections before.

29:41.046 --> 29:43.248 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WALLACE: Well?

29:43.248 --> 29:45.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: That was a great pivot
off the fact that she wants open
borders, OK?

29:45.851 --> 29:47.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How did we get on to Putin?

29:47.953 --> 29:49.554 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
WALLACE: Hold on
-- hold on, wait.

29:49.554 --> 29:51.757 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hold on, folks.

29:51.757 --> 29:54.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Because we -- this is going to
end up getting out of control.

29:54.693 --> 29:57.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's try to keep it quiet so --
for the candidates and for the
American people.

29:57.396 --> 29:58.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: So just to finish
on the borders...

29:58.096 --> 29:59.364 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WALLACE: Yes?

29:59.364 --> 30:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: She wants open borders.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
People are going to
pour into our country.

30:04.102 --> 30:06.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
People are going to
come in from Syria.

30:06.938 --> 30:11.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She wants 550 percent more
people than Barack Obama, and he
has thousands and thousands

30:11.510 --> 30:13.145 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of people.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have no idea
where they come from.

30:15.147 --> 30:20.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you see, we are going to
stop radical Islamic terrorism
in this country.

30:20.452 --> 30:23.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She won't even mention the
words, and neither will
President Obama.

30:23.488 --> 30:25.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I just want to tell you,
she wants open borders.

30:25.624 --> 30:26.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now we can talk about Putin.

30:26.758 --> 30:28.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't know Putin.

30:28.193 --> 30:30.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He said nice things about me.

30:30.228 --> 30:33.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If we got along well,
that would be good.

30:33.532 --> 30:37.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If Russia and the United States
got along well and went after
ISIS, that would be good.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He has no respect for her.

30:40.305 --> 30:43.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He has no respect
for our president.

30:43.542 --> 30:48.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'll tell you what: We're in
very serious trouble, because we
have a country with tremendous

30:48.947 --> 30:54.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
numbers of nuclear warheads --
1,800, by the way -- where they
expanded and we didn't,

30:54.586 --> 30:56.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
1,800 nuclear warheads.

30:56.888 --> 30:57.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And she's playing chicken.

30:57.689 --> 30:58.824 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Look, Putin...

30:58.824 --> 31:00.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Wait, but...

31:00.726 --> 31:05.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: ... from everything I
see, has no respect for this
person.

31:05.530 --> 31:08.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, that's because
he'd rather have a puppet as
president of the United States.

31:08.767 --> 31:09.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: No puppet.

31:09.634 --> 31:11.103 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No puppet.

31:11.103 --> 31:11.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: And it's
pretty clear...

31:11.903 --> 31:13.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: You're the puppet!

31:13.271 --> 31:13.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: It's pretty
clear you won't admit...

31:13.972 --> 31:16.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: No, you're the puppet.

31:16.141 --> 31:18.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: ... that the Russians
have engaged in cyberattacks
against the United States

31:18.310 --> 31:26.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of America, that you encouraged
espionage against our people,
that you are willing to

31:26.384 --> 31:32.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spout the Putin line, sign up
for his wish list, break up
NATO, do whatever he wants

31:32.324 --> 31:39.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do, and that you continue to
get help from him, because he
has a very clear favorite

31:39.197 --> 31:41.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this race.

31:41.366 --> 31:46.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I think that this is such
an unprecedented situation.

31:46.204 --> 31:51.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We've never had a foreign
government trying to interfere
in our election.

31:51.243 --> 31:59.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have 17 -- 17 intelligence
agencies, civilian and military,
who have all concluded that

31:59.217 --> 32:04.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these espionage attacks, these
cyberattacks, come from the
highest levels of the Kremlin

32:04.489 --> 32:07.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and they are designed to
influence our election.

32:07.192 --> 32:08.960 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I find that deeply disturbing.

32:08.960 --> 32:10.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton...

32:10.362 --> 32:11.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: And I think it's
time you take a stand...

32:11.830 --> 32:13.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: She has no idea whether
it's Russia, China, or anybody
else.

32:13.899 --> 32:14.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: I am not
quoting myself.

32:14.833 --> 32:15.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: She has no idea.

32:15.967 --> 32:17.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON: I am quoting 17...

32:17.135 --> 32:18.904 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
TRUMP: Hillary,
you have no idea.

32:18.904 --> 32:21.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: ... 17 intelligence --
do you doubt 17 military and
civilian...

32:21.039 --> 32:22.307 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
TRUMP: And our
country has no idea.

32:22.307 --> 32:23.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: ... agencies.

32:23.275 --> 32:24.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Yeah, I doubt it.

32:24.142 --> 32:26.812 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I doubt it.

32:26.812 --> 32:30.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, he'd rather
believe Vladimir Putin than the
military and civilian
intelligence

32:30.215 --> 32:32.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
professionals who are
sworn to protect us.

32:32.918 --> 32:33.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I find that just absolutely...

32:33.919 --> 32:36.388 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

32:36.388 --> 32:39.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: She doesn't like Putin
because Putin has outsmarted her
at every step of the way.

32:39.791 --> 32:40.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Mr. Trump...

32:40.725 --> 32:42.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Excuse me.

32:42.127 --> 32:42.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Putin has outsmarted
her in Syria.

32:42.794 --> 32:43.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Mr. Trump...

32:43.628 --> 32:45.363 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

32:45.363 --> 32:46.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: He's outsmarted her
every step of the way.

32:46.231 --> 32:47.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: I do get to
ask some questions.

32:47.766 --> 32:49.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Yes, that's fine.

32:49.534 --> 32:52.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WALLACE: And I would like to
ask you this direct question.

32:52.904 --> 32:56.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The top national security
officials of this country do
believe that Russia has been
behind

32:56.141 --> 32:59.344 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these hacks.

32:59.344 --> 33:03.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even if you don't know for sure
whether they are, do you condemn
any interference by Russia

33:03.982 --> 33:05.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the American election?

33:05.217 --> 33:07.452 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
TRUMP: By Russia
or anybody else.

33:07.452 --> 33:08.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: You condemn
their interference?

33:08.420 --> 33:10.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Of course I condemn.

33:10.622 --> 33:10.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: I know more about
ISIS than the generals,

33:10.255 --> 33:12.924 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
believe me.

33:12.924 --> 33:12.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: I have
sat at that table in the
Situation

33:12.157 --> 33:14.526 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Room.

33:14.526 --> 33:15.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Nobody knows the
system better than me. I alone
can fix it.

33:15.894 --> 33:15.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I'm
going to close my campaign
focused on opportunities for
kids

33:15.493 --> 33:17.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and fairness for families.

33:17.596 --> 33:18.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Hillary failed on
the economy. Everything she
touched didn't work out.

33:18.697 --> 33:18.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Even if
you're totally opposed to Donald
Trump, you may still have

33:18.396 --> 33:20.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some questions about me.

33:20.498 --> 33:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff. Gwen Ifill is
away tonight.

33:22.000 --> 33:21.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Welcome to this "PBS NewsHour"
special coverage of the final
presidential debate between
Democrat

33:21.867 --> 33:23.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hillary Clinton and
Republican Donald Trump.

33:23.635 --> 33:25.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The stage is set at the
University of Nevada, Las Vegas,
at a time when the most recent

33:25.003 --> 33:25.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
polls, both national and in
battleground states, show a
surge in support for Clinton,
while

33:25.737 --> 33:26.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump's numbers have been
slipping, especially since the
release of the 2005 video where

33:26.504 --> 33:27.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's heard using lewd language,
boasting about being sexually
aggressive.

33:27.806 --> 33:28.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The debate moderator, Chris
Wallace of FOX News, announced
ahead of time that there will

33:28.740 --> 33:29.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be six topics tonight, not
necessarily in this order, debt
and entitlement, immigration,

33:29.507 --> 33:30.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the economy, the Supreme Court,
foreign hot spots, and fitness
to be president.

33:30.742 --> 33:31.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To watch it all, joining me here
at this table in Washington, our
regular "NewsHour" contributors,

33:31.810 --> 33:31.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
syndicated columnist Mark
Shields, New York Times
columnist David Brooks, and Amy
Walter

33:31.576 --> 33:33.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of The Cook Political Report.

33:33.378 --> 33:33.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we're at the third one. And
it will all be over after this
one.

33:33.879 --> 33:34.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
David, do you expect
them to go high or low?

33:34.846 --> 33:35.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: You promise
it will be over?

33:35.247 --> 33:37.148 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

33:37.148 --> 33:38.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: No, I expect her
to go high, him to go low.

33:38.750 --> 33:39.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's behind, and so he's got to
try some desperate move. And the
trick for her will be to see

33:39.818 --> 33:40.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if she can be strong enough to
rebut whatever he says, while
still projecting some sense

33:40.018 --> 33:41.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of positivity that will
attract some people to her.

33:41.620 --> 33:42.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My big question, though, for the
country is, do we want to take a
shower after this is

33:42.120 --> 33:42.754 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over? Will we feel better
about our country or worse?

33:42.754 --> 33:44.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Low
or high, Mark?

33:44.756 --> 33:46.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think Donald
Trump won the nomination going
away and prevailed in the

33:46.024 --> 33:46.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
debates by exposing and playing
to the vulnerabilities and
perceived weaknesses of his
opponents.

33:46.825 --> 33:47.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has to have concluded after
-- and he rattled them. And he
bullied them. And he has to have

33:47.959 --> 33:48.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concluded, after two debates,
that that hasn't worked with
Hillary Clinton. After 26
debates

33:48.927 --> 33:49.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Barack Obama, she's far
more formidable than anybody he
faced in the Republican
primaries.

33:49.461 --> 33:49.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't know. I think he's
just going to throw everything
today.

33:49.427 --> 33:51.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy?

33:51.663 --> 33:51.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: And that's the challenge
for the third debate

33:51.162 --> 33:53.765 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
too.

33:53.765 --> 33:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Your home always told, you never
get a second chance to make a
good first impression. His

33:54.833 --> 33:56.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first debate performance, I
think, in many ways sealed the
fate of his entire candidacy.

33:56.034 --> 33:56.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, he can try to come back in
the third debate and go after
Hillary Clinton more
aggressively.

33:56.835 --> 33:57.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I don't know that that's
going to make much of a
difference, although this is
what

33:57.736 --> 33:58.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a Republican strategist told me
he needs to do tonight. He just
put in all caps, "E-mails,

33:58.970 --> 33:58.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
foundation, failed record,
e-mails, foundation, failed
record, e-mails, foundation,
failed

33:58.169 --> 34:00.205 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
record."

34:00.205 --> 34:01.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is, I think, what you're
going to hear from Donald Trump.

34:01.806 --> 34:02.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: Good evening from the
Thomas and Mack Center at the
University of Nevada, Las

34:02.707 --> 34:03.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Vegas. I'm Chris Wallace of Fox
News, and I welcome you to the
third and final of the

34:03.975 --> 34:05.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2016 presidential debates
between Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton and Donald J.
Trump.

34:05.010 --> 34:05.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: This debate is
sponsored by the Commission on
Presidential Debates. The
commission has

34:05.644 --> 34:06.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
designed the format: Six roughly
15-minute segments with
two-minute answers to the first

34:06.811 --> 34:06.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
question, then open discussion
for the rest of each segment.
Both campaigns have agreed

34:06.311 --> 34:08.847 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to those rules.

34:08.847 --> 34:09.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the record, I decided the
topics and the questions in each
topic. None of those questions

34:09.748 --> 34:10.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
has been shared with the
commission or the two
candidates. The audience here in
the hall

34:10.782 --> 34:10.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has promised to remain silent.
No cheers, boos, or other
interruptions so we and you

34:10.949 --> 34:12.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can focus on what the
candidates have to say.

34:12.884 --> 34:13.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALLACE: No noise, except right
now, as we welcome the
Democratic nominee for
president,

34:13.551 --> 34:13.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Clinton, and the
Republican nominee for
president, Mr. Trump.

34:13.285 --> 34:15.854 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

34:15.854 --> 34:15.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump,
welcome. Let's get right to it.
The first topic is the Supreme

34:15.220 --> 34:17.722 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Court.

34:17.722 --> 34:18.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You both talked briefly about
the court in the last debate,
but I want to drill down

34:18.990 --> 34:18.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on this, because the next
president will almost certainly
have at least one appointment
and

34:18.990 --> 34:20.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
likely or possibly two
or three appointments.

34:20.892 --> 34:20.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: Which means that you
will, in effect, determine the
balance of the court for what

34:20.759 --> 34:22.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
could be the next
quarter century.

34:22.794 --> 34:23.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First of all, where do you want
to see the court take the
country? And secondly, what's

34:23.929 --> 34:25.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
your view on how the
Constitution should be
interpreted? Do the founders'
words mean what

34:25.030 --> 34:25.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they say or is it a living
document to be applied flexibly
according to changing
circumstances?

34:25.497 --> 34:26.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In this segment, Secretary
Clinton, you go first. You have
two minutes.

34:26.598 --> 34:27.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Thank you very much,
Chris. And thanks to UNLV for
hosting us.

34:27.832 --> 34:28.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, I think when we talk
about the Supreme Court, it
really raises the central issue

34:28.867 --> 34:29.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this election, namely, what
kind of country are we going to
be? What kind of opportunities

34:29.567 --> 34:30.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
will we provide for our
citizens? What kind of rights
will Americans have?

34:30.669 --> 34:32.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I feel strongly that the
Supreme Court needs to stand on
the side of the American

34:32.037 --> 34:32.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people, not on the side of the
powerful corporations and the
wealthy. For me, that means that
we

34:32.737 --> 34:33.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need a Supreme Court that will
stand up on behalf of women's
rights, on behalf of the

34:33.838 --> 34:34.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rights of the LGBT community,
that will stand up and say no to
Citizens United, a decision

34:34.639 --> 34:35.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that has undermined the election
system in our country because of
the way it permits

34:35.206 --> 34:36.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dark, unaccountable money to
come into our electoral system.

34:36.708 --> 34:37.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have major disagreements with
my opponent about these issues
and others that will be

34:37.742 --> 34:38.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
before the Supreme Court. But I
feel that at this point in our
country's history, it

34:38.710 --> 34:39.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is important that we not reverse
marriage equality, that we not
reverse Roe v. Wade,

34:39.678 --> 34:40.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that we stand up against
Citizens United, we stand up for
the rights of people in the

34:40.679 --> 34:40.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
workplace, that we stand up and
basically say: The Supreme Court
should represent all

34:40.245 --> 34:42.714 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of us.

34:42.714 --> 34:43.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's how I see the court, and
the kind of people that I would
be looking to nominate

34:43.848 --> 34:43.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the court would be in the
great tradition of standing up
to the powerful, standing up

34:43.815 --> 34:45.850 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
on behalf of our
rights as Americans.

34:45.850 --> 34:46.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I look forward to having
that opportunity. I would hope
that the Senate would do its

34:46.685 --> 34:47.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
job and confirm the nominee that
President Obama has sent to
them. That's the way the

34:47.852 --> 34:48.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Constitution fundamentally
should operate. The president
nominates, and then the Senate

34:48.453 --> 34:48.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
advises and consents, or not,
but they go forward with the
process.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Secretary
Clinton, thank you.

34:50.722 --> 34:51.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Mr. Trump, same
question. Where do you want to
see the court take the country?

34:51.423 --> 34:52.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And how do you believe the
Constitution should be
interpreted?

34:52.824 --> 34:53.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, first of all, it's
great to be with you, and thank
you, everybody. The Supreme

34:53.725 --> 34:53.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Court: It's what it's all about.
Our country is so, so -- it's
just so imperative that

34:53.625 --> 34:55.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we have the right justices.

34:55.694 --> 34:56.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Something happened recently
where Justice Ginsburg made some
very, very inappropriate

34:56.895 --> 34:58.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
statements toward me and toward
a tremendous number of people,
many, many millions of people

34:58.063 --> 34:57.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that I represent. And she was
forced to apologize. And
apologize she did. But these
were statements

34:57.929 --> 34:59.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that should never,
ever have been made.

34:59.831 --> 35:00.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need a Supreme Court that in
my opinion is going to uphold
the Second Amendment, and

35:00.832 --> 35:01.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all amendments, but the Second
Amendment, which is under
absolute siege. I believe if

35:01.800 --> 35:02.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my opponent should win this
race, which I truly don't think
will happen, we will have

35:02.834 --> 35:03.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a Second Amendment which will be
a very, very small replica of
what it is right now. But

35:03.835 --> 35:03.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I feel that it's absolutely
important that we uphold,
because of the fact that it is

35:03.468 --> 35:05.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
under such trauma.

35:05.704 --> 35:06.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I feel that the justices that I
am going to appoint -- and I've
named 20 of them -- the

35:06.871 --> 35:07.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
justices that I'm going to
appoint will be pro-life. They
will have a conservative bent.

35:07.806 --> 35:08.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will be protecting the
Second Amendment. They are great
scholars in all cases, and

35:08.707 --> 35:09.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're people of tremendous
respect. They will interpret the
Constitution the way the

35:09.541 --> 35:10.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
founders wanted it interpreted.
And I believe that's very, very
important.

35:10.875 --> 35:11.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think we should have
justices appointed that decide
what they want to hear. It's all

35:11.710 --> 35:12.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the Constitution of -- of
-- and so important, the
Constitution the way it was

35:12.277 --> 35:12.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
meant to be. And those are the
people that I will appoint.

35:12.677 --> 35:14.779 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALLACE: Mr. Trump, thank you.

35:14.779 --> 35:15.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: We now have about 10
minutes for an open discussion.
I want to focus on two

35:15.714 --> 35:16.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issues that, in fact, by the
justices that you name could end
up changing the existing

35:16.748 --> 35:17.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
law of the land. First is one
that you mentioned, Mr. Trump,
and that is guns.

35:17.749 --> 35:18.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Clinton, you said last
year, let me quote, "The Supreme
Court is wrong on the

35:18.883 --> 35:19.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Second Amendment." And now, in
fact, in the 2008 Heller case,
the court ruled that there

35:19.851 --> 35:20.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a constitutional right to
bear arms, but a right that is
reasonably limited. Those

35:20.852 --> 35:20.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were the words of the Judge
Antonin Scalia who wrote the
decision. What's wrong with

35:20.285 --> 35:22.387 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that?

35:22.387 --> 35:23.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CONTENT FROM PHILIPS
Patient-centered healthcare is
coming

35:23.922 --> 35:24.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Discover how value-based care
can lead to greater efficiency
and better patient outcomes.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, first of all, I
support the Second Amendment. I
lived in Arkansas for

35:26.024 --> 35:26.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
18 wonderful years. I
represented upstate New York. I
understand and respect the
tradition

35:26.291 --> 35:27.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of gun ownership. It goes back
to the founding of our country.

35:27.959 --> 35:28.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I also believe that there
can be and must be reasonable
regulation. Because I support

35:28.893 --> 35:29.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Second Amendment doesn't
mean that I want people who
shouldn't have guns to be able

35:29.194 --> 35:30.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to threaten you, kill you
or members of your family.

35:30.895 --> 35:31.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so when I think about what
we need to do, we have 33,000
people a year who die from

35:31.930 --> 35:32.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
guns. I think we need
comprehensive background checks,
need to close the online
loophole,

35:32.864 --> 35:33.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
close the gun show loophole.
There's other matters that I
think are sensible that are

35:33.932 --> 35:33.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the kind of reforms that would
make a difference that are not
in any way conflicting with the

35:33.498 --> 35:35.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Second Amendment.

35:35.734 --> 35:36.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You mentioned the Heller
decision. And what I was saying
that you referenced, Chris, was

35:36.901 --> 35:37.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that I disagreed with the way
the court applied the Second
Amendment in that case, because

35:37.869 --> 35:38.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what the District of Columbia
was trying to do was to protect
toddlers from guns and so

35:38.903 --> 35:39.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they wanted people with guns to
safely store them. And the court
didn't accept that reasonable

35:39.738 --> 35:40.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regulation, but they've accepted
many others. So I see no
conflict between saving people's

35:40.038 --> 35:41.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lives and defending
the Second Amendment.

35:41.906 --> 35:42.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: Let me bring Mr. Trump
in here. The bipartisan Open
Debate Coalition got millions

35:42.841 --> 35:44.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of votes on questions to ask
here, and this was, in fact, one
of the top questions that

35:44.209 --> 35:44.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they got. How will you ensure
the Second Amendment is
protected? You just heard
Secretary Clinton's

35:44.876 --> 35:45.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
answer. Does she persuade you
that, while you may disagree on
regulation, that, in fact,

35:45.877 --> 35:46.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she supports a Second Amendment
right to bear arms? TRUMP: Well,
the D.C. vs. Heller decision

35:46.745 --> 35:48.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was very strongly -- and she was
extremely angry about it. I
watched. I mean, she was

35:48.113 --> 35:49.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very, very angry when upheld.
And Justice Scalia was so
involved. And it was a
well-crafted

35:49.014 --> 35:49.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decision. But Hillary was
extremely upset, extremely
angry. And people that believe
in

35:49.781 --> 35:49.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Second Amendment and believe
in it very strongly were very
upset with what she had

35:49.280 --> 35:51.649 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to say.

35:51.649 --> 35:53.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: Well, let me bring in
Secretary Clinton. Were you
extremely upset?

35:53.118 --> 35:53.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, I was upset
because, unfortunately, dozens
of toddlers injure themselves,
even

35:53.752 --> 35:53.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kill people with guns, because,
unfortunately, not everyone who
has loaded guns in their

35:53.885 --> 35:55.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
homes takes appropriate
precautions.

35:55.954 --> 35:57.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there's no doubt that I
respect the Second Amendment,
that I also believe there's an

35:57.155 --> 35:58.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
individual right to bear arms.
That is not in conflict with
sensible, commonsense
regulation.

35:58.056 --> 35:58.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, you know, look, I
understand that Donald's been
strongly supported by the NRA.
The gun

35:58.923 --> 35:59.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lobby's on his side. They're
running millions of dollars of
ads against me. And I regret

35:59.891 --> 36:00.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, because what I would like
to see is for people to come
together and say: Of course

36:00.892 --> 36:01.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're going to protect and
defend the Second Amendment. But
we're going to do it in a way

36:01.526 --> 36:02.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that tries to save some of these
33,000 lives that we lose every
year.

36:02.894 --> 36:03.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: Let me bring Mr. Trump
back into this, because, in
fact, you oppose any limits

36:03.928 --> 36:03.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on assault weapons, any limits
on high- capacity magazines. You
support a national right to

36:03.561 --> 36:05.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
carry law. Why, sir?

36:05.830 --> 36:07.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, let me just tell
you before we go any further. In
Chicago, which has the

36:07.098 --> 36:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
toughest gun laws in the United
States, probably you could say
by far, they have more gun
violence

36:07.766 --> 36:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than any other city. So we have
the toughest laws, and you have
tremendous gun violence.

36:08.900 --> 36:09.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am a very strong supporter of
the Second Amendment. And I am
-- I don't know if Hillary

36:09.934 --> 36:11.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was saying it in a sarcastic
manner, but I'm very proud to
have the endorsement of the

36:11.102 --> 36:10.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NRA. And it's the earliest
endorsement they've ever given
to anybody who ran for
president.

36:10.902 --> 36:12.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So I'm very honored
by all of that.

36:12.804 --> 36:13.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are going to appoint justices
-- this is the best way to help
the Second Amendment.

36:13.905 --> 36:14.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are going to appoint justices
that will feel very strongly
about the Second Amendment,

36:14.039 --> 36:15.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that will not do damage
to the Second Amendment.

36:15.940 --> 36:16.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: Well, let's pick up on
another issue which divides you
and the justices that whoever

36:16.975 --> 36:16.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ends up winning this election
appoints could have a dramatic
effect there, and that's the

36:16.541 --> 36:17.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
issue of abortion.

36:17.475 --> 36:19.844 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRUMP: Right.

36:19.844 --> 36:20.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: Mr. Trump, you're
pro-life. But I want to ask you
specifically: Do you want

36:20.779 --> 36:21.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the court, including the
justices that you will name, to
overturn Roe v. Wade, which

36:21.346 --> 36:22.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
includes -- in fact, states --
a woman's right to abortion?

36:22.981 --> 36:23.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, if that would
happen, because I am pro-life,
and I will be appointing
pro-life

36:23.548 --> 36:24.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
judges, I would think that that
will go back to the individual
states.

36:24.549 --> 36:25.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: But I'm asking you
specifically. Would you like
to...

36:25.383 --> 36:26.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: If they overturned it,
it will go back to the states.

36:26.885 --> 36:28.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: But what I'm asking
you, sir, is, do you want to see
the court overturn -- you

36:28.053 --> 36:27.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just said you want to see the
court protect the Second
Amendment. Do you want to see
the

36:27.719 --> 36:29.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
court overturn Roe v. Wade?

36:29.921 --> 36:30.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, if we put another
two or perhaps three justice on,
that's really what's going

36:30.822 --> 36:31.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be -- that will happen. And
that'll happen automatically, in
my opinion, because I am

36:31.823 --> 36:32.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
putting pro-life justices on the
court. I will say this: It will
go back to the states,

36:32.090 --> 36:32.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the states will then
make a determination.

36:32.724 --> 36:35.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?

36:35.060 --> 36:36.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, I strongly
support Roe v. Wade, which
guarantees a constitutional
right to

36:36.027 --> 36:36.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a woman to make the most
intimate, most difficult, in
many cases, decisions about her
health

36:36.995 --> 36:36.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care that one can imagine. And
in this case, it's not only
about Roe v. Wade. It is about

36:36.961 --> 36:38.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what's happening right
now in America.

36:38.830 --> 36:39.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So many states are putting very
stringent regulations on women
that block them from

36:39.964 --> 36:41.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exercising that choice to the
extent that they are defunding
Planned Parenthood, which,

36:41.099 --> 36:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of course, provides all kinds of
cancer screenings and other
benefits for women in our
country.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald has said he's in favor of
defunding Planned Parenthood. He
even supported shutting

36:43.268 --> 36:43.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the government down to defund
Planned Parenthood. I will
defend Planned Parenthood. I
will defend

36:43.868 --> 36:45.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Roe v. Wade, and I will defend
women's rights to make their own
health care decisions.

36:45.003 --> 36:45.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton...
CLINTON: And we have come too
far to have that turned back

36:45.870 --> 36:46.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now. And, indeed, he said women
should be punished, that there
should be some form of

36:46.805 --> 36:46.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
punishment for women who obtain
abortions. And I could just not
be more opposed to that

36:46.571 --> 36:48.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
kind of thinking.

36:48.773 --> 36:49.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: I'm going to give you a
chance to respond, but I want to
ask you, Secretary

36:49.974 --> 36:51.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton, I want to explore how
far you believe the right to
abortion goes. You have been

36:51.276 --> 36:50.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quoted as saying that the fetus
has no constitutional rights.
You also voted against a ban on
late-term,

36:50.775 --> 36:52.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
partial-birth abortions. Why?

36:52.844 --> 36:53.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Because Roe v. Wade
very clearly sets out that there
can be regulations on

36:53.812 --> 36:54.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
abortion so long as the life and
the health of the mother are
taken into account. And

36:54.579 --> 36:55.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when I voted as a senator, I did
not think that that was the
case.

36:55.847 --> 36:56.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The kinds of cases that fall at
the end of pregnancy are often
the most heartbreaking,

36:56.915 --> 36:58.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
painful decisions for families
to make. I have met with women
who toward the end of

36:58.049 --> 36:58.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their pregnancy get the worst
news one could get, that their
health is in jeopardy if they

36:58.950 --> 37:00.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
continue to carry to term or
that something terrible has
happened or just been discovered

37:00.051 --> 37:00.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the pregnancy. I do not
think the United States
government should be stepping in
and

37:00.885 --> 37:01.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
making those most personal of
decisions. So you can regulate
if you are doing so with

37:01.352 --> 37:03.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the life and the health of the
mother taken into account.

37:03.088 --> 37:02.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Mr. Trump, your
reaction? And particularly on
this issue of late-term,
partial-birth

37:02.454 --> 37:04.956 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
abortions.

37:04.956 --> 37:05.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, I think it's
terrible. If you go with what
Hillary is saying, in the ninth

37:05.824 --> 37:05.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
month, you can take the baby and
rip the baby out of the womb of
the mother just prior to

37:05.657 --> 37:07.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the birth of the baby.

37:07.826 --> 37:08.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, you can say that that's OK
and Hillary can say that that's
OK. But it's not OK with

37:08.860 --> 37:09.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me, because based on what she's
saying, and based on where she's
going, and where she's

37:09.861 --> 37:09.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been, you can take the baby and
rip the baby out of the womb in
the ninth month on the

37:09.994 --> 37:11.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
final day. And that's
not acceptable.

37:11.830 --> 37:12.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, that is not what
happens in these cases. And
using that kind of scare

37:12.964 --> 37:13.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rhetoric is just terribly
unfortunate. You should meet
with some of the women that I

37:13.998 --> 37:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have met with, women I have
known over the course of my
life. This is one of the worst

37:14.966 --> 37:14.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
possible choices that any woman
and her family has to make. And
I do not believe the government

37:14.632 --> 37:17.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
should be making it.

37:17.001 --> 37:17.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, I've had the great
honor of traveling across the
world on behalf of our country.

37:17.969 --> 37:19.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I've been to countries where
governments either forced women
to have abortions, like they

37:19.003 --> 37:19.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
used to do in China, or forced
women to bear children, like
they used to do in Romania.

37:19.904 --> 37:21.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I can tell you: The
government has no business in
the decisions that women make

37:21.106 --> 37:20.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with their families in
accordance with their faith,
with medical advice. And I will
stand

37:20.605 --> 37:22.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
up for that right.

37:22.841 --> 37:23.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: All right. But just
briefly, I want to move on to
another segment...

37:23.842 --> 37:24.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: And, honestly, nobody has
business doing what I just said,
doing that, as late

37:24.642 --> 37:26.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as one or two or three or four
days prior to birth. Nobody has
that.

37:26.077 --> 37:26.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALLACE: All right. Let's move
on to the subject of
immigration. And there is almost
no issue

37:26.911 --> 37:27.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that separates the two of you
more than the issue of
immigration. Actually, there are

37:27.112 --> 37:29.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a lot of issues that
separate the two of you.

37:29.047 --> 37:30.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump, you want to build a
wall. Secretary Clinton, you
have offered no specific plan

37:30.281 --> 37:30.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for how you want to secure our
southern border. Mr. Trump, you
are calling for major
deportations.

37:30.982 --> 37:31.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Clinton, you say that
within your first 100 days as
president you're going to

37:31.950 --> 37:32.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
offer a package that includes a
pathway to citizenship. The
question, really, is, why

37:32.083 --> 37:33.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are you right and
your opponent wrong?

37:33.418 --> 37:34.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Trump, you go first in this
segment. You have two minutes.

37:34.986 --> 37:36.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, first of all, she
wants to give amnesty, which is
a disaster and very unfair

37:36.087 --> 37:36.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to all of the people that are
waiting on line for many, many
years. We need strong borders.

37:36.855 --> 37:37.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the audience tonight, we have
four mothers of -- I mean, these
are unbelievable people

37:37.989 --> 37:38.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that I've gotten to know over a
period of years whose children
have been killed, brutally

37:38.857 --> 37:40.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
killed by people that came into
the country illegally. You have
thousands of mothers and

37:40.058 --> 37:40.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fathers and relatives all over
the country. They're coming in
illegally. Drugs are pouring

37:40.425 --> 37:41.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in through the border. We have
no country if we have no border.

37:41.993 --> 37:42.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary wants to give amnesty.
She wants to have open borders.
The border -- as you know,

37:42.927 --> 37:43.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Border Patrol agents,
16,500-plus ICE last week,
endorsed me. First time they've

37:43.928 --> 37:44.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ever endorsed a candidate. It
means their job is tougher. But
they know what's going

37:44.996 --> 37:44.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on. They know it better than
anybody. They want strong
borders. They feel we have to

37:44.662 --> 37:46.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have strong borders.

37:46.998 --> 37:47.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was up in New Hampshire the
other day. The biggest complaint
they have -- it's with all

37:47.966 --> 37:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the problems going on in the
world, many of the problems
caused by Hillary Clinton

37:49.033 --> 37:50.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and by Barack Obama. All of the
problems -- the single biggest
problem is heroin that pours

37:50.001 --> 37:50.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
across our southern border. It's
just pouring and destroying
their youth. It's poisoning

37:50.969 --> 37:52.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the blood of their youth and
plenty of other people. We have
to have strong borders. We

37:52.070 --> 37:53.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have to keep the drugs out of
our country. We are -- right
now, we're getting the drugs,

37:53.171 --> 37:53.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're getting the cash. We
need strong borders. We need
absolute -- we cannot give
amnesty.

37:53.938 --> 37:55.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, I want to build the wall.
We need the wall. And the Border
Patrol, ICE, they all

37:55.006 --> 37:56.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want the wall. We stop the
drugs. We shore up the border.
One of my first acts will be

37:56.074 --> 37:57.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get all of the drug lords,
all of the bad ones -- we have
some bad, bad people in this

37:57.175 --> 37:57.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country that have to go out.
We're going to get them out;
we're going to secure the
border.

37:57.909 --> 37:58.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And once the border is secured,
at a later date, we'll make a
determination as to the

37:58.743 --> 37:59.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rest. But we have some bad
hombres here, and we're going to
get them out.

37:59.911 --> 38:00.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: Mr. Trump, thank you.
Same question to you, Secretary
Clinton. Basically, why

38:00.111 --> 38:02.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are you right and
Mr. Trump is wrong?

38:02.113 --> 38:02.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Well, as he was
talking, I was thinking about a
young girl I met here in Las
Vegas,

38:02.914 --> 38:03.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Carla, who is very worried that
her parents might be deported,
because she was born in

38:03.882 --> 38:03.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this country but they were not.
They work hard, they do
everything they can to give

38:03.548 --> 38:06.050 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
her a good life.

38:06.050 --> 38:07.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you're right. I don't want
to rip families apart. I don't
want to be sending parents

38:07.018 --> 38:06.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
away from children. I don't want
to see the deportation force
that Donald has talked about

38:06.784 --> 38:08.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in action in our country.

38:08.987 --> 38:10.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have 11 million undocumented
people. They have 4 million
American citizen children,

38:10.088 --> 38:11.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
15 million people. He said as
recently as a few weeks ago in
Phoenix that every undocumented

38:11.055 --> 38:12.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
person would be subject to
deportation. Now, here's what
that means. It means you would

38:12.257 --> 38:13.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to have a massive law
enforcement presence, where law
enforcement officers would be
going

38:13.057 --> 38:13.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
school to school, home to home,
business to business, rounding
up people who are undocumented.

38:13.925 --> 38:15.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we would then have to put
them on trains, on buses to get
them out of our country.

38:15.026 --> 38:15.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that is an idea that is
not in keeping with who we are
as a nation. I think it's

38:15.160 --> 38:16.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an idea that would rip
our country apart.

38:16.961 --> 38:18.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have been for border security
for years. I voted for border
security in the United

38:18.263 --> 38:19.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
States Senate. And my
comprehensive immigration reform
plan of course includes border
security.

38:19.164 --> 38:19.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I want to put our resources
where I think they're most
needed: Getting rid of any
violent

38:19.464 --> 38:20.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
person. Anybody who should be
deported, we should deport them.

38:20.965 --> 38:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When it comes to the wall that
Donald talks about building, he
went to Mexico, he had

38:22.000 --> 38:22.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a meeting with the Mexican
president. Didn't even raise it.
He choked and then got into

38:22.901 --> 38:24.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a Twitter war because the
Mexican president said we're not
paying for that wall.

38:24.035 --> 38:25.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think we are both a nation
of immigrants and we are a
nation of laws and that we can

38:25.103 --> 38:25.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
act accordingly. And that's why
I'm introducing comprehensive
immigration reform within the

38:25.170 --> 38:26.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
first 100 days with the
path to citizenship.

38:26.471 --> 38:26.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WALLACE: Thank you, Secretary
Clinton. I want to follow up...

38:26.871 --> 38:27.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Chris, I think it's...

38:27.572 --> 38:30.041 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WALLACE: OK.

38:30.041 --> 38:31.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: I think I should respond
to that. First of all, I had a
very good meeting with the

38:31.075 --> 38:32.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president of Mexico. Very nice
man. We will be doing very much
better with Mexico on trade

38:32.076 --> 38:32.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deals. Believe me. The NAFTA
deal signed by her husband is
one of the worst deals ever

38:32.410 --> 38:34.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
made of any kind, signed by
anybody. It's a disaster.

38:34.078 --> 38:35.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.
Hillary Clinton fought for the
wall in 2006 or thereabouts.

38:35.213 --> 38:34.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, she never gets anything
done, so naturally the wall
wasn't built. But Hillary
Clinton

38:34.579 --> 38:36.281 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wanted the wall.

38:36.281 --> 38:37.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Well, let me --
wait, wait, sir, let me...

38:37.682 --> 38:38.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: We are a country of laws.
We either have -- and by the
way...

38:38.183 --> 38:39.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Now, wait. I'd
like to hear from...

38:39.184 --> 38:40.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Well -- well, but
she said one thing.

38:40.652 --> 38:41.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: I'd like to hear -- I'd
like to hear from Secretary
Clinton.

38:41.419 --> 38:41.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: I voted for border
security, and there are...

38:41.719 --> 38:44.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: And the wall.

38:44.255 --> 38:44.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLINTON: There are some limited
places where that was
appropriate. There also is
necessarily

38:44.422 --> 38:46.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to be new technology
and how best to deploy that.

38:46.124 --> 38:47.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it is clear, when you look
at what Donald has been
proposing, he started his
campaign

38:47.091 --> 38:47.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bashing immigrants, calling
Mexican immigrants rapists and
criminals and drug dealers, that

38:47.792 --> 38:49.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he has a very different view
about what we should do to deal
with immigrants.

38:49.060 --> 38:49.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, what I am also arguing is
that bringing undocumented
immigrants out from the shadows

38:49.861 --> 38:50.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
putting them into the economy
will be good, because employers
can't exploit

38:50.128 --> 38:52.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
them and undercut
Americans' wages.

38:52.030 --> 38:53.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Donald knows a lot about
this. He used undocumented labor
to build the Trump Tower.

38:53.198 --> 38:53.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He underpaid undocumented
workers, and when they
complained, he basically said
what a

38:53.631 --> 38:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lot of employers do: "You
complain, I'll get you
deported."

38:55.133 --> 38:55.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to get everybody out of
the shadows, get the economy
working, and not let employers

38:55.967 --> 38:55.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like Donald exploit undocumented
workers, which hurts them, but
also hurts American

38:55.466 --> 38:56.734 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
workers.

38:56.734 --> 38:59.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Mr. Trump?

38:59.003 --> 39:00.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: President Obama has moved
millions of people out. Nobody
knows about it, nobody

39:00.038 --> 39:01.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talks about it. But under Obama,
millions of people have been
moved out of this country.

39:01.072 --> 39:00.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They've been deported. She
doesn't want to say that, but
that's what's happened, and

39:00.872 --> 39:03.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that's what happened big league.

39:03.107 --> 39:03.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As far as moving these people
out and moving -- we either have
a country or we don't. We're

39:03.441 --> 39:05.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a country of laws. We either
have a border or we don't.

39:05.310 --> 39:06.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, you can come back in and
you can become a citizen. But
it's very unfair. We have
millions

39:06.144 --> 39:07.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of people that did it the right
way. They're on line. They're
waiting. We're going to speed

39:07.111 --> 39:06.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up the process, big league,
because it's very inefficient.
But they're on line and they're

39:06.878 --> 39:08.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
waiting to become citizens.

39:08.980 --> 39:10.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Very unfair that somebody runs
across the border, becomes a
citizen, under her plan,

39:10.148 --> 39:09.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you have open borders. You would
have a disaster on trade, and
you will have a disaster with

39:09.714 --> 39:10.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
your open borders.

39:10.782 --> 39:13.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: I want to...

39:13.284 --> 39:12.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRUMP: But what she doesn't say
is that President Obama has
deported millions and millions
of

39:12.850 --> 39:14.219 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people just the way it is.

39:14.219 --> 39:15.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Secretary
Clinton, I want to...

39:15.320 --> 39:16.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: We will not have
open borders. That is...

39:16.154 --> 39:17.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Well, let
me -- Secretary...

39:17.222 --> 39:17.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: That is a rank
mischaracterization.

39:17.922 --> 39:20.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton...

39:20.091 --> 39:20.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: We will have secure
borders, but we'll also have
reform. And this used to be

39:20.458 --> 39:21.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a bipartisan issue. Ronald
Reagan was the last president...

39:21.526 --> 39:22.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton,
excuse me. Secretary Clinton.

39:22.961 --> 39:24.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: ... to sign immigration
reform, and George W. Bush
supported it, as well.

39:24.128 --> 39:24.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, I
want to clear up your position
on this issue, because in

39:24.996 --> 39:26.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a speech you gave to a Brazilian
bank, for which you were paid
$225,000, we've learned

39:26.064 --> 39:26.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the WikiLeaks, that you
said this, and I want to quote.
"My dream is a hemispheric

39:26.864 --> 39:26.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
common market with open trade
and open borders." So that's the
question...

39:26.731 --> 39:29.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Thank you.

39:29.100 --> 39:29.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: That's the question.
Please quiet, everybody. Is that
your dream, open borders?

39:29.934 --> 39:31.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, if you went on to
read the rest of the sentence, I
was talking about

39:31.035 --> 39:32.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
energy. You know, we trade more
energy with our neighbors than
we trade with the rest

39:32.103 --> 39:32.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the world combined. And I do
want us to have an electric
grid, an energy system that

39:32.537 --> 39:34.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
crosses borders. I think that
would be a great benefit to us.

39:34.072 --> 39:35.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you are very clearly quoting
from WikiLeaks. And what's
really important about WikiLeaks

39:35.006 --> 39:36.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is that the Russian government
has engaged in espionage against
Americans. They have

39:36.307 --> 39:37.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hacked American websites,
American accounts of private
people, of institutions. Then
they

39:37.141 --> 39:38.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have given that information to
WikiLeaks for the purpose of
putting it on the Internet.

39:38.243 --> 39:39.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This has come from the highest
levels of the Russian
government, clearly, from Putin
himself,

39:39.344 --> 39:40.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in an effort, as 17 of our
intelligence agencies have
confirmed, to influence our
election.

39:40.111 --> 39:41.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: So I actually think the
most important question of this
evening, Chris, is, finally,

39:41.145 --> 39:42.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will Donald Trump admit and
condemn that the Russians are
doing this and make it clear

39:42.046 --> 39:43.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he will not have the help
of Putin in in this election,
that he rejects Russian

39:43.281 --> 39:44.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
espionage against Americans,
which he actually encouraged in
the past? Those are the
questions

39:44.148 --> 39:43.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we need answered. We've never
had anything like this happen in
any of our elections before.

39:43.681 --> 39:46.017 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WALLACE: Well?

39:46.017 --> 39:45.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: That was a great pivot
off the fact that she wants open
borders, OK? How did we

39:45.650 --> 39:47.986 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
get on to Putin?

39:47.986 --> 39:49.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: Hold on -- hold on,
wait. Hold on, folks. Because we
-- this is going to end

39:49.053 --> 39:48.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up getting out of control. Let's
try to keep it quiet so -- for
the candidates and for

39:48.786 --> 39:50.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the American people.

39:50.221 --> 39:50.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: So just to finish
on the borders...

39:50.688 --> 39:53.057 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WALLACE: Yes?

39:53.057 --> 39:54.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: She wants open borders.
People are going to pour into
our country. People are

39:54.058 --> 39:55.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to come in from Syria. She
wants 550 percent more people
than Barack Obama, and

39:55.059 --> 39:56.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he has thousands and thousands
of people. They have no idea
where they come from.

39:56.127 --> 39:57.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you see, we are going to
stop radical Islamic terrorism
in this country. She won't

39:57.362 --> 39:56.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even mention the words, and
neither will President Obama. So
I just want to tell you, she
wants

39:56.694 --> 39:59.097 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
open borders.

39:59.097 --> 40:00.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now we can talk about Putin. I
don't know Putin. He said nice
things about me. If we

40:00.231 --> 39:59.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got along well, that would be
good. If Russia and the United
States got along well and went

39:59.931 --> 40:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
after ISIS, that would be good.

40:02.300 --> 40:03.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has no respect for her. He
has no respect for our
president. And I'll tell you
what:

40:03.101 --> 40:04.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're in very serious trouble,
because we have a country with
tremendous numbers of

40:04.202 --> 40:04.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by
the way -- where they expanded
and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear

40:04.402 --> 40:04.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
warheads. And she's playing
chicken. Look, Putin...

40:04.836 --> 40:06.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Wait, but...

40:06.738 --> 40:08.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: ... from everything I
see, has no respect for this
person.

40:08.172 --> 40:07.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, that's because
he'd rather have a puppet as
president of the United States.

40:07.939 --> 40:09.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: No puppet. No puppet.

40:09.107 --> 40:09.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: And it's
pretty clear...

40:09.907 --> 40:11.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: You're the puppet!

40:11.276 --> 40:11.976 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: It's pretty
clear you won't admit...

40:11.976 --> 40:14.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: No, you're the puppet.

40:14.145 --> 40:15.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: ... that the Russians
have engaged in cyberattacks
against the United States

40:15.046 --> 40:16.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of America, that you encouraged
espionage against our people,
that you are willing to

40:16.147 --> 40:17.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spout the Putin line, sign up
for his wish list, break up
NATO, do whatever he wants

40:17.148 --> 40:16.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do, and that you continue to
get help from him, because he
has a very clear favorite

40:16.714 --> 40:19.217 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this race.

40:19.217 --> 40:20.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think that this is such an
unprecedented situation. We've
never had a foreign government

40:20.285 --> 40:21.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to interfere in our
election. We have 17 -- 17
intelligence agencies, civilian
and

40:21.052 --> 40:22.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
military, who have all concluded
that these espionage attacks,
these cyberattacks, come

40:22.053 --> 40:21.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the highest levels of the
Kremlin and they are designed to
influence our election.

40:21.986 --> 40:22.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I find that deeply disturbing.

40:22.987 --> 40:24.389 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton...

40:24.389 --> 40:25.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: And I think it's
time you take a stand...

40:25.857 --> 40:26.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: She has no idea whether
it's Russia, China, or anybody
else.

40:26.124 --> 40:26.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: I am not
quoting myself.

40:26.824 --> 40:27.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: She has no idea.

40:27.959 --> 40:29.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON: I am quoting 17...

40:29.127 --> 40:30.895 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
TRUMP: Hillary,
you have no idea.

40:30.895 --> 40:31.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: ... 17 intelligence --
do you doubt 17 military and
civilian...

40:31.195 --> 40:31.863 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
TRUMP: And our
country has no idea.

40:31.863 --> 40:33.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: ... agencies.

40:33.164 --> 40:35.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Yeah, I doubt
it. I doubt it.

40:35.366 --> 40:35.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, he'd rather
believe Vladimir Putin than the
military and civilian
intelligence

40:35.967 --> 40:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
professionals who are sworn to
protect us. I find that just
absolutely...

40:35.700 --> 40:38.169 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

40:38.169 --> 40:37.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: She doesn't like Putin
because Putin has outsmarted her
at every step of the way.

40:37.869 --> 40:39.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Mr. Trump...

40:39.437 --> 40:39.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: Excuse me. Putin has
outsmarted her in Syria.

40:39.871 --> 40:40.705 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Mr. Trump...

40:40.705 --> 40:42.440 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

40:42.440 --> 40:43.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: He's outsmarted her
every step of the way.

40:43.308 --> 40:43.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: I do get to
ask some questions.

40:43.841 --> 40:46.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Yes, that's fine.

40:46.110 --> 40:47.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: And I would like to ask
you this direct question. The
top national security

40:47.178 --> 40:48.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
officials of this country do
believe that Russia has been
behind these hacks. Even if

40:48.079 --> 40:47.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you don't know for sure whether
they are, do you condemn any
interference by Russia

40:47.945 --> 40:49.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the American election?

40:49.047 --> 40:50.315 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
TRUMP: By Russia
or anybody else.

40:50.315 --> 40:51.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: You condemn
their interference?

40:51.949 --> 40:52.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Of course I condemn. Of
course I -- I don't know Putin.
I have no idea.

40:52.517 --> 40:54.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WALLACE: I'm not asking --
I'm asking do you condemn?

40:54.252 --> 40:53.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: I never met Putin. This
is not my best friend. But if
the United States got along

40:53.985 --> 40:56.187 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with Russia, wouldn't be so bad.

40:56.187 --> 40:57.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let me tell you, Putin has
outsmarted her and Obama at
every single step of the way.

40:57.188 --> 40:58.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whether it's Syria, you name it.
Missiles. Take a look at the
"start up" that they signed.

40:58.056 --> 40:59.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Russians have said,
according to many, many reports,
I can't believe they allowed

40:59.190 --> 40:59.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
us to do this. They create
warheads, and we can't. The
Russians can't believe it. She

40:59.023 --> 41:01.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has been outsmarted by Putin.

41:01.492 --> 41:02.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all you have to do is look
at the Middle East. They've
taken over. We've spent $6
trillion.

41:02.260 --> 41:02.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They've taken over the Middle
East. She has been outsmarted
and outplayed worse than anybody

41:02.393 --> 41:04.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I've ever seen in any
government whatsoever.

41:04.262 --> 41:03.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: We're a long way away
from immigration, but I'm going
to let you finish this topic.

41:03.961 --> 41:05.029 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You got about 45 seconds.

41:05.029 --> 41:07.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: And she always will be.

41:07.432 --> 41:07.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLINTON: I -- I find it ironic
that he's raising nuclear
weapons. This is a person who
has

41:07.799 --> 41:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been very cavalier, even casual
about the use of nuclear
weapons. He's...

41:09.033 --> 41:10.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Wrong. CLINTON: ...
advocated more countries getting
them, Japan, Korea, even

41:10.468 --> 41:11.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Saudi Arabia. He said, well, if
we have them, why don't we use
them, which I think is
terrifying.

41:11.202 --> 41:12.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But here's the deal. The bottom
line on nuclear weapons is that
when the president gives the

41:12.203 --> 41:13.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
order, it must be followed.
There's about four minutes
between the order being given

41:13.237 --> 41:14.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the people responsible for
launching nuclear weapons to do
so. And that's why 10 people

41:14.405 --> 41:15.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who have had that awesome
responsibility have come out
and, in an unprecedented way,
said

41:15.173 --> 41:14.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they would not trust Donald
Trump with the nuclear codes or
to have his finger on the

41:14.739 --> 41:16.040 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nuclear button.

41:16.040 --> 41:16.908 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: I have 200 generals...

41:16.908 --> 41:19.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Very quickly.

41:19.210 --> 41:20.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: ... and admirals, 21
endorsing me, 21 congressional
Medal of Honor recipients.

41:20.211 --> 41:21.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As far as Japan and other
countries, we are being ripped
off by everybody in the -- we're

41:21.145 --> 41:20.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
defending other countries. We
are spending a fortune doing it.
They have the bargain

41:20.745 --> 41:23.414 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the century.

41:23.414 --> 41:24.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All I said is, we have to
renegotiate these agreements,
because our country cannot
afford

41:24.282 --> 41:24.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan,
Germany, South Korea, and many
other places. We cannot continue

41:24.549 --> 41:24.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to afford -- she took that
as saying nuclear weapons.

41:24.749 --> 41:27.318 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WALLACE: OK.

41:27.318 --> 41:26.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Look, she's been proven
to be a liar on so many
different ways. This is just
another

41:26.617 --> 41:28.586 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lie.

41:28.586 --> 41:29.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, I'm just quoting
you when you were asked...

41:29.854 --> 41:31.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: There's no quote. You're
not going to find a quote from
me.

41:31.289 --> 41:31.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: ... about a potential
nuclear -- nuclear competition
in Asia, you said, you know, go

41:31.356 --> 41:32.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ahead, enjoy yourselves,
folks. That kind...

41:32.056 --> 41:33.224 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: And defend yourselves.

41:33.224 --> 41:34.959 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
CLINTON: ... of
language -- well...

41:34.959 --> 41:36.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: And defend yourselves. I
didn't say nuclear. And defend
yourself.

41:36.427 --> 41:37.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLINTON: The United States has
kept the peace -- the United
States has kept the peace
through

41:37.161 --> 41:38.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our alliances. Donald wants to
tear up our alliances. I think
it makes the world safer

41:38.396 --> 41:39.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, frankly, it makes the
United States safer. I would
work with our allies in Asia, in
Europe,

41:39.163 --> 41:38.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in the Middle East, and
elsewhere. That's the only way
we're going to be able to keep

41:38.730 --> 41:41.165 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the peace.

41:41.165 --> 41:42.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: We're going to -- no,
we are going to move on to the
next topic, which is the

41:42.166 --> 41:43.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
economy. And I hope we handle
that as well as we did
immigration. You also have very

41:43.201 --> 41:44.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
different ideas about how to get
the economy growing faster.
Secretary Clinton, in your

41:44.268 --> 41:45.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plan, government plays a big
role. You see more government
spending, more entitlements,

41:45.203 --> 41:45.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more tax credits, more tax
penalties. Mr. Trump, you want
to get government out with

41:45.036 --> 41:45.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lower taxes and less regulation.

41:45.770 --> 41:48.506 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRUMP: Yes.

41:48.506 --> 41:49.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALLACE: We're going to drill
down into this a little bit
more. But in this overview,
please

41:49.140 --> 41:50.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
explain to me why you believe
that your plan will create more
jobs and growth for this

41:50.208 --> 41:51.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country and your opponent's plan
will not. In this round, you go
first, Secretary Clinton.

41:51.242 --> 41:52.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, I think when the
middle class thrives, America
thrives. And so my plan is

41:52.443 --> 41:53.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
based on growing the economy,
giving middle-class families
many more opportunities. I want
us

41:53.244 --> 41:54.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to have the biggest jobs program
since World War II, jobs in
infrastructure and advanced

41:54.379 --> 41:55.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
manufacturing. I think we can
compete with high-wage
countries, and I believe we
should.

41:55.313 --> 41:55.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New jobs and clean energy, not
only to fight climate change,
which is a serious problem,

41:55.513 --> 41:57.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but to create new opportunities
and new businesses.

41:57.248 --> 41:58.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want us to do more to help
small business. That's where
two- thirds of the new jobs are

41:58.082 --> 41:59.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to come from. I want us to
raise the national minimum wage,
because people who

41:59.317 --> 41:59.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
live in poverty should not --
who work full-time should not
still be in poverty. And I sure

41:59.717 --> 42:01.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do want to make sure women get
equal pay for the work we do.

42:01.319 --> 42:02.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I feel strongly that we have to
have an education system that
starts with preschool and goes

42:02.320 --> 42:03.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through college. That's why I
want more technical education in
high schools and in community

42:03.187 --> 42:04.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
colleges, real apprenticeships
to prepare young people for the
jobs of the future. I

42:04.288 --> 42:05.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want to make college debt-free
and for families making less
than $125,000, you will not get

42:05.590 --> 42:04.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a tuition bill from a public
college or university if the
plan that I worked on with
Bernie Sanders

42:04.789 --> 42:07.158 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is enacted.

42:07.158 --> 42:08.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're going to work hard to
make sure that it is, because we
are going to go where

42:08.226 --> 42:09.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the money is. Most of the gains
in the last years since the
Great Recession have gone

42:09.160 --> 42:10.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the very top. So we are going
to have the wealthy pay their
fair share. We're going

42:10.161 --> 42:11.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to have corporations make a
contribution greater than they
are now to our country.

42:11.429 --> 42:12.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is a plan that has been
analyzed by independent experts
which said that it could produce
10

42:12.263 --> 42:13.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
million new jobs. By contrast,
Donald's plan has been analyzed
to conclude it might lose

42:13.331 --> 42:14.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
3.5 million jobs. Why? Because
his whole plan is to cut taxes,
to give the biggest tax breaks

42:14.399 --> 42:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ever to the wealthy and to
corporations, adding $20
trillion to our debt, and
causing the

42:15.333 --> 42:14.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kind of dislocation that we have
seen before, because it truly
will be trickle-down economics

42:14.799 --> 42:17.368 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on steroids.

42:17.368 --> 42:17.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the plan I have I think will
actually produce greater
opportunities. The plan he has
will

42:17.702 --> 42:19.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cost us jobs and possibly lead
to another Great Recession.

42:19.337 --> 42:19.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: Secretary, thank you.
Mr. Trump, why will your plan
create more jobs and growth

42:19.036 --> 42:21.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than Secretary Clinton's?

42:21.272 --> 42:22.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, first of all,
before I start on my plan, her
plan is going to raise taxes

42:22.173 --> 42:23.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and even double your taxes. Her
tax plan is a disaster. And she
can say all she wants

42:23.274 --> 42:24.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about college tuition. And I'm a
big proponent. We're going to do
a lot of things for college

42:24.275 --> 42:24.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tuition. But the rest of the
public's going to be paying for
it. We will have a massive,

42:24.509 --> 42:26.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
massive tax increase under
Hillary Clinton's plan.

42:26.177 --> 42:27.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: But I'd like to start off
where we left, because when I
said Japan and Germany,

42:27.345 --> 42:28.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I'm -- not to single them
out, but South Korea, these are
very rich, powerful countries.

42:28.146 --> 42:29.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Saudi Arabia, nothing but money.
We protect Saudi Arabia. Why
aren't they paying?

42:29.180 --> 42:30.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She immediately -- when she
heard this, I questioned it, and
I questioned NATO. Why

42:30.181 --> 42:31.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aren't the NATO questioned --
why aren't they paying? Because
they weren't paying.

42:31.349 --> 42:32.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Since I did this -- this was a
year ago -- all of a sudden,
they're paying. And I've been

42:32.183 --> 42:33.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
given a lot -- a lot of credit
for it. All of a sudden, they're
starting to pay up. They

42:33.184 --> 42:32.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have to pay up. We're protecting
people, they have to pay up. And
I'm a big fan of NATO.

42:32.950 --> 42:35.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But they have to pay up.

42:35.186 --> 42:36.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She comes out and said, we love
our allies, we think our allies
are great. Well, it's

42:36.154 --> 42:35.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
awfully hard to get them to pay
up when you have somebody saying
we think how great they

42:35.686 --> 42:38.256 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are.

42:38.256 --> 42:39.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to tell Japan in a very
nice way, we have to tell
Germany, all of these countries,

42:39.290 --> 42:40.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
South Korea, we have to say, you
have to help us out. We have,
during his regime, during

42:40.158 --> 42:41.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama's regime, we've
doubled our national debt. We're
up to $20 trillion.

42:41.559 --> 42:42.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So my plan -- we're going to
renegotiate trade deals. We're
going to have a lot of free
trade.

42:42.193 --> 42:43.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to have free trade,
more free trade than we have
right now. But we have

42:43.261 --> 42:43.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
horrible deals. Our jobs are
being taken out by the deal that
her husband signed, NAFTA,

42:43.895 --> 42:45.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of the worst deals ever. Our
jobs are being sucked out of our
economy.

42:45.363 --> 42:46.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You look at all of the places
that I just left, you go to
Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio,

42:46.164 --> 42:46.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you go to Florida, you go to any
of them. You go upstate New
York. Our jobs have fled

42:46.731 --> 42:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Mexico and other places.
We're bringing our jobs back.

42:48.166 --> 42:49.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am going to renegotiate NAFTA.
And if I can't make a great deal
-- then we're going

42:49.167 --> 42:50.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to terminate NAFTA and we're
going to create new deals. We're
going to have trade, but

42:50.201 --> 42:51.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're going -- we're going to
terminate it, we're going to
make a great trade deal.

42:51.302 --> 42:52.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if we can't, we're going to
do it -- we're going to go a
separate way, because it has

42:52.203 --> 42:53.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been a disaster. We are going to
cut taxes massively. We're going
to cut business taxes

42:53.337 --> 42:53.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
massively. They're going to
start hiring people. We're going
to bring the $2.5 trillion...

42:53.070 --> 42:55.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALLACE: Time, Mr. Trump.

42:55.573 --> 42:54.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRUMP: ... that's offshore back
into the country. We are going
to start the engine rolling
again,

42:54.806 --> 42:55.973 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
because...

42:55.973 --> 42:57.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Mr. Trump?

42:57.909 --> 42:58.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: ... right now, our
country is dying at 1 percent
GDP.

42:58.609 --> 42:58.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, let me translate
that if i can, because

42:58.943 --> 43:01.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: You can't.

43:01.546 --> 43:02.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLINTON: ... the fact is, he's
going to advocate for the
largest tax cuts we've ever
seen,

43:02.513 --> 43:03.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
three times more than the tax
cuts under the Bush
administration. I have said
repeatedly

43:03.147 --> 43:04.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
throughout this campaign: I will
not raise taxes on anyone making
$250,000 or less.

43:04.315 --> 43:04.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I also will not add a penny to
the debt. I have costed out what
I'm going to do. He will,

43:04.782 --> 43:06.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
through his massive tax cuts,
add $20 trillion to the debt.

43:06.317 --> 43:07.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, he mentioned the debt. We
know how to get control of the
debt. When my husband was

43:07.518 --> 43:08.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president, we went from a $300
billion deficit to a $200
billion surplus and we were
actually

43:08.352 --> 43:09.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the path to eliminating the
national debt. When President
Obama came into office, he

43:09.353 --> 43:08.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inherited the worst economic
disaster since the Great
Depression. He has cut the
deficit

43:08.886 --> 43:11.222 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by two-thirds.

43:11.222 --> 43:12.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, yes, one of the ways you go
after the debt, one of the ways
you create jobs is by

43:12.490 --> 43:13.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investing in people. So I do
have investments, investments in
new jobs, investments in
education,

43:13.191 --> 43:13.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
skill training, and the
opportunities for people to get
ahead and stay ahead. That's

43:13.324 --> 43:14.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the kind of approach
that will work.

43:14.025 --> 43:16.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Secretary...

43:16.394 --> 43:16.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Cutting taxes on the
wealthy, we've tried that. It
has not worked the way that

43:16.027 --> 43:18.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it has been promised.

43:18.496 --> 43:19.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, I
want to pursue your plan,
because in many ways it is
similar

43:19.363 --> 43:25.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the Obama stimulus plan in
2009, which has led to the
slowest GDP growth since 1949.

43:25.736 --> 43:27.438 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRUMP: Correct.

43:27.438 --> 43:31.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Thank you, sir.

43:31.676 --> 43:36.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You told me in July when we
spoke that the problem is that
President Obama didn't get

43:36.981 --> 43:41.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do enough in what he was
trying to do with his stimulus.
So is your plan basically more

43:41.686 --> 43:44.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
-- even more of the
Obama stimulus?

43:44.822 --> 43:50.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Well, it's a
combination, Chris. And let me
say that when you inherit the
level

43:50.995 --> 43:59.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of economic catastrophe that
President Obama inherited, it
was a real touch-and-go
situation.

43:59.036 --> 44:06.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was in the Senate before I
became secretary of state. I've
never seen people as physically

44:06.277 --> 44:12.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
distraught as the Bush
administration team was because
of what was happening to the
economy.

44:12.917 --> 44:19.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I personally believe that the
steps that President Obama took
saved the economy. He doesn't
get

44:19.257 --> 44:25.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the credit he deserves for
taking some very hard positions.
But it was a terrible recession.

44:25.563 --> 44:30.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So now we've dug ourselves out
of it, we're standing, but we're
not yet running. So what

44:30.902 --> 44:36.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am proposing is that we invest
from the middle out and the
ground up, not the top

44:36.007 --> 44:39.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
down. That is not going to work.

44:39.977 --> 44:45.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why what I have put
forward doesn't add a penny to
the debt, but it is the kind

44:45.116 --> 44:50.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of approach that will enable
more people to take those new
jobs, higher-paying jobs. We're

44:50.421 --> 44:57.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
beginning to see some increase
in incomes, and we certainly
have had a long string of

44:57.295 --> 45:01.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
increasing jobs. We've got to do
more to get the whole economy
moving, and that's what

45:01.032 --> 45:03.935 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I believe I will be able to do.

45:03.935 --> 45:08.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Mr. Trump, even
conservative economists who have
looked at your plan say that the

45:08.673 --> 45:13.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
numbers don't add up, that your
idea, and you've talked about 25
million jobs created,

45:13.344 --> 45:14.645 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
4 percent...

45:14.645 --> 45:18.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Over a 10-year period.

45:18.382 --> 45:22.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: ... growth is
unrealistic. And they say -- you
talk a lot about growing the
energy

45:22.753 --> 45:25.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
industry. They say with oil
prices as low as they are right
now, that's unrealistic,

45:25.623 --> 45:28.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as well. Your response, sir?

45:28.526 --> 45:35.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRUMP: So I just left some high
representatives of India.
They're growing at 8 percent.
China

45:35.132 --> 45:40.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is growing at 7 percent. And
that for them is a
catastrophically low number.

45:40.905 --> 45:45.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are growing -- our last
report came out -- and it's
right around the 1 percent
level.

45:45.042 --> 45:50.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it's going down.
Last week, as you know, the end
of last week, they came

45:50.014 --> 45:55.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out with an anemic jobs report.
A terrible jobs report. In fact
I said, is that the last

45:55.820 --> 45:59.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
jobs report before the election?
Because if it is, I should win
easily, it was so bad.

45:59.724 --> 46:02.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The report was so bad.

46:02.760 --> 46:09.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, our country is stagnant.
We've lost our jobs. We've lost
our businesses. We're

46:09.567 --> 46:14.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not making things anymore,
relatively speaking. Our product
is pouring in from China,
pouring

46:14.338 --> 46:18.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in from Vietnam, pouring in
from all over the world.

46:18.109 --> 46:22.513 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I've visited so many
communities. This has been such
an incredible education for me,

46:22.513 --> 46:27.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chris. I've gotten to know so
many -- I've developed so many
friends over the last year.

46:27.818 --> 46:32.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they cry when they see
what's happened. I pass
factories that were thriving 20,
25

46:32.223 --> 46:37.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years ago, and because of the
bill that her husband signed and
she blessed 100 percent,

46:37.261 --> 46:41.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it is just horrible what's
happened to these people in
these communities.

46:41.499 --> 46:46.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, she can say that her
husband did well, but, boy, did
they suffer as NAFTA kicked

46:46.103 --> 46:50.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in, because it didn't really
kick in very much, but it kicked
in after they left. Boy,

46:50.441 --> 46:55.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did they suffer. That was one of
the worst things that's ever
been signed by our country.

46:55.613 --> 47:00.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now she wants to sign
Trans-Pacific Partnership. And
she wants it. She lied when she
said she

47:00.151 --> 47:04.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
didn't call it the gold standard
in one of the debates. She
totally lied. She did call

47:04.088 --> 47:06.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it the gold standard. And they
actually fact checked, and they
said I was right. I was

47:06.557 --> 47:08.893 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
so honored.

47:08.893 --> 47:11.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: I want you to give you
a chance to briefly speak to
that, and then I want to

47:11.162 --> 47:12.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pivot to one-sixth
of the economy...

47:12.229 --> 47:13.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: And that will
be as bad as NAFTA.

47:13.397 --> 47:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WALLACE: ... which is Obamacare.
But go ahead, briefly.

47:16.233 --> 47:22.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, first, let me
say, number one, when I saw the
final agreement for TPP, I

47:22.540 --> 47:27.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said I was against it. It didn't
meet my test. I've had the same
test. Does it create jobs,

47:27.278 --> 47:31.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
raise incomes, and further our
national security? I'm against
it now. I'll be against it after

47:31.215 --> 47:34.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the election. I'll be against
it when I'm president.

47:34.251 --> 47:37.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's only one of us on this
stage who's actually shipped
jobs to Mexico, because that's

47:37.922 --> 47:41.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald. He's shipped jobs to 12
countries, including Mexico.

47:41.959 --> 47:45.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he mentioned China. And, you
know, one of the biggest
problems we have with China

47:45.329 --> 47:51.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is the illegal dumping of steel
and aluminum into our markets. I
have fought against that

47:51.202 --> 47:55.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as a senator. I've stood up
against it as secretary of
state.

47:55.306 --> 48:00.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald has bought Chinese steel
and aluminum. In fact, the Trump
Hotel right here in Las

48:00.444 --> 48:05.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vegas was made with Chinese
steel. So he goes around with
crocodile tears about how
terrible

48:05.049 --> 48:08.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it is, but he has given jobs to
Chinese steelworkers, not
American steelworkers.

48:08.152 --> 48:10.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Mr. Trump?

48:10.087 --> 48:12.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: That's the kind of
approach that is just not going
to work.

48:12.757 --> 48:14.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Well, let me just
say -- let me just say.

48:14.592 --> 48:17.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: We're going to pull the
country together. We're going to
have trade agreements that

48:17.128 --> 48:22.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we enforce. That's why I'm going
to have a trade prosecutor for
the first time in history.

48:22.099 --> 48:26.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're going to enforce those
agreements, and we're going to
look for businesses to

48:26.137 --> 48:27.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
help us by buying
American products.

48:27.905 --> 48:29.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?
Go ahead, Mr. Trump.

48:29.573 --> 48:32.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Let me ask a simple
question. She's been doing this
for 30 years. Why the hell

48:32.843 --> 48:34.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
didn't you do it over
the last 15, 20 years?

48:34.779 --> 48:37.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: No, I voted.

48:37.148 --> 48:42.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: You were very much
involved -- excuse me. My turn.
You were very much involved in

48:42.520 --> 48:47.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
every aspect of this country.
Very much. And you do have
experience. I say the one thing

48:47.424 --> 48:49.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you have over me is experience,
but it's bad experience, because
what you've done has turned

48:49.960 --> 48:52.396 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out badly.

48:52.396 --> 48:56.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For 30 years, you've been in a
position to help, and if you say
that I use steel or I

48:56.867 --> 49:02.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
use something else, I -- make it
impossible for me to do that. I
wouldn't mind.

49:02.540 --> 49:07.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The problem is, you talk, but
you don't get anything done,
Hillary. You don't. Just like

49:07.478 --> 49:13.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
when you ran the State
Department, $6 billion was
missing. How do you miss $6
billion? You

49:13.717 --> 49:22.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ran the State Department, $6
billion was either stolen. They
don't know. It's gone, $6
billion.

49:22.059 --> 49:28.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you become president, this
country is going to be in some
mess. Believe me.

49:28.365 --> 49:32.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, first of all,
what he just said about the
State Department is not only

49:32.269 --> 49:35.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
untrue, it's been
debunked numerous times.

49:35.372 --> 49:40.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: But I think it's really
an important issue. He raised
the 30 years of experience,

49:40.578 --> 49:45.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so let me just talk briefly
about that. You know, back in
the 1970s, I worked for the

49:45.516 --> 49:50.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Children's Defense Fund. And I
was taking on discrimination
against African-American

49:50.654 --> 49:54.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kids in schools. He was getting
sued by the Justice Department
for racial discrimination

49:54.525 --> 49:57.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in his apartment buildings.

49:57.428 --> 50:03.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the 1980s, I was working to
reform the schools in Arkansas.
He was borrowing $14

50:03.667 --> 50:09.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
million from his father to start
his businesses. In the 1990s, I
went to Beijing and I said

50:09.406 --> 50:12.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
women's rights are human rights.
He insulted a former Miss
Universe, Alicia Machado, called

50:12.309 --> 50:13.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her an eating machine.

50:13.277 --> 50:15.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Give me a break.

50:15.613 --> 50:22.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: And on the day when I
was in the Situation Room,
monitoring the raid that brought

50:22.052 --> 50:27.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Osama bin Laden to justice, he
was hosting the "Celebrity
Apprentice." So I'm happy to

50:27.458 --> 50:32.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
compare my 30 years of
experience, what I've done for
this country, trying to help in
every

50:32.963 --> 50:37.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way I could, especially kids and
families get ahead and stay
ahead, with your 30 years,

50:37.902 --> 50:41.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and I'll let the American
people make that decision.

50:41.138 --> 50:44.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, I think I did a
much better job. I built a
massive company, a great
company,

50:44.775 --> 50:50.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of the greatest assets
anywhere in the world, worth
many, many billions of dollars.

50:50.547 --> 50:54.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I started with a $1 million
loan. I agree with that. It's a
$1 million loan. But I built

50:54.184 --> 50:57.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a phenomenal company.

50:57.755 --> 51:02.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if we could run our country
the way I've run my company, we
would have a country that

51:02.826 --> 51:06.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you would be so proud of. You
would even be proud of it.

51:06.931 --> 51:13.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And frankly, when you look at
her real record, take a look at
Syria. Take a look at the
migration.

51:13.404 --> 51:19.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Take a look at Libya. Take a
look at Iraq. She gave us ISIS,
because her and Obama created

51:19.176 --> 51:24.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this huge vacuum, and a small
group came out of that huge
vacuum because when -- we should

51:24.448 --> 51:28.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
never have been in Iraq, but
once we were there, we should
have never got out the way

51:28.319 --> 51:33.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they wanted to get out. She gave
us ISIS as sure as you are
sitting there. And what happened

51:33.524 --> 51:38.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is now ISIS is in 32 countries.
And now I listen how she's going
to get rid of ISIS.

51:38.529 --> 51:40.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She's going to get
rid of nobody.

51:40.965 --> 51:46.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: All right. We are going
to get to foreign hot spots in a
few moments, but the

51:46.070 --> 51:50.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
next segment is fitness to be
president of the United States.
Mr. Trump, at the last

51:50.607 --> 51:58.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debate, you said your talk about
grabbing women was just that,
talk, and that you'd

51:58.215 --> 52:03.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
never actually done it. And
since then, as we all know, nine
women have come forward

52:03.687 --> 52:11.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and have said that you either
groped them or kissed them
without their consent.

52:11.061 --> 52:15.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why would so many different
women from so many different
circumstances over so many

52:15.199 --> 52:19.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
different years, why would they
all in this last couple of weeks
make up -- you deny this

52:19.670 --> 52:22.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
-- why would they all
make up these stories?

52:22.640 --> 52:28.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Since this is a question for
both of you, Secretary Clinton,
Mr. Trump says what your

52:28.412 --> 52:33.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
husband did and that you
defended was even worse. Mr.
Trump, you go first.

52:33.484 --> 52:38.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, first of all, those
stories have been largely
debunked. Those people -- I
don't

52:38.222 --> 52:40.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know those people. I have a
feeling how they came. I believe
it was her campaign that did

52:40.791 --> 52:43.594 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

52:43.594 --> 52:48.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just like if you look at what
came out today on the clips
where I was wondering what
happened

52:48.766 --> 52:54.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with my rally in Chicago and
other rallies where we had such
violence? She's the one

52:54.505 --> 52:59.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Obama that caused the
violence. They hired people --
they paid them $1,500, and
they're

52:59.843 --> 53:04.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on tape saying be violent,
cause fights, do bad things.

53:04.815 --> 53:08.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would say the only way --
because those stories are all
totally false, I have to say

53:08.952 --> 53:13.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that. And I didn't even
apologize to my wife, who's
sitting right here, because I
didn't

53:13.157 --> 53:18.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do anything. I didn't know any
of these -- I didn't see these
women.

53:18.362 --> 53:24.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These women -- the woman on the
plane, the -- I think they want
either fame or her campaign

53:24.034 --> 53:30.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did it. And I think it's her
campaign. Because what I saw
what they did, which is a
criminal

53:30.274 --> 53:33.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
act, by the way, where they're
telling people to go out and
start fist-fights and start

53:33.243 --> 53:35.946 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
violence.

53:35.946 --> 53:39.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'll tell you what, in
particular in Chicago, people
were hurt and people could have
been

53:39.783 --> 53:46.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
killed in that riot. And that
was now all on tape, started by
her. I believe, Chris,

53:46.490 --> 53:51.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that she got these people to
step forward. If it wasn't, they
get their 10 minutes of

53:51.728 --> 53:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fame. But they were all totally
-- it was all fiction. It was
lies, and it was fiction.

53:56.266 --> 53:57.534 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CLINTON: Well...

53:57.534 --> 53:59.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?

53:59.703 --> 54:07.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: At the last debate, we
heard Donald talking about what
he did to women. And after

54:07.811 --> 54:13.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, a number of women have
come forward saying that's
exactly what he did to them.

54:13.984 --> 54:19.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, what was his response?
Well, he held a number of big
rallies where he said that

54:19.556 --> 54:24.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he could not possibly have done
those things to those women
because they were not attractive

54:24.795 --> 54:26.964 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
enough for them to be assaulted.

54:26.964 --> 54:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: I did not say that.
I did not say that.

54:30.300 --> 54:32.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: In fact, he went on to
say... WALLACE: Her two minutes
-- sir, her two minutes. Her

54:32.336 --> 54:33.570 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two minutes.

54:33.570 --> 54:34.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: I did not say that.

54:34.638 --> 54:36.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALLACE: It's her two minutes.

54:36.673 --> 54:43.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: He went on to say,
"Look at her. I don't think so."
About another woman, he

54:43.147 --> 54:49.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said, "That wouldn't be my first
choice." He attacked the woman
reporter writing the

54:49.720 --> 54:56.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
story, called her "disgusting,"
as he has called a number of
women during this campaign.

54:56.026 --> 55:04.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald thinks belittling women
makes him bigger. He goes after
their dignity, their self-worth,

55:04.434 --> 55:09.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I don't think there is a
woman anywhere who doesn't know
what that feels like. So

55:09.840 --> 55:13.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we now know what Donald thinks
and what he says and how he acts
toward women. That's

55:13.977 --> 55:17.748 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who Donald is.

55:17.748 --> 55:25.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's really up to all of
us to demonstrate who we are and
who our country is, and to

55:25.489 --> 55:33.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stand up and be very clear about
what we expect from our next
president, how we want to bring

55:33.297 --> 55:40.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our country together, where we
don't want to have the kind of
pitting of people one

55:40.604 --> 55:45.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against the other, where instead
we celebrate our diversity, we
lift people up, and we make

55:45.842 --> 55:50.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our country even greater.

55:50.480 --> 55:56.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
America is great, because
America is good. And it really
is up to all of us to make that

55:56.820 --> 56:01.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
true, now and in the future, and
particularly for our children
and our grandchildren.

56:01.124 --> 56:03.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Mr. Trump...

56:03.360 --> 56:06.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: Nobody has more respect
for women than I do. Nobody.

56:06.363 --> 56:07.631 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

56:07.631 --> 56:08.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Nobody has more respect...

56:08.665 --> 56:11.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALLACE: Please, everybody.

56:11.034 --> 56:16.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRUMP: And frankly, those
stories have been largely
debunked. And I really want to
just

56:16.840 --> 56:20.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
talk about something
slightly different.

56:20.711 --> 56:26.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She mentions this, which is all
fiction, all fictionalized,
probably or possibly started

56:26.750 --> 56:33.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by her and her very sleazy
campaign. But I will tell you
what isn't fictionalized are

56:33.757 --> 56:38.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her e-mails, where she destroyed
33,000 e-mails criminally,
criminally, after getting a
subpoena

56:38.929 --> 56:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from the United States Congress.

56:43.300 --> 56:49.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What happened to the FBI, I
don't know. We have a great
general, four-star general,
today

56:49.673 --> 56:55.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you read it in all of the
papers, going to potentially
serve five years in jail for
lying

56:55.545 --> 57:04.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the FBI. One lie. She's lied
hundreds of times to the people,
to Congress, and to the

57:04.621 --> 57:11.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FBI. He's going to probably go
to jail. This is a four-star
general. And she gets away

57:11.828 --> 57:17.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with it, and she can run for the
presidency of the United States?
That's really what you

57:17.467 --> 57:20.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should be talking about, not
fiction, where somebody wants
fame or where they come out

57:20.637 --> 57:22.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of her crooked campaign.

57:22.606 --> 57:24.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?

57:24.875 --> 57:34.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, every time Donald
is pushed on something which is
obviously uncomfortable,

57:34.051 --> 57:42.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like what these women are
saying, he immediately goes to
denying responsibility. And it's
not

57:42.426 --> 57:48.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just about women. He never
apologizes or says he's sorry
for anything.

57:48.498 --> 57:54.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we know what he has said and
what he's done to women. But he
also went after a disabled

57:54.338 --> 57:56.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reporter, mocked and mimicked
him on national television.

57:56.340 --> 57:58.775 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRUMP: Wrong.

57:58.775 --> 58:05.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: He went after Mr. and
Mrs. Khan, the parents of a
young man who died serving

58:05.549 --> 58:10.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our country, a Gold Star family,
because of their religion. He
went after John McCain,

58:10.954 --> 58:19.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a prisoner of war, said he
prefers "people who aren't
captured." He went after a
federal

58:19.029 --> 58:25.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
judge, born in Indiana, but who
Donald said couldn't be trusted
to try the fraud and
racketeering

58:25.602 --> 58:29.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
case against Trump University
because his parents were
Mexican.

58:29.873 --> 58:37.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it's not one thing. This is a
pattern, a pattern of
divisiveness, of a very dark

58:37.280 --> 58:44.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and in many ways dangerous
vision of our country, where he
incites violence, where he
applauds

58:44.121 --> 58:50.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who are pushing and
pulling and punching at his
rallies. That is not who America
is.

58:50.894 --> 58:58.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I hope that as we move in
the last weeks of this campaign,
more and more people will

58:58.335 --> 59:02.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
understand what's at stake in
this election. It really does
come down to what kind of
country

59:02.305 --> 59:04.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we are going to have.

59:04.775 --> 59:08.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: So sad when she talks
about violence at my rallies,
and she caused the violence.

59:08.378 --> 59:09.613 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's on tape.

59:09.613 --> 59:11.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALLACE: During the last...

59:11.815 --> 59:16.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: The other things are
false, but honestly, I'd love to
talk about getting rid of ISIS,

59:16.019 --> 59:16.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and I'd love to talk
about other things...

59:16.753 --> 59:18.789 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WALLACE: OK.

59:18.789 --> 59:21.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: ... but those other
charges, as she knows, are
false.

59:21.124 --> 59:25.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: In this bucket about
fitness to be president, there's
been a lot of developments

59:25.829 --> 59:30.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the last 10 days since the
last debate. I'd like to ask you
about them. These are

59:30.167 --> 59:32.736 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
questions that the
American people have.

59:32.736 --> 59:37.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Clinton, during your
2009 Senate confirmation
hearing, you promised to avoid

59:37.908 --> 59:43.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
even the appearance of a
conflict of interest with your
dealing with the Clinton
Foundation

59:43.413 --> 59:49.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
while you were secretary of
state, but e-mails show that
donors got special access to
you.

59:49.152 --> 59:54.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those seeking grants for Haiti
relief were considered
separately from non-donors, and

59:54.925 --> 01:00:00.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
some of those donors got
contracts, government contracts,
taxpayer money.

01:00:00.864 --> 01:00:04.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you really say that you kept
your pledge to that Senate
committee? And why isn't what

01:00:04.835 --> 01:00:08.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happened and what went on
between you and the Clinton
Foundation, why isn't it what

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:12.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump calls pay to play?

01:00:12.342 --> 01:00:18.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, everything I did
as secretary of state was in
furtherance of our country's

01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:23.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interests and our values. The
State Department has said that.
I think that's been proven.

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:27.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I am happy, in fact I'm
thrilled to talk about the
Clinton Foundation, because it
is

01:00:27.157 --> 01:00:32.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a world-renowned charity and I
am so proud of the work that it
does. You know, I could

01:00:32.362 --> 01:00:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talk for the rest of the debate
-- I know I don't have the time
to do that.

01:00:36.666 --> 01:00:43.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But just briefly, the Clinton
Foundation made it possible for
11 million people around the

01:00:43.006 --> 01:00:48.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
world with HIV-AIDS to afford
treatment, and that's about half
all the people in the world

01:00:48.178 --> 01:00:52.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are getting treatment. In
partnership with the American
Health Association...

01:00:52.048 --> 01:00:54.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton...

01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:55.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLINTON: ... we have made
environments in schools
healthier for kids, including
healthier

01:00:55.819 --> 01:00:58.188 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lunches...

01:00:58.188 --> 01:00:59.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton,
respectfully, this is -- this is
an open discussion.

01:00:59.289 --> 01:01:01.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Well, it is an
open discussion. And you...

01:01:01.825 --> 01:01:04.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: And the specific
question went to pay for play.
Do you want to talk about that?

01:01:04.628 --> 01:01:06.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, but there is no
-- but there is no evidence --
but there is...

01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:08.265 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:01:08.265 --> 01:01:08.932 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: I think that
it's been very well...

01:01:08.932 --> 01:01:10.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALLACE: Let's ask Mr. Trump.

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:11.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: There is a lot of
evidence about the very good
work...

01:01:11.067 --> 01:01:12.102 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
TRUMP: It's been
very well studied.

01:01:12.102 --> 01:01:12.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: ... and the
high rankings...

01:01:12.636 --> 01:01:14.237 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:15.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Please let
me Mr. Trump speak.

01:01:15.772 --> 01:01:16.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: ... and it's a criminal
enterprise, and so many people
know it.

01:01:16.106 --> 01:01:16.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Please let
Mr. Trump speak.

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:19.309 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:21.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: It's a criminal
enterprise. Saudi Arabia giving
$25 million, Qatar, all of these
countries.

01:01:21.311 --> 01:01:27.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You talk about women and women's
rights? So these are people that
push gays off business

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:31.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- off buildings. These are
people that kill women and treat
women horribly. And yet you

01:01:31.955 --> 01:01:34.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
take their money.

01:01:34.724 --> 01:01:39.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I'd like to ask you right
now, why don't you give back the
money that you've taken

01:01:39.162 --> 01:01:44.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from certain countries that
treat certain groups of people
so horribly? Why don't you

01:01:44.434 --> 01:01:47.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
give back the money? I think
it would be a great gesture.

01:01:47.971 --> 01:01:53.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because she takes a tremendous
amount of money. And you take a
look at the people of Haiti.

01:01:53.243 --> 01:01:58.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was at a little Haiti the
other day in Florida. And I want
to tell you, they hate the
Clintons,

01:01:58.949 --> 01:02:04.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because what's happened in Haiti
with the Clinton Foundation is a
disgrace. And you

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:06.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know it, and they know it,
and everybody knows it.

01:02:06.122 --> 01:02:08.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?

01:02:08.191 --> 01:02:13.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, very quickly, we
at the Clinton Foundation spend
90 percent -- 90 percent

01:02:13.229 --> 01:02:19.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of all the money that is donated
on behalf of programs of people
around the world and

01:02:19.135 --> 01:02:24.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in our own country. I'm very
proud of that. We have the
highest rating from the
watchdogs

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:29.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that follow foundations. And I'd
be happy to compare what we do
with the Trump Foundation,

01:02:29.346 --> 01:02:33.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which took money from other
people and bought a six- foot
portrait of Donald. I mean, who

01:02:33.316 --> 01:02:37.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
does that? It just
was astonishing.

01:02:37.387 --> 01:02:42.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when it comes to Haiti,
Haiti is the poorest country in
our hemisphere. The earthquake

01:02:42.392 --> 01:02:47.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the hurricanes, it has
devastated Haiti. Bill and I
have been involved in trying to

01:02:47.397 --> 01:02:53.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
help Haiti for many years. The
Clinton Foundation raised $30
million to help Haiti after the

01:02:53.803 --> 01:02:59.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
catastrophic earthquake and all
of the terrible problems the
people there had.

01:02:59.109 --> 01:03:02.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have done things to help
small businesses, agriculture,
and so much else. And we're
going

01:03:02.946 --> 01:03:04.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to keep working to help Haiti...

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:06.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: All right.

01:03:06.282 --> 01:03:07.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: ... because it's an
important part of the American
experience.

01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:09.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: They don't want you
to help them anymore.

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:12.188 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:03:12.188 --> 01:03:16.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: I'd like to mention one
thing. Trump Foundation, small
foundation. People contribute,

01:03:16.893 --> 01:03:21.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I contribute. The money goes 100
percent -- 100 percent goes to
different charities, including

01:03:21.097 --> 01:03:25.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of military. I don't get
anything. I don't buy boats. I
don't buy planes. What

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:27.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
happens -- the money
goes to them.

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:29.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: Wasn't some of the
money used to settle your
lawsuits, sir?

01:03:29.939 --> 01:03:34.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: No, it was -- we put up
the American flag. And that's
it. They put up the American

01:03:34.611 --> 01:03:37.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
flag. We fought for the right in
Palm Beach to put up the
American flag.

01:03:37.447 --> 01:03:40.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: Right. But there was a
penalty that was imposed by Palm
Beach County, and the

01:03:40.517 --> 01:03:41.685 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
money came from
your foundation...

01:03:41.685 --> 01:03:43.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: There was. There
was. And, by the way...

01:03:43.687 --> 01:03:45.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: ... instead of
Mar-a-Lago or yourself, sir.

01:03:45.522 --> 01:03:49.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: ... the money -- the
money went to Fisher House,
where they build houses -- the

01:03:49.225 --> 01:03:52.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
money that you're talking about
went to Fisher House, where they
build houses for veterans

01:03:52.862 --> 01:03:54.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and disabled vets.

01:03:54.197 --> 01:03:56.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: I want to
get into one...

01:03:56.132 --> 01:03:58.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: But, of course, there's
no way we can know whether any
of that is true, because

01:03:58.635 --> 01:04:03.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he hasn't released his tax
returns. He is the first
candidate ever to run for
president

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:08.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the last 40-plus years who
has not released his tax
returns, so everything he says
about

01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:12.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
charity or anything else, we
can't prove it. You can look at
our tax returns. We've got

01:04:12.916 --> 01:04:15.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
them all out there.

01:04:15.518 --> 01:04:22.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what is really troubling is
that we learned in the last
debate he has not paid a penny

01:04:22.125 --> 01:04:27.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in federal income tax. And we
were talking about immigrants a
few minutes ago, Chris.

01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:32.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, half of all immigrants
-- undocumented immigrants in
our country -- actually pay

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:37.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
federal income tax. So we have
undocumented immigrants in
America who are paying more

01:04:37.273 --> 01:04:39.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
federal income tax than a
billionaire. I find that just
astonishing.

01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:41.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: I want...

01:04:41.444 --> 01:04:44.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: So let me just tell you
very quickly, we're entitled
because of the laws that people

01:04:44.748 --> 01:04:49.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like her passed to take massive
amounts of depreciation on other
charges, and we do it.

01:04:49.619 --> 01:04:53.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all of her donors -- just
about all of them -- I know
Buffett took hundreds of
millions

01:04:53.156 --> 01:04:56.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of dollars, Soros, George Soros,
took hundreds of millions of
dollars...

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:57.794 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WALLACE: We...

01:04:57.794 --> 01:04:58.962 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Let me just explain.

01:04:58.962 --> 01:05:00.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: But, no,
we heard this...

01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:01.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: Most of her donors have
done the same thing as I do.

01:05:01.431 --> 01:05:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALLACE: Mr. Trump, we -- OK.

01:05:02.766 --> 01:05:03.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: You know what
she should have done?

01:05:03.399 --> 01:05:05.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALLACE: Folks, we heard this...

01:05:05.668 --> 01:05:07.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: And you know, Hillary,
what you should have done, you
should have changed the law

01:05:07.103 --> 01:05:08.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
when you were a United
States senator...

01:05:08.972 --> 01:05:11.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALLACE: Folks, we heard this...

01:05:11.474 --> 01:05:14.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: ... because your donors
and your special interests are
doing the same thing as I do,

01:05:14.244 --> 01:05:15.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
except even more so.

01:05:15.345 --> 01:05:17.614 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, you know...

01:05:17.614 --> 01:05:20.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: You should have changed
the law. But you won't change
the law, because you take

01:05:20.283 --> 01:05:25.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in so much money. I mean, I sat
in my apartment today on a very
beautiful hotel down the street

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:27.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
known as Trump...

01:05:27.290 --> 01:05:28.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Made with
Chinese steel.

01:05:28.458 --> 01:05:28.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: But I will tell
you, I sat there...

01:05:28.958 --> 01:05:31.327 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:05:31.327 --> 01:05:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
... I sat there watching ad
after ad after ad, false ad. All
paid for by your friends

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:42.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Wall Street that gave so much
money because they know you're
going to protect them. And,

01:05:42.806 --> 01:05:44.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
frankly, you should
have changed the laws.

01:05:44.007 --> 01:05:45.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Mr. Trump...

01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:47.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: If you don't like what I
did, you should have changed the
laws.

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:52.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: Mr. Trump, I want to
ask you about one last question
in this topic. You have

01:05:52.248 --> 01:05:59.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been warning at rallies recently
that this election is rigged and
that Hillary Clinton

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:05.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is in the process of trying
to steal it from you.

01:06:05.161 --> 01:06:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Your running mate, Governor
Pence, pledged on Sunday that he
and you -- his words -- "will

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:16.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
absolutely accept the result of
this election." Today your
daughter, Ivanka, said the same

01:06:16.573 --> 01:06:21.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thing. I want to ask you here on
the stage tonight: Do you make
the same commitment that

01:06:21.044 --> 01:06:25.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you will absolutely -- sir, that
you will absolutely accept the
result of this election?

01:06:25.548 --> 01:06:27.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: I will look at it at the
time. I'm not looking at
anything now. I'll look at

01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:30.687 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it at the time.

01:06:30.687 --> 01:06:36.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What I've seen -- what I've seen
is so bad. First of all, the
media is so dishonest and

01:06:36.693 --> 01:06:41.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so corrupt, and the pile-on is
so amazing. The New York Times
actually wrote an article

01:06:41.731 --> 01:06:45.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about it, but they don't even
care. It's so dishonest. And
they've poisoned the mind of

01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:47.737 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the voters.

01:06:47.737 --> 01:06:51.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But unfortunately for them, I
think the voters are seeing
through it. I think they're
going

01:06:51.407 --> 01:06:52.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to see through it. We'll find
out on November 8th. But I think
they're going to see through

01:06:52.575 --> 01:06:54.010 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:56.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALLACE: But, sir, there's...

01:06:56.145 --> 01:07:00.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: If you look -- excuse me,
Chris -- if you look at your
voter rolls, you will see

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:04.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
millions of people that are
registered to vote -- millions,
this isn't coming from me

01:07:04.754 --> 01:07:08.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- this is coming from Pew
Report and other places --
millions of people that are
registered

01:07:08.892 --> 01:07:13.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to vote that shouldn't
be registered to vote.

01:07:13.196 --> 01:07:18.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So let me just give you one
other thing. So I talk about the
corrupt media. I talk about

01:07:18.301 --> 01:07:23.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the millions of people -- tell
you one other thing. She
shouldn't be allowed to run.
It's

01:07:23.139 --> 01:07:27.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crooked -- she's -- she's guilty
of a very, very serious crime.
She should not be allowed

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:29.979 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to run.

01:07:29.979 --> 01:07:34.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And just in that respect, I say
it's rigged, because she should
never...

01:07:34.183 --> 01:07:36.686 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WALLACE: But...

01:07:36.686 --> 01:07:40.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Chris, she should never
have been allowed to run for the
presidency based on what she

01:07:40.356 --> 01:07:43.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
did with e-mails and
so many other things.

01:07:43.326 --> 01:07:47.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: But, sir, there is a
tradition in this country -- in
fact, one of the prides

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:51.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of this country -- is the
peaceful transition of power and
that no matter how hard-fought

01:07:51.834 --> 01:07:58.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a campaign is, that at the end
of the campaign that the loser
concedes to the winner. Not

01:07:58.141 --> 01:08:01.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying that you're necessarily
going to be the loser or the
winner, but that the loser

01:08:01.611 --> 01:08:06.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
concedes to the winner and that
the country comes together in
part for the good of the

01:08:06.282 --> 01:08:09.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country. Are you saying you're
not prepared now to commit to
that principle?

01:08:09.185 --> 01:08:11.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: What I'm saying is that I
will tell you at the time. I'll
keep you in suspense.

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:13.823 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

01:08:13.823 --> 01:08:17.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, Chris, let me
respond to that, because that's
horrifying. You know, every

01:08:17.794 --> 01:08:22.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time Donald thinks things are
not going in his direction, he
claims whatever it is, is

01:08:22.365 --> 01:08:25.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rigged against him.

01:08:25.368 --> 01:08:30.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The FBI conducted a year-long
investigation into my e-mails.
They concluded there was

01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:36.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no case; he said the FBI was
rigged. He lost the Iowa caucus.
He lost the Wisconsin primary.

01:08:36.813 --> 01:08:42.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said the Republican primary
was rigged against him. Then
Trump University gets sued

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:47.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for fraud and racketeering; he
claims the court system and the
federal judge is rigged

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:54.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against him. There was even a
time when he didn't get an Emmy
for his TV program three

01:08:54.030 --> 01:08:56.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years in a row and he started
tweeting that the Emmys were
rigged against him.

01:08:56.699 --> 01:08:57.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Should have gotten it.

01:08:57.367 --> 01:08:59.902 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:08:59.902 --> 01:09:03.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: This is -- this is a
mindset. This is how Donald
thinks. And it's funny, but

01:09:03.272 --> 01:09:04.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's also really troubling.

01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:06.776 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WALLACE: OK.

01:09:06.776 --> 01:09:12.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: So that is not the way
our democracy works. We've been
around for 240 years. We've

01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:18.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had free and fair elections.
We've accepted the outcomes when
we may not have liked them.

01:09:18.488 --> 01:09:24.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that is what must be
expected of anyone standing on a
debate stage during a general

01:09:24.894 --> 01:09:27.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
election. You know, President
Obama said the other day when
you're whining before the game

01:09:27.096 --> 01:09:27.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is even finished...

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:29.699 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:09:29.699 --> 01:09:31.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WALLACE: Hold on. Hold on,
folks. Hold on, folks.

01:09:31.401 --> 01:09:35.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: ... it just shows
you're not up to doing the job.
And let's -- you know, let's

01:09:35.338 --> 01:09:40.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be clear about what he is saying
and what that means. He is
denigrating -- he's talking

01:09:40.543 --> 01:09:46.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down our democracy. And I, for
one, am appalled that somebody
who is the nominee of one of

01:09:46.282 --> 01:09:50.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our two major parties would
take that kind of position.

01:09:50.253 --> 01:09:55.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: I think what the FBI did
and what the Department of
Justice did, including meeting

01:09:55.858 --> 01:10:01.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with her husband, the attorney
general, in the back of an
airplane on the tarmac in
Arizona,

01:10:01.497 --> 01:10:03.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it's disgraceful.
I think it's a disgrace.

01:10:03.166 --> 01:10:04.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: All right.

01:10:04.967 --> 01:10:06.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: I think we've never had a
situation so bad in this
country.

01:10:06.002 --> 01:10:08.504 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:10:08.504 --> 01:10:11.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: Hold on, folks. This
doesn't do any good for anyone.
Let's please continue the

01:10:11.841 --> 01:10:16.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
debate, and let's move on to the
subject of foreign hot spots.

01:10:16.379 --> 01:10:23.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Iraqi offensive to take back
Mosul has begun. If they are
successful in pushing ISIS

01:10:23.653 --> 01:10:29.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out of that city and out of all
of Iraq, the question then
becomes, what happens the day

01:10:29.725 --> 01:10:32.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after? And that's something that
whichever of you ends up --
whoever of you ends up as

01:10:32.595 --> 01:10:36.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president is going
to have to confront.

01:10:36.566 --> 01:10:42.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Will you put U.S. troops into
that vacuum to make sure that
ISIS doesn't come back or

01:10:42.472 --> 01:10:46.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
isn't replaced by something even
worse? Secretary Clinton, you go
first in this segment. You

01:10:46.342 --> 01:10:48.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have two minutes.

01:10:48.744 --> 01:10:56.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, I am encouraged
that there is an effort led by
the Iraqi army, supported

01:10:56.018 --> 01:11:04.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by Kurdish forces, and also
given the help and advice from
the number of special forces

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and other Americans on the
ground. But I will not support
putting American soldiers into

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:15.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iraq as an occupying force. I
don't think that is in our
interest, and I don't think

01:11:15.371 --> 01:11:19.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that would be smart to do. In
fact, Chris, I think that would
be a big red flag waving

01:11:19.542 --> 01:11:23.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for ISIS to reconstitute itself.

01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:29.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The goal here is to take back
Mosul. It's going to be a hard
fight. I've got no illusions

01:11:29.652 --> 01:11:35.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about that. And then continue to
press into Syria to begin to
take back and move on Raqqa,

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:38.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which is the ISIS headquarters.

01:11:38.995 --> 01:11:45.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am hopeful that the hard work
that American military advisers
have done will pay off and

01:11:45.368 --> 01:11:52.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we will see a real -- a
really successful military
operation. But we know we've got

01:11:52.608 --> 01:11:58.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lots of work to do. Syria will
remain a hotbed of terrorism as
long as the civil war, aided

01:11:58.814 --> 01:12:02.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and abetted by the Iranians
and the Russians, continue.

01:12:02.351 --> 01:12:07.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I have said, look, we need to
keep our eye on ISIS. That's why
I want to have an

01:12:07.290 --> 01:12:11.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intelligence surge that protects
us here at home, why we have to
go after them from the

01:12:11.961 --> 01:12:16.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
air, on the ground, online, why
we have to make sure here at
home we don't let terrorists

01:12:16.766 --> 01:12:21.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
buy weapons. If you're too
dangerous to fly, you're too
dangerous to buy a gun.

01:12:21.437 --> 01:12:28.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm going to continue to
push for a no-fly zone and safe
havens within Syria not only

01:12:28.911 --> 01:12:34.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to help protect the Syrians and
prevent the constant outflow of
refugees, but to, frankly,

01:12:34.784 --> 01:12:39.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gain some leverage on both the
Syrian government and the
Russians so that perhaps we can
have

01:12:39.388 --> 01:12:44.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the kind of serious negotiation
necessary to bring the conflict
to an end and go forward

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:47.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on a political track.

01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:53.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Mr. Trump, same
question. If we are able to push
ISIS out of Mosul and out of

01:12:53.569 --> 01:12:58.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iraq, will -- would you be
willing to put U.S. troops in
there to prevent their return

01:12:58.207 --> 01:13:00.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or something else?

01:13:00.476 --> 01:13:06.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Let me tell you, Mosul is
so sad. We had Mosul. But when
she left, when she took

01:13:06.182 --> 01:13:11.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
everybody out, we lost Mosul.
Now we're fighting again to get
Mosul. The problem with Mosul

01:13:11.787 --> 01:13:15.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and what they wanted to do is
they wanted to get the leaders
of ISIS who they felt were

01:13:15.458 --> 01:13:18.794 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Mosul.

01:13:18.794 --> 01:13:22.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
About three months ago, I
started reading that they want
to get the leaders and they're

01:13:22.832 --> 01:13:29.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to attack Mosul. Whatever
happened to the element of
surprise, OK? We announce we're

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:32.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going after Mosul. I have been
reading about going after Mosul
now for about -- how long

01:13:32.742 --> 01:13:38.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is it, Hillary, three months?
These people have all left.
They've all left.

01:13:38.481 --> 01:13:45.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The element of surprise. Douglas
MacArthur, George Patton
spinning in their graves when

01:13:45.321 --> 01:13:49.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they see the stupidity of our
country. So we're now fighting
for Mosul, that we had.

01:13:49.992 --> 01:13:53.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All she had to do was stay
there, and now we're going in to
get it.

01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you know who the big winner
in Mosul is going to be after we
eventually get it? And

01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:02.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the only reason they did it is
because she's running for the
office of president and they

01:14:02.571 --> 01:14:08.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want to look tough. They want to
look good. He violated the red
line in the sand, and

01:14:08.744 --> 01:14:12.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he made so many mistakes, made
all the mistakes. That's why we
have the great migration. But

01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:16.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she wanted to look good for the
election. So they're going in.

01:14:16.152 --> 01:14:20.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But who's going to get Mosul,
really? We'll take Mosul
eventually. But the way -- if
you

01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:23.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
look at what's happening, much
tougher than they thought. Much,
much tougher. Much more

01:14:23.993 --> 01:14:26.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dangerous. Going to be more
deaths that they thought.

01:14:26.696 --> 01:14:30.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the leaders that we wanted
to get are all gone because
they're smart. They say,

01:14:30.032 --> 01:14:37.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what do we need this for? So
Mosul is going to be a wonderful
thing. And Iran should write

01:14:37.173 --> 01:14:41.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
us a letter of thank you, just
like the really stupid -- the
stupidest deal of all time,

01:14:41.977 --> 01:14:48.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a deal that's going to give Iran
absolutely nuclear weapons. Iran
should write us yet

01:14:48.184 --> 01:14:54.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
another letter saying thank you
very much, because Iran, as I
said many years ago, Iran

01:14:54.924 --> 01:14:57.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is taking over Iraq, something
they've wanted to do forever,
but we've made it so easy for

01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:00.329 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:03.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we're now going to take
Mosul. And do you know who's
going to be the beneficiary?
Iran.

01:15:03.999 --> 01:15:09.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Oh, yeah, they're making -- I
mean, they are outsmarting --
look, you're not there, you

01:15:09.472 --> 01:15:13.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
might be involved in that
decision. But you were there
when you took everybody out of

01:15:13.609 --> 01:15:18.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mosul and out of Iraq. You
shouldn't have been in Iraq, but
you did vote for it. You

01:15:18.614 --> 01:15:21.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shouldn't have been in Iraq, but
once you were in Iraq, you
should have never left the

01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:22.752 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

01:15:22.752 --> 01:15:24.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Sir, your
two minutes are up.

01:15:24.053 --> 01:15:26.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: The point is, the big
winner is going to be Iran.

01:15:26.255 --> 01:15:32.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, you know, once
again, Donald is implying that
he didn't support the invasion

01:15:32.828 --> 01:15:36.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of Iraq. I said it was a
mistake. I've said that years
ago. He has consistently denied

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:37.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what is...

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.135 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRUMP: Wrong.

01:15:39.135 --> 01:15:39.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: ... a very
clear fact that...

01:15:39.602 --> 01:15:42.071 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRUMP: Wrong.

01:15:42.071 --> 01:15:45.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: ... before the
invasion, he supported it. And,
you know, I just want everybody
to

01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:50.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go Google it. Google "Donald
Trump Iraq." And you will see
the dozens of sources which

01:15:50.846 --> 01:15:52.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
verify that he was for
the invasion of Iraq.

01:15:52.848 --> 01:15:55.317 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRUMP: Wrong.

01:15:55.317 --> 01:15:59.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: And you can actually
hear the audio of him saying
that. Now, why does that matter?

01:15:59.255 --> 01:16:05.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, it matters because he has
not told the truth about that
position. I guess he believes

01:16:05.961 --> 01:16:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it makes him look better now to
contrast with me because I did
vote for it.

01:16:11.333 --> 01:16:18.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what's really important here
is to understand all the
interplay. Mosul is a Sunni
city.

01:16:18.474 --> 01:16:25.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mosul is on the border of Syria.
And, yes, we do need to go after
Baghdadi, and -- just

01:16:25.147 --> 01:16:29.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like we went after bin Laden,
while you were doing "Celebrity
Apprentice," and we brought

01:16:29.418 --> 01:16:33.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him to justice. We need to
go after the leadership.

01:16:33.823 --> 01:16:38.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we need to get rid of them,
get rid of their fighters. There
are an estimated several

01:16:38.961 --> 01:16:43.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thousand fighters in Mosul.
They've been digging
underground. They've been
prepared to defend.

01:16:43.566 --> 01:16:46.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's going to be tough fighting.
But I think we can take back
Mosul, and then we can move

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:50.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on into Syria and
take back Raqqa.

01:16:50.573 --> 01:16:56.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is what we have to do. I'm
just amazed that he seems to
think that the Iraqi government

01:16:56.979 --> 01:17:02.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and our allies and everybody
else launched the attack on
Mosul to help me in this
election,

01:17:02.518 --> 01:17:05.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but that's how Donald thinks.
You know, he always is looking
for some conspiracy.

01:17:05.888 --> 01:17:07.056 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
TRUMP: Chris, we
don't gain anything.

01:17:07.056 --> 01:17:07.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: He has all the
conspiracy theories...

01:17:07.756 --> 01:17:09.024 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:17:09.024 --> 01:17:10.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Iran is taking over Iraq.

01:17:10.192 --> 01:17:10.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Secretary
Clinton, it's...

01:17:10.759 --> 01:17:12.628 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:17:12.628 --> 01:17:13.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: Iran is taking over
Iraq. We don't gain anything.

01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:14.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: This conspiracy theory,
which he's been spewing out for
quite some time.

01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:15.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: If they did
it by surprise...

01:17:15.231 --> 01:17:17.399 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:17:17.399 --> 01:17:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: Wait, wait, wait,
Secretary Clinton, it's an open
discussion.

01:17:17.366 --> 01:17:18.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: He says...

01:17:18.234 --> 01:17:20.102 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:17:20.102 --> 01:17:22.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: We could have gained
if they did it by surprise.

01:17:22.071 --> 01:17:24.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WALLACE: Secretary, please
let Mr. Trump speak.

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:27.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: ... unfit, and he
proves it every time he talks.

01:17:27.209 --> 01:17:30.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRUMP: No, you are the one
that's unfit. You know,
WikiLeaks just actually came out
-- John

01:17:30.679 --> 01:17:36.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Podesta said some horrible
things about you, and, boy, was
he right. He said some beauties.

01:17:36.519 --> 01:17:40.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you know, Bernie Sanders, he
said you have bad judgment. You
do.

01:17:40.689 --> 01:17:46.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you think that going into
Mosul after we let the world
know we're going in, and

01:17:46.595 --> 01:17:51.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all of the people that we really
wanted -- the leaders -- they're
all gone. If you think

01:17:51.834 --> 01:17:56.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that was good, then you do. Now,
John Podesta said you have
terrible instincts. Bernie
Sanders

01:17:56.171 --> 01:17:59.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said you have bad judgment.
I agree with both.

01:17:59.942 --> 01:18:02.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, you should ask
Bernie Sanders who he's
supporting for president. And he

01:18:02.444 --> 01:18:03.746 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has said...

01:18:03.746 --> 01:18:06.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Which is a big mistake.

01:18:06.115 --> 01:18:08.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: ... as he has
campaigned for me around the
country, you are the most
dangerous person

01:18:08.951 --> 01:18:15.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to run for president in the
modern history of America. I
think he's right.

01:18:15.057 --> 01:18:22.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: Let's turn to Aleppo.
Mr. Trump, in the last debate,
you were both asked about

01:18:22.998 --> 01:18:28.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the situation in the Syrian city
of Aleppo. And I want to follow
up on that, because you

01:18:28.604 --> 01:18:35.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said several things in that
debate which were not true, sir.
You said that Aleppo has
basically

01:18:35.177 --> 01:18:38.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fallen. In fact, there -- in
fact, there are... TRUMP: It's a
catastrophe. I mean...

01:18:38.414 --> 01:18:38.981 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
WALLACE: It's a
catastrophe, but there...

01:18:38.981 --> 01:18:40.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: ... it's a mess.

01:18:40.282 --> 01:18:41.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: There are
a quarter of...

01:18:41.483 --> 01:18:41.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Have you seen
it? Have you seen it?

01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:43.586 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WALLACE: Sir...

01:18:43.586 --> 01:18:45.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: Have you seen what's
happening to Aleppo?

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:46.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Sir, if I may
finish my question...

01:18:46.255 --> 01:18:49.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: OK, so it hasn't
fallen. Take a look at it.

01:18:49.692 --> 01:18:51.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALLACE: Well, there are a
quarter of a million people
still living there and being
slaughtered.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: That's right. And they
are being slaughtered...

01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:54.964 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WALLACE: Yes.

01:18:54.964 --> 01:18:56.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: ... because
of bad decisions.

01:18:56.899 --> 01:19:02.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: If I may just finish
here, and you also said that --
that Syria and Russia are

01:19:02.938 --> 01:19:08.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
busy fighting ISIS. In fact,
they have been the ones who've
been bombing and shelling

01:19:08.444 --> 01:19:13.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
eastern Aleppo, and they just
announced a humanitarian pause,
in effect, admitting that

01:19:13.816 --> 01:19:17.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have been bombing and
shelling Aleppo. Would you like
to clear that up, sir?

01:19:17.019 --> 01:19:23.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Well, Aleppo is a
disaster. It's a humanitarian
nightmare. But it has fallen

01:19:23.158 --> 01:19:26.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the -- from any standpoint.
I mean, what do you need, a
signed document? Take a look

01:19:26.261 --> 01:19:30.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at Aleppo. It is so sad when
you see what's happened.

01:19:30.165 --> 01:19:37.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a lot of this is because of
Hillary Clinton, because what's
happened is, by fighting Assad,

01:19:37.339 --> 01:19:41.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who turned out to be a lot
tougher than she thought, and
now she's going to say, oh, he

01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:48.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
loves Assad, she's -- he's just
much tougher and much smarter
than her and Obama. And everyone

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:53.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thought he was gone two years
ago, three years ago. He -- he
aligned with Russia.

01:19:53.355 --> 01:20:00.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He now also aligned with Iran,
who we made very powerful. We
gave them $150 billion back.

01:20:00.529 --> 01:20:06.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We give them $1.7 billion in
cash. I mean, cash. Bundles of
cash as big as this stage.

01:20:06.635 --> 01:20:10.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We gave them $1.7 billion.

01:20:10.205 --> 01:20:18.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now they have -- he has aligned
with Russia and with Iran. They
don't want ISIS, but they

01:20:18.147 --> 01:20:23.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have other things, because we're
backing -- we're backing rebels.
We don't know who the rebels

01:20:23.585 --> 01:20:29.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are. We're giving them lots of
money, lots of everything. We
don't know who the rebels

01:20:29.425 --> 01:20:33.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are. And when and if -- and it's
not going to happen, because you
have Russia and you

01:20:33.262 --> 01:20:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have Iran now. But if they ever
did overthrow Assad, you might
end up with -- as bad as

01:20:38.333 --> 01:20:45.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Assad is, and he's a bad guy,
but you may very well end up
with worse than Assad.

01:20:45.174 --> 01:20:51.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If she did nothing, we'd be in
much better shape. And this is
what's caused the great

01:20:51.447 --> 01:20:57.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
migration, where she's taking in
tens of thousands of Syrian
refugees, who probably in many
cases

01:20:57.619 --> 01:20:59.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
-- not probably, who
are definitely...

01:20:59.655 --> 01:21:02.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Let me...

01:21:02.057 --> 01:21:05.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: ... in many cases,
ISIS-aligned, and we now have
them in our country, and wait

01:21:05.561 --> 01:21:09.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
until you see -- this is going
to be the great Trojan horse.
And wait until you see what

01:21:09.565 --> 01:21:14.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happens in the coming years.
Lots of luck, Hillary. Thanks a
lot for doing a great job.

01:21:14.903 --> 01:21:19.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, you
have talked about -- and in the
last debate and again

01:21:19.108 --> 01:21:24.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today -- that you would impose a
no-fly zone to try to protect
the people of Aleppo and

01:21:24.246 --> 01:21:27.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to stop the killing there.
President Obama has refused to
do that because he fears it's

01:21:27.916 --> 01:21:31.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to draw us closer or
deeper into the conflict.

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:36.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And General Joseph Dunford, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, says you impose

01:21:36.191 --> 01:21:41.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a no-fly zone, chances are
you're going to get into a war
-- his words -- with Syria

01:21:41.530 --> 01:21:47.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Russia. So the question I
have is, if you impose a no-fly
zone -- first of all,

01:21:47.136 --> 01:21:51.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how do you respond to their
concerns? Secondly, if you
impose a no-fly zone and a
Russian

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:55.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plane violates that, does
President Clinton shoot that
plane down?

01:21:55.077 --> 01:22:00.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, Chris, first of
all, I think a no-fly zone could
save lives and could hasten

01:22:00.649 --> 01:22:04.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the end of the conflict. I'm
well aware of the really
legitimate concerns that you
have

01:22:04.686 --> 01:22:08.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
expressed from both the
president and the general.

01:22:08.991 --> 01:22:13.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This would not be done just on
the first day. This would take a
lot of negotiation. And

01:22:13.896 --> 01:22:17.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it would also take making it
clear to the Russians and the
Syrians that our purpose

01:22:17.466 --> 01:22:22.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
here was to provide safe
zones on the ground.

01:22:22.037 --> 01:22:28.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We've had millions of people
leave Syria and those millions
of people inside Syria who

01:22:28.210 --> 01:22:34.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been dislocated. So I think
we could strike a deal and make
it very clear to the

01:22:34.082 --> 01:22:38.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russians and the Syrians that
this was something that we
believe was in the best
interests

01:22:38.854 --> 01:22:43.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the people on the ground in
Syria, it would help us with our
fight against ISIS.

01:22:43.425 --> 01:22:49.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I want to respond to what
Donald said about refugees. He's
made these claims repeatedly.

01:22:49.231 --> 01:22:55.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am not going to let anyone
into this country who is not
vetted, who we do not have
confidence

01:22:55.304 --> 01:23:00.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in. But I am not going to slam
the door on women and children.
That picture of that little

01:23:00.542 --> 01:23:05.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with
the blood coming down his face
while he sat in an ambulance,

01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:11.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is haunting. And so we are going
to do very careful, thorough
vetting. That does not solve

01:23:11.486 --> 01:23:17.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our internal challenges with
ISIS and our need to stop
radicalization, to work with

01:23:17.292 --> 01:23:23.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
American Muslim communities who
are on the front lines to
identify and prevent attacks.

01:23:23.198 --> 01:23:32.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, the killer of the
dozens of people at the
nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse
nightclub,

01:23:32.341 --> 01:23:37.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was born in Queens, the same
place Donald was born. So let's
be clear about what the

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:42.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
threat is and how we are best
going to be able to meet it.

01:23:42.351 --> 01:23:47.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, yes, some of that threat
emanates from over in Syria and
Iraq, and we've got to keep

01:23:47.389 --> 01:23:51.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fighting, and I will defeat
ISIS, and some of it is we have
to up our game and be much

01:23:51.126 --> 01:23:52.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
smarter here at home.

01:23:52.794 --> 01:23:53.562 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WALLACE: Folks, I want to
get into our final segment.

01:23:53.562 --> 01:23:54.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: But I just have to...

01:23:54.429 --> 01:23:56.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Real quick.

01:23:56.698 --> 01:23:59.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: It's so ridiculous what
she -- she will defeat ISIS. We
should have never let

01:23:59.968 --> 01:24:01.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISIS happen in the first place.
And right now, they're in 32
countries.

01:24:01.670 --> 01:24:04.439 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WALLACE: OK.

01:24:04.439 --> 01:24:09.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRUMP: We should have -- wait
one second. They had a
cease-fire three weeks ago. A
cease-fire,

01:24:09.378 --> 01:24:14.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United States, Russia, and
Syria. And during the
cease-fire, Russia took over
vast

01:24:14.449 --> 01:24:19.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
swatches of land, and then they
said we don't want the
cease-fire anymore.

01:24:19.121 --> 01:24:25.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are so outplayed on missiles,
on cease-fires. They are
outplayed. Now, she wasn't
there.

01:24:25.761 --> 01:24:32.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I assume she had nothing to do
with it. But our country is so
outplayed by Putin and Assad,

01:24:32.567 --> 01:24:38.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and by the way -- and by Iran.
Nobody can believe how stupid
our leadership is.

01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:42.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: Mr. Trump, Secretary
Clinton -- no, we need to move
on to our final segment, and

01:24:42.678 --> 01:24:47.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that is the national debt, which
has not been discussed until
tonight.

01:24:47.616 --> 01:24:54.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our national debt, as a share of
the economy, our GDP, is now 77
percent. That's the highest

01:24:54.189 --> 01:25:00.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since just after World War II.
But the nonpartisan Committee
for a Responsible Federal Budget

01:25:00.162 --> 01:25:06.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says, Secretary Clinton, under
your plan, debt would rise to 86
percent of GDP over

01:25:06.368 --> 01:25:12.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the next 10 years. Mr. Trump,
under your plan, they say it
would rise to 105 percent of GDP

01:25:12.474 --> 01:25:17.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the next 10 years. The
question is, why are both of you
ignoring this problem? Mr.

01:25:17.045 --> 01:25:19.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump, you go first.

01:25:19.581 --> 01:25:23.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, I say they're
wrong, because I'm going to
create tremendous jobs. And
we're

01:25:23.185 --> 01:25:27.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bringing GDP from, really, 1
percent, which is what it is
now, and if she got in, it will

01:25:27.823 --> 01:25:34.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be less than zero. But we're
bringing it from 1 percent up to
4 percent. And I actually

01:25:34.096 --> 01:25:38.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think we can go higher than 4
percent. I think you can go to 5
percent or 6 percent. And

01:25:38.867 --> 01:25:43.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if we do, you don't have to
bother asking your question,
because we have a tremendous

01:25:43.705 --> 01:25:50.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
machine. We will have created a
tremendous economic machine once
again. To do that, we're

01:25:50.779 --> 01:25:55.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
taking back jobs. We're not
going to let our companies be
raided by other countries where

01:25:55.517 --> 01:26:01.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we lose all our jobs, we don't
make our product anymore. It's
very sad. But I'm going to
create

01:26:01.256 --> 01:26:06.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a -- the kind of a country that
we were from the standpoint of
industry. We used to be

01:26:06.094 --> 01:26:12.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there. We've given it up. We've
become very, very sloppy.

01:26:12.334 --> 01:26:16.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We've had people that are
political hacks making the
biggest deals in the world,
bigger

01:26:16.471 --> 01:26:20.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than companies. You take these
big companies, these trade deals
are far bigger than these

01:26:20.509 --> 01:26:25.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
companies, and yet we don't use
our great leaders, many of whom
back me and many of

01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:29.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whom back Hillary, I must say.
But we don't use those people.
Those are the people -- these

01:26:29.484 --> 01:26:32.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are the greatest negotiators in
the world. We have the greatest
businesspeople in the

01:26:32.154 --> 01:26:35.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
world. We have to use them to
negotiate our trade deals.

01:26:35.924 --> 01:26:41.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We use political hacks. We use
people that get the position
because they gave -- they

01:26:41.129 --> 01:26:45.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made a campaign contribution and
they're dealing with China and
people that are very much
smarter

01:26:45.767 --> 01:26:49.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than they are. So we have
to use our great people.

01:26:49.805 --> 01:26:56.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that being said, we will
create an economic machine the
likes of which we haven't seen

01:26:56.611 --> 01:27:02.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in many decades. And people,
Chris, will again go back to
work and they'll make a lot of

01:27:02.517 --> 01:27:06.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
money. And we'll have companies
that will grow and expand and
start from new.

01:27:06.688 --> 01:27:09.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?

01:27:09.491 --> 01:27:14.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, first, when I
hear Donald talk like that and
know that his slogan is "Make

01:27:14.529 --> 01:27:22.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
America Great Again," I wonder
when he thought America was
great. And before he rushes and

01:27:22.671 --> 01:27:26.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says, "You know, before you and
President Obama were there," I
think it's important

01:27:26.208 --> 01:27:32.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to recognize that he has been
criticizing our government for
decades.

01:27:32.547 --> 01:27:41.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, back in 1987, he took
out a $100,000 ad in the New
York Times, during the time

01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:47.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when President Reagan was
president, and basically said
exactly what he just said now,
that we

01:27:47.462 --> 01:27:52.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were the laughingstock of the
world. He was criticizing
President Reagan. This is the

01:27:52.834 --> 01:27:58.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way Donald thinks about himself,
puts himself into, you know, the
middle and says, "You

01:27:58.673 --> 01:28:03.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know, I alone can fix it," as he
said on the convention stage.

01:28:03.612 --> 01:28:09.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you look at the debt,
which is the issue you asked
about, Chris, I pay for
everything

01:28:09.551 --> 01:28:15.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm proposing. I do not add a
penny to the national debt. I
take that very seriously,

01:28:15.757 --> 01:28:20.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because I do think it's one of
the issues we've got to come to
grips with.

01:28:20.529 --> 01:28:24.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So when I talk about how we're
going to pay for education, how
we're going to invest in

01:28:24.699 --> 01:28:28.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
infrastructure, how we're going
to get the cost of prescription
drugs down, and a lot

01:28:28.837 --> 01:28:33.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the other issues that people
talk to me about all the time,
I've made it very clear

01:28:33.408 --> 01:28:37.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we are going where the money is.
We are going to ask the wealthy
and corporations to pay

01:28:37.546 --> 01:28:40.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their fair share.

01:28:40.382 --> 01:28:46.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And there is no evidence
whatsoever that that will slow
down or diminish our growth. In

01:28:46.521 --> 01:28:51.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fact, I think just the opposite.
We'll have what economists call
middle-out growth. We've

01:28:51.826 --> 01:28:57.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got to get back to rebuilding
the middle class, the families
of America. That's where growth

01:28:57.566 --> 01:29:02.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will come from. That's why I
want to invest in you. I want to
invest in your family.

01:29:02.337 --> 01:29:07.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that's the smartest
way to grow the economy, to make
the economy fairer. And

01:29:07.309 --> 01:29:10.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we just have a big disagreement
about this. It may be because of
our experiences. You

01:29:10.779 --> 01:29:13.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know, he started off with
his dad as a millionaire...

01:29:13.715 --> 01:29:14.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Yeah, yeah, we've heard
-- we've heard this before,
Hillary.

01:29:14.516 --> 01:29:15.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: I started off with --
my dad was a small-business man.

01:29:15.283 --> 01:29:17.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: We've heard this before.

01:29:17.619 --> 01:29:20.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: And I think it -- you
know, it's a difference that
affects how we see the world

01:29:20.555 --> 01:29:21.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and what we want to
do with the economy.

01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:23.291 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WALLACE: Time.

01:29:23.291 --> 01:29:24.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: Thank you, Hillary.
Could I just respond?

01:29:24.993 --> 01:29:26.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WALLACE: Well, no, sir, because
we're running out of time...

01:29:26.595 --> 01:29:29.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Because I did disagree
with Ronald Reagan very strongly
on trade. I disagreed

01:29:29.998 --> 01:29:33.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with him. We should have been
much tougher on trade even then.
I've been waiting for

01:29:33.501 --> 01:29:34.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
years. Nobody does it right.

01:29:34.536 --> 01:29:36.271 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WALLACE: OK.

01:29:36.271 --> 01:29:38.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: And frankly, now
we're going to do it right.

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:42.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: All right. The one last
area I want to get into with you
in this debate is the

01:29:42.744 --> 01:29:49.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fact that the biggest driver of
our debt is entitlements, which
is 60 percent of all federal

01:29:49.618 --> 01:29:53.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spending. Now, the Committee for
federal -- a Responsible Federal
Budget has looked at both

01:29:53.888 --> 01:29:58.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of your plans and they say
neither of you has a serious
plan that is going to solve

01:29:58.727 --> 01:30:02.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the fact that Medicare's going
to run out of money in the
2020s, Social Security is

01:30:02.897 --> 01:30:06.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to run out of money in the
2030s, and at that time,
recipients are going to take

01:30:06.935 --> 01:30:10.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
huge cuts in their benefits.

01:30:10.272 --> 01:30:14.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, in effect, the final
question I want to ask you in
this regard is -- and let me
start

01:30:14.809 --> 01:30:20.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with you, Mr. Trump, would
President Trump make a deal to
save Medicare and Social
Security

01:30:20.548 --> 01:30:26.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that included both tax increases
and benefit cuts, in effect, a
grand bargain on entitlements?

01:30:26.821 --> 01:30:29.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: I'm cutting taxes. We're
going to grow the economy. It's
going to grow at a record

01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:30.925 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
rate of growth.

01:30:30.925 --> 01:30:32.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WALLACE: That's not going to
help in the entitlements.

01:30:32.527 --> 01:30:37.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: No, it's going to totally
help you. And one thing we have
to do: Repeal and replace

01:30:37.565 --> 01:30:43.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the disaster known as Obamacare.
It's destroying our country.
It's destroying our businesses,

01:30:43.571 --> 01:30:49.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our small business and our big
businesses. We have to repeal
and replace Obamacare.

01:30:49.444 --> 01:30:54.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You take a look at the kind of
numbers that that will cost us
in the year '17, it is a

01:30:54.783 --> 01:31:00.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
disaster. If we don't repeal and
replace -- now, it's probably
going to die of its own weight.

01:31:00.155 --> 01:31:05.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Obamacare has to go. It's --
the premiums are going up 60
percent, 70 percent, 80 percent.

01:31:05.126 --> 01:31:09.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Next year they're going to
go up over 100 percent.

01:31:09.597 --> 01:31:13.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm really glad that the
premiums have started -- at
least the people see what's

01:31:13.968 --> 01:31:18.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happening, because she wants to
keep Obamacare and she wants to
make it even worse, and it

01:31:18.606 --> 01:31:22.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can't get any worse. Bad health
care at the most expensive
price. We have to repeal and

01:31:22.610 --> 01:31:25.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
replace Obamacare.

01:31:25.046 --> 01:31:30.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: And, Secretary Clinton,
same question, because at this
point, Social Security and

01:31:30.585 --> 01:31:34.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Medicare are going to run out,
the trust funds are going to run
out of money. Will you as

01:31:34.489 --> 01:31:40.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president entertain -- will you
consider a grand bargain, a deal
that includes both tax

01:31:40.428 --> 01:31:44.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
increases and benefit cuts to
try to save both programs?

01:31:44.799 --> 01:31:49.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, Chris, I am on
record as saying that we need to
put more money into the Social

01:31:49.637 --> 01:31:57.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Security Trust Fund. That's part
of my commitment to raise taxes
on the wealthy. My Social
Security

01:31:57.011 --> 01:32:02.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
payroll contribution will go up,
as will Donald's, assuming he
can't figure out how to get out

01:32:02.384 --> 01:32:05.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of it. But what we want to do is
to replenish the Social Security
Trust Fund...

01:32:05.587 --> 01:32:07.889 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Such a nasty woman.

01:32:07.889 --> 01:32:14.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: ... by making sure that
we have sufficient resources,
and that will come from either

01:32:14.129 --> 01:32:19.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
raising the cap and/or finding
other ways to get more money
into it. I will not cut

01:32:19.234 --> 01:32:25.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
benefits. I want to enhance
benefits for low-income workers
and for women who have been
disadvantaged

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:29.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by the current Social
Security system.

01:32:29.677 --> 01:32:36.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what Donald is proposing
with these massive tax cuts will
result in a $20 trillion
additional

01:32:36.818 --> 01:32:42.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
national debt. That will have
dire consequences for Social
Security and Medicare.

01:32:42.090 --> 01:32:46.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'll say something about the
Affordable Care Act, which he
wants to repeal. The Affordable

01:32:46.127 --> 01:32:51.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Care Act extended the solvency
of the Medicare Trust Fund. So
if repeals it, our Medicare

01:32:51.299 --> 01:32:53.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
problem gets worse. What we
need to do is go after...

01:32:53.334 --> 01:32:55.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Your husband
disagrees with you.

01:32:55.537 --> 01:33:00.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLINTON: ... the long-term
health care drivers. We've got
to get costs down, increase
value,

01:33:00.775 --> 01:33:05.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
emphasize wellness. I have a
plan for doing that. And I think
that we will be able to

01:33:05.079 --> 01:33:09.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get entitlement spending under
control by with more resources
and harder decisions.

01:33:09.951 --> 01:33:13.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLACE: This is -- this is the
final time, probably to both of
your delight, that you're

01:33:13.822 --> 01:33:19.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to be on a stage together
in this campaign. I would like
to end it on a positive note.

01:33:19.761 --> 01:33:24.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You had not agreed to closing
statements, but it seems to me
in a funny way that might

01:33:24.666 --> 01:33:28.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
make it more interesting because
you haven't prepared closing
statements.

01:33:28.736 --> 01:33:32.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I'd like you each to take --
and we're going to put a clock
up, a minute, as the

01:33:32.907 --> 01:33:37.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
final question in the final
debate, to tell the American
people why they should elect

01:33:37.879 --> 01:33:40.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you to be the next president.
This is another new
mini-segment. Secretary Clinton,
it's

01:33:40.982 --> 01:33:43.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
your turn to go first.

01:33:43.184 --> 01:33:48.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, I would like to
say to everyone watching tonight
that I'm reaching out to

01:33:48.990 --> 01:33:54.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all Americans -- Democrats,
Republicans, and independents --
because we need everybody

01:33:54.028 --> 01:33:59.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to help make our country what it
should be, to grow the economy,
to make it fairer, to

01:33:59.434 --> 01:34:04.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
make it work for everyone. We
need your talents, your skills,
your commitments, your energy,

01:34:04.205 --> 01:34:06.574 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your ambition.

01:34:06.574 --> 01:34:11.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, I've been privileged
to see the presidency up close.
And I know the awesome

01:34:11.212 --> 01:34:16.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
responsibility of protecting our
country and the incredible
opportunity of working to try

01:34:16.384 --> 01:34:21.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make life better for all of
you. I have made the cause of
children and families really

01:34:21.723 --> 01:34:24.959 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my life's work.

01:34:24.959 --> 01:34:29.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what my mission will be
in the presidency. I will stand
up for families against powerful

01:34:29.864 --> 01:34:35.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interests, against corporations.
I will do everything that I can
to make sure that you

01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:40.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have good jobs, with rising
incomes, that your kids have
good educations from preschool

01:34:40.375 --> 01:34:44.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through college. I hope you will
give me a chance to serve as
your president.

01:34:44.279 --> 01:34:45.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALLACE: Secretary
Clinton, thank you.

01:34:45.547 --> 01:34:48.082 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mr. Trump?

01:34:48.082 --> 01:34:53.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: She's raising the money
from the people she wants to
control. Doesn't work that way.

01:34:53.187 --> 01:34:58.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But when I started this
campaign, I started it very
strongly. It's called "Make
America

01:34:58.726 --> 01:35:02.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Great Again." We're going to
make America great. We have a
depleted military. It has

01:35:02.797 --> 01:35:07.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be helped, has to be fixed.
We have the greatest people on
Earth in our military.

01:35:07.068 --> 01:35:10.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't take care of our
veterans. We take care of
illegal immigrants, people that
come

01:35:10.605 --> 01:35:15.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into the country illegally,
better than we take care of our
vets. That can't happen.

01:35:15.143 --> 01:35:21.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our policemen and women are
disrespected. We need law and
order, but we need justice,

01:35:21.015 --> 01:35:26.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
too. Our inner cities are a
disaster. You get shot walking
to the store. They have no

01:35:26.921 --> 01:35:30.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
education. They have no jobs. I
will do more for
African-Americans and Latinos
than she

01:35:30.091 --> 01:35:33.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
can ever do in 10 lifetimes.

01:35:33.895 --> 01:35:39.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All she's done is talk to the
African-Americans and to the
Latinos, but they get the vote,

01:35:39.467 --> 01:35:43.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then they come back, they
say, we'll see you in four
years. We are going to make
America

01:35:43.504 --> 01:35:49.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strong again, and we are going
to make America great again, and
it has to start now. We cannot

01:35:49.043 --> 01:35:53.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take four more years of Barack
Obama, and that's what you get
when you get her.

Secretary Clinton -- hold on
just a moment, folks. Secretary
Clinton, Mr. Trump, I want

01:36:01.122 --> 01:36:05.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to thank you both for
participating in all three of
these debates.

01:36:05.426 --> 01:36:09.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That brings to an end this
year's debates sponsored by the
Commission on Presidential

01:36:09.397 --> 01:36:12.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Debates. We want to thank the
University of Nevada, Las Vegas,
and its students for having

01:36:12.834 --> 01:36:17.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
us. Now the decision
is up to you.

01:36:17.005 --> 01:36:22.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
While millions have already
voted, Election Day, November
8th, is just 20 days away. One

01:36:22.276 --> 01:36:27.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thing everyone here can agree
on: We hope you will go vote. It
is one of the honors

01:36:27.181 --> 01:36:33.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and obligations of living in
this great country. Thank you,
and good night.

01:36:33.788 --> 01:36:39.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that wraps up
the final presidential debate
between Donald Trump and

01:36:39.661 --> 01:36:45.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, as we watch the
candidates walk across the stage
to shake the hand of

01:36:45.967 --> 01:36:50.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the moderator, Chris Wallace,
and presumably their families
will join them on stage in

01:36:50.672 --> 01:36:53.107 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a moment.

01:36:53.107 --> 01:36:57.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Joining me here in our
Washington studio, syndicated
columnist Mark Shields, New York

01:36:57.245 --> 01:37:02.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Times columnist David Brooks,
and Amy Walter of The Cook
Political Report.

01:37:02.450 --> 01:37:07.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Brooks, it started out on
a civil note. That lasted about
15 or 20 minutes. Then they

01:37:07.622 --> 01:37:12.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got into I can think a number of
subjects around abortion and the
Supreme Court.

01:37:12.794 --> 01:37:17.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, by the end of it, Donald
Trump was calling Hillary
Clinton a nasty woman and a
liar.

01:37:17.865 --> 01:37:20.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we heard a lot.

01:37:20.034 --> 01:37:22.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I counted 27
minutes of civility. That may be
exceeding expectations.

01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:25.473 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:37:25.473 --> 01:37:30.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I thought it was
-- well, the headline of the
night is going to be the -- when

01:37:30.311 --> 01:37:32.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he was asked if he would support
the election, and he said, I
will keep you in suspense about

01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:34.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that over the election results.

01:37:34.882 --> 01:37:35.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is going to be the headline
of the night. It's hard to
believe we've...

01:37:35.450 --> 01:37:35.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER, The Cook
Political Report: For sure.

01:37:35.850 --> 01:37:36.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For sure.

01:37:36.784 --> 01:37:38.886 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:37:38.886 --> 01:37:41.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: ... presidential
candidate say that in a national
debate.

01:37:41.422 --> 01:37:45.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I, frankly, thought it one of
the best debate performances
that Hillary Clinton has ever

01:37:45.426 --> 01:37:49.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
given. I thought he was -- he
has improved, but she gave four
answers that I think knocked

01:37:49.931 --> 01:37:54.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him out of the park, especially
on the sexual abuse issue, on 30
years of experience, on

01:37:54.168 --> 01:37:57.071 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that episode.

01:37:57.071 --> 01:38:03.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She gave some extremely strong
and coherent and Michelle
Obama-esque answers.

01:38:03.010 --> 01:38:09.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it was
Michelle Obama, Mark, who said,
"When they go low, we go high."

01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:13.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chris Wallace, at the end, asked
them both to be positive, but we
heard some -- we heard

01:38:13.855 --> 01:38:15.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
negative language
to the very end.

01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:18.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: We did.

01:38:18.126 --> 01:38:23.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I thought Trump was better
temperamentally tonight than he
had been in any of the debates.

01:38:23.898 --> 01:38:28.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If he had been that in the first
debate, I think it would have
been -- it would have

01:38:28.336 --> 01:38:30.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
been a different race.

01:38:30.905 --> 01:38:36.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think we come back to the
tape. The tape is a killer to
him. And I think that...

01:38:36.844 --> 01:38:37.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean the
"Access Hollywood" audiotape.

01:38:37.979 --> 01:38:40.448 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:38:40.448 --> 01:38:45.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think the
dynamic of tonight, it was his
bad moment. I don't think people

01:38:45.987 --> 01:38:51.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
believe him. And it was
her better moment.

01:38:51.392 --> 01:38:57.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I -- he didn't get the lift
he needed. And I thought there
were episodes of just

01:38:57.732 --> 01:39:00.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
incoherence on his part.

01:39:00.434 --> 01:39:05.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I disagree with David. I thought
Hillary had some great answers,
but I thought there were

01:39:05.506 --> 01:39:13.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
excessive phases of just sort of
bland, predictable prose. We're
going to grow the -- how many

01:39:13.548 --> 01:39:18.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
times are we going to grow the
economy? Is that a phrase that
has sort of reached its

01:39:18.953 --> 01:39:20.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
saturation point or
expiration date?

01:39:20.788 --> 01:39:23.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter?

01:39:23.157 --> 01:39:27.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: So, the only
question coming out of this
debate was whether or not he
could

01:39:27.662 --> 01:39:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stop what was looking like a
freefall in the polls and
whether that freefall was also
going

01:39:32.333 --> 01:39:39.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to hurt the down-ballot
candidates, especially Senate
candidates, in battleground
states.

01:39:39.907 --> 01:39:44.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think it really helped
at all here. And David is right.
The headline is that a

01:39:44.712 --> 01:39:48.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president -- a candidate running
for president of the United
States of America said, I don't

01:39:48.749 --> 01:39:54.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know if I'm going to abide by
the decision made by voters.

01:39:54.488 --> 01:40:01.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is just an unbelievable
statement. And the number one
challenge that Donald Trump

01:40:01.596 --> 01:40:06.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
has had throughout this
campaign, when you look at where
he has fallen flat with voters,

01:40:06.968 --> 01:40:10.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is on the question, do you think
that Donald Trump has the
judgment and the temperament

01:40:10.238 --> 01:40:12.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to be president of
the United States?

01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:19.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has trailed Hillary Clinton
on that time and time again.
It's now a gaping chasm on

01:40:19.180 --> 01:40:28.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that issue. And he did not
challenge her on that and help
expand his -- do any better

01:40:28.356 --> 01:40:31.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on that the question of judgment
and temperament tonight, either
by interrupting her, and then,

01:40:31.926 --> 01:40:36.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of course, by making the
statement he did that he's going
to keep people in suspense.

01:40:36.197 --> 01:40:40.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we should
note that he said this on a day
when both his vice presidential

01:40:40.601 --> 01:40:45.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
running mate, Mike Pence, who we
see there in the audience, has
been saying -- and he

01:40:45.406 --> 01:40:48.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said it again today -- that we
will accept the results of the
election, his daughter

01:40:48.843 --> 01:40:52.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ivanka Trump said today that
she expected her father would.

01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:58.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's listen to that part of the
debate where moderator Chris
Wallace asked Donald Trump

01:40:58.119 --> 01:41:02.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
directly, will you accept the
result no matter what it is?

01:41:02.423 --> 01:41:05.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I will look at it
at the time. I'm not looking at
anything now. I will look

01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:08.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at it at the time.

01:41:08.663 --> 01:41:14.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What I have seen -- what I have
seen is so bad. First of all,
the media is so dishonest

01:41:14.502 --> 01:41:19.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and so corrupt, and the pile-on
is so amazing. The New York
Times actually wrote an article

01:41:19.607 --> 01:41:22.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about it, but they don't even
care. It's so dishonest. And
they've poisoned the minds

01:41:22.877 --> 01:41:25.579 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the voters.

01:41:25.579 --> 01:41:28.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, unfortunately for them, I
think the voters are seeing
through it. I think they're
going

01:41:28.749 --> 01:41:31.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to see through it. We'll
find out on November 8.

01:41:31.185 --> 01:41:37.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you look at your voter rolls,
you will see millions of people
that are registered

01:41:37.224 --> 01:41:41.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to vote, millions -- this isn't
coming from me -- this is coming
from Pew report and other

01:41:41.262 --> 01:41:47.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
places -- millions of people
that are registered to vote that
shouldn't be registered to vote.

01:41:47.268 --> 01:41:50.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS WALLACE, Moderator: Are
you saying you're not prepared
now to commit to that principle?

01:41:50.338 --> 01:41:51.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: What I'm saying is
that I will tell you at the
time. I will keep you in
suspense.

01:41:51.639 --> 01:41:54.275 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

01:41:54.275 --> 01:41:56.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well,
Chris, let me respond to that,
because that's horrifying.

01:41:56.243 --> 01:42:00.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, it doesn't
get any plainer, I guess, than
that.

01:42:00.481 --> 01:42:04.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. And I
wonder if it will hurt him.

01:42:04.418 --> 01:42:10.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reason we concede elections,
and the reason why every
candidate in our history has
conceded

01:42:10.191 --> 01:42:13.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
elections, and has said so all
along that they respect the will
of the voters, is because

01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:16.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this is coherence
of the country.

01:42:16.664 --> 01:42:22.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The struggle for power can get
ruthless in the world. And when
you -- and you can lead

01:42:22.336 --> 01:42:27.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to war. It can lead to conflict.
It can lead to barbarity. And
the reason we don't do fall

01:42:27.041 --> 01:42:29.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into barbarity is because not
that we're wonderful people, but
we have certain customs and
standards

01:42:29.210 --> 01:42:32.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
which we adhere to.

01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:36.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And not adhering to those
customs and standards really
does put you on the edge of some
sort

01:42:36.117 --> 01:42:38.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of dissent from the system we
have enjoyed, which is not only
based on the laws, but our

01:42:38.552 --> 01:42:41.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
attitudes toward the laws.

01:42:41.655 --> 01:42:47.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so he is violating and
corrupting those attitudes. How
many people in America agree

01:42:47.661 --> 01:42:51.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with him? Well, people have done
studies of this, and somewhere
between a third and 40

01:42:51.732 --> 01:42:55.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
percent think they don't trust
our system of government
anymore.

01:42:55.136 --> 01:42:59.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so this is a time of maximum
cynicism, which he is part of
and also inflamed.

01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:04.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we have been
seeing people at his rallies,
Mark, in recent days say they

01:43:04.945 --> 01:43:06.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
won't accept her. They may not
accept the results of the
election.

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:07.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, that's right.

01:43:07.782 --> 01:43:10.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How
serious do you see this?

01:43:10.317 --> 01:43:12.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think it is
serious. I think it's the lead.
There's no question of it.

01:43:12.787 --> 01:43:16.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have never had a
president do that before.

01:43:16.257 --> 01:43:22.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was in Washington when the
moment of maximum constitutional
crisis, when Richard Nixon

01:43:22.830 --> 01:43:27.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
left the presidency. There were
no tanks in the streets. There
were no rifles. It was

01:43:27.535 --> 01:43:33.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
peaceable. It was peaceful. It
was lawful. And Gerald Ford
became president.

01:43:33.574 --> 01:43:39.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What Trump -- what's wrong with
Trump here is his -- he's
stepping on his basic message.

01:43:39.113 --> 01:43:43.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His basic message is, I'm the
strong guy, I'm the guy. And
now, oh, poor little me.

01:43:43.851 --> 01:43:47.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Woe is me. They have
rigged it on me.

01:43:47.755 --> 01:43:54.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's the strong man as
whiner. And it's just a -- it's
a terrible message. And it

01:43:54.762 --> 01:44:01.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't work politically. But I
think it is a -- I mean, "I will
look at it the time"

01:44:01.869 --> 01:44:07.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is -- Stephen A. Douglas
conceded to Abraham Lincoln
after a bitter campaign and
said,

01:44:07.908 --> 01:44:12.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you know, you are my
president, God bless you.

01:44:12.246 --> 01:44:15.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that -- it was such a
small, small mind and man...

01:44:15.349 --> 01:44:16.484 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:44:16.484 --> 01:44:18.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy.

01:44:18.853 --> 01:44:23.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: If it weren't for
that quote, I think the other
one that would be leading

01:44:23.491 --> 01:44:29.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tonight would be early on, when
the question about the Supreme
Court and who would be appointed

01:44:29.096 --> 01:44:34.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the Supreme Court by each of
these candidates, and Donald
Trump conceded the fact he's
going

01:44:34.301 --> 01:44:40.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to not just appoint pro-life
justices, but that he expects
them to overturn Roe v. Wade.

01:44:40.708 --> 01:44:46.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That would be -- again, if this
were any other campaign, if we
were on parallel Earth 2 in

01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:51.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a normal kind of campaign, that
would have been a really amazing
statement. And, again,

01:44:51.852 --> 01:44:55.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is for a candidate who is
doing very badly with women
candidates, especially suburban

01:44:55.689 --> 01:44:58.325 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
women.

01:44:58.325 --> 01:45:01.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is the kind of statement
that just makes his ability to
dig himself out of the hole

01:45:01.795 --> 01:45:02.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he's in very, very tough.

01:45:02.963 --> 01:45:05.299 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:45:05.299 --> 01:45:06.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I was just going
to say, our -- I will come back
to you in a minute.

01:45:06.967 --> 01:45:11.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our John Yang, "NewsHour"'s John
Yang, is at the debate site at
the University of Nevada,

01:45:11.238 --> 01:45:13.641 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Las Vegas.

01:45:13.641 --> 01:45:16.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John, you're in the spin room.
You have been trying to catch up
with people speaking for

01:45:16.477 --> 01:45:19.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
both campaigns. What
are you hearing?

01:45:19.213 --> 01:45:23.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Judy, I tell you, I
have just spoken to number of
people from the Clinton
campaign,

01:45:23.083 --> 01:45:26.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not only here in the spin
room, but by e-mail.

01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:31.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The two moments that they single
out in this debate were both
Donald Trump moments, one

01:45:31.959 --> 01:45:37.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where he, as you have been
talking about, said he wouldn't
pledge to accept the outcome

01:45:37.631 --> 01:45:43.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the election, and then also
when he wouldn't acknowledge or
wouldn't accept the U.S.
intelligence

01:45:43.337 --> 01:45:49.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
assessment that Russia is behind
the hacks, the WikiLeaks hacks.
They say this shows that

01:45:49.276 --> 01:45:52.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he's unfit for office.

01:45:52.112 --> 01:45:58.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, what I also asked them
that, in all three debates, it
seems that their message has
been

01:45:58.152 --> 01:46:02.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that -- the negative message
against Donald Trump,
essentially that Hillary Clinton
should

01:46:02.656 --> 01:46:06.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be elected because she's
not Donald Trump.

01:46:06.126 --> 01:46:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I asked if she had made the
positive message for herself.
They all pointed to the closing

01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:18.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
statement, which wasn't planned,
as you heard. But they also say
that the pivot starts now,

01:46:18.105 --> 01:46:22.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, in these debates, because
of what Donald Trump has done,
they had to make that. They

01:46:22.209 --> 01:46:26.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had to go after him because
of what he was doing.

01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:32.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say that, from now on, on
the campaign trail, for the next
few weeks, or couple of

01:46:32.019 --> 01:46:38.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weeks, the closing argument is
going to be a positive one,
presenting what Hillary Clinton

01:46:38.692 --> 01:46:43.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will do as president if she's
elected, making a positive
argument for her, rather than
the

01:46:43.864 --> 01:46:47.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
negative argument
against Donald Trump.

01:46:47.034 --> 01:46:52.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, John,
who has been talking, as we
heard, to Clinton and to Trump

01:46:52.206 --> 01:46:56.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
representatives there in the
spin room in Las Vegas.

01:46:56.644 --> 01:47:01.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Brooks, did you hear
Hillary Clinton doing that,
making that pivot from making

01:47:01.782 --> 01:47:04.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the case against Donald Trump to
saying, here is why I'm the
right person?

01:47:04.551 --> 01:47:07.588 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Not really, no.

01:47:07.588 --> 01:47:13.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think she does -- I will give
Mark 20 yards in the 100-yard
field. She does devolve into

01:47:13.661 --> 01:47:17.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cliche and stereotypical thought
when asked to make the positive
case. And her best answers

01:47:17.598 --> 01:47:20.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are attacks at him.

01:47:20.868 --> 01:47:26.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think she has got some
indignation that she's facing
this guy and indignation about

01:47:26.140 --> 01:47:30.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of the things he has said
and his treatment toward women.
In many ways, her entire life

01:47:30.511 --> 01:47:34.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has been in defense of women's
rights. And here comes, at the
climax of her political

01:47:34.014 --> 01:47:37.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
life, her electoral life, a guy
who seems to her a threat and an
insult to all that.

01:47:37.618 --> 01:47:40.354 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And so she's
rightfully indignant.

01:47:40.354 --> 01:47:45.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Has she made a positive case for
herself? I think not. But that
is in part because it's

01:47:45.626 --> 01:47:48.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in both their interests right
now to make him the center of
attention. And he -- she

01:47:48.696 --> 01:47:51.999 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
could have had a
very bad day today.

01:47:51.999 --> 01:47:56.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These video clips of her loose
campaign staff allegedly saying
they are fomenting violence

01:47:56.637 --> 01:48:00.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and doing voter fraud, it could
have been a terrible day for
her. And yet he made himself

01:48:00.074 --> 01:48:02.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the center even of
his own remarks.

01:48:02.409 --> 01:48:05.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He did on
several -- at several points.

01:48:05.846 --> 01:48:09.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All right, our colleague Lisa
Desjardins is in our newsroom
upstairs, who has been looking

01:48:09.817 --> 01:48:11.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at some -- what we
call the fact-check.

01:48:11.752 --> 01:48:15.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa, what did you discover?

01:48:15.689 --> 01:48:18.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, you know,
one of the headlines of this
debate that might not get

01:48:18.225 --> 01:48:21.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as much attention is the amount
of policy that was discussed
tonight.

01:48:21.662 --> 01:48:24.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was certainly the most that I
have think we have seen this
presidential election. And

01:48:24.064 --> 01:48:27.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we want to look at some of the
facts around those policies.

01:48:27.234 --> 01:48:31.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Up near the top, we heard lot
about guns and the Second
Amendment. And Hillary Clinton

01:48:31.238 --> 01:48:37.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made a claim. She claimed that,
in this country, some 33,000
people are killed by guns, die

01:48:37.945 --> 01:48:41.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from gun injuries a year. We
checked that. And according to
the CDC, the latest available

01:48:41.148 --> 01:48:44.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
data shows she's right.

01:48:44.451 --> 01:48:50.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just over 33,000 people are
killed from firearms. But we
really need to add some context,
because

01:48:50.457 --> 01:48:57.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
63 percent, almost two-thirds of
those firearm deaths, are
suicides, not homicide.

01:48:57.531 --> 01:49:02.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also, what is interesting to
know about that number, that is
approximately as many people

01:49:02.035 --> 01:49:07.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are killed in car crashes in
this country as well.
Additionally, the U.S. gun death

01:49:07.708 --> 01:49:14.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rate is about 25 times higher
than the similar rates in
similar high-income countries.

01:49:14.248 --> 01:49:17.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All right, how about a claim
from Donald Trump? We heard a
lot about the economy. Donald
Trump

01:49:17.885 --> 01:49:22.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
claims that the U.S. economy is
stagnant. He used those words --
that word exactly.

01:49:22.122 --> 01:49:28.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Well, if you look at the
numbers, GDP was up almost 2,
almost 2.5 percent last year.

01:49:28.729 --> 01:49:32.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last month -- this is the report
that Donald Trump cited -- the
country gained 156,000

01:49:32.399 --> 01:49:38.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
jobs. So, that certainly is not
stagnant. There is an increase.
But it is below the

01:49:38.105 --> 01:49:42.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ideal and even below what
economists like to see, which is
3 percent GDP growth.

01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:47.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he may have been right when
he said anemic, not stagnant.
Job growth, as Mark Shields

01:49:47.981 --> 01:49:52.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said, a bland, predictable piece
of prose, but an important piece
of policy.

01:49:52.219 --> 01:49:55.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you, Lisa,
for keeping track of all that
and a lot more during the

01:49:55.656 --> 01:49:58.292 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
debate.

01:49:58.292 --> 01:50:01.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark, at this stage in the
campaign, with less than three
weeks to go, how much do these

01:50:01.261 --> 01:50:07.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things matter, whether you get
the exact description right on
the economy or not?

01:50:07.734 --> 01:50:13.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, they matter
into everybody's decision, Judy.
The decision process is very

01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:16.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
personal. But I think the
decision has been made.

01:50:16.643 --> 01:50:23.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just one -- one point where
Hillary did get in trouble in
April of this year, if you will

01:50:23.183 --> 01:50:28.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recall, when she said an unborn
person doesn't have any
constitutional rights. And she
was

01:50:28.155 --> 01:50:32.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attacked by Planned Parenthood
for saying that, because you
have to use the language,

01:50:32.759 --> 01:50:35.229 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
which is fetus.

01:50:35.229 --> 01:50:40.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's interesting. She's gone
from a time when abortion was
safe, legal and rare. Now

01:50:40.267 --> 01:50:46.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Democratic position is,
abortion shall be available. I
mean, it's -- the rare part

01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:52.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has been dropped totally from
the Democratic rhetoric, I think
it's fair to say.

01:50:52.446 --> 01:50:59.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was an ardent, really
unfettered pro-choice advocate
tonight. And she has been
criticized

01:50:59.853 --> 01:51:03.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by some of the pro-choice groups
in the past for talking about
the person who -- of an

01:51:03.690 --> 01:51:06.226 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unborn...

01:51:06.226 --> 01:51:09.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: It's one thing.
Presidential candidates used to
say that, oh, I'm not going

01:51:09.062 --> 01:51:12.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to impose a litmus test here.

01:51:12.232 --> 01:51:16.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that was actually a very
valuable thing to say, because
it did protect -- or at least

01:51:16.136 --> 01:51:18.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
make a pretense that the
judiciary is about the
Constitution, and it's not
strictly a

01:51:18.739 --> 01:51:21.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
political office.

01:51:21.441 --> 01:51:24.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that idea, that we don't
have litmus tests, that's gone.
It's like, we're -- I'm going

01:51:24.311 --> 01:51:24.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to pick the people
who are on my side.

01:51:24.912 --> 01:51:26.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

01:51:26.647 --> 01:51:27.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I mean, and
there's no question about that.

01:51:27.681 --> 01:51:29.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Which has been going
on, right, for quite some while.

01:51:29.349 --> 01:51:34.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's going to pick people who
are going to stand with her on
Citizens United and the

01:51:34.021 --> 01:51:37.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decision there, and he's going
to pick people who stand on
abortion rights.

01:51:37.791 --> 01:51:41.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy, we did hear,
as Lisa said, a lot more about
policy tonight. Chris Wallace

01:51:41.562 --> 01:51:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made a point of ticking off
those six subject areas,
entitlements and debt.

01:51:46.300 --> 01:51:49.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Did we learn anything new
from these candidates?

01:51:49.303 --> 01:51:51.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: No. No,
we really didn't.

01:51:51.872 --> 01:51:56.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, again, this is hard for
somebody who has been following
this all year. So, I recognize

01:51:56.376 --> 01:51:58.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most normal people do not sit
and listen to the candidates,
which is all the time.

01:51:58.879 --> 01:52:01.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: More than a year.

01:52:01.048 --> 01:52:03.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes, more -- it has
felt like a hundred years, this
campaign. So, I recognize

01:52:03.650 --> 01:52:06.253 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

01:52:06.253 --> 01:52:10.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we kind of come back to
where we started in discussing
this debate, which is, there

01:52:10.591 --> 01:52:15.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is still not a lot of substance
there with Donald Trump. It's a
lot of the same talking

01:52:15.929 --> 01:52:20.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
points, but you're not really
getting much more, much more
than that.

01:52:20.968 --> 01:52:25.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, I felt like,
did tick through some of the
talking points that she usually

01:52:25.706 --> 01:52:32.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hits on. But I do feel like
Donald Trump had the opportunity
in this case to give more

01:52:32.012 --> 01:52:36.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
details about the economy. And
looking at the polling, it's the
one issue where people

01:52:36.016 --> 01:52:39.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
say they trust him more
than Hillary Clinton.

01:52:39.152 --> 01:52:44.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And yet, when he had the chance,
when the economy was literally
teed up to him, he pivoted

01:52:44.291 --> 01:52:50.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back to explain himself and the
attack that Hillary Clinton made
on him about missiles

01:52:50.097 --> 01:52:53.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and nuclear weapons.

01:52:53.266 --> 01:52:57.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so any time, even on issue
that is supposedly in his
wheelhouse, he had a hard time
making

01:52:57.871 --> 01:53:00.674 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that case.

01:53:00.674 --> 01:53:02.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I thought that
happened a couple of different
-- several different times,
where

01:53:02.809 --> 01:53:04.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she was able, because of the way
she phrased something, to
frankly get under his skin...

01:53:04.878 --> 01:53:07.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: She did.

01:53:07.214 --> 01:53:10.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... and to get
him -- and to goad him into
probably something he didn't

01:53:10.484 --> 01:53:11.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
mean to talk about.

01:53:11.451 --> 01:53:13.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

01:53:13.854 --> 01:53:18.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I thought her answer of the 30
years was probably the strongest
answer she had, what I was doing

01:53:18.659 --> 01:53:24.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those 30 years and what were you
doing. And I think it -- I think
it did bother him, Judy.

01:53:24.331 --> 01:53:28.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there was another
problem that Trump had tonight.
And that is the denigration of

01:53:28.502 --> 01:53:34.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
America and its leadership: Our
country has no idea. We're
losers.

01:53:34.441 --> 01:53:40.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's one thing to criticize
policy or policy decisions, but,
boy, he makes it sound like

01:53:40.814 --> 01:53:46.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the United States has done
nothing right. And I just -- I
think that our country has

01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:53.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
no idea, I think it has no
political salience or appeal.

01:53:53.226 --> 01:53:53.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I think
I disagree with that.

01:53:53.927 --> 01:53:56.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: OK.

01:53:56.229 --> 01:53:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: That's been his
secret sauce all year, and that
there are -- the level

01:53:59.166 --> 01:54:02.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of anger, the level of disgust,
the level of deep, deep
pessimism is -- that's why we

01:54:02.936 --> 01:54:05.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have Donald Trump.

01:54:05.839 --> 01:54:09.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so he's closing with what
his -- and he closed his debate
comments with his strongest

01:54:09.209 --> 01:54:11.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
close: I'm different.

01:54:11.278 --> 01:54:13.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It's a primary
argument. It's not a general
argument.

01:54:13.747 --> 01:54:18.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, let's -- for
the final minute-and-a-half that
we have left, Amy,

01:54:18.118 --> 01:54:22.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where does this campaign go from
here? We have, what, 20 days --
19 days left.

01:54:22.022 --> 01:54:26.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: We're 19 days now,
19 left. Remember, two million
people have already voted.

01:54:26.526 --> 01:54:29.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this debate, we talk about
changing minds, are there
undecided voters? A lot of folks

01:54:29.863 --> 01:54:33.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have already cast their
ballots before this debate.

01:54:33.366 --> 01:54:39.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think what this debate
reminded us is that the
candidates really are doubling
and tripling

01:54:39.606 --> 01:54:43.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
down on their message, on their
overall closing argument.

01:54:43.076 --> 01:54:47.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For Trump, it's that his base is
more important than expanding
his ceiling. He's going to

01:54:47.914 --> 01:54:51.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
continue to make the same case
he's made in the primaries
throughout the general, even

01:54:51.318 --> 01:54:55.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
though it only appeals to a
narrow slice of Americans,
Hillary Clinton going to
continue

01:54:55.388 --> 01:55:02.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make Donald Trump the focus,
but also try to make sure that
he doesn't get any expansion.

01:55:02.129 --> 01:55:04.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Twenty
seconds, Mark.

01:55:04.431 --> 01:55:09.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It was the last
great moment. The rest of it is
parallel skiing. And this

01:55:09.603 --> 01:55:14.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was the intersection. This was
his chance to change the race.
And he didn't do it tonight.

01:55:14.441 --> 01:55:18.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And will Mike
Pence agree? Will he reiterate
that he's going to support the

01:55:18.945 --> 01:55:21.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
election results no matter what?
That -- to see how their
positions evolve over the next

01:55:21.882 --> 01:55:23.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
few days on that question
will be interesting.

01:55:23.183 --> 01:55:24.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Every
Republican candidate...

01:55:24.384 --> 01:55:24.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It will be
really interesting to see.

01:55:24.885 --> 01:55:26.219 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Every Republican.

01:55:26.219 --> 01:55:28.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: ... will
be asked that tomorrow.

01:55:28.021 --> 01:55:31.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes. And Mike
Pence was asked it tonight, I'm
guessing. So, we will find

01:55:31.024 --> 01:55:33.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out what he had to say.

01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:37.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Amy Walter, David Brooks, Mark
Shields, we thank you all.

01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:41.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that wraps up our coverage
of this final presidential
debate of the election.

01:55:41.034 --> 01:55:45.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
