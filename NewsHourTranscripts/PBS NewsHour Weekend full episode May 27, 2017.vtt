MAY NOT BE.

04:54.093 --> 04:54.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT WAS

DISCUSSED.

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER.

05:02.435 --> 05:05.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE HAD A DISCUSSION WHERE

TECHNICALLY HE WAS RAISING

05:08.141 --> 05:09.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUBJECTS THAT WOULD BREAK THE

05:09.375 --> 05:10.877 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAW, BUT IT'S A LAW THAT WAS

05:10.877 --> 05:12.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
200 YEARS OLD THAT HAS NEVER

BEEN ENFORCED.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

I MEAN, THIS IS THE LATEST IN A

SERIES OF CASES IN WHICH THE

05:28.027 --> 05:31.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHITE HOUSE HAS HAD MANY, MANY

05:31.731 --> 05:33.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MONTHS TO BE UP FRONT ABOUT WHAT

05:33.299 --> 05:34.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENED, WHEN THESE MEETINGS

05:34.567 --> 05:36.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENED, WHAT WAS SAID IN THESE

05:36.936 --> 05:39.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEETINGS, AND THEY'RE ALWAYS

05:39.372 --> 05:40.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACKNOWLEDGING THEM ONLY AFTER

05:40.340 --> 05:41.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE EXPOSED IN THE PRESS.

05:41.708 --> 05:43.009 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WE'RE LEARNING NOW IS A

05:43.009 --> 05:44.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT, THAT

05:44.577 --> 05:45.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KUSHNER AND KISLYAK WERE

05:45.845 --> 05:46.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ACCOMPLISH THAT.

05:56.456 --> 05:58.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY REMARKABLE.

>> Sreenivasan: LET'S GET TO

06:00.526 --> 06:02.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW WE KNOW THAT WAS SAID.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

MOSCOW WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED.

06:09.569 --> 06:11.304 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

06:11.304 --> 06:12.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS COMMUNICATIONS WITH MOSCOW,

06:12.638 --> 06:14.207 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE UNDER SURVEILLANCE.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE INTERCEPTED, AND THIS

06:15.641 --> 06:17.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS HOW THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE

06:17.777 --> 06:19.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PICKED UP ON WHAT WAS DISCUSSED

06:19.011 --> 06:21.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THIS MEETING WITH KUSHNER.

06:21.814 --> 06:24.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: HOW DO WE KNOW

06:24.217 --> 06:25.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT SERGEY KISLYAK WAS BEING

06:25.918 --> 06:27.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HONEST TO HIS SUPERIORS?

06:27.320 --> 06:29.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE.

06:29.789 --> 06:30.890 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIAN OFFICIALS AND

06:30.890 --> 06:32.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTELLIGENCE OPERATIVES WILL

06:32.525 --> 06:35.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFTEN PUSH FALSEHOODS INTO

06:35.728 --> 06:36.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMUNICATIONS CHANNELS THAT

06:36.429 --> 06:38.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY KNOW THE UNITED STATES IS

MONITORING, JUST TO SOW

CONFUSION, BUT IN THIS CASE,

06:41.968 --> 06:44.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT THE

06:44.637 --> 06:46.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOTIVE WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR

06:46.939 --> 06:49.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KISLYAK TO MISCHARACTERIZE HIS

06:49.342 --> 06:50.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONVERSATION WITH KUSHNER IN

06:50.943 --> 06:51.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS WAY.

06:51.344 --> 06:53.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN FACT, KISLYAK SEEMED TAKEN

06:53.413 --> 06:55.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABACK BY THIS REQUEST, BASED ON

06:55.515 --> 06:56.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW HE'S RELAYING THIS TO

06:56.883 --> 06:57.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOSCOW.

06:57.483 --> 06:59.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE CAN'T REALLY BELIEVE, WHY

06:59.352 --> 07:01.187 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD THEY WANT TO DO THIS?

07:01.187 --> 07:02.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY ARE THEY ASKING FOR THIS?

07:02.555 --> 07:04.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT SEEMS STRANGE TO HIM.

07:04.056 --> 07:07.460 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT DOESN'T FIT IN WITH HIM

07:07.460 --> 07:08.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXAGGERATING HIS RELATIONSHIP

07:08.561 --> 07:10.196 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH KUSHNER OR AT THAT TIME

07:10.196 --> 07:11.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY TRYING TO... WHAT WOULD

07:11.297 --> 07:15.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE THE POINT OF PUTTING KUSHNER

07:15.401 --> 07:18.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN A VULNERABLE POSITION THIS

07:18.104 --> 07:18.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

10:40.640 --> 10:43.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE,

10:43.175 --> 10:45.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS YOU SAID, WE HAVE 239 DEAD.

10:45.444 --> 10:47.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REASON WHY WE FOCUSED ON

10:47.013 --> 10:48.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRANCE IS WE THOUGHT WE COULD

10:48.314 --> 10:51.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKE THE FRENCH HOSTAGE.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY THOUGHT THE MORE ATTACKS

10:53.285 --> 10:54.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WOULD BE, THEN THE MORE

10:54.587 --> 10:55.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE WOULD VOTE FOR THE

10:55.655 --> 10:59.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXTREME RIGHT BECAUSE THEY FELT

10:59.458 --> 10:59.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WAY.

10:59.959 --> 11:02.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THE

11:02.228 --> 11:05.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERRORIST JIHADIST WANTS TO

11:05.698 --> 11:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICIZE OTHER MUSLIMS, AND

11:06.666 --> 11:08.434 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WANT TO SORT OF WRING THEM

11:08.434 --> 11:10.503 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

11:17.209 --> 11:19.645 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE RACIST, THE FRENCH VOTE FOR

11:19.645 --> 11:22.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE EXTREME RIGHT, THEREFORE THE

11:22.815 --> 11:24.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONLY WAY FOR YOU TO BE SAFE IN

11:24.483 --> 11:28.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

FUTURE IN EUROPE AND THEN ARE

11:48.541 --> 11:51.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SORT OF MANIPULATED BY THE

11:51.077 --> 11:53.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CALIPHATE AND THINK THERE IS A

BREAK IN VALUES BETWEEN ISLAM

11:54.780 --> 11:56.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND EUROPEAN VALUES, AND

11:56.515 --> 11:58.684 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEREFORE, YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE

SORT OF PHENOMENON THAT WILL

12:03.089 --> 12:07.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEAD TO MOBILIZE THE MASSES.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, DEFINITELY.

12:28.981 --> 12:30.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ISSUE IS TO DESTABILIZE

13:22.168 --> 13:23.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS THAT FLOW DECREASED, AND IF

13:23.936 --> 13:24.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, WHY?

13:24.436 --> 13:27.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, OVER THE LAST YEAR,

13:27.239 --> 13:28.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS NO FLOW LEFT BECAUSE

13:28.941 --> 13:30.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BORDERS BETWEEN TURKEY AND

13:30.810 --> 13:32.645 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ISLAMIC STATE HAVE BEEN

13:32.645 --> 13:35.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEALED, AND THE TURKS ARREST

13:35.314 --> 13:38.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHOEVER COMES FROM FRANCE AND

13:38.517 --> 13:41.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY PICK UP IN TURKEY.

13:41.320 --> 13:46.225 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO TO A LARGE EXTENT THIS THREAT

13:46.225 --> 13:48.761 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WE HAVE SO MANY RETURNEES

13:48.761 --> 13:50.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO HAVE BEEN TRAINED AND

13:50.663 --> 13:52.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRAINWASHED AND WOULD BE VERY

13:52.798 --> 13:56.202 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POWERFUL IN STAGING HUGE ATTACKS

13:56.202 --> 13:59.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS NOT BEEN THAT SALIENT AS WE

13:59.572 --> 14:01.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

14:01.140 --> 14:04.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

14:05.978 --> 14:07.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

14:08.848 --> 14:10.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEREFORE THEY'RE SORT OF

14:10.015 --> 14:10.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRAPPED THERE FOR THE TIME

14:10.916 --> 14:13.419 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE LONE WOLF.

14:18.924 --> 14:20.292 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S NOT ABSOLUTELY ACCURATE.

14:20.292 --> 14:22.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU TRACE IT BACK INTO IDEOLOGY

14:22.161 --> 14:26.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HOW IT'S BEEN PUBLICIZED AND

14:26.131 --> 14:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROSELYTIZED FOR YEARS AND YEARS

14:27.266 --> 14:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW.

14:28.100 --> 14:31.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ONE OF THE MORE UNSETTLING

14:31.637 --> 14:34.039 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCLUSIONS IS THAT THE ATTACK

14:34.039 --> 14:36.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN SAN BERNARDINO, THE ATTACK IN

14:36.675 --> 14:39.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

14:40.412 --> 14:44.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT.

14:55.861 --> 14:59.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS

IDEOLOGY IN PLACE.

15:03.135 --> 15:05.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

YOU KILL AS MANY INFIDELS AS

POSSIBLE.

15:29.862 --> 15:32.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEN THEY WILL RETALIATE.

15:32.531 --> 15:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WILL DESECRATE A MOSQUE OR

15:34.300 --> 15:36.068 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING, AND THIS WILL CREATE

15:36.068 --> 15:37.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A SYSTEM OF PROVOCATION AND

17:11.030 --> 17:13.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TO THINK ABOUT OUR OWN SOCIETY.

17:16.135 --> 17:17.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

17:17.836 --> 17:20.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

17:22.174 --> 17:24.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO

17:24.376 --> 17:25.644 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WONDER WHY TERROR HAPPENS.

17:25.644 --> 17:26.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IF WE UNDERSTAND THAT

17:26.378 --> 17:28.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CORRECTLY, I THINK IT COULD

17:28.747 --> 17:30.816 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLOW US TO FIX WHAT IS GOING
