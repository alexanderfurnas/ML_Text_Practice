02:26.446 --> 02:28.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

FOR THE ACTS OF THESE

02:30.116 --> 02:30.783 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERRORISTS.

02:30.783 --> 02:32.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I'M QUITE CLEAR THAT WE WILL

NEVER LET THEM WIN, NOR WILL WE

TOWARD THE TERRORIST THREAT.

02:40.627 --> 02:41.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

MORE OF AN EYE OPEN NOW.

WHEREAS BEFORE, YOU COULD

02:44.797 --> 02:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASUALLY WALK OUT, BUT NOW IT'S

02:47.133 --> 02:48.801 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A DAUNTING EXPERIENCE.

02:48.801 --> 02:49.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT'S SCARY.

02:49.969 --> 02:52.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THERE'S A VERY STRONG FEELING

02:52.105 --> 02:54.440 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF DEFIANCE AND ANGER.

02:54.440 --> 02:55.808 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"HOW DARE YOU?"

02:55.808 --> 02:57.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND A REAL STRONG FEELING OF, WE

02:57.777 --> 02:58.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL CARRY ON.

THE ATTACK, PRESIDENT TRUMP

03:00.513 --> 03:01.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFFERED HIS SUPPORT TO PRIME

03:01.581 --> 03:03.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MINISTER MAY, BUT ALSO SEEMED TO

03:03.216 --> 03:05.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
URGE THE SUPREME COURT TO BACK

03:05.051 --> 03:07.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS PROPOSED TRAVEL BAN ON

03:07.387 --> 03:08.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITIZENS FROM SIX MOSTLY MUSLIM

COUNTRIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND

03:10.089 --> 03:11.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NORTH AFRICA.

03:11.157 --> 03:12.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE TWEETED, "WE NEED TO BE

03:12.959 --> 03:14.761 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SMART, VIGILANT AND TOUGH.

03:14.761 --> 03:15.962 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE NEED THE COURTS TO GIVE US

03:15.962 --> 03:17.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BACK OUR RIGHTS.

03:17.096 --> 03:18.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE NEED THE TRAVEL BAN AS AN

03:18.898 --> 03:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXTRA LEVEL OF SAFETY!"

03:20.800 --> 03:22.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TODAY, EVEN REPUBLICAN SENATORS

03:22.569 --> 03:24.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE SKEPTICAL OF THE BAN'S

03:24.337 --> 03:26.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELEVANCE OR LEGALITY.

03:26.072 --> 03:29.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK THE TRAVEL BAN IS TOO

03:29.509 --> 03:31.211 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BROAD, AND THAT IS WHY IT'S BEEN

03:31.211 --> 03:33.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REJECTED BY THE COURTS.

03:33.413 --> 03:35.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT, HOWEVER,

03:35.682 --> 03:38.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB

03:38.117 --> 03:39.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF VETTING INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

03:39.919 --> 03:42.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMING FROM WAR-TORN COUNTRIES

03:42.622 --> 03:46.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO OUR NATION, BUT I DO

03:46.192 --> 03:48.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BELIEVE THAT THE VERY BROAD BAN

03:48.561 --> 03:50.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HE HAS PROPOSED IS NOT THE

03:50.697 --> 03:51.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT WAY TO GO.

03:51.731 --> 03:52.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: THE LONDON

03:52.365 --> 03:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRIDGE ATTACK WAS EERILY SIMILAR

03:53.866 --> 03:55.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO THE ONE IN MARCH, WHEN A MAN

03:55.435 --> 03:57.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RAN OVER PEDESTRIANS ON

03:57.036 --> 03:58.671 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, KILLING FOUR

03:58.671 --> 04:00.807 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE, AND THEN FATALLY STABBED

04:00.807 --> 04:02.809 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A POLICE OFFICER BEFORE POLICE

04:02.809 --> 04:04.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOT AND KILLED HIM.

04:04.577 --> 04:06.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BRIDGE AND MARKET ATTACKS

04:06.079 --> 04:07.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAST NIGHT ALSO CAME LESS THAN

04:07.880 --> 04:09.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TWO WEEKS AFTER A SUICIDE BOMBER

04:09.882 --> 04:11.351 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

FEW MONTHS TIME-- HOW IS THE

04:43.583 --> 04:48.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.K, HOW IS LONDON COPING?

04:48.421 --> 04:50.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, IF YOU TALK TO SOME

04:50.923 --> 04:52.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONDONERS, THEY'LL PAINT A

04:52.058 --> 04:53.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PICTURE OF THE CITY BEING A

04:53.660 --> 04:55.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOTALLY INDOMITABLE PLACE, A

04:55.028 --> 04:56.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACE THAT'S LIVED THROUGH THE

04:56.262 --> 04:57.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BLITZ, WITH GERMAN BOMBS RAINING

04:57.930 --> 05:00.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOWN, WITH THE I.R.A. BOMBING

05:00.099 --> 05:02.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS PLACE DURING THE 1970s AND

05:02.435 --> 05:04.404 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
1980s, AND THEY SAY THAT LONDON

05:04.404 --> 05:05.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN COPE.

05:05.271 --> 05:07.373 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THAT'S ONLY SOME PEOPLE.

05:07.373 --> 05:08.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK OTHERS ARE GENERALLY

05:08.675 --> 05:09.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRAZZLED BY WHAT HAS HAPPENED.

05:09.776 --> 05:11.277 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS THE SECOND ATTACK IN THE

05:11.277 --> 05:13.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITY WITHIN TWO MONTHS AND THERE

05:13.546 --> 05:15.281 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS BEEN A REAL ESCALATION, THE

05:15.281 --> 05:16.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SORT OF TERRORISM THAT TOOK

05:16.949 --> 05:18.284 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACE ON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE

05:18.284 --> 05:19.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORPHED INTO THIS, IT BECAME

05:19.786 --> 05:21.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE EFFICIENT IN THE TERMS OF

05:21.287 --> 05:21.954 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ISLAMISTS.

05:21.954 --> 05:22.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND PEOPLE HERE REALLY DON'T

05:22.789 --> 05:24.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT.

05:24.791 --> 05:26.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WAS JUST TALKING TO A YOUNG

05:26.459 --> 05:27.460 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHAPLAIN, HE SAYS WHENEVER HE

05:27.460 --> 05:28.928 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUNS ACROSS THE BRIDGE HERE, HE

05:28.928 --> 05:29.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS FORCED TO BE VIGILANT.

05:29.796 --> 05:31.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE HAS TO LOOK TO SEE WHETHER

05:31.064 --> 05:32.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARS ARE MOUNTING THE CURB.

05:32.965 --> 05:34.534 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HE ALSO HAS TWO CHILDREN.

05:34.534 --> 05:36.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HE AND HIS WIFE HAVE GOT TO

05:36.302 --> 05:37.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLAN THAT, IF SOMETHING HAPPENS,

05:37.303 --> 05:39.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'LL EACH GRAB A CHILD.

05:39.138 --> 05:40.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THIS IS THE WAY THAT PEOPLE

05:40.139 --> 05:41.607 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE HAVING TO THINK THESE DAYS,

05:41.607 --> 05:43.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THIS SORT OF ATTACK IS

05:43.476 --> 05:44.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECOMING THE NEW NORMAL.

05:44.744 --> 05:45.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: MALCOLM, YOU

05:45.411 --> 05:47.280 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE HEADING THERE FOR REPORTING

05:47.280 --> 05:49.816 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS WEEK, LEADING UP TO THE NEW

05:49.816 --> 05:51.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTIONS, AND PERHAPS, PART

05:51.451 --> 05:52.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF YOUR STORY WOULD HAVE BEEN

05:52.418 --> 05:53.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RIPPLE EFFECTS OF THE

05:53.486 --> 05:55.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANCHESTER ATTACK, THAT HAPPENED

05:55.221 --> 05:56.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.

05:56.155 --> 05:58.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, HERE'S THIS CONVERSATION.

05:58.825 --> 06:01.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOES THIS HAVE AN IMPACT ON

06:01.160 --> 06:01.994 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTERS WHEN THEY GO TO THE

06:01.994 --> 06:05.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLLS?

06:05.998 --> 06:07.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK IT IS GOING TO.

06:07.667 --> 06:08.601 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, THE MANCHESTER ATTACK

06:08.601 --> 06:09.535 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENED TWO WEEKS AGO.

06:09.535 --> 06:11.437 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN PEOPLE WERE SAYING THAT

06:11.437 --> 06:12.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERRORISM AND SECURITY WAS GOING

06:12.705 --> 06:14.407 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO HAVE A SERIOUS IMPACT ON THE

06:14.407 --> 06:15.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTIONS.

06:15.241 --> 06:16.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF

06:16.342 --> 06:17.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEEKS, IT'S GONE AWAY.

06:17.577 --> 06:18.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING

06:18.611 --> 06:19.879 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THIS IS THE WAY IN WHICH

06:19.879 --> 06:21.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS HAS BEEN PLAYING OUT FOR

06:21.180 --> 06:22.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE INCUMBENT PRIME MINISTER,

06:22.248 --> 06:23.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERESA MAY.

06:23.182 --> 06:24.650 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN SHE CALLED THIS ELECTION,

06:24.650 --> 06:25.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE REALLY HAD A SUBSTANTIAL

06:25.818 --> 06:26.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEAD, AND OVER THE COURSE OF THE

06:26.986 --> 06:28.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAST FEW WEEKS, THAT LEAD HAS

06:28.421 --> 06:30.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN DRAMATICALLY ERODED.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.125 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HER RIVAL,JEREMY CORBIN, WHO

06:32.125 --> 06:34.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS WIDELY REGARDED AS BEING A

06:34.527 --> 06:36.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIT OF A LEFT-WING CANDIDATE,

06:36.429 --> 06:37.530 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS DONE EXTREMELY WELL IN THE

06:37.530 --> 06:38.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLLS.

06:38.531 --> 06:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO MUCH SO, THAT HE CAME

06:40.800 --> 06:41.868 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITHIN, YOU KNOW, A HAIR'S

06:41.868 --> 06:43.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BREATH OF HER IN THE LATEST

06:43.102 --> 06:43.870 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPINION POLLS.

06:43.870 --> 06:45.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, THIS INCIDENT HAPPENED ON

06:45.138 --> 06:46.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SATURDAY NIGHT, AND THAT REALLY

06:46.606 --> 06:49.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS CHANGED THE DYNAMIC OF THIS

06:49.308 --> 06:50.042 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTION.

06:50.042 --> 06:51.277 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND, IT HAS TO BE SAID-- IT MAY

06:51.277 --> 06:53.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE TO MRS. MAY'S ADVANTAGE,

06:53.312 --> 06:54.881 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE SHE WAS ONCE THE HOME

06:54.881 --> 06:57.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECRETARY, AND PLAYING TO

06:57.049 --> 06:58.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECURITY IS HER STRENGTH.

06:58.384 --> 06:59.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO, SHE WAS ABLE TO PRESENT

06:59.786 --> 07:01.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERSELF AS THE PRIME MINISTER

07:01.320 --> 07:03.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO IS ABLE TO TALK IN ROBUST

07:03.856 --> 07:05.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERMS OUTSIDE DOWNING STREET,

07:05.992 --> 07:07.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THIS IS THE AREA WHERE THE

07:07.226 --> 07:08.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTION IS GOING TO BE FOUGHT.

07:08.394 --> 07:10.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND FOR TONIGHT, FOR EXAMPLE,

07:10.563 --> 07:12.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MR. CORBIN IS SAYING-- IS GOING

07:12.398 --> 07:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THE ATTACK, SAYING THAT THE

07:13.733 --> 07:15.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSERVATIVES HAVE DONE A REALLY

07:15.501 --> 07:16.402 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BAD JOB IN THE PAST BY--

07:16.402 --> 07:17.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LETTING THE PEOPLE DOWN BY

07:17.336 --> 07:19.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CUTTING THE NUMBER OF POLICE ON

07:19.071 --> 07:22.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BEAT, AND SO THIS IS AN AREA

07:22.408 --> 07:23.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH IS REALLY GOING TO PLAY

07:23.276 --> 07:24.644 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO PEOPLE'S MINDS WHEN THEY GO

07:24.644 --> 07:25.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THINGS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

CHANGE-- WHAT HAS TO CHANGE?

07:48.768 --> 07:50.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO, SHE DIDN'T ACTUALLY

07:50.169 --> 07:52.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANNOUNCE ANY SPECIFIC MEASURES.

07:52.104 --> 07:54.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE SAID "ENOUGH IS ENOUGH," AND

07:54.140 --> 07:56.108 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE SAID WE HAVE TO FIGHT

07:56.108 --> 07:58.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAINST THE IDEOLOGY THAT SHE

07:58.611 --> 08:00.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECLARED TO BE ISLAMIST

08:00.079 --> 08:01.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXTREMISM, BUT SHE DIDN'T

OUTLINE ANY SPECIFIC ACTIONS

08:04.450 --> 08:06.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT COULD BE TAKEN.

08:10.623 --> 08:12.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS FAR AS KNOWN NETWORKS ARE

08:12.758 --> 08:14.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCERNED, I THINK THEY COULD

08:14.627 --> 08:16.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERVENE A LITTLE BIT EARLIER.

08:16.262 --> 08:17.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE CASE OF MANCHESTER, FOR

08:17.797 --> 08:19.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXAMPLE, ALL THE SUSPECTS WERE

08:19.665 --> 08:21.334 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOWN, THEY WERE KNOWN TO THE

08:21.334 --> 08:22.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AUTHORITIES, AND FOR SOME REASON

08:22.969 --> 08:24.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WEREN'T ARRESTED, PROBABLY

08:24.971 --> 08:26.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THE AUTHORITIES THOUGHT

08:26.939 --> 08:28.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WERE UNDER CONTROL AND THEY

08:28.741 --> 08:30.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WANTED TO WAIT AND OBSERVE A

08:30.776 --> 08:32.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LITTLE BIT LONGER.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.714 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK THE THRESHOLD HAS BECOME

08:34.714 --> 08:35.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LITTLE BIT LOWER AND THEY'RE

08:35.915 --> 08:37.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO INTERVENE EARLIER NOW.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELL POSITIONED-- THEY HAD A

08:53.833 --> 08:55.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOOD STRATEGY.

08:55.001 --> 08:56.269 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY HAVE INVESTED VERY

08:56.269 --> 08:58.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSISTENTLY IN COUNTERTERRORISM

08:58.604 --> 09:01.440 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SINCE 2005, SINCE THE JULY 7

09:01.440 --> 09:02.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTACKS.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY HAVE A GREAT REPUTATION

09:04.010 --> 09:05.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN EUROPE, SO IT'S GOING TO BE

09:05.678 --> 09:09.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY HARD FOR THEM TO LEVEL UP

09:09.015 --> 09:11.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND TO MAKE GREAT IMPROVEMENTS,

09:11.350 --> 09:13.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE, PERHAPS SOMEWHAT

09:13.352 --> 09:15.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVERCONFIDENTLY, THEY BELIEVE

09:15.521 --> 09:17.323 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE PRETTY GOOD ALREADY.

OF THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA

09:22.862 --> 09:24.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS A WAY TO TRY TO FIGHT THIS.

IS THIS POSSIBLE TO CONTAIN?

09:27.033 --> 09:27.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, IN THE SENSE THAT IF IT

09:27.867 --> 09:30.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS NOT DIRECTED BY ISIS, LET'S

09:30.703 --> 09:32.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY IT WAS INSPIRED BY THEM.

09:32.371 --> 09:33.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW DO YOU STOP PEOPLE FROM

COMMUNICATING AND BEING INSPIRED

09:35.708 --> 09:37.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

09:38.844 --> 09:41.280 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONVENIENT FOR HER TO SAY THAT.

09:41.280 --> 09:44.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S TRUE THAT IN 2014 THERE WAS

09:44.216 --> 09:46.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A MASSIVE PROBLEM ON MAINSTREAM

09:46.519 --> 09:48.054 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS LIKE

09:48.054 --> 09:49.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACEBOOK AND TWITTER.

09:49.388 --> 09:51.490 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

09:51.490 --> 09:52.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE, AND TRYING TO RADICALIZE

09:52.959 --> 09:54.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND RECRUIT.

09:54.093 --> 09:55.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

10:12.411 --> 10:13.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
