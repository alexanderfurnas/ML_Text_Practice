00:04.705 --> 00:06.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.540 --> 00:11.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: What
if there's
a contested convention? What
might happen

00:11.478 --> 00:17.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if no Republican candidate wins
enough delegates
before the July gathering in
Cleveland?

00:17.584 --> 00:23.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: how a community college in
New York
City is also paying student book
fees and

00:24.057 --> 00:28.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
transportation costs to double
graduation
rates.

00:28.462 --> 00:33.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we go to Denmark to see if
it lives up
to the title happiest place on
earth.

00:33.667 --> 00:39.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH EGESKOV, Attorney: I don't
think we
ever thought about anything evil
or threatening

00:39.373 --> 00:43.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through our childhoods, and I
hope we can
give the same to our daughters.

00:43.977 --> 00:51.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:51.852 --> 00:54.588 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:54.688 --> 01:04.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The day's major
headline in
the presidential race came far
from the campaign's

01:04.765 --> 01:10.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
front lines. As the candidates
stumped for
votes, the spotlight shifted to
a man who

01:10.103 --> 01:13.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
insisted he won't join the hunt,
now or later.

01:13.874 --> 01:17.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House:
I do not want, nor will I will
accept the

01:18.078 --> 01:19.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nomination for our party.

01:20.013 --> 01:25.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The declaration
came from House
Speaker Paul Ryan in Washington:
He said he's

01:25.686 --> 01:28.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not looking to be president
under any circumstances.

01:28.855 --> 01:31.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN: Count me out.

01:31.425 --> 01:38.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I simply believe that if you
want to be the
nominee for our party, to be the
president,

01:38.298 --> 01:44.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you should actually run for it.
I chose not
to do this. Therefore, I should
not be considered,

01:44.504 --> 01:46.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
period, end of story.

01:46.640 --> 01:52.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Even that may not
end the talk
of turning to Ryan, especially
with a contested

01:52.713 --> 01:55.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
convention looking likelier all
the time.

01:55.782 --> 02:01.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Upstate New York today,
front-running Donald
Trump pressed to make sure it
doesn't come

02:01.521 --> 02:07.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to that, first by winning New
York state's
GOP primary next week, where new
polls show

02:07.861 --> 02:14.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him with a wide lead. Trump is
also keeping
up his running criticism of
delegate selection,

02:14.201 --> 02:21.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
charging the process is rigged,
and that rival
Ted Cruz is stealing delegates
that are rightfully

02:21.174 --> 02:22.876 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
his.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I have millions of votes more,
but I also

02:25.045 --> 02:29.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have hundreds of delegates more,
but that's
not the same thing to me. I
think the vote

02:29.916 --> 02:31.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is the thing that you count.

02:31.818 --> 02:35.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In turn, the
Texas senator
says he's simply better
organized than Trump

02:36.023 --> 02:42.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, in a radio interview today,
predicted
a grassroots tsunami will send
him to victory

02:42.195 --> 02:43.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at the convention.

02:44.097 --> 02:45.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
We're seeing people who love
this country

02:45.899 --> 02:50.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coming out, and they're crawling
over broken
glass. It's not for me. It's not
about me.

02:50.570 --> 02:52.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's about the country. It's
about the Constitution.

02:52.572 --> 02:58.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For now, Trump
leads Cruz by
about 200 delegates, with John
Kasich well

02:58.679 --> 03:05.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back in the count. But in New
York City today,
the Ohio governor warned
Republicans, in a

03:05.786 --> 03:07.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
clear reference to Trump.

03:07.687 --> 03:10.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate:
Some feed off of the fears and
anger that

03:11.024 --> 03:19.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is felt by some of us and
exploit it feed
their own insatiable desires for
fame or attention.

03:19.933 --> 03:26.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That could drive America down
into a ditch
and not make us great again.

03:26.139 --> 03:30.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Democrat Bernie
Sanders also
took on the Republican
front-runner at a rally

03:31.078 --> 03:33.046 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Rochester.

03:33.146 --> 03:36.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
When we stand together and we
don't let the

03:36.116 --> 03:43.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trumps of the world divide us
up, when we
stand together, there is nothing
that we cannot

03:43.323 --> 03:43.890 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
accomplish.

03:43.990 --> 03:45.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:45.826 --> 03:49.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hillary Clinton,
meanwhile,
campaigned in New York City,
with a pitch

03:49.429 --> 03:51.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for equal pay for women.

03:51.431 --> 03:54.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I'm very proud that New York and
California

03:54.201 --> 03:58.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have raised the minimum wage,
because nearly
two-thirds of minimum wage
workers are women.

03:58.939 --> 04:04.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in
Washington, President
Obama appeared to boost Clinton
at a new museum

04:04.611 --> 04:11.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on women's equality. He said he
wants future
generations to be astonished
there was a time

04:11.118 --> 04:14.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when a woman had never been
president.

04:14.454 --> 04:18.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: North
Carolina's
governor moved to ease or change
parts of

04:18.992 --> 04:24.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a new law on gay, lesbian and
transgender
rights. Pat McCrory ordered
protections for

04:24.865 --> 04:31.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state employees based on sexual
orientation
and gender. And he asked North
Carolina lawmakers

04:31.404 --> 04:41.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to restore the right to sue over
discrimination.
He said it shows he's listening.

04:41.982 --> 04:48.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
confusion, passion and, frankly,
selective
outrage and hypocrisy,
especially against

04:48.955 --> 04:55.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the great state of North
Carolina. But, based
upon this feedback, I am taking
action to

04:55.662 --> 04:59.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
affirm the state's commitment to
privacy and
equality.

04:59.866 --> 05:04.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: McCrory still
supports a ban
on letting transgender people
select public

05:04.871 --> 05:10.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
bathrooms based on gender
identity. The law
has led to several major
corporations canceling

05:10.677 --> 05:13.280 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
expansion plans in the state.

05:13.380 --> 05:18.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Afghanistan, the Taliban
launched a spring
offensive, and warned of
large-scale suicide

05:18.318 --> 05:24.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bombings and assassinations.
Hours earlier,
the U.S. Embassy in Kabul issued
an emergency

05:24.391 --> 05:30.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
warning to Americans. It cited a
plot to attack
a major hotel in the capital.

05:30.664 --> 05:35.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police in Belgium have charged
two more men
in connection with the Brussels
bombings.

05:35.268 --> 05:40.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They allegedly helped rent an
apartment for
one of the attackers who killed
32 people

05:40.473 --> 05:46.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last month. Prosecutors also
announced three
new arrests linked to November's
attacks in

05:46.479 --> 05:48.181 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Paris.

05:48.281 --> 05:52.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A new warning today about the
world economy.
In Washington, the International
Monetary

05:52.519 --> 05:58.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fund downgraded its forecast for
growth this
year again, the new target, 3.2
percent.

05:58.225 --> 06:03.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAURICE OBSTFELD, International
Monetary Fund:
Global growth continues, but at
an increasingly

06:03.597 --> 06:10.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disappointing pace that leaves
the world economy
more exposed to negative risks.
Growth has

06:10.270 --> 06:12.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been too slow for too long.

06:12.439 --> 06:17.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Despite that
report, Wall Street
surged higher, as a jump in oil
prices lifted

06:17.744 --> 06:25.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
energy stocks. The Dow Jones
industrial average
gained nearly 165 points to
close at 17721.

06:25.452 --> 06:30.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 38 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added 19.

06:30.991 --> 06:37.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A measure of help may be on the
way for the
nation's bees. Garden care giant
Ortho announced

06:37.631 --> 06:45.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
today it will stop using
chemicals known as
neonicotinoids by 2021. They
attack insects'

06:45.438 --> 06:50.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nervous system, but it's widely
believed they
have also helped to cause a
dramatic decline

06:50.543 --> 06:56.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the bee population. Other
companies are
considering ending their use as
well.

06:56.750 --> 07:04.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Russian billionaire investor
Yuri Milner
pledged $100 million today to
send tiny spaceships

07:04.257 --> 07:10.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the stars. The goal is to
hunt for life
in the Alpha Centauri. That's
the star system

07:10.297 --> 07:16.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
closest to our solar system.
Each probe will
have a so-called light sail.
They will capture

07:16.102 --> 07:22.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
energy from lasers on Earth and
could travel
at one-fifth the speed of light,
far faster

07:22.575 --> 07:25.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than any current craft.

07:25.445 --> 07:30.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the possibilities
around a contested Republican
Convention;

07:30.750 --> 07:35.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the last of the big banks
settles over the
financial crisis -- is it still
too big to

07:35.955 --> 07:53.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fail?; a trip to the happiest
nation on earth;
and much more.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we begin with politics
tonight.

07:55.542 --> 08:00.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we just heard, the race for
the White House
is partly a battle for
delegates, and neither

08:00.380 --> 08:05.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
party has a candidate with
enough delegates
yet to clinch the nomination.
Democrats Hillary

08:05.785 --> 08:11.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton and Bernie Sanders are
within a few
hundred pledged delegates of one
another.

08:11.224 --> 08:15.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But add in superdelegates, and
she has a commanding
lead.

08:15.462 --> 08:21.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For Republicans, Donald Trump
leads the delegate
count, with Ted Cruz a few
hundred behind,

08:21.534 --> 08:27.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and John Kasich well back. The
GOP still has
contests too come in 16 states,
including

08:28.074 --> 08:30.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
New York, Pennsylvania, and
California.

08:30.443 --> 08:35.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on the Republican
delegate dance,
we're joined by Ben Ginsberg.
He's a partner

08:36.082 --> 08:42.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the law firm Jones Day, an
NBC/MSNBC political
analyst, and he served as
general counsel

08:42.756 --> 08:44.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign.

08:45.091 --> 08:47.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, Ben Ginsberg, welcome to
the "NewsHour."

08:47.494 --> 08:49.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN GINSBERG, Former Mitt
Romney General
Counsel: Thank you. Thank you
for having me.

08:49.396 --> 08:52.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, let's remind
everybody
first that this delegate process
has two different

08:52.832 --> 08:53.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
steps to it.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN GINSBERG: It does.

08:55.602 --> 09:00.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first is the primaries that
we have all
been following on Tuesday nights
and Saturday

09:00.440 --> 09:07.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
afternoons, where candidates vie
to get percentages
of the vote. And the second part
is the delegate

09:07.714 --> 09:13.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
selection process, which is now
going on in
state conventions and before
state executive

09:13.920 --> 09:15.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
committees around the country.

09:15.755 --> 09:19.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what's
happening now is
that, after the number of
delegates is chosen

09:19.225 --> 09:24.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
based on how well these
candidates do, decisions
have to be made about who the
people are that

09:24.631 --> 09:29.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fill those slots. And you were
telling us
earlier it is different in
virtually every

09:29.102 --> 09:30.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
state in how that's done.

09:30.136 --> 09:31.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BENJAMIN GINSBERG: It is.

09:32.005 --> 09:35.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans practice a fierce
federalism,
which allows each state to do it
the way that

09:35.608 --> 09:41.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state wants to, and you have a
variety of
mechanisms for selecting who
will be the actual

09:41.648 --> 09:43.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people on the floor in
Cleveland.

09:43.483 --> 09:49.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And how are those
decisions
made? A lot of it is personal
relationships,

09:49.722 --> 09:54.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you were saying. Some of it is
who is already
in the party hierarchy in a
particular state.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BENJAMIN GINSBERG: Yes.

09:56.563 --> 09:59.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it's a state convention, then
it's a matter
of the candidates getting enough
of their

09:59.499 --> 10:06.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supporters there to win their
slate of delegates.
There are other states where a
state executive

10:06.606 --> 10:10.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
committee, in other words, the
leaders of
the state, will determine who
the delegates

10:11.044 --> 10:12.779 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are.

10:12.879 --> 10:16.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's an instance of taking
care of your
political supporters and maybe
your friends

10:16.416 --> 10:22.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and family. There are a few
states about 10
percent of the delegates are
chosen directly

10:23.089 --> 10:29.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the candidates, but in most
instances,
the delegates are not chosen
directly by the

10:29.529 --> 10:31.297 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
candidates.

10:31.397 --> 10:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And right now, as
we have reported,
Donald Trump is a couple hundred
delegates

10:33.533 --> 10:40.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ahead, but Ted Cruz seems to be
picking off
delegates here and there. What
is he doing

10:40.139 --> 10:41.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that Mr. Trump isn't?

10:42.008 --> 10:47.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN GINSBERG: Well, the
very granular
process of winning state
conventions is what

10:47.247 --> 10:49.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he seems to have concentrated a
great deal
on.

10:50.016 --> 10:56.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the way Republicans do it is
that there
are often county conventions and
then district

10:56.322 --> 11:01.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conventions and then a state
convention. And
so it's a process of getting
your supporters

11:01.828 --> 11:06.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in each one of those, and,
ultimately, that's
how you get people in Cleveland.

11:06.499 --> 11:11.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, the ideal
solution for
any candidate is to get to the
magic number

11:11.371 --> 11:15.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
1,237 before Cleveland. Donald
Trump still
has a chance to do that, right?

11:15.875 --> 11:20.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN GINSBERG: Yes. Yes. If
he wins about
60 percent of the delegates who
are remaining,

11:20.613 --> 11:26.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
perhaps 66 percent of the
delegates who will
be bound to a particular
candidate, he can

11:26.386 --> 11:27.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
do that on the first ballot.

11:27.654 --> 11:30.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But if he
doesn't, what are
the options then?

11:30.857 --> 11:36.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN GINSBERG: Well, the
options are about
70 percent of the delegates will
become unbound

11:37.096 --> 11:38.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for a second ballot. So, it's...

11:38.598 --> 11:41.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So they're no
longer committed
to voting.

11:42.001 --> 11:46.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN GINSBERG: To either Mr.
Trump or
Mr. Cruz or Mr. Kasich or Mr.
Rubio or Bush

11:46.773 --> 11:49.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or Carson or any of the
candidates, correct.

11:49.609 --> 11:56.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that means
that it then
goes on to several -- to ballots
after that,

11:56.282 --> 11:57.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and what could happen?

11:57.550 --> 11:59.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BENJAMIN GINSBERG: Well, a
number of things
can happen.

11:59.786 --> 12:06.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The convention can come to a
decision on one
of the candidates, Mr. Trump or
Mr. Cruz.

12:06.292 --> 12:12.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is possible that additional
individuals
can get their names put in
nomination further

12:12.432 --> 12:17.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
down the road. There is a
process for doing
that. Much of this will actually
be determined,

12:17.470 --> 12:23.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these rules of the road, by the
convention
rules committee meeting on
probably the Friday

12:23.576 --> 12:25.345 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
before the convention starts.

12:25.445 --> 12:30.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So for us to be
talking about
it now, can we really know right
now what's

12:30.116 --> 12:30.984 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going to happen?

12:31.084 --> 12:32.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BENJAMIN GINSBERG: No, I don't
think so.

12:32.986 --> 12:40.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On June 8, the day after the
last primaries,
there will be a pretty set way
to know what

12:40.526 --> 12:45.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the first ballot vote will be
like. And then
there will be rules decisions
made by delegates

12:45.465 --> 12:50.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who have not yet even been
selected that will
impact the way the proceedings
of the convention

12:50.903 --> 12:52.739 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
go.

12:52.839 --> 12:54.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What a lot of
people are talking
about, Ben Ginsberg, is if
Donald Trump is

12:55.041 --> 13:01.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
close, but not there, if he's
say at 1,100,
rather than 1,237, what happens
in that situation?

13:01.447 --> 13:07.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN GINSBERG: Well, there
are a number
of delegates who are unbound,
somewhere between

13:07.954 --> 13:12.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
160 and 200 probably, who are
not bound to
a candidate.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At any point? You
mean going
into the convention.

13:13.993 --> 13:15.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BENJAMIN GINSBERG: At any point.
At any point.

13:15.995 --> 13:21.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their states follow specific
rules. So there
will be 40 days of wooing as
those unbound

13:22.035 --> 13:25.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
delegates get entreaties from
many a candidate.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Entreaties,
meaning?

13:27.507 --> 13:31.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN GINSBERG: Well, they
will have conversations
about how the candidates are
best qualified

13:31.811 --> 13:35.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do it. There might be some
sightseeing
around the country.

13:35.448 --> 13:43.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gerald Ford in 1976 took people
on rides on
Air Force One. So there are any
number of

13:43.589 --> 13:47.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ways to develop a relationship
with those
delegates.

13:47.160 --> 13:51.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But if you're a
delegate right
now who is not bound to anybody,
you're a

13:51.330 --> 13:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pretty popular guy or girl.

13:53.166 --> 13:58.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN GINSBERG: I think
you're very popular,
and your popularity may only
increase.

13:58.337 --> 14:03.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're either going to have a
lot of currency
on June 8 to July 18, or you
will you will

14:03.810 --> 14:05.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be, gee, it was so close.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Prediction, Ben
Ginsberg, on
how much suspense there is going
to be going

14:08.281 --> 14:10.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into this convention?

14:10.249 --> 14:14.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN GINSBERG: Well, again,
we will know
that on June the 8th, after the
June 7 primaries

14:15.088 --> 14:16.856 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are done.

14:16.956 --> 14:22.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there will be a lot of
maneuvering.
This will be an historically
close delegate

14:22.595 --> 14:28.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
count, one way or another, and
the rules fights
in the week before the
convention can actually

14:28.301 --> 14:32.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a determining effect on the
outcome the
following week.

14:32.238 --> 14:33.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All eyes on
Cleveland.

14:33.406 --> 14:34.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN GINSBERG: Yes, indeed.

14:34.373 --> 14:35.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: No doubt about
it.

14:35.775 --> 14:39.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ben, Ben Ginsberg, it's great to
see you.
Thank you.

14:39.512 --> 14:46.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN GINSBERG: Thanks, Judy.

14:47.019 --> 14:54.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to our
occasional series
of conversations about whether
some banks

14:54.594 --> 15:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and firms are too big to fail,
and whether
they pose a risk to the
country's financial

15:00.366 --> 15:01.167 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
health.

15:01.267 --> 15:03.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
John Yang has our latest
installment.

15:03.202 --> 15:09.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Eight years after the
housing bubble
exploded, investment bank
Goldman Sachs this

15:09.175 --> 15:14.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
week became the last big
institution to settle
with the government for its role
in selling

15:14.413 --> 15:18.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
bundles of bad loans to
investors, which led
to the financial crisis.

15:18.351 --> 15:23.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this election year, there is
a lot of talk
about whether too many firms
remain too big

15:23.523 --> 15:27.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to fail and whether the
Dodd-Frank law is
working.

15:27.860 --> 15:32.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Lynn Stout is a Cornell
University law professor
who now serves on the Treasury
Department's

15:32.598 --> 15:37.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Financial Research Advisory
Committee. She
has been very critical of
Dodd-Frank, and

15:37.236 --> 15:40.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she joins us now from Ithaca,
New York.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Professor Stout, thanks for
being with us.

15:42.475 --> 15:47.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Let's start off with that
Goldman Sachs settlement
this week. They have agreed to
pay as much

15:47.914 --> 15:54.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as $5 billion in this settlement
with the
government. What does this say
about accountability

15:54.987 --> 16:00.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now among the big financial
institutions after
the financial crisis?

16:00.226 --> 16:04.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LYNN STOUT, Cornell University:
I'm afraid
the settlement confirms
something that we

16:05.064 --> 16:09.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have suspected for quite a long
time, which
is that it looks like fraudulent
practices

16:09.435 --> 16:14.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were hard-baked into the banking
sector during
2008.

16:14.273 --> 16:19.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, unfortunately, although $5
billion sounds
like a lot of money, the
settlement is actually

16:19.679 --> 16:24.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
relatively small. It's certainly
small compared
to the damage that was done by
these fraudulent

16:24.450 --> 16:28.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
practices, and it's relatively
small compared
to some of the settlements by
some of the

16:28.387 --> 16:31.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other banks, by Citibank and by
Bank of America.

16:31.891 --> 16:37.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, as large as the figure may
seem, I'm afraid
it creates the risk that this
could be business

16:37.930 --> 16:42.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as usual, that, at the end of
the day, Goldman
Sachs may have found these sorts
of fraudulent

16:42.368 --> 16:45.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
practices to overall profitable,
even in light
of the fines.

16:46.072 --> 16:48.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Business as usual,
you say.

16:48.374 --> 16:52.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, Dodd-Frank was supposed to
address all
this. It was the response to all
of this,

16:52.545 --> 16:57.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the financial crisis and what
brought it on.
You say Dodd-Frank isn't
working. Why not?

16:57.950 --> 16:59.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What about it isn't working?

16:59.919 --> 17:05.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LYNN STOUT: The basic problem
with Dodd-Frank
is that it created the
appearance of Congress

17:05.124 --> 17:09.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doing something, without that
appearance being
backed up by reality.

17:09.462 --> 17:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What the Dodd-Frank Act did
mostly was direct
various regulators at the
Federal Reserve,

17:14.700 --> 17:21.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the FTC, the CFTC to draft
regulations that
were supposed to rein in the
banks. But Dodd-Frank

17:21.240 --> 17:25.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
itself doesn't impose many hard
and fast rules,
and what's happened in all the
years since

17:25.711 --> 17:30.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that the financial industry,
through lobbying,
campaign contributions,
behind-the-scene actions,

17:30.950 --> 17:37.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAS been very effective at
stymying regulators
from doing anything that really
crimps their

17:37.123 --> 17:38.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
style and reins them in.

17:39.058 --> 17:42.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, the banks say
that they are,
they are being reined in. The
banks say that

17:42.595 --> 17:47.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their profits are down, that
Dodd-Frank has
changed the way they do
business. They're

17:47.266 --> 17:53.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
holding more capital, they say.
They're being
more closely regulated. There
are things they

17:53.773 --> 17:55.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can and they can't do.

17:55.541 --> 17:58.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as I say, it's cutting into
their profits,
they say. What do you say to
that?

17:58.744 --> 18:03.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LYNN STOUT: Well, it's true that
bank profits
are down, but I think we need to
be realistic.

18:03.282 --> 18:08.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the primary reasons is
that the banks
basically lost the faith of
their customers.

18:08.854 --> 18:13.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They damaged their own
reputations and destroyed
much of their own customer base.
Now, some

18:13.292 --> 18:18.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regulation does play a role. And
right now,
regulators are watching the
banks pretty closely,

18:18.364 --> 18:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but the rules are still pretty
flexible.

18:20.733 --> 18:26.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have to be concerned that
in years
that are coming in the future,
the regulators

18:26.505 --> 18:30.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are going to take their eye off
the ball and
we will be back to some of the
same problems

18:30.276 --> 18:36.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in terms of concentrations of
risk and highly
speculative activity that led to
the 2008

18:36.415 --> 18:37.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
collapse in the first place.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What do you think
should be done?

18:39.618 --> 18:43.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LYNN STOUT: It's actually very
straightforward.

18:43.356 --> 18:49.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Up until around the year 2000,
we had a bunch
of banking regulations in place,
including

18:49.795 --> 18:55.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Glass-Steagall and rules against
speculative
derivatives trading that had
proven time-tested

18:55.368 --> 19:00.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at keeping banks from taking on
excessive
risks and had been very
effective at keeping

19:00.673 --> 19:03.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the financial sector stable and
sound.

19:03.976 --> 19:09.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And most of those laws were
eliminated in
a -- what's turned out to be a
very misbegotten

19:09.882 --> 19:14.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
profit of so-called
deregulation. I think
that if we put those rules back
in place,

19:14.987 --> 19:18.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
experience and history suggest
there's no
reason why we can't have a safe,
sound banking

19:19.025 --> 19:20.793 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sector.

19:20.893 --> 19:25.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's just very hard without some
of the original
regulatory firewalls we used to
have.

19:25.197 --> 19:29.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Glass-Steagall came
out of the
Depression and said you couldn't
-- you couldn't

19:29.301 --> 19:33.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- had to separate commercial
banking and
investment banking.

19:33.639 --> 19:39.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The critics of that, of your
assessment, say
that a lot of what happened in
the financial

19:39.712 --> 19:44.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crisis had nothing to do with
that. It had
to do with a pure investment
bank like Goldman

19:44.917 --> 19:50.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sachs. It had to do not with the
mixing of
the two. What's your response?

19:50.122 --> 19:55.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LYNN STOUT: Oh, that's true, to
some extent,
but Glass-Steagall wasn't the
only rule that

19:55.828 --> 19:57.763 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was changed.

19:57.863 --> 20:02.068 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
We also legalized
over-the-counter derivatives
for the first time, and we even
gave a derivatives

20:02.168 --> 20:06.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
contracts priority in
bankruptcy. There were
lots and lots of financial rules
that were

20:06.539 --> 20:11.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
changed in favor of the
financial industry
through a steady process of the
application

20:11.811 --> 20:15.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of campaign contributions and
lobbying power.

20:15.481 --> 20:20.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if we're going to have a
stable system,
I think we need to find a way to
get past

20:20.519 --> 20:25.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
this problem of lack of a
political will to
effectively regulate financial
institutions.

20:25.357 --> 20:29.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: We had Barney Frank
on in one of
our conversations about this,
the Barney Frank

20:29.929 --> 20:31.697 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Dodd-Frank.

20:31.797 --> 20:35.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said that even if an
institution were
to get into trouble, that the
way the law

20:35.201 --> 20:40.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is now, there would be no
government bailout,
no propping up of an
institution, it would

20:40.439 --> 20:47.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to fail, and that whatever
government
funds would be spent would be
spent on letting

20:47.680 --> 20:53.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
it dissolve in an orderly
fashion, so it wouldn't
cause a big financial problem to
the rest

20:53.719 --> 20:58.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the economy, and that any
money the government
spent would have to be
recovered.

20:58.724 --> 21:00.226 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Your response.

21:00.326 --> 21:05.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LYNN STOUT: I think that's,
shall we say,
an extremely optimistic view.

21:05.598 --> 21:10.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think history has shown
that the ties
between the big financial
institutions and

21:10.102 --> 21:15.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Washington are so tight that the
financial
institutions are very good at
engineering

21:15.875 --> 21:17.409 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
taxpayer-financed bailouts.

21:17.510 --> 21:24.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Lynn Stout, thanks
for joining
us. Thank you very much.

21:24.383 --> 21:33.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

21:33.192 --> 21:38.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
New York City
program that promises to double
community

21:38.130 --> 21:43.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
college graduation rates; the
highest glass
ceiling, a look at the women who
aspired to

21:44.003 --> 21:50.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
be president; and why
politicians need to
do less talking and more
listening.

21:50.209 --> 21:58.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: Universal health
care, free university
education, and generous
unemployment benefits,

21:58.217 --> 22:03.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are these the keys to happiness?
They are
all offered in Denmark, the
Nordic country

22:03.622 --> 22:08.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democratic presidential hopeful
Bernie Sanders
says the United States should
look to as a

22:08.661 --> 22:10.462 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
model.

22:10.563 --> 22:16.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once again this year, Denmark
tops a United
Nations poll as the happiest
nation on earth.

22:16.268 --> 22:18.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But is this really true?

22:18.103 --> 22:22.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
From Copenhagen, special
correspondent Malcolm
Brabant investigates.

22:22.708 --> 22:32.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: A happy
accident of geography:
being born in a country whose
safety net offers

22:32.785 --> 22:34.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
protection from cradle to grave.

22:34.753 --> 22:38.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH EGESKOV, Attorney: On a
day like this,
it's obvious we are gathered
with our friends

22:39.091 --> 22:44.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and family to celebrate this
little baby,
so it's a wonderful day. And in
the bigger

22:44.363 --> 22:50.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
picture, we live in a great
society with a
health care system and free
education.

22:50.536 --> 22:54.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Christening
their daughter
Kaya (ph), attorney Sarah
Egeskov and her

22:54.940 --> 22:58.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
partner, Claes, hope their state
of bliss
will leap a generation.

22:58.811 --> 23:03.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLAES RASMUSSEN, Financial
Adviser: We try
to give her some of the same
values that we

23:03.749 --> 23:10.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have today and hope for her that
she will
have the same freedom of speech
and freedom

23:10.489 --> 23:11.290 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of beliefs.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SARAH EGESKOV: And a safe
childhood.

23:12.558 --> 23:14.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLAES RASMUSSEN: Yes.

23:14.660 --> 23:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH EGESKOV: I don't think we
thought about
anything evil or threatening
through our childhoods,

23:20.866 --> 23:23.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and I hope we can give the same
to our daughters.

23:23.802 --> 23:28.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Pastor Pernille
Oestrem's
church is in Copenhagen's most
racially diverse

23:29.074 --> 23:33.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
district. She worries that some
of her immigrant
parishioners do not enjoy the
same level of

23:33.779 --> 23:39.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happiness as ethnic Danes, and
she regards
it as her mission to try to
spread the joy.

23:39.351 --> 23:45.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PERNILLE OESTREM, Pastor: We
don't have any
wars and the crime is low. And
we can let

23:45.391 --> 23:49.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our children walk to school in
the morning
by themselves when they're quite
young. We

23:49.261 --> 23:53.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't have to drive them because
of drive-by
shootings or something like
that. That means

23:53.599 --> 23:58.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot, that we think we're going
to be 90
and have
great-great-great-grandchildren.

23:58.937 --> 24:05.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Danes pay more
income tax
than any other nationality, earn
over $55,000,

24:05.744 --> 24:11.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the tax rate hits more than
60 percent,
but, according to happiness
expert Meik Wiking,

24:11.650 --> 24:13.552 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Danes don't mind.

24:13.652 --> 24:17.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEIK WIKING, Happiness Expert:
Just take free
access to health care, free
access to university

24:17.222 --> 24:22.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
education, quite generous
benefits if you
lose your job. Just those three
things mean

24:22.695 --> 24:26.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that a lot of people around the
world, if
they don't have access to them,
will experience

24:26.498 --> 24:30.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unhappiness. And since the
welfare state takes
care of that, we increase the
bottom.

24:30.869 --> 24:33.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: What about the
high levels
of taxes that people have to
pay?

24:34.073 --> 24:37.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEIK WIKING: Well it's true,
it's really high
levels. But I think what's more
interesting

24:37.576 --> 24:42.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that the really high level of
support for
the for high taxes. If you ask
Danes, are

24:42.181 --> 24:45.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you happily paying your taxes,
nine out of
10 will say yes.

24:45.884 --> 24:50.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: It's just after
2:00 in the
afternoon and some of
Copenhagen's bicycling

24:50.122 --> 24:55.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
commuters are already heading
home. The average
Dane only works a 35-hour week,
and enjoys

24:55.828 --> 25:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
five weeks annual paid leave, on
top of public
holidays, not to mention
generous maternity

25:01.800 --> 25:03.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and paternity leave.

25:03.769 --> 25:08.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to yet another survey,
it has the
best work-life balance in the
developed world,

25:08.540 --> 25:11.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is a source of pride for
union leader
Nana Hojlund.

25:11.810 --> 25:16.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANA HOJLUND, Union Leader:
Work-life balance
means a lot to the Danish people
when it comes

25:16.415 --> 25:21.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to happiness, because it's a way
that you
can both have a really good job,
and you can

25:21.220 --> 25:24.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spend hours on your job, and you
can also
have a family.

25:24.390 --> 25:28.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Not everyone
swallows the
concept of perfect little
Denmark. British

25:28.694 --> 25:33.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
author Michael Booth has lived
here for 15
years, and his book debunking
the Scandinavian

25:33.632 --> 25:35.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
myths is a bestseller.

25:35.501 --> 25:37.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BOOTH, Author, "The
Almost Nearly
Perfect People": I know the
institutes and

25:37.469 --> 25:40.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the researchers like to use that
word because
it grabs headlines around the
world. I don't

25:40.672 --> 25:45.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think the Danes are happy. I
think they're
more satisfied. They're a pretty
somber, dour

25:46.044 --> 25:48.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people. They complain quite a
lot.

25:48.313 --> 25:52.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when you ask them, are you
happy, what
they really mean is, well, we're
content.

25:52.317 --> 25:56.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Things function here. It's safe.
We have a
safety net. We don't worry that
much. And

25:56.822 --> 26:00.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the difference between the rich
and the poor
means that you don't have this
kind of society

26:00.492 --> 26:03.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of envy that you might have
elsewhere in the
world.

26:03.729 --> 26:09.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: According to
the United Nations,
Burundi is the unhappiest
country on the planet,

26:09.835 --> 26:16.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
followed closely by Syria. The
United States
is in 13th in the happiness
league, just behind

26:16.608 --> 26:18.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Israel and Austria.

26:18.410 --> 26:23.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, according to Bernie
Sanders, the U.S.
would be a much better place if
it emulated

26:23.182 --> 26:28.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cycle-crazy Denmark. But the
center-right
Danish prime minister has
rejected suggestions

26:29.021 --> 26:34.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that this is some sort of
socialist utopia,
but he's happy that Denmark's
welfare system

26:34.893 --> 26:39.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is being looked at as something
to aim for.

26:39.798 --> 26:45.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to Danish experts,
Scandinavians
have a genetic predisposition
towards happiness.

26:45.571 --> 26:49.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Americans with Scandinavian
heritage share
those particular traits. Could
the Danish

26:50.075 --> 26:54.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
model be transported across the
Atlantic if
the U.S. chose to change the
guard?

26:54.847 --> 26:59.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEIK WIKING: The same things
that drive happiness
in Scandinavia are the same
things that drive

26:59.318 --> 27:03.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happiness in the U.S. So I think
there are
some things we could export.

27:03.455 --> 27:06.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: So what would
you have to
export?

27:06.124 --> 27:12.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEIK WIKING: I think what I
would do would
be to focus on the bottom half
of the population

27:12.598 --> 27:17.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to increase the bottom by
installing a welfare
system inspired by the Nordic
countries.

27:17.769 --> 27:21.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: One uniquely
Scandinavian
social phenomenon that would be
difficult

27:22.074 --> 27:27.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to export is what's called the
Jantelov, an
unwritten code of conformity
that decries

27:27.446 --> 27:32.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
displays of ostentation or
wealth and people
who try to rise above their
allotted station

27:32.417 --> 27:34.253 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in life.

27:34.353 --> 27:36.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BOOTH: How does that sit
with Americans
and the American dream? Not so
well. There's

27:36.355 --> 27:40.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no simple template that could be
imposed on
America. It doesn't take much to
make a happy

27:40.425 --> 27:44.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dane. Light a fire, light some
candles, open
a bottle of red wine, and you
have got a happy

27:44.162 --> 27:46.064 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Dane.

27:46.164 --> 27:49.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Americans are a little
more demanding
when it comes to their
happiness. It's enshrined,

27:49.101 --> 27:53.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, in the Constitution.
They're entitled
to it. But they have much bigger
ideas of

27:53.772 --> 27:59.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what constitutes happiness. So,
can you take
it? Will Americans pay 56
percent income tax?

27:59.845 --> 28:01.747 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I doubt it.

28:01.847 --> 28:07.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Pastor Pernille
Oestrem believes
a lack of realism enables the
Danes to be

28:07.352 --> 28:11.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so upbeat. But she is acutely
aware that,
along with the rest of Europe,
Denmark is

28:11.657 --> 28:16.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a potential target for Islamic
State. So how
does she manage to maintain
happiness in a

28:16.762 --> 28:18.664 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
time of terror?

28:18.764 --> 28:23.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PERNILLE OESTREM: Maybe the
children that
I baptize during this time are
actually inheriting

28:23.535 --> 28:30.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a society that looks a lot like
the society
when I was young. There was a
nuclear scare.

28:30.275 --> 28:36.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I didn't know if tomorrow was
going to come,
but we still went out to play
and had our

28:36.248 --> 28:39.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fights and got home to have
dinner.

28:39.151 --> 28:45.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: So, there's the
perfect advice.
Keep calm and carry on. It's
just easier if

28:45.557 --> 28:47.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you're Danish. It's in their
genes.

28:47.626 --> 28:56.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Copenhagen.

28:56.635 --> 29:08.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Obama
administration has
long touted efforts to boost
college completion.

29:08.580 --> 29:12.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But graduation rates haven't
budged. That's
why states across the country
are watching

29:13.085 --> 29:18.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an effort in New York City that
promises to
more than double graduation
rates at community

29:18.790 --> 29:20.425 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
colleges.

29:20.525 --> 29:23.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan went to the
Bronx to see
how the city's community
colleges plan to

29:23.762 --> 29:25.664 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do it.

29:25.764 --> 29:31.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Karla Ayala is
in her last
semester at Bronx Community
College. If everything

29:31.803 --> 29:35.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
goes as planned, she will earn
her associate's
degree from the City University
of New York

29:35.674 --> 29:38.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campus in five semesters, or
about two years.

29:39.077 --> 29:44.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Only 20 percent of community
college students
complete a degree or certificate
within three

29:44.182 --> 29:49.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years of enrollment. Ayala has
done it despite
having the types of
responsibilities that

29:49.354 --> 29:52.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
derail hundreds of thousands of
students every
year.

29:52.290 --> 29:55.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARLA AYALA, Student: College is
stressful,
and then on top of it having an
outside life,

29:55.994 --> 30:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have kids, I'm married, I
don't have a full-time
job, but yet I have a
responsibility part-time

30:02.100 --> 30:03.835 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at school.

30:03.935 --> 30:06.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: She's stayed
on track with
the help of Accelerated Study in
Associate

30:07.072 --> 30:12.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Programs, or ASAP, The City
University of
New York created the wrap-around
support program

30:12.177 --> 30:17.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for full-time students on some
of its seven
community college campuses in
2007.

30:17.449 --> 30:23.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARLA AYALA: I did a semester
without being
in ASAP, and it was a little
hard, because

30:23.488 --> 30:26.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was -- in a sense, I was lost.

30:26.925 --> 30:32.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Ayala is up at
6:00 to get
the kids ready for school and
out the door

30:32.330 --> 30:39.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by 7:30, when her husband is
already at work.
ASAP pays for any tuition not
covered by scholarships,

30:39.705 --> 30:43.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which meant $2,600 a semester
for Ayala.

30:43.608 --> 30:49.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Students also get a stipend for
textbooks.
Commuting costs in a city like
New York can

30:49.347 --> 30:54.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
add up and become a hurdle. ASAP
provides
free monthly MetroCards for city
buses and

30:54.953 --> 31:03.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trains, which normally cost
$116. Class schedules
that change every semester can
derail students

31:03.462 --> 31:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who have to work or care for
family. ASAP
students take blocks of classes
that bring

31:08.900 --> 31:14.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them to campus at the same time
every day.
That means Ayala knows she can
get home to

31:14.372 --> 31:16.374 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pick the kids up from school.

31:16.475 --> 31:19.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the most important support
has come from
her adviser.

31:19.344 --> 31:23.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARLA AYALA: We have established
a relationship
where she knows, like, OK,
Karla, what's going

31:23.648 --> 31:27.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on with this class? And I had a
class where
I was struggling, and she
definitely, you

31:27.686 --> 31:31.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, gave me the pep talk.
She's like, you
got to do it. I'm not going to
take you out

31:31.356 --> 31:33.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the class. You're going to
have to work
hard in your tutoring.

31:33.959 --> 31:40.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The data
points to success
stories beyond Ayala. Only 17
percent of CUNY's

31:40.832 --> 31:45.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
full-time community college
students get a
degree in three years. For ASAP
students,

31:45.871 --> 31:52.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the rate is 57 percent. In the
fall, New York
City leaders pledged an
additional $42 million

31:53.011 --> 31:59.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to expand the program from 7,500
students
this year to 25,000 by 2018.

31:59.851 --> 32:05.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The goal is to raise the system
wide graduation
rate to 50 percent or higher for
full-time

32:05.924 --> 32:07.793 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
students.

32:07.893 --> 32:09.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MILLIKEN, Chancellor, City
University
of New York: At community
colleges, and particularly

32:09.861 --> 32:14.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at urban community colleges
across the country,
the three-year graduation rate
is about 16

32:14.599 --> 32:17.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
percent right now. And so you
could call that
a crisis.

32:17.536 --> 32:19.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: CUNY's
chancellor James
Milliken:

32:19.571 --> 32:24.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MILLIKEN: The issue's not
all about
access. It's a big part of it.
We have to

32:24.176 --> 32:28.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be focused on the success of our
students,
getting them a degree.

32:28.246 --> 32:33.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Ayala's
adviser, Melanie
Robles, says turning the numbers
around takes

32:33.285 --> 32:35.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than pointing students to
the right classes.

32:35.554 --> 32:38.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MELANIE ROBLES, City University
of New York:
I can work with a student on
their academics,

32:38.657 --> 32:44.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right? That's typical. But then
you also have
that moment where you're working
with a student

32:44.963 --> 32:49.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is having difficulty at
home, so you're
coaching them on maybe how to
have a conversation

32:49.901 --> 32:56.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a parent that maybe doesn't
want to assist
them any longer to take care of
their child

32:56.975 --> 32:58.810 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for them.

32:58.910 --> 33:04.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Javier Legasa
oversees ASAP
on the Bronx campus. He says
this intensive

33:04.382 --> 33:10.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
support is possible because ASAP
advisers
only work with 150 students each
semester,

33:10.822 --> 33:14.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
compared to 500 students for
each adviser
outside the program.

33:14.593 --> 33:17.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAVIER LEGASA, City University
of New York:
Students need to feel that they
belong, that

33:18.029 --> 33:24.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is their place, that we
welcome them.
And so having the sense of
connection with

33:24.836 --> 33:30.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
staff members, with the other
students as
well, and the faculty who will
be teaching

33:31.042 --> 33:33.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them in class, this is a key
element.

33:33.945 --> 33:36.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And they're
tracking students'
progress closely.

33:37.048 --> 33:42.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAVIER LEGASA: Sometimes, it can
be, OK, you
may have to withdraw from one of
the classes

33:42.220 --> 33:47.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
so you can concentrate in
others. But, in
other cases, we will be just,
you know, do

33:47.225 --> 33:49.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
some tutoring work, for example.

33:49.261 --> 33:52.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Somebody's
going to say,
listen, this is a ton of money.
Why don't

33:52.664 --> 33:57.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you just hand these people the
keys to a four-year
private institution if you're
going to invest

33:57.903 --> 33:59.804 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
$80 million in 25,000 students?

33:59.905 --> 34:03.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MILLIKEN: The cost that's
invested in
a community college student may
be about $15,000.

34:03.475 --> 34:09.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're talking about now a
cost of an additional
$3,700 for the ASAP program
today.

34:09.314 --> 34:15.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, by the time we scale up to
25,000, it
may be $3,200. It may be lower.
The cost per

34:15.287 --> 34:20.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
degree goes down. But if you
look at a lot
of the research that's been done
on educational

34:20.325 --> 34:25.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attainment levels, there are a
whole lot of
other social benefits, lower
demand on criminal

34:25.697 --> 34:31.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
justice system, on social
welfare systems,
divorce rates.

34:31.970 --> 34:39.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Karla Ayala is
playing her
own part in the ASAP expansion.
In her part-time

34:39.177 --> 34:44.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
job as a peer mentor, she runs
information
sessions like the one that
exposed her to

34:44.649 --> 34:46.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ASAP two years ago.

34:46.551 --> 34:49.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARLA AYALA: So, it's like you
have this group
with the same mentality, and
you're bound

34:49.421 --> 34:51.289 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be successful.

34:51.389 --> 34:56.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: By 2018, CUNY
plans to enroll
nearly all 7,000 full-time
students at the

34:56.361 --> 34:58.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Bronx campus in ASAP.

34:58.330 --> 35:07.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Hari

JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
designated
a new national monument in
Washington today.

35:16.314 --> 35:22.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Belmont-Paul Women's
Equality National
Monument honors suffrage
fighters Alva Belmont

35:22.687 --> 35:28.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Alice Paul. Since 1929, the
home has been
the headquarters of the National
Woman's Party.

35:28.960 --> 35:32.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, it becomes the first
national monument
to women's history.

35:32.497 --> 35:35.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
I want young boys and girls to
come here 10,

35:35.934 --> 35:41.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
20, 100 years from now to know
that women
fought for equality. It wasn't
just given

35:41.573 --> 35:46.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to them. I want them to come
here and be astonished
that there was ever a time when
women could

35:46.745 --> 35:52.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not vote, that there was ever a
time where
a woman never sat in the Oval
Office.

35:52.984 --> 35:57.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And speaking of
the Oval Office,
that brings us to our latest
addition to the

35:57.956 --> 35:59.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
"NewsHour" Bookshelf.

35:59.324 --> 36:01.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
First, some background.

36:01.359 --> 36:03.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Finally, fathers will be able to
say to their

36:03.461 --> 36:06.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
daughters, you too can grow up
to be president.

36:06.564 --> 36:08.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

36:08.433 --> 36:12.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Making her second
run, Hillary
Clinton is far from the first
woman to set

36:12.837 --> 36:19.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her eyes on the nation's highest
office. She
follows more than 200 American
women in that

36:19.210 --> 36:21.079 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
quest.

36:21.179 --> 36:35.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Take the first, Victoria
Woodhull. The 32-year-old
launched her bid in 1870, almost
half-a-century

36:35.727 --> 36:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a group she organized. Woodhull
faced opposition
in the press, depicted as a
devil for supporting

36:42.600 --> 36:49.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the free love movement, by which
she meant
the freedom to marry, divorce
and bear children.

36:49.340 --> 36:55.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Almost 100 years later came
Maine's Margaret
Chase Smith, the first woman to
be elected

36:55.280 --> 37:00.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into the Senate in her own
right. At President
John F. Kennedy's last press
conference in

37:01.086 --> 37:05.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
1963, he was asked about a
potential Smith
run.

37:05.290 --> 37:07.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN F. KENNEDY, President of
the United States:
If I were a Republican
candidate, I would

37:07.492 --> 37:10.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not look forward to campaigning
against Margaret
Chase Smith to New Hampshire.
She is a very

37:10.995 --> 37:13.031 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
formidable political figure.

37:13.131 --> 37:15.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:15.166 --> 37:20.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Smith's bid for
the 1964 Republican
nomination was unsuccessful, but
her candidacy

37:20.305 --> 37:25.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
turned out to be no laughing
matter. She became
the first woman to have her
named entered

37:25.610 --> 37:28.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into nomination at a major
party's convention.

37:29.013 --> 37:32.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET CHASE SMITH,
Presidential Candidate:
Women before me pioneered and
smoothed the

37:32.917 --> 37:40.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way for me to be the first women
to be elected
to both the House and the
Senate, and that

37:41.059 --> 37:46.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I should give back in return
that which had
been given to me.

37:46.364 --> 37:51.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just four years
after Smith
gave back came Shirley Chisholm,
the first

37:52.036 --> 37:57.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
black woman elected to Congress
in 1968, who
moved on to become the first
black woman to

37:58.042 --> 38:03.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
run as a major-party candidate
for president
in 1972.

38:03.515 --> 38:09.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It was a short-lived, but
memorable bid, with
the slogan "Unbought and
Unbossed." She said

38:10.054 --> 38:11.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
her campaign was for the
have-nots.

38:11.990 --> 38:16.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHIRLEY CHISHOLM, Presidential
Candidate:
I am not the candidate of black
America, although

38:16.528 --> 38:19.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I am black and proud.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.932 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

38:21.032 --> 38:26.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHIRLEY CHISHOLM: I am not the
candidate of
the women's movement of this
country, although

38:27.071 --> 38:30.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I am a woman, and I am equally
proud of that.

38:30.942 --> 38:32.210 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

38:32.310 --> 38:36.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHIRLEY CHISHOLM: I am the
candidate of the
people of America.

38:36.614 --> 38:38.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

38:38.116 --> 38:42.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: These women
helped set the
stage for Hillary Clinton.

38:42.720 --> 38:49.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Already, Clinton has made it
further than
any woman before her. Historian
Ellen Fitzpatrick

38:49.494 --> 38:54.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
profiles the three who laid the
groundwork
for Clinton in her new book,
"The Highest

38:54.999 --> 38:58.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Glass Ceiling: Women's Quest for
the American
Presidency."

38:59.003 --> 39:01.005 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ellen Fitzpatrick, welcome.

39:01.105 --> 39:01.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELLEN FITZPATRICK, Author, "The
Highest Glass
Ceiling: Women's Quest for the
American Presidency":

39:01.839 --> 39:03.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you. Nice to be here.

39:03.741 --> 39:06.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, there have
been a lot of
books written about women in
politics, but

39:06.344 --> 39:12.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you specifically wanted to focus
on women
going after the top job, the
presidency. Why?

39:12.383 --> 39:16.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELLEN FITZPATRICK: Well, there
had been very
little, I noticed, done on this
subject. There

39:16.354 --> 39:22.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had been a lot of books about
the idea of
a woman president, but no
historian had really

39:22.560 --> 39:25.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
looked at this question, no
academic historian.

39:25.830 --> 39:31.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It had sort of fallen between
the crevices.
On the one hand, there's so much
presidential

39:31.402 --> 39:35.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
history. On the other hand,
there's a lot
of wonderful work in women's
history. But

39:35.573 --> 39:39.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
women presidential candidates
had largely
been shunted aside.

39:39.510 --> 39:44.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hillary Clinton,
right now,
she is the front-runner for the
Democratic

39:44.649 --> 39:46.384 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nomination.

39:46.484 --> 39:51.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the three women you focus on
were women
who, because of the time they
went for the

39:51.422 --> 39:56.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
presidency, it was a very
different environment.
Why did you pick these three?

39:56.594 --> 39:58.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And start with Victoria
Woodhull, 1872.

39:58.963 --> 40:00.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELLEN FITZPATRICK: Remarkable.

40:00.999 --> 40:07.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She emerged during
Reconstruction, which was
the period after the Civil War
when many questions

40:07.205 --> 40:13.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were being raised about what
freedom and democracy
in America really meant. We had
just fought

40:13.378 --> 40:19.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this brutal and bloody Civil
War, and in the
aftermath of it, there were four
million slaves

40:19.584 --> 40:27.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
emancipated and new
constitutional amendments
written to confer new rights on
African-Americans.

40:27.125 --> 40:33.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In that moment, the suffrage
movement began
to make its claim that women
should be included

40:33.264 --> 40:38.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in these new liberties, that
women's voting
rights should be established.
And Victoria

40:38.136 --> 40:45.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Woodhull emerged in the middle
of that debate
and said: Why not run for the
office itself?

40:45.376 --> 40:48.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I can embody the cause of
women's equality.

40:48.880 --> 40:53.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And then it was
almost another
100 years before another woman
you look at

40:53.951 --> 40:58.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- that was Margaret Chase Smith
-- had been
the senator from the state of
Maine -- she

40:58.389 --> 41:05.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was a Republican -- went for the
presidency.
But she was also facing very,
very tough odds.

41:05.897 --> 41:11.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELLEN FITZPATRICK: What was
extraordinary
was to find out, in 1964, the
kinds of things

41:11.469 --> 41:16.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said about Margaret Chase Smith,
who arguably
was really the best prepared of
any woman

41:16.974 --> 41:23.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who had run, certainly to that
point, were
actually more sexist than what
was being said

41:23.514 --> 41:26.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about Victoria Woodhull in 1870.

41:26.818 --> 41:31.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was depicted as, on the one
hand, she
had been greatly admired. As
soon as she announced

41:31.789 --> 41:38.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her bid for the presidency, she
was depicted
as menopausal, addled, not
really up to the

41:38.363 --> 41:40.131 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
responsibility.

41:40.231 --> 41:45.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And then, just a
few years
later, Shirley Chisholm, who ran
for president

41:45.370 --> 41:52.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the early 1970s, first
African-American
woman elected to Congress. So,
she jumped

41:52.343 --> 41:54.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that hurdle, but the presidency
was something
else altogether.

41:54.679 --> 41:56.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ELLEN FITZPATRICK: Right.

41:56.581 --> 42:00.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was on the national stage
from the moment
of her election, and she was a
vociferous

42:00.618 --> 42:06.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
critic of the Nixon
administration. She got
a lot of press. She was
well-known. But she

42:06.491 --> 42:13.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
too was really ridiculed when
she announced
her bid for the presidency in
1972, but she

42:13.598 --> 42:15.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stuck with it and went all the
way to the
convention.

42:15.566 --> 42:20.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you draw
from all of
this, Ellen Fitzpatrick, in
terms of lessons

42:20.338 --> 42:25.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for Hillary Clinton this year or
any other
woman who wants to be president?

42:25.276 --> 42:29.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELLEN FITZPATRICK: Well, I think
the most
striking thing that we're seeing
in contemporary

42:29.881 --> 42:36.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
politics is that now, in Hillary
Clinton,
there is a woman candidate who
has overcome

42:36.154 --> 42:42.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the biggest obstacles in the way
of the women
that preceded her, but there is
no failure

42:42.894 --> 42:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like success in this case,
because she has
been able to raise a lot of
money.

42:48.733 --> 42:56.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That sunk every previous
candidate. She has
strong support from her party.
Very few women

42:56.808 --> 43:04.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been able to get that. A
high national
profile. And she is widely seen,
because of

43:04.449 --> 43:08.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her -- secretary of state, as
capable in foreign
affairs.

43:08.119 --> 43:12.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, she's overcome these
prejudices, but she's
now seen as establishment.

43:12.256 --> 43:17.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Some would say,
looking at
the polls, that the main
obstacles she faces

43:17.495 --> 43:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't have to do with gender.
They have to
do whether it's the controversy
over the e-mails

43:22.633 --> 43:23.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or people say they don't trust
her.

43:23.868 --> 43:24.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ELLEN FITZPATRICK: Right.

43:24.802 --> 43:26.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you read
that?

43:26.771 --> 43:29.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELLEN FITZPATRICK: The way I
read it is that
a lot of Americans will say
today that they're

43:29.640 --> 43:34.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
happy to vote for a woman
president, and they're
even enthusiastic about that.

43:34.445 --> 43:41.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a huge reversal from the
early 20th
century. But they often will
say, I just don't

43:41.486 --> 43:49.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like that woman. And I think
that the way
that I read it is that it's hard
to imagine

43:49.193 --> 43:55.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anyone overcoming all these
obstacles and
also having this likability,
universal likability

43:55.500 --> 43:58.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
factor that some seem to be
looking for.

43:58.202 --> 44:02.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about the
fact, Ellen
Fitzpatrick, that, in the United
States, we

44:03.007 --> 44:10.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
elected an African-American
president before
we may elect a woman president?

44:10.615 --> 44:16.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELLEN FITZPATRICK: Well, that
was an important
moment in overcoming a long,
obviously, and

44:16.821 --> 44:23.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
torturous racial history in the
United States
of tremendous inequality in
political life.

44:23.494 --> 44:29.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the changes that occurred in
the Democratic
Party and the Republican Party
in the 1970s

44:29.734 --> 44:36.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
created the opening for women
and African-Americans
to move up in the party system,
and, hence,

44:36.841 --> 44:40.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Barack Obama could emerge and
Hillary Clinton
as well.

44:40.845 --> 44:46.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, women should
take away
from this book that a woman will
one day be

44:46.350 --> 44:47.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
elected president, or not?

44:47.418 --> 44:49.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELLEN FITZPATRICK: Well, but not
easily.

44:49.353 --> 44:54.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that it's important
to know the
history to really appreciate
what the stakes

44:55.059 --> 44:56.694 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are.

44:56.794 --> 45:01.599 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ellen
Fitzpatrick, a great
book, "The Highest Glass
Ceiling: Women's

45:01.699 --> 45:03.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Quest for the American
Presidency."

45:03.935 --> 45:04.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you so much.

45:04.869 --> 45:06.504 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELLEN FITZPATRICK: Thank you,
Judy.

45:06.604 --> 45:22.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In a rural
Nebraska village
of less than 200 people, a local
artist is

45:22.653 --> 45:27.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
attempting to get drivers
passing through
to stop and spend a little money
locally,

45:27.491 --> 45:31.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
while at the same time doubling
the town's
population.

45:31.462 --> 45:40.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From PBS member station NET,
Nebraska Education
Television, Mike Tobias
explains.

45:40.137 --> 45:54.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE TOBIAS: There's Ralph
Hodson, little
Audrey, Ralph and Hank, the
friendly villagers

45:54.719 --> 46:00.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Taylor, old-fashioned, kind
of stoic folks,
a little stiff, wooden,
actually.

46:00.625 --> 46:06.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARAH SANDOZ, Artist: I want as
many wooden
people as there are actual
people in Taylor,

46:06.497 --> 46:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which is only 182. I can do it.

46:09.100 --> 46:16.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE TOBIAS: Marah Sandoz is one
of the actual
people, and creator of the
wooden ones.

46:16.941 --> 46:21.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A couple decades ago, she got
involved with
a local economic development
group brainstorming

46:21.512 --> 46:23.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about ways to help the fading
village.

46:24.048 --> 46:30.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARAH SANDOZ: What can we do to
stop the traffic?
What can we create for people to
see?

46:30.855 --> 46:37.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we went back to, OK, what
do we have?
We have a couple really cool
historic buildings.

46:37.695 --> 46:44.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's go back to that era and
let's recreate
what was when this town was
booming, when

46:44.535 --> 46:46.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this town was bustling.

46:46.537 --> 46:51.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE TOBIAS: It became Sandoz's
project, a
self-described, self-trained
artist with experience

46:51.542 --> 46:57.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
using wood and paint. She
hatched the idea
of life-sized plywood cutouts
depicting people

46:57.415 --> 47:02.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who might have lived in the
village between
1890 and 1920, when Taylor had
twice as many

47:02.787 --> 47:08.659 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
people as today.

47:08.759 --> 47:16.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first villagers arrived in
2003, Herbert
and Alice, near the historic,
now unused Pavilion

47:16.667 --> 47:18.369 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Hotel.

47:18.469 --> 47:22.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARAH SANDOZ: People thought
they were fun.
They were different. People said
that they

47:22.273 --> 47:25.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had to stop and wait because
they thought
that the people wanted top cross
the street.

47:25.843 --> 47:30.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They wave at them. It created a
lot of local
chatter.

47:30.247 --> 47:36.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE TOBIAS: The villager
population has since
grown to about 100 of the
cutouts. Sandoz

47:36.987 --> 47:42.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
does most of the work, with a
little help
from family and locals. Location
is often

47:42.126 --> 47:43.994 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a starting point for the artist.

47:44.095 --> 47:51.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARAH SANDOZ: So, a lot of my
ideas come from
seeing a spot. I tend to see
canvases in the

47:51.535 --> 47:58.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
community, what would have been
happening
there in 1910.

47:58.209 --> 48:04.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE TOBIAS: The villagers
caused a pair of
westbound travelers to stop.

48:04.682 --> 48:08.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Well, first reaction, we
thought it was
real, you know, it was real,
just kind of

48:08.786 --> 48:10.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
somebody standing there, you
know?

48:10.621 --> 48:13.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: And it has kind of an
inviting look to
it, you know? And it makes you
want to find

48:13.624 --> 48:17.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out more about it. So, we're --
actually,
we're thrilled that we stopped
here and find

48:17.995 --> 48:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out this is where they're being
made and a
little bit about the villagers,
as they call

48:22.600 --> 48:24.435 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

48:24.535 --> 48:28.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE TOBIAS: Right now, there's
only so much
revenue the villagers can
generate for Taylor,

48:28.372 --> 48:32.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because there are only a handful
of places
to spend money in the only town
in one of

48:32.943 --> 48:34.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nebraska's least populated
counties.

48:35.045 --> 48:41.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that population has been
declining for
decades. Sandoz believes the
villagers project

48:42.086 --> 48:43.954 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can change that.

48:44.054 --> 48:49.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARAH SANDOZ: We're creating a
really positive
climate for antique and retro
stuff, and so

48:49.727 --> 48:55.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will see if we can get some
other little businesses
around the square that can fill
those tourism

48:55.566 --> 48:57.401 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
niches.

48:57.501 --> 49:02.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE TOBIAS: For now, Sandoz
will do her part
by creating more villagers, six
a year, until

49:02.940 --> 49:08.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's enough wooden people to
symbolically
double the town's population,
all with the

49:08.412 --> 49:15.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hope that real people will start
coming to
Taylor, instead of leaving.

49:15.219 --> 49:23.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Mike
Tobias in
Taylor, Nebraska.

49:23.661 --> 49:34.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
just in time
for this primary season, an
essay on political

49:34.371 --> 49:36.340 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rhetoric.

49:36.440 --> 49:40.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Barton Swaim was the chief --
was the speechwriter
for former South Carolina
Governor Mark Sanford.

49:41.011 --> 49:46.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Swaim believes that perhaps the
best solution
to improving political speech is
for politicians

49:47.017 --> 49:48.819 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to just say less.

49:48.919 --> 49:52.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARTON SWAIM, Speechwriter: It's
easy to dislike
politicians, especially when we
hear them

49:52.857 --> 49:54.792 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
speak.

49:54.892 --> 49:58.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They cram their speeches with
wonkish hooey
and hedge their statements with
so many qualifiers

49:58.729 --> 50:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that you're sometimes left
unsure what those
statements even mean.

50:02.533 --> 50:07.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I used to work for a politician
as a speechwriter,
and I confess I came up with
fair amount of

50:07.771 --> 50:13.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
verbal rubbish in my day. But
let's give our
politicians a break. We expect
them to speak

50:13.410 --> 50:16.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
far too often, about far too
many subjects.

50:17.047 --> 50:22.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Think of the president. A
half-century ago,
the president spoke only rarely
in public,

50:22.620 --> 50:27.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
once a week maybe. Now he speaks
in public
settings all week long,
sometimes several

50:28.058 --> 50:32.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
times in a single day, to all
sorts of gatherings
on a vast range of topics.

50:32.496 --> 50:38.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not natural to orate that
often. You
run out of interesting things to
say. And,

50:38.302 --> 50:43.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make it worse, your every
utterance is
scrutinized by reporters and
political adversaries

50:43.674 --> 50:45.976 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for anything offensive or
controversial.

50:46.076 --> 50:52.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, what are politicians
supposed to do? They
have to speak all the time, but
without saying

50:52.449 --> 50:58.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
anything that might cause
trouble. They have
no choice, really, but to
generate reams of

50:58.255 --> 51:00.658 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
semi-meaningless verbiage.

51:00.758 --> 51:05.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know what it sounds like.
You have heard
politicians droning on about the
American

51:05.396 --> 51:07.231 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
exceptionalism...

51:07.331 --> 51:08.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
Exceptionalism that has made
this nation a

51:08.565 --> 51:11.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
clarion voice for freedom in the
world.

51:11.302 --> 51:13.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARTON SWAIM: About how we can
build an...

51:13.237 --> 51:14.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Economy where hard work is
rewarded.

51:14.505 --> 51:16.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARTON SWAIM: ... economy where
hard work
is rewarded,

51:16.173 --> 51:19.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
About how we're going to give
our kids and
grandkids the future they
deserve.

51:19.209 --> 51:19.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Give our kids and grandkids the
future they

51:19.910 --> 51:21.779 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
deserve.

51:21.879 --> 51:23.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARTON SWAIM: About how good
things happen
when America is engaged with
friends and allies.

51:23.814 --> 51:28.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEB BUSH (R), Former Florida
Governor: Alert
to danger, resolved to deal with
threats before

51:28.585 --> 51:30.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they become catastrophes.

51:30.454 --> 51:33.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARTON SWAIM: You have heard
these phrases,
sometimes many of them strung
together all

51:34.058 --> 51:38.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at once, and concluded that you
don't know
what any of it meant.

51:38.896 --> 51:44.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, empty verbosity will
always be
a part of democratic politics.
But can we

51:44.201 --> 51:50.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lower the supply of it, even by
a little?
Maybe we can by asking our
politicians to

51:50.507 --> 51:54.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
speak less often and about fewer
things.

51:54.378 --> 51:59.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The politician I worked for
spoke at a dizzying
array of events every week,
ground-breakings,

51:59.917 --> 52:05.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ribbon-cuttings, awards
ceremonies, industry
group gatherings, and many
others. He was

52:05.322 --> 52:10.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
invited to speak at these events
chiefly because
he was the governor, not because
he had some

52:10.361 --> 52:12.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
special insight to impart.

52:12.763 --> 52:19.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In most cases, it served no
useful purpose
for him to be there at all. We
can't stop

52:19.136 --> 52:23.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
politicians from speaking so
much. There's
the First Amendment. But maybe
we could stop

52:24.074 --> 52:26.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
inviting them to speak so
frequently.

52:26.377 --> 52:32.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Consider, for example, a
moratorium on elected
officials addressing graduation
ceremonies.

52:32.649 --> 52:37.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
My guess is that most
politicians would enjoy
not speaking so often. Some of
them like the

52:38.055 --> 52:43.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sound of their own voice, for
sure. But many
of them realize that, if you
want to be listened

52:43.460 --> 52:48.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to, the best thing to do is keep
quiet until
you have got something to say.

52:48.732 --> 52:52.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we would miss
them if they
spoke less.

gap in professional
sports, but gender equality
among athletes

53:09.820 --> 53:14.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
goes beyond the money. You can

you, and good night.
