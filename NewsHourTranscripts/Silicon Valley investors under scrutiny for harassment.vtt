ANCHOR: The technology
sector, and especially
the start-up culture

00:04.433 --> 00:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Silicon Valley, has long been
criticized for its record on
diversity, gender and inclusion.

00:10.966 --> 00:14.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, the spotlight is
being shone a spotlight
on the investors and
funders in the valley.

00:14.833 --> 00:15.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's Hari Sreenivasan.

00:17.866 --> 00:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN, PBS NEWSHOUR
CORRESPONDENT: The scrutiny
has intensified in recent weeks

00:19.900 --> 00:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after two publications, "The
Information" and "The New York
Times," documented how prominent

00:26.433 --> 00:30.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
venture capitalists had
been accused of making
unwanted sexual advances
through texts, phone

00:30.900 --> 00:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
calls and physical intimidation.

00:32.966 --> 00:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These powerful investors used
their power to harass dozens
of women in whose companies

00:37.200 --> 00:39.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they might invest.

00:39.266 --> 00:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It led to the resignation of
Dave McClure, who was the CEO
of tech incubator, 500 Startups.

00:45.800 --> 00:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
McClure apologized after he was
accused of harassment by other
women and wrote to a prospective

00:51.033 --> 00:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
employee, quote, I was getting
confused figuring out whether
to hire you or hit on you.

00:56.400 --> 00:59.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Freada Kapor Klein is an
entrepreneur and leading voice
pushing companies to increase

00:59.300 --> 01:01.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
culture and diversity.

01:01.366 --> 01:05.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kapor Klein and her husband
invest in several startups,
including some funds run by 500

01:05.900 --> 01:06.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Startups.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She joins me now from Oakland.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Freada, you have been
working on this for decades.

01:10.033 --> 01:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why are those two stories in the
past couple of weeks resonating?

01:12.600 --> 01:16.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FREADA KAPOR KLEIN, FOUNDER,
LEVEL PLAYING INSTITUTE: Well,
I think, finally, Silicon

01:16.566 --> 01:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Valley is willing to look at
itself and to recognize it
may be on the leading edge of

01:22.933 --> 01:25.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
investing in tech.

01:25.100 --> 01:29.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's certainly on the
trailing edge of dealing
with its own ecosystem,
diversity and inclusion

01:31.500 --> 01:32.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in particular.

01:32.500 --> 01:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Why is it --

01:33.500 --> 01:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAPOR KLEIN: Venture capital --

01:34.500 --> 01:35.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SREENIVASAN: Go ahead.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAPOR KLEIN: Pardon?

01:37.466 --> 01:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was going to say, venture
capital is now looking at
behaviors that it's engaging in

01:42.966 --> 01:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that were addressed on Wall
Street more than 20 years ago.

01:47.433 --> 01:51.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: there aren't
exactly any stats on this,
but how pervasive is it?

01:51.733 --> 01:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, you've started projects
to include women and people
of color to try to foster

01:58.733 --> 02:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
change in the pipeline and it's
important to point out that
this isn't just about gender.

02:03.500 --> 02:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is also about race and
sexual orientation sometimes.

02:05.833 --> 02:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAPOR KLEIN: Exactly, and I
think a term that's a bit bulky
but a very important concept,

02:12.833 --> 02:17.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
what we see is
intersectionality,
meaning we can have
multiple identities.

02:17.066 --> 02:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's important to point out
that the women who told their
stories to the information

02:22.033 --> 02:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about binary capital and the
women who came forward against
Dave McClure in the "New York

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Times," all of those were
women of color, and talking
about unwelcome advances from

02:33.900 --> 02:35.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Caucasian men.

02:35.966 --> 02:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we need to look at that
racial dynamic as it's layered
in with the gender dynamic.

02:42.166 --> 02:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And you're absolutely right.

02:44.033 --> 02:45.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's an abuse of power.

02:45.966 --> 02:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: One of the
interesting things people point
out about Uber is that there

02:48.966 --> 02:53.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were so many different
scandals where nothing
happened to the CEO really
until his big investors

02:55.533 --> 02:58.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
signed a letter and
asked him to step down.

02:58.033 --> 03:02.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It seems that money
talks much louder here.

03:02.200 --> 03:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAPOR KLEIN: Unfortunately,
money does talk much louder.

03:06.666 --> 03:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we've hit an era in
venture capital where greed is
everything and it, again, mimics

03:14.400 --> 03:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wall Street in the 1990s where
greed is good was a commonplace
statement and, in fact,

03:21.733 --> 03:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a commencement speech.

03:23.733 --> 03:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think now we have to
look at is the only thing
that matters dollars?

03:29.633 --> 03:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is it the dollars that get
invested in the entrepreneur?

03:32.133 --> 03:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is it the, quote-unquote,
unicorn status meaning
the billion-dollar
evaluation of a startup?

03:38.033 --> 03:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when are we going to expand
the ledger sheet to include
how people are treated, to

03:44.366 --> 03:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
include how venture capital
and startups behave as citizens
of the communities and of the

03:50.300 --> 03:52.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

03:52.366 --> 03:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: So, how do you
change that dynamic for venture
funding that's all chasing those

03:55.566 --> 03:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unicorns, they all want to get
rich quick, they all want to
fund the right startup that's

03:58.933 --> 04:02.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
going to make billions
and billions of dollars,
and it seems that
they're almost enabling

04:02.100 --> 04:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a culture that goes on because,
hey, it's all about profits?

04:05.500 --> 04:09.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAPOR KLEIN: Well, I think
that's right, and I think there
are several groups that are

04:09.466 --> 04:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to need to join
forces to make that change.

04:13.566 --> 04:18.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The venture capital
community itself has to
say, wait a second, we
aren't with the bottom

04:20.166 --> 04:24.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of the bottom here, and
we need to work to clean
up our own industry.

04:26.500 --> 04:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we also need to see the
limited partners who invest
in these venture funds need to

04:31.566 --> 04:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
start doing different kinds of
due diligence, different kinds
of demands about diversity

04:36.933 --> 04:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and inclusion in the venture
capital firm itself, in the
companies that are funded and

04:42.433 --> 04:45.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the values of the
startups that are created.

04:45.033 --> 04:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, the limited partners
can create a lot of change.

04:49.266 --> 04:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The entrepreneurs
themselves, one of the
things we need to point
out is that venture capital

04:56.633 --> 04:59.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as currently constructed
is leaving billions of
dollars on the table
because they're overlooking

05:02.233 --> 05:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
underrepresented entrepreneurs
who have great ideas and who
can serve real communities'

05:09.200 --> 05:10.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
real needs.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SREENIVASAN: All right.

05:11.700 --> 05:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Freada Kapor Klein joining
us from Oakland tonight.

05:13.033 --> 05:14.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thanks so much.

05:14.033 --> 05:15.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KLEIN: Thank you.
