THERE WERE SEVERAL SERIOUS
ERRORS MADE.

12:16.757 --> 12:18.514
THERE WERE SEVERAL SERIOUS
ERRORS MADE.
THE FIRST BEING THAT IT

12:18.516 --> 12:19.709
ERRORS MADE.
THE FIRST BEING THAT IT
ALLOWED -- IT WAS THE ISSUE OF

12:19.711 --> 12:20.904
THE FIRST BEING THAT IT
ALLOWED -- IT WAS THE ISSUE OF

QUESTION OF RACE IN THIS CASE.

12:25.787 --> 12:27.744
IN CLOSING SAID THAT IT WASN'T A
QUESTION OF RACE IN THIS CASE.
AND I THINK THAT WAS A

12:27.746 --> 12:29.172
QUESTION OF RACE IN THIS CASE.
AND I THINK THAT WAS A
SIGNIFICANT ERROR AND A

12:29.174 --> 12:31.364
AND I THINK THAT WAS A
SIGNIFICANT ERROR AND A
SIGNIFICANT FALSE FACT, REALLY.

12:31.366 --> 12:32.459
SIGNIFICANT ERROR AND A
SIGNIFICANT FALSE FACT, REALLY.
THE SECOND THING I WOULD POINT

12:32.461 --> 12:33.853
SIGNIFICANT FALSE FACT, REALLY.
THE SECOND THING I WOULD POINT
OUT IS YOU KNOW, THE JURY

12:33.855 --> 12:37.572
THE SECOND THING I WOULD POINT
OUT IS YOU KNOW, THE JURY
SELECTION IN THIS CASE, I DON'T

12:37.574 --> 12:39.399
OUT IS YOU KNOW, THE JURY
SELECTION IN THIS CASE, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND HOW THE PROSECUTION

12:39.401 --> 12:41.922
SELECTION IN THIS CASE, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND HOW THE PROSECUTION
BELIEVED THAT A JURY OF SIX

12:41.924 --> 12:43.980
UNDERSTAND HOW THE PROSECUTION
BELIEVED THAT A JURY OF SIX
WHITE WOMEN WAS GOING TO BE

12:43.982 --> 12:46.869
BELIEVED THAT A JURY OF SIX
WHITE WOMEN WAS GOING TO BE
FAVORABLE TO ITS CASE AGAINST

WHITE WOMEN WAS GOING TO BE
FAVORABLE TO ITS CASE AGAINST
MR. ZIMMERMAN.

12:47.336 --> 12:49.360
FAVORABLE TO ITS CASE AGAINST
MR. ZIMMERMAN.
SO I THINK THAT WAS ANOTHER

12:49.362 --> 12:49.691
MR. ZIMMERMAN.
SO I THINK THAT WAS ANOTHER
ERROR.

12:49.693 --> 12:50.821
SO I THINK THAT WAS ANOTHER
ERROR.
SEVERAL OF THE WITNESSES THAT

12:50.823 --> 12:52.879

TO BE UNPREPARED OR
UNDERPREPARED TO PRESENT A
MR. ZIMMERMAN.

12:58.857 --> 13:00.615
UNDERPREPARED TO PRESENT A
MR. ZIMMERMAN.
SO I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF

13:00.617 --> 13:02.143
MR. ZIMMERMAN.
SO I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF
ISSUES AND ERRORS IN TERMS OF
