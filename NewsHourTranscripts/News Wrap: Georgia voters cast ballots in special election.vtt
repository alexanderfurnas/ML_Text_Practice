JUDY WOODRUFF: The battle
over tax cuts is heating up.

00:03.933 --> 00:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The speaker of the House of
Representatives, Paul Ryan,
promised today that Republicans

00:08.433 --> 00:12.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
are moving full-speed
ahead, despite divisions
over the issue.

00:12.533 --> 00:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a Washington speech,
he said the GOP majorities
in Congress must press for
he called transformational

00:19.466 --> 00:20.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tax reform.

00:20.466 --> 00:22.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House: We have to
get this done in 2017.

00:24.133 --> 00:27.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We cannot let this
once-in-a-generation
moment slip by.

00:27.200 --> 00:32.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, the defenders of the
status quo -- and there are many
of them -- they are counting

00:34.133 --> 00:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on us to lose our nerve, to
fall back, or put this off
altogether, but we will not wait

00:38.433 --> 00:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for a path free of obstacles.

00:40.366 --> 00:41.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Guess what?

00:41.366 --> 00:43.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It doesn't exist.

00:43.500 --> 00:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In turn, Senate
Democrats warned that they may
balk at raising the national

00:46.466 --> 00:51.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debt ceiling if Republicans
push for new tax
breaks for the wealthy.

00:51.266 --> 00:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Voters in Atlanta's northern
suburbs went to the polls today
in a special election that

00:58.133 --> 01:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is now the most expensive
race ever for a seat
in the U.S. House.

01:00.833 --> 01:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Total spending in the contest
between Republican Karen Handel
and Democrat Jon Ossoff reached

01:06.566 --> 01:08.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at least $50 million.

01:08.966 --> 01:13.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The seat came open when Tom
Price took the job of secretary
of health and human services

01:14.700 --> 01:15.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for President Trump.

01:15.966 --> 01:19.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It has been in GOP
hands since 1979.

01:19.666 --> 01:21.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's been another
incident over Syria.

01:21.900 --> 01:26.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An American fighter plane
shot down an Iranian-made
armed drone overnight.

01:26.400 --> 01:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. officials say it was
flying near a U.S. training camp
along the Syrian-Jordan border.

01:33.433 --> 01:37.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Sunday, American planes
downed a Syrian military jet
that bombed near U.S.-backed

01:37.800 --> 01:39.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rebels.

01:39.266 --> 01:42.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russia, in turn, warned it
would target coalition planes.

01:42.666 --> 01:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, at the United Nations,
Secretary-General Antonio
Guterres urged restraint.

01:49.766 --> 01:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTONIO GUTERRES, United Nations
Secretary-General: These kind of
incidents can be very dangerous

01:51.800 --> 01:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a conflict situation in
which there are so many actors
and in which the situation

01:56.066 --> 01:58.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is so complex on the ground,
so, indeed, I am concerned.

01:58.500 --> 02:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I hope that this will
not lead to any escalation of
the conflict that is already

02:04.233 --> 02:06.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as dramatic as it is.

02:06.866 --> 02:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the
U.S. coalition members,
Australia, announced today
that it has suspended

02:11.300 --> 02:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
airstrikes in Syria for now.

02:13.266 --> 02:17.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The United States and Russia
traded accusations today
over another incident.

02:18.766 --> 02:21.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This one came Monday
over the Baltic Sea.

02:21.300 --> 02:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Pentagon says that a
Russian fighter jet swooped
within a few feet of an
American reconnaissance

02:26.000 --> 02:27.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
plane in the air.

02:27.533 --> 02:32.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Russians say the U.S. plane
swerved too close to their jet.

02:32.200 --> 02:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country,
brand-new federal statistics
find the opioid abuse crisis
is swamping hospitals.

02:39.233 --> 02:44.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
According to the report,
there were nearly 1.3
million emergency room
visits and in-patient

02:45.266 --> 02:47.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stays for opioid
problems in 2014.

02:47.700 --> 02:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The emergency visits were up
64 percent from 2005, while
in-patient stays nearly doubled.

02:55.800 --> 02:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Officials say the epidemic
is still getting worse.

02:59.033 --> 03:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Atlantic hurricane season
is only three weeks' old, and
already, the Gulf Coast is

03:03.333 --> 03:05.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bracing for a hit.

03:05.800 --> 03:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tropical Storm Cindy
formed today and should
reach the Texas-Louisiana
border region late

03:11.033 --> 03:12.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tomorrow night.

03:12.533 --> 03:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A foot of rain could fall as far
east as the Florida Panhandle.

03:15.733 --> 03:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The rain was already
falling, and the sea churning
today in New Orleans.

03:20.166 --> 03:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mayor Mitch Landrieu
urged people to get ready.

03:22.633 --> 03:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH LANDRIEU (D), Mayor of
New Orleans, Louisiana: And we
have been through this many,

03:24.700 --> 03:25.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
many times before.

03:25.700 --> 03:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't want anybody to panic.

03:27.466 --> 03:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no reason to do that.

03:29.033 --> 03:31.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But this is going to
be a serious event.

03:31.866 --> 03:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We could get lucky, and it
could turn out to be nothing.

03:34.900 --> 03:36.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We don't expect that's
going to happen.

03:36.366 --> 03:38.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It could be one to three inches,
or it could be three to 12.

03:38.466 --> 03:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if those bands hit us the
wrong way intimately over time,
then we could have some serious

03:43.000 --> 03:44.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
flooding.

03:44.933 --> 03:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At the same
time, Tropical Storm Bret
weakened to a tropical wave, as

03:48.233 --> 03:50.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it blew across the
Southern Caribbean.

03:50.500 --> 03:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, the Southwestern
U.S. is seeing one of its worst
heat waves in years on this

03:56.266 --> 03:58.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
first day of summer.

03:58.300 --> 04:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Temperatures reached to near
120 degrees in Phoenix today
for the first time in 22 years.

04:04.200 --> 04:08.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The conditions are also
tough on fire crews battling
wildfires in Southern California

04:09.166 --> 04:11.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and elsewhere.

04:11.200 --> 04:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Helicopters and tanker planes
have reduced their loads
because the superheated air is

04:15.466 --> 04:17.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
thinner.

04:17.533 --> 04:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wall Street cooled off some
today, as falling oil prices
took the broader market lower.

04:23.800 --> 04:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial
average lost nearly 62
points to close at 21467.

04:28.533 --> 04:33.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Nasdaq fell 51, and
the S&amp;P 500 slipped 16.

04:34.266 --> 04:36.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And a cultural note.

04:36.300 --> 04:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Barbie's longtime companion
doll, Ken, has a new look
-- 15 of them, in fact.

04:42.633 --> 04:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Toymaker Mattel unveiled the
revamped dolls today with a
range of body types, skin tones

04:48.133 --> 04:51.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and hair styles, from
cornrows to man buns.

04:51.566 --> 04:56.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ken's makeover follows a similar
effort to make Barbie's image
more realistic and diverse.

04:57.900 --> 04:58.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's about time.
