JUDY WOODRUFF: Aid
organizations, especially
those working in conflict
zones like Yemen,

00:05.633 --> 00:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say it's crucial that they
remain politically neutral.

00:09.233 --> 00:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They say it's the only way
they can safely do their jobs.

00:12.566 --> 00:17.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But a recent investigation by
The New York Times reveals how
one company may have endangered

00:18.700 --> 00:21.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that neutrality for many
humanitarian groups.

00:21.433 --> 00:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has that story.

00:23.566 --> 00:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: UNICEF and
the Red Cross are two of the
humanitarian groups working

00:26.800 --> 00:31.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Yemen, where a brutal civil
war has killed or injured
at least 12,000 people.

00:33.800 --> 00:36.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Times today revealed that
a logistics company known
as Transoceanic Development

00:36.566 --> 00:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wasn't only helping those aid
groups get their supplies into
Yemen, but the company was also

00:41.433 --> 00:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
secretly helping U.S.
special forces do the same.

00:45.200 --> 00:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Times reports how this
dual relationship could drive
suspicion that the aid groups

00:49.800 --> 00:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were somehow acting as agents
of the U.S. government.

00:52.900 --> 00:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm joined now by Eric Schmitt.

00:54.533 --> 00:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's one of The Times'
reporters who broke this story.

00:57.400 --> 00:59.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And by Daryl Grisgraber.

00:59.966 --> 01:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's a senior advocate
at Refugees International,
which is an aid group
that operates in the

01:03.400 --> 01:05.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Middle East, Africa,
and Southeast Asia.

01:05.933 --> 01:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She previously worked for
Amnesty International.

01:08.366 --> 01:09.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Eric Schmitt, I would
like to start with you.

01:11.866 --> 01:14.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let's just go over some
of these details again.

01:14.433 --> 01:18.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So this logistics company,
Transoceanic Development,
is working to deliver
and help deliver aid

01:20.666 --> 01:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supplies to Yemen for these
aid groups, while they're also
doing some work for U.S. special

01:27.633 --> 01:29.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forces.

01:29.133 --> 01:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Can you explain those two
relationships a little bit?

01:30.333 --> 01:31.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ERIC SCHMITT, The New
York Times: Right.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Transoceanic is this giant
global logistics company.

01:34.800 --> 01:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And its job is really to ferry
materials and shipments all over
the world for various customers.

01:41.766 --> 01:45.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a couple of its customers,
as you mentioned, are the
Red Cross and for UNICEF.

01:45.066 --> 01:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in this case, they did
some warehousing, they did some
basic bringing materials and

01:52.133 --> 01:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shipments of supplies into Yemen
that would then be delivered to
-- through other humanitarian

01:59.000 --> 02:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
organizations to the needy
in that strife-torn country.

02:03.733 --> 02:04.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So that's one of their jobs.

02:04.966 --> 02:06.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they were very
open about this.

02:06.966 --> 02:10.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when Mr. Darden was
kidnapped, his story became
quite public, because...

02:10.866 --> 02:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This
is the main, the central
character in your story,
who was sort of organizing

02:16.733 --> 02:18.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this organization in Yemen.

02:18.700 --> 02:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was kidnapped by some
rebels there, and then was
released after several years.

02:22.133 --> 02:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ERIC SCHMITT: That's right.

02:23.633 --> 02:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Scott Darden was the country
director for Transoceanic.

02:25.700 --> 02:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he was responsible kind of
at the front end for getting
these shipments of aid into

02:31.433 --> 02:32.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yemen.

02:32.433 --> 02:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, that story is quite public.

02:34.733 --> 02:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's new here is that it
turned out that Transoceanic
and Mr. Darden were also working

02:42.233 --> 02:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on secret contracts
involving shipping similar
types of materials into
Yemen for the military,

02:48.066 --> 02:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
specifically for the very
specialized special operations
forces, the commandos, who are

02:53.266 --> 02:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
operating in Yemen today.

02:55.233 --> 02:59.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And just
for the record, there's no
evidence that the aid groups had

02:59.000 --> 03:03.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
any idea that the company they
were hiring to do work for
them was also doing this work

03:03.600 --> 03:04.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the U.S. government.

03:04.733 --> 03:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ERIC SCHMITT: That's right.

03:06.833 --> 03:11.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Spokesmen for both UNICEF and
for the Red Cross said they
had no idea that Transoceanic

03:14.266 --> 03:19.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was carrying out these kind of
contracts with the military on
the logistics side of things.

03:19.200 --> 03:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And had they known, they may
have opted for another company.

03:22.500 --> 03:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I must say, there aren't a
lot of companies that get into
these kind of very dangerous

03:28.233 --> 03:30.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
war zone type of places.

03:30.300 --> 03:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it's not unusual to find
a company like Transoceanic
dealing with multiple kinds of

03:35.566 --> 03:37.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
customers.

03:37.233 --> 03:38.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
So, Daryl Grisgraber,
what is your reaction?

03:38.866 --> 03:39.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You read this story.

03:39.866 --> 03:42.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What was your response?

03:42.466 --> 03:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARYL GRISGRABER, Refugees
International: Initially,
we were all quite
dismayed as humanitarians,

03:44.633 --> 03:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because there's meant to be a
very strict separation between
military assistance, political

03:50.700 --> 03:52.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
assistance, and
humanitarian assistance.

03:52.733 --> 03:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there is quite a lively
debate that goes on right now
in the humanitarian world about

03:56.033 --> 04:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
keeping those separate
and when and how is it
possible to combine them.

04:00.600 --> 04:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the initial reaction
then is, because these got
combined, it's going to look bad

04:04.733 --> 04:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for humanitarians everywhere.

04:07.300 --> 04:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Humanitarians tend to
be a little bit under
suspicion anyway, just
because they're foreigners

04:13.900 --> 04:16.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
often in a country,
where we talk about
the U.N. or big INGOs.

04:16.266 --> 04:20.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And they operate very
significantly on trust,
building trust with
the people they serve,

04:20.800 --> 04:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as well as the governments
that allow them to operate.

04:23.533 --> 04:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to know now that the
humanitarian principle
of neutrality in
particular has potentially

04:30.966 --> 04:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been compromised or
even perceived to be
compromised is going to
affect all humanitarians.

04:34.866 --> 04:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, the
concern, just to spell it out
even more clearly, is that if

04:39.400 --> 04:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a government or groups operating
in a certain country somehow
thought that you were receiving

04:46.400 --> 04:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shipments from a company that
was also working for a partisan
group in that nation as well,

04:51.366 --> 04:52.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the humanitarian aid
workers might come under attack.

04:52.933 --> 04:55.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DARYL GRISGRABER:
Oh, for sure, yes.

04:55.266 --> 04:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Organizations could be banned
from operating in a country.

04:57.533 --> 05:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The humanitarian individuals
could come under attack.

05:00.300 --> 05:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in general, it's really
important to remember that
this just erodes the trust that

05:04.900 --> 05:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
allows humanitarians to do
work everywhere and get access
to the people who really need

05:09.066 --> 05:14.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them the most, because
that often involves
really emphasizing the
fact that you are neutral

05:14.066 --> 05:18.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and not on the side of a
conflict, and so it's OK for
you to be serving people.

05:18.100 --> 05:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Eric Schmitt,
in your piece you remind us
that there was a more notorious

05:22.733 --> 05:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
incident where the CIA
was operating in Pakistan,
and it literally did
blur these very lines

05:28.600 --> 05:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that we're talking about.

05:29.800 --> 05:30.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Can you tell us what
happened in that story?

05:30.733 --> 05:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ERIC SCHMITT: Sure, absolutely.

05:32.800 --> 05:37.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In an effort to try and
determine whether Osama
bin Laden was actually
hiding in a walled

05:39.266 --> 05:43.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
compound in Abbottabad, in this
town in Pakistan, they devised
a system where they would go

05:45.366 --> 05:48.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
door-to-door in that city and
do inoculations, and hoping
that somebody would come to the

05:50.733 --> 05:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
door, they would be able to
come inside, take inoculations
from presumably family members,

05:55.766 --> 05:58.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and then get some type
of DNA readout on this.

05:58.700 --> 06:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, this all came to
light, of course, after
the death of bin Laden, and
it very much jeopardized

06:05.700 --> 06:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not only the doctors that were
involved, but it basically
turned much of that community

06:11.733 --> 06:14.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in Pakistan against
polio vaccinations.

06:14.100 --> 06:18.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it became -- actually,
it was very counterproductive
for public health
reasons in that country.

06:18.166 --> 06:20.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the CIA has said
it won't do that again.

06:20.266 --> 06:24.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Daryl
Grisgraber, what do you
-- what is your sense
of what revelations

06:24.233 --> 06:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like this could do for the
effort in Yemen right now?

06:26.733 --> 06:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DARYL GRISGRABER: Well, there
are very few aid groups,
relatively speaking, operating

06:30.433 --> 06:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Yemen as it is because
of the security situation.

06:33.633 --> 06:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are many U.N. agencies
and INGOs, international
non-governmental
organizations, that had to

06:39.366 --> 06:41.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
withdraw their staff.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so compared to the need
in Yemen, there are really
very few groups addressing it.

06:44.666 --> 06:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if this breaks trust or
puts humanitarian under fire in
some way, it will be completely

06:49.633 --> 06:52.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
comprehensible that
organizations pull their
staffs out of there.

06:52.933 --> 06:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that means even less
help for -- what are we
talking at, at this point?

06:56.433 --> 06:59.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Potentially, 17 million
people might begin starving
to death in a few weeks.

06:59.666 --> 07:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Daryl Grisgraber, Eric Schmitt,
thank you both very much.

07:02.566 --> 07:03.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DARYL GRISGRABER: Thank you.

07:03.566 --> 07:03.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ERIC SCHMITT: Thank you.
