AS A LARGELY SYMBOLIC TRIP BUT

CUBA FOREIGN POLICY THAT IS

03:26.067 --> 03:26.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NAIVE AND DANGEROUS.

03:26.867 --> 03:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> DANGER DEFINITELY NOT, CUBA

03:28.700 --> 03:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS NOT A NATIONAL SECURITY

CUBA AND A GOVERNMENT THAT

03:37.367 --> 03:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY DOES NOT ABIDE BY BASIC

03:39.633 --> 03:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS SO A LOT

03:40.700 --> 03:42.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

POLITICAL CHANGE THAT, YOU KNOW,

04:03.000 --> 04:04.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS MORE IMPORTANT TAN WHETHER

RIGHTS?

04:11.633 --> 04:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:12.533 --> 04:13.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

COUNTRIES, CUBA HAS NOT BUDGED

04:26.633 --> 04:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON HUMAN RIGHTS.

04:27.200 --> 04:30.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

WELL.

04:44.333 --> 04:45.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT HE

04:45.467 --> 04:47.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL DO IS ENGAGE IN A PUBLIC

04:47.467 --> 04:49.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPEECH THAT WILL BE BROADCAST

04:49.700 --> 04:51.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

CERTAIN PARTS FORCE ISLAND, BUT

05:58.967 --> 06:00.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH PEOPLE ARE

06:00.167 --> 06:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STILL DETERMINED TO COME HERE.

06:01.933 --> 06:04.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOST EXTRAORDINARY, ACTUALLY

06:04.867 --> 06:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TODAY, WE ARE ABOUT 500

06:07.200 --> 06:08.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAKISTANIS, FOR EXAMPLE, WHO

06:08.867 --> 06:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REGISTERED IN A CAMP JUST

06:09.733 --> 06:11.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUTSIDE OF THE MAIN TOWN.

06:11.867 --> 06:14.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

06:19.500 --> 06:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TO BE DEPORT SOD THEY HAVE COME

06:23.200 --> 06:25.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AN EXTREMELY LONG WAY AND ALL

06:25.267 --> 06:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXTREMELY WORRIED.

06:25.933 --> 06:27.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I TALKED TO ONE A PAKISTANI

06:27.867 --> 06:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN WHO HAS BEEN HERE A LITTLE

06:29.400 --> 06:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONGER THAN THEM, ONE DAY, AND

06:31.533 --> 06:33.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE SAID THAT SHE A CHRISTIAN,

06:33.967 --> 06:36.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IF GREECE SENDS HIM BACK, HE

06:36.867 --> 06:39.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAYS HE WILL COMMIT SUICIDE HERE

06:39.100 --> 06:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THE PROSPECT OF GOING

06:40.400 --> 06:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BACK TO PAKISTAN IS TOO AWFUL TO

06:42.333 --> 06:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSIDER.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ADMINISTRATIVE CHALLENGES THE

06:45.067 --> 06:45.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIRST DAY.

06:45.667 --> 06:46.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

EMPTY THE ISLAND OF PEOPLE THAT

06:51.000 --> 06:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE HERE ALREADY, AND WE HAVE

06:53.233 --> 06:55.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEN SEVERAL FERRIS COMING INTO

06:55.867 --> 06:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LESBOS TO TAKE PEOPLE AWAY TO

06:57.300 --> 07:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VARIOUS PARTS OF GREECE, TO AN

07:01.633 --> 07:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AWFUL PORT JUST OUTSIDE OF

07:04.433 --> 07:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATHENS AND ANOTHER PLACE IS

07:06.133 --> 07:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KABBALAH, AND THIS IS WHEREAS

07:08.333 --> 07:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASYLUM CLAIMS WILL BE ASSESSED.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE

07:11.400 --> 07:12.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THAT WHAT THEY WANT TO BE

07:12.500 --> 07:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABLE TO DO IS TO GET THEM AWAY

07:15.433 --> 07:16.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM -- INTO VARIOUS PLACES

07:16.867 --> 07:18.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AROUND GREECE SO THEY CAN

07:18.267 --> 07:19.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISPERSE THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE

07:19.867 --> 07:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCERNED THAT THERE IS GOING TO

07:21.033 --> 07:23.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE SOME REVOLT AMONGST THESE

07:23.000 --> 07:24.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY WON'T WANT

07:24.100 --> 07:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO GO BACK AND WE CAN SEE THE

07:26.133 --> 07:26.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PREPARATIONS OF THE AUTHORITIES

07:26.867 --> 07:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE MAKING.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY HAVE BROUGHT IN RIOT POLICE

07:29.033 --> 07:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR EXAMPLE TO CAMPS TO MAKE

07:31.033 --> 07:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SURE THAT PEOPLE DO REGISTER,

07:33.933 --> 07:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND, RELUCTANTLY BECAUSE THEY

07:35.733 --> 07:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
END UP GETTING SENT BACK.

07:37.333 --> 07:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

HALF DEAD SO TO SEND THEM BACK

07:58.900 --> 08:00.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS ABSOLUTELY CRUEL BUT OF

08:00.000 --> 08:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COURSE, THERE IS A DESIRE THAT

08:02.200 --> 08:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS WHOLE WAVE OF PEOPLE COMING
