BRUTAL ISIS ATTACKS OVERSEAS.

OBAMA ADMINISTRATION’S CLAIMS

00:48.348 --> 00:49.816
THAT IT WAS BEHIND THE CYBER

00:49.816 --> 00:52.052
ATTACK ON SONY "SLANDER" AND

00:52.052 --> 00:53.787
THREATENED TO RETALIATE UNLESS

00:53.787 --> 00:55.522
THE UNITED STATES AGREES TO

00:55.522 --> 00:57.257
CONDUCT A JOINT INVESTIGATION

00:57.257 --> 00:58.292
ABOUT THE MATTER.

00:59.927 --> 01:01.395
STATEMENT READ ON STATE-

01:01.395 --> 01:02.429

AMERICAN OFFICIALS SAY THE

01:03.430 --> 01:04.564
ATTACK WAS SIMILAR TO OTHERS

01:04.564 --> 01:05.666
CARRIED OUT BY THE NORTH

01:05.666 --> 01:06.700
KOREANS.

01:06.700 --> 01:07.701
CHINESE AUTHORITIES HAVE

01:07.701 --> 01:09.603
DETAINED A 74-YEAR-OLD AMERICAN

01:09.603 --> 01:11.538
MISSIONARY, PETER HAHN.

01:11.538 --> 01:12.906
THE INCIDENT OCCURRED YESTERDAY

01:12.906 --> 01:14.675
NEAR CHINA’S BORDER WITH NORTH

01:14.675 --> 01:15.342
KOREA.

01:15.342 --> 01:17.144
REUTERS TODAY QUOTED SOURCES AS

01:17.144 --> 01:18.879

01:18.879 --> 01:20.447
MISSIONARIES HAVE BEEN FORCED

01:20.447 --> 01:22.983

01:28.221 --> 01:29.756
THE FOUR, ALL FROM AFGHANISTAN,

01:29.756 --> 01:31.892
WERE RETURNED HOME AFTER BEING

01:31.892 --> 01:33.527
RELEASED LATE YESTERDAY AT THE

01:33.527 --> 01:35.028
REQUEST OF THE NEW AFGHAN

01:35.028 --> 01:36.763
PRESIDENT, ASHRAF GHANI.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.966
THE U.S. HAS FREED 23 PRISONERS

FROM GUANTANAMO THIS YEAR.

01:40.467 --> 01:43.603

01:43.603 --> 01:44.938
NEW HOSTILITIES BETWEEN ISRAEL

01:44.938 --> 01:45.906
AND HAMAS.

01:45.906 --> 01:47.808
A ROCKET FIRED FROM GAZA LANDED

01:47.808 --> 01:49.376
IN ISRAEL YESTERDAY, AND ISRAEL

01:49.376 --> 01:50.711
RESPONDED BY BOMBING WHAT IT

01:50.711 --> 01:53.013
CALLED A "TERROR SITE" IN GAZA.

01:53.013 --> 01:54.514
IT WAS THE FIRST ISRAELI AIR

01:54.514 --> 01:55.749
STRIKE IN GAZA SINCE A TRUCE

01:55.749 --> 01:58.085
WENT INTO EFFECT IN AUGUST.

01:58.085 --> 01:59.019
BACK IN THIS COUNTRY, THE

01:59.019 --> 02:00.921
NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD

02:00.921 --> 02:02.823
HAS FILED FORMAL COMPLAINTS

02:02.823 --> 02:04.558
AGAINST McDONALD’S AND SOME OF

02:04.558 --> 02:05.892
ITS FRANCHISE OWNERS.

02:05.892 --> 02:07.094
THE GOVERNMENT ALLEGES THEY

02:07.094 --> 02:09.129
FIRED OR INTIMIDATED EMPLOYEES

02:09.129 --> 02:11.031
FOR TAKING PART IN UNION

02:11.031 --> 02:13.133
ORGANIZING AND IN PROTESTS

02:13.133 --> 02:15.068
DEMANDING HIGHER WAGES.

02:15.068 --> 02:15.836
THE COMPLAINTS WILL BE

02:15.836 --> 02:17.170
CONSIDERED BY ADMINISTRATIVE LAW

02:17.170 --> 02:18.805
JUDGES BEGINNING IN MARCH.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.540
ANOTHER MAJOR SECURITY BREACH,

02:20.540 --> 02:22.209
THIS TIME AT STAPLES.

02:22.209 --> 02:23.744
THE OFFICE SUPPLY CHAIN SAYS

02:23.744 --> 02:25.012
HACKERS APPARENTLY STOLE THE

02:25.012 --> 02:27.014
FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF 1.2

02:27.014 --> 02:28.849
MILLION OF ITS CUSTOMERS

02:28.849 --> 02:30.917
THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER AND FALL.

02:30.917 --> 02:32.552
THEY GAINED ACCESS TO SHOPPERS’

02:32.552 --> 02:34.721
NAMES, CREDIT CARD NUMBERS, CARD

02:34.721 --> 02:36.390
EXPIRATION DATES AND

02:36.390 --> 02:37.891
VERIFICATION CODES.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.593
IN MILWAUKEE, THERE WERE DOZENS

02:39.593 --> 02:41.361
OF ARRESTS LAST NIGHT AFTER

02:41.361 --> 02:43.230
PROTESTERS BLOCKED TRAFFIC ON A

02:43.230 --> 02:45.165
MAJOR HIGHWAY DURING RUSH HOUR.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.166
THE DEMONSTRATORS WERE

02:46.166 --> 02:47.801
PROTESTING THE KILLING OF AN

02:47.801 --> 02:49.336
UNARMED BLACK MAN BY A WHITE

02:49.336 --> 02:50.937
POLICE OFFICER EARLIER THIS

02:50.937 --> 02:51.638
YEAR.

02:51.638 --> 02:53.006
THE OFFICER HAS NOT BEEN

02:53.006 --> 02:53.907
CHARGED.

02:53.907 --> 02:55.842
THE DEAD MAN, 31-YEAR-OLD DONTRE

02:55.842 --> 02:57.044
HAMILTON, HAD A HISTORY OF

02:57.044 --> 02:58.011
MENTAL PROBLEMS.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.747
HE WAS SHOT 14 TIMES.

03:00.747 --> 03:02.349
AND AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION

03:02.349 --> 03:03.984
REVEALED THAT THE F.B.I.

03:03.984 --> 03:06.620
ROUTINELY MISHANDLES, MISLABELS

03:06.620 --> 03:08.388
OR LOSES EVIDENCE.

03:08.388 --> 03:09.256
ACCORDING TO THE "NEW YORK

03:09.256 --> 03:10.657
TIMES," INVESTIGATORS EXAMINED

03:10.657 --> 03:12.659
MORE THAN 41,000 PIECES OF

03:12.659 --> 03:14.394
EVIDENCE AT F.B.I. OFFICES

03:14.394 --> 03:16.296
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND FOUND

03:16.296 --> 03:17.798
PROBLEMS WITH NEARLY HALF OF

03:17.798 --> 03:18.632
THEM.

03:18.632 --> 03:19.833
THE F.B.I. IS NOW ALERTING

03:19.833 --> 03:21.001
PROSECUTORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY

03:21.001 --> 03:23.003
THAT THESE ERRORS MAY NEED TO BE

03:23.003 --> 03:24.671
DISCLOSED TO SOME DEFENDANTS,

03:24.671 --> 03:26.640
POTENTIALLY UNDERMINING CRIMINAL

03:26.640 --> 03:27.674
CASES.

03:35.415 --> 03:36.583
>> Sreenivasan: IN RECENT DAYS,

03:36.583 --> 03:38.318
PRO-WESTERN KURDISH FIGHTERS,

03:38.318 --> 03:40.053
BACKED BY AMERICAN AIR POWER,

03:40.053 --> 03:41.788
HAVE FORCED ISIS FIGHTERS IN

03:41.788 --> 03:43.857
NORTHERN IRAQ TO RETREAT FROM

03:43.857 --> 03:45.325
TERRITORY THEY SEIZED LAST

03:45.325 --> 03:46.026
SUMMER.

03:46.026 --> 03:46.993
FOR MORE ABOUT THIS, WE ARE

03:46.993 --> 03:48.261
JOINED NOW BY ANTHONY CORDESMAN

03:48.261 --> 03:49.429
OF THE CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND

03:49.429 --> 03:50.430
INTERNATIONAL STUDIES IN

03:50.430 --> 03:51.264
WASHINGTON.

03:51.264 --> 03:52.265
CORDESMAN PREVIOUSLY SERVED IN

03:52.265 --> 03:53.467
THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND WAS THE

03:53.467 --> 03:54.367
DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE

03:54.367 --> 03:55.802
ASSESSMENT IN THE OFFICE OF THE

03:55.802 --> 03:56.703
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE.

03:56.703 --> 03:58.338
SO, WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST

03:58.338 --> 04:00.040
FEW DAYS?

04:00.040 --> 04:01.541
>> WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT A

04:01.541 --> 04:05.078
COMBINATION OF SYRIAN AND IRAQI

04:05.078 --> 04:07.414
KURDISH FORCES, BACKED BY U.S.

04:07.414 --> 04:10.183
AND OTHER AIRPOWER, OPENED UP A

04:10.183 --> 04:13.653
LINE WHERE YAZDIS-- THESE ARE A

04:13.653 --> 04:15.122
MINORITY GROUP WHO HAVE BEEN

04:15.122 --> 04:17.958
STRANDED ON A MOUNTAIN RANGE FOR

04:17.958 --> 04:21.661
MONTHS-- COULD ACTUALLY MOVE OUT

04:21.661 --> 04:22.762
ALONG THE GROUND.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.831
NOW, THIS WAS IMPORTANT NOT ONLY

04:24.831 --> 04:26.766
BECAUSE THE YAZDIS FOR THE FIRST

04:26.766 --> 04:28.735
TIME WERE GIVEN A SECURE GROUND

04:28.735 --> 04:31.171
ROUTE TO ESCAPE, BUT THERE ARE

04:31.171 --> 04:33.573
ESTIMATES UP TO 8,000 KURDISH

04:33.573 --> 04:35.208
TROOPS WERE INVOLVED, THAT THEY

04:35.208 --> 04:36.743
WERE ABLE TO MAKE EFFECTIVE USE

04:36.743 --> 04:39.279
OF AIR SUPPORT, THAT THIS IS THE

04:39.279 --> 04:43.083
LARGEST OPERATION SO FAR AS AN

04:43.083 --> 04:45.218
OFFENSIVE GROUND-AIR OPERATION

04:45.218 --> 04:46.920
AGAINST THE ISLAMIC STATE.

04:46.920 --> 04:47.821
>> Sreenivasan: SO

04:47.821 --> 04:48.655
STRATEGICALLY IT’S IMPORTANT

04:48.655 --> 04:50.357
BECAUSE THEY ARE ABLE TO

04:50.357 --> 04:53.894
MAINTAIN CONTROL OF A REGION?

04:53.894 --> 04:55.462
>> WELL, IT’S IMPORTANT BECAUSE

04:55.462 --> 04:57.430
THEY WERE ABLE TO OPERATE A

04:57.430 --> 04:58.999
SIGNIFICANT GROUND FORCE WITH

04:58.999 --> 05:00.400
AIR SUPPORT.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.035
WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT AGAIN

05:02.035 --> 05:03.336
AND AGAIN, WE’VE BEEN TOLD IT’S

05:03.336 --> 05:05.705
GOING TO TAKE TWO TO THREE YEARS

05:05.705 --> 05:06.673
TO CREATE AN EFFECTIVE

05:06.673 --> 05:09.709
COMBINATION OF KURDISH, IRAQI,

05:09.709 --> 05:12.012
AND SUNNI IRAQI FORCES THAT

05:12.012 --> 05:13.880
COULD ACTUALLY LIBERATE THE

05:13.880 --> 05:15.715
PARTS OF IRAQ OCCUPIED BY THE

05:15.715 --> 05:17.517
ISLAMIC STATE.

05:17.517 --> 05:20.220
THIS IS NOT A DECISIVE VICTORY.

05:20.220 --> 05:21.688
THE ISLAMIC STATE IS STILL

05:21.688 --> 05:23.924
MAKING SOME GAINS IN THE SOUTH.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.026
IT HASN’T AFFECTED THE SITUATION

05:26.026 --> 05:27.294
IN SYRIA.

05:27.294 --> 05:29.829
THERE STILL HAS BEEN NO REALLY

05:29.829 --> 05:33.400
EFFECTIVE OPERATION BY THE IRAQI

05:33.400 --> 05:35.001
GROUND TROOPS, EXCEPT IN A

05:35.001 --> 05:37.204
REFINERY AREA IN BEIJI.

05:37.204 --> 05:40.106
THIS IS VERY EARLY DAYS IN A

05:40.106 --> 05:42.442
VERY LONG BUT LOW-LEVEL

05:42.442 --> 05:43.243
STRUGGLE.

05:43.243 --> 05:44.144
>> Sreenivasan: SPEAKING OF

05:44.144 --> 05:45.011
IRAQI GROUND TROOPS, THERE

05:45.011 --> 05:46.713
HAVE BEEN REPORTS THAT THERE

05:46.713 --> 05:48.248
HAVE BEEN ALMOST MASS DESERTIONS

05:48.248 --> 05:49.849
IN SOME CORNERS FROM SHIITE

05:49.849 --> 05:52.052
FORCES THAT SIGNED UP.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.087
THEY WERE CRUCIAL IN ORDER TO

05:54.087 --> 05:56.156
TAKE BACK CERTAIN GAINS ISIS HAS

05:56.156 --> 05:59.159
MADE, BUT IS IRAQ SLIPPING AGAIN

05:59.159 --> 06:01.595
FROM MAINTAINING THAT MORALE AND

06:01.595 --> 06:03.063
MAINTAINING THAT TROOP FORCE

06:03.063 --> 06:04.831
THAT CAN HOLD OFF ISIS?

06:04.831 --> 06:06.466
>> WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THERE

06:06.466 --> 06:07.934
ARE AN AWFUL LOT OF REPORTS

06:07.934 --> 06:10.103
HERE, AND SOME OF THEM ARE MORE

06:10.103 --> 06:11.304
ACCURATE THAN OTHERS.

06:11.304 --> 06:12.305
THERE WERE A LOT OF SHIITE

06:12.305 --> 06:13.506
MILITIAS INVOLVED.

06:13.506 --> 06:14.874
THESE ARE NOT FORCES THAT CAN

06:14.874 --> 06:16.676
REALLY STAY ON THE GROUND.

06:16.676 --> 06:18.311
THEY REALLY HAD ONLY LIMITED

06:18.311 --> 06:20.814
CAPABILITY TO PUSH ISLAMIC

06:20.814 --> 06:21.781
FORCES OUT.

06:21.781 --> 06:23.617
THEY WERE HELPFUL IN DEFENSE.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.952
THE CORE IS THE IRAQI ARMY,

06:25.952 --> 06:28.154
FRANKLY, COLLAPSED UNDER THE

06:28.154 --> 06:30.023
PREVIOUS PRIME MINISTER, A

06:30.023 --> 06:32.592
COMBINATION OF CORRUPTION, BAD

06:32.592 --> 06:34.160
LEADERSHIP.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.662
ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT COULD GO

06:35.662 --> 06:37.030
WRONG DID.

06:37.030 --> 06:39.332
WE ARE NOW TRYING TO SALVAGE

06:39.332 --> 06:41.601
SOME NINE BRIGADES OUT OF A

06:41.601 --> 06:44.170
FORCE THAT ONCE HAD 46 BRIGADES.

06:44.170 --> 06:45.005
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT, SO

06:45.005 --> 06:45.972
WHAT’S HAPPENING IN THE MOSUL

06:45.972 --> 06:47.107
AREA NOW?

06:47.107 --> 06:48.341
>> WELL, THE FACT IS IT REMAINS

06:48.341 --> 06:50.010
UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE ISLAMIC

06:50.010 --> 06:51.011
STATE.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.747
THE AIR CAMPAIGN, EFFORTS TO

06:53.747 --> 06:56.916
SHUT OFF THE ILLEGAL EXPORT OF

06:56.916 --> 06:58.385
PETROLEUM-- ALL OF THESE HAVE

06:58.385 --> 07:00.920
WEAKENED THE ISLAMIC STATE.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.555
THERE IS REALLY A PROBLEM WITH

07:02.555 --> 07:03.223
POWER.

07:03.223 --> 07:04.524
ALMOST ALL OF IT HAS TO COME

07:04.524 --> 07:06.626
FROM LOCAL GENERATORS.

07:06.626 --> 07:08.428
THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH WATER.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.263
THERE ARE NO REAL JOBS IN THE

07:10.263 --> 07:12.265
AREA, AND, ODDLY ENOUGH, IT’S

07:12.265 --> 07:14.668
THE IRAQI CENTRAL GOVERNMENT

07:14.668 --> 07:16.836
THAT IS PAYING FOR THE SCHOOLS

07:16.836 --> 07:18.371
THAT THE ISLAMIC STATE NOW

07:18.371 --> 07:19.773
SUPERVISES.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.841
SO YOU HAVE SOME ELEMENTS OF A

07:21.841 --> 07:24.344
STATE FROM THE ISLAMIC STATE BUT

07:24.344 --> 07:26.346
THE SITUATION IN MOSUL AND THE

07:26.346 --> 07:28.648
AREAS IT CONTROLS SEEMS TO BE

07:28.648 --> 07:30.283
STEADILY DETERIORATING.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.184
>> Sreenivasan: ANTHONY

07:31.184 --> 07:32.319
CORDESMAN JOINING US FROM

07:32.319 --> 07:33.987
WASHINGTON, THANKS SO MUCH.

07:33.987 --> 07:35.355
>> THANK YOU.

07:42.829 --> 07:43.997
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW TO OUR

07:43.997 --> 07:45.265
SIGNATURE SEGMENT.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.100
A NEW PEW POLL SHOWS THAT

07:47.100 --> 07:48.368
AMERICANS FEEL MUCH LESS

07:48.368 --> 07:49.903
FAVORABLY TOWARD MUSLIMS THAN

07:49.903 --> 07:52.005
THEY DO TOWARDS JEWS, CATHOLICS

07:52.005 --> 07:53.740
AND EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS, AND

07:53.740 --> 07:55.241
THE U.S. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TOLD

07:55.241 --> 07:56.476
THE NEWSHOUR WEEKEND YESTERDAY

07:56.476 --> 07:58.378
THAT A "SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER"

07:58.378 --> 07:59.846
PERCENTAGE OF DISCRIMINATION

07:59.846 --> 08:01.681
CASES IT IS INVESTIGATING

08:01.681 --> 08:03.550
INVOLVE SITES WHERE MUSLIMS

08:03.550 --> 08:04.184
WORSHIP.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.318
THE NEWSHOUR’S WILLIAM BRANGHAM

08:05.318 --> 08:07.120
RECENTLY VISITED A RURAL GEORGIA

08:07.120 --> 08:09.022
TOWN THAT APPROVED THE OPENING

08:09.022 --> 08:10.957
OF A MOSQUE, BUT ONLY AFTER A

08:10.957 --> 08:13.293
LARGE PUBLIC OUTCRY AND THE

08:13.293 --> 08:14.694
THREAT OF A LAWSUIT.

08:16.262 --> 08:17.464
>> Reporter: NASSER OMER IS AN

08:17.464 --> 08:19.032
ACCOUNTANT, HUSBAND AND FATHER

08:19.032 --> 08:20.433
OF TWO GROWN KIDS.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.135
THIS INDIAN-AMERICAN IS ALSO A

08:22.135 --> 08:24.003
DEVOUT MUSLIM, AND, AS SUCH, HE

08:24.003 --> 08:25.105
TRIES TO GET TO HIS NEAREST

08:25.105 --> 08:26.606
MOSQUE AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE TO

08:26.606 --> 08:27.474
PRAY.

08:27.474 --> 08:28.308
>> FOR MUSLIM MEN, IT IS

08:28.308 --> 08:30.710
MANDATORY TO PRAY FIVE TIMES A

08:30.710 --> 08:32.312
DAY IN CONGREGATION.

08:32.312 --> 08:33.947
THAT IS THE REASON WE NEED TO GO

08:33.947 --> 08:34.881
TO THE MOSQUE.

08:34.881 --> 08:35.915
>> Reporter: OMER LIVES IN

08:35.915 --> 08:37.050
KENNESAW, GEORGIA, A RURAL

08:37.050 --> 08:38.385
COMMUNITY OF ABOUT 30,000

08:38.385 --> 08:39.386
PEOPLE.

08:39.386 --> 08:40.520
IT’S JUST OVER 25 MILES

08:40.520 --> 08:42.288
NORTHWEST OF ATLANTA, A QUIET

08:42.288 --> 08:43.656
TOWN, ONE WHERE CONFEDERATE

08:43.656 --> 08:45.425
FLAGS FLY FREELY.

08:45.425 --> 08:47.160
THERE ARE AT LEAST 40 DIFFERENT

08:47.160 --> 08:48.762
CHURCHES IN KENNESAW BUT NO

08:48.762 --> 08:50.730
MOSQUE, SO OMER-- ONE OF PERHAPS

08:50.730 --> 08:52.599
A HUNDRED MUSLIMS IN TOWN-- HAS

08:52.599 --> 08:54.067
TO DRIVE TO THE NEIGHBORING TOWN

08:54.067 --> 08:55.335
OF MARIETTA WHERE THERE ARE A

08:55.335 --> 08:56.302
COUPLE OF MOSQUES.

08:56.302 --> 08:57.670
HOW FAR IS THE NEAREST MOSQUE

08:57.670 --> 08:59.339
FOR YOU TO GO TO NOW?

08:59.339 --> 09:00.407
>> IT’S ABOUT TEN MILES FROM

09:00.407 --> 09:02.909
HERE, AND IT TAKES ABOUT 30

09:02.909 --> 09:04.644
MINUTES FROM MY HOME TO THE

09:04.644 --> 09:06.646
MOSQUE, ONE WAY.

09:06.646 --> 09:08.047
AFTER THE PRAYERS, AGAIN, 30

09:08.047 --> 09:09.516
MINUTES TO COME BACK.

09:09.516 --> 09:10.383
>> Reporter: A FEW MONTHS AGO,

09:10.383 --> 09:11.684
OMER AND A FEW OTHER MUSLIM

09:11.684 --> 09:13.052
FAMILIES DECIDED THEY’D LIKE TO

09:13.052 --> 09:14.487
OPEN THEIR OWN SMALL MOSQUE IN

09:14.487 --> 09:15.588
THEIR OWN TOWN.

09:15.588 --> 09:17.023
THEY FOUND THIS STRIP MALL WHICH

09:17.023 --> 09:18.625
HAD MULTIPLE VACANCIES, THE

09:18.625 --> 09:20.260
PRICE WAS RIGHT, AND SO THEY

09:20.260 --> 09:21.728
FILED THE PAPERWORK TO OPEN A

09:21.728 --> 09:23.396
SMALL STOREFRONT MOSQUE RIGHT

09:23.396 --> 09:24.464
HERE.

09:24.464 --> 09:25.632
IT’S SIMILAR TO WHAT THIS

09:25.632 --> 09:26.933
PENTECOSTAL CHURCH HAD DONE

09:26.933 --> 09:28.134
A FEW MONTHS BEFORE IN A

09:28.134 --> 09:29.602
DIFFERENT STRIP MALL.

09:29.602 --> 09:30.703
TO HELP THEM WITH THE PROCESS,

09:30.703 --> 09:32.338
THEY ENLISTED A LOCAL MUSLIM

09:32.338 --> 09:33.706
COMMUNITY LEADER, AMJAD

09:33.706 --> 09:34.541
TAUFIQUE.

09:34.541 --> 09:35.475
HE’D HELPED SET UP ANOTHER

09:35.475 --> 09:36.709
MOSQUE IN MARIETTA.

09:36.709 --> 09:38.278
SO, WHY DOES KENNESAW NEED A

09:38.278 --> 09:39.179
MOSQUE?

09:39.179 --> 09:41.047
>> WELL, I MEAN, MUSLIMS TRY TO

09:41.047 --> 09:42.916
MAKE IT FIVE TIMES A DAY TO THE

09:42.916 --> 09:44.651
MOSQUE, AND, IN THIS DAY AND

09:44.651 --> 09:45.685
AGE, IT’S A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO

09:45.685 --> 09:47.120
BE THERE FIVE TIMES A DAY.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.521
BUT USUALLY, IF YOU ARE CLOSE

09:48.521 --> 09:49.556
ENOUGH-- FIVE, TEN MINUTES’

09:49.556 --> 09:50.890
DRIVE-- YOU CAN GO THERE EARLY

09:50.890 --> 09:51.925
IN THE MORNING PRAYERS, IN THE

09:51.925 --> 09:53.526
EVENING PRAYERS AT LEAST.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.128
AND YOU BUILD UP THE COMMUNITY.

09:55.128 --> 09:55.995
>> Reporter: AT FIRST, THE

09:55.995 --> 09:58.298
APPLICATION PROCESS WAS ROUTINE.

09:58.298 --> 09:59.332
THE ZONING BOARD OKAYED THE

09:59.332 --> 10:01.534
IDEA, BUT, AS WORD GOT OUT ABOUT

10:01.534 --> 10:02.902
THE PROPOSED MOSQUE, SOME

10:02.902 --> 10:04.637
OPPONENTS SHOWED UP IN FORCE AT

10:04.637 --> 10:06.005
THE NEXT PLANNING COMMISSION

10:06.005 --> 10:06.940
MEETING.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.308
CRIS EATON WELSH, WHO THINKS THE

10:08.308 --> 10:09.976
MOSQUE SHOULD BE APPROVED, SITS

10:09.976 --> 10:11.711
ON THE KENNESAW CITY COUNCIL.

10:11.711 --> 10:13.913
>> FROM MY UNDERSTANDING, THERE

10:13.913 --> 10:15.148
WERE OVER 200 PEOPLE THAT SHOWED

10:15.148 --> 10:16.883
UP TO THE MEETING, AND THERE...

10:16.883 --> 10:17.717
>> Reporter: AND THAT’S UNUSUAL?

10:17.717 --> 10:18.518
>>VERYUNUSUAL.

10:18.518 --> 10:19.586
YOU MIGHT HAVE THREE PEOPLE,

10:19.586 --> 10:20.386
FIVE PEOPLE.

10:20.386 --> 10:21.221
>> Reporter: IS THAT RIGHT?

10:21.221 --> 10:22.188
NORMALLY THREE PEOPLE SHOW UP?

10:22.188 --> 10:23.156
YOU HAD 200 THIS TIME?

10:23.156 --> 10:24.691
>> 200 PEOPLE SHOW UP THIS TIME.

10:24.691 --> 10:27.861
AND IT WAS: "YOU CAN’T LET THIS

10:27.861 --> 10:29.496
IN OUR COMMUNITY, THEY’RE GOING

10:29.496 --> 10:32.165
TO PRACTICE SHARIA LAW," AND

10:32.165 --> 10:36.202
LOTS OF FEAR, AND, I BELIEVE,

10:36.202 --> 10:37.337
MISUNDERSTANDING IN THE

10:37.337 --> 10:38.304
COMMUNITY.

10:38.304 --> 10:39.339
>> Reporter: IT CERTAINLY DIDN’T

10:39.339 --> 10:40.640
HELP THAT THE DAY BEFORE THE

10:40.640 --> 10:42.008
CITY COUNCIL WAS TO HOLD THEIR

10:42.008 --> 10:43.309
NEXT MEETING TO DISCUSS THE

10:43.309 --> 10:44.978
MOSQUE, THE ISLAMIC MILITANT

10:44.978 --> 10:46.679
GROUP ISIS RELEASED ANOTHER

10:46.679 --> 10:48.047
VIDEO SHOWING THE BEHEADING OF

10:48.047 --> 10:50.283
ANOTHER AMERICAN, THIS TIME AID-

10:50.283 --> 10:51.684
WORKER AND FORMER U.S. ARMY

10:51.684 --> 10:53.486
RANGER, PETER KASSIG.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.622
WELSH SAYS THIS ONGOING VIOLENCE

10:55.622 --> 10:57.090
BY SOME MUSLIMS IN THE MIDDLE

10:57.090 --> 10:59.158
EAST MADE ANY MOVES BY A MUSLIM

10:59.158 --> 11:01.661
GROUP IN GEORGIA SEEM SUSPICIOUS

11:01.661 --> 11:03.496
TO SOME PEOPLE IN HER COMMUNITY.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.464
>> AND THEY’RE SEEING IT EVERY

11:04.464 --> 11:06.799
SINGLE NIGHT ON THE NEWS, AND...

11:06.799 --> 11:07.600
AND I THINK THAT INSTILLS...

11:07.600 --> 11:08.535
>> Reporter: SEEING ISIS AND AL

11:08.535 --> 11:09.402
QAEDA, BEHEADINGS...

11:09.402 --> 11:10.970
>> ISIS AND AL-QAEDA, UH-HUH.

11:10.970 --> 11:12.071
>> Reporter: AND SO THEY THOUGHT

11:12.071 --> 11:13.406
THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE AN

11:13.406 --> 11:14.574
OUTPOST FOR ISIS?

11:14.574 --> 11:16.009
>> YES, ABSOLUTELY.

11:16.009 --> 11:16.876
>> Reporter: OVER THE LAST

11:16.876 --> 11:17.810
COUPLE OF DAYS, WE’VE BEEN

11:17.810 --> 11:18.811
ASKING PEOPLE AROUND TOWN WHAT

11:18.811 --> 11:19.879
THEY THINK OF THE PROPOSED

11:19.879 --> 11:21.214
MOSQUE, AND THE REACTIONS HAVE

11:21.214 --> 11:23.216
BEEN SPLIT ABOUT 50/50-- HALF

11:23.216 --> 11:24.918
THE PEOPLE FOR, HALF AGAINST.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.219
THE INTERESTING THING THOUGH IS

11:26.219 --> 11:27.420
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE AGAINST THE

11:27.420 --> 11:28.888
MOSQUE WERE VERY RELUCTANT TO

11:28.888 --> 11:30.890
TALK WITH US ABOUT IT ON-CAMERA.

11:30.890 --> 11:32.058
SUPPORTERS OF THE MOSQUE,

11:32.058 --> 11:33.326
HOWEVER, WERE VERY EAGER TO

11:33.326 --> 11:34.193
TALK.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.128
>> YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE EVERY

11:35.128 --> 11:36.262
RIGHT TO WORSHIP WHERE THEY

11:36.262 --> 11:37.030
WANT.

11:37.030 --> 11:37.830
IT REALLY DOESN’T BOTHER

11:37.830 --> 11:38.631
ME.

11:38.631 --> 11:39.632
I MEAN, I HOPE IT GOES THROUGH

11:39.632 --> 11:41.167
FOR THEM AND, YOU KNOW, I HOPE

11:41.167 --> 11:42.235
IT’S SUCCESSFUL.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.469
>> I DON’T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

11:43.469 --> 11:45.939
THE MOSQUE COMING TO TOWN.

11:45.939 --> 11:46.873
I THINK THAT THIS COUNTRY’S

11:46.873 --> 11:48.775
BUILT ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, AND

11:48.775 --> 11:50.076
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD RESPECT

11:50.076 --> 11:50.843
THAT.

11:50.843 --> 11:53.079
>> I DO HAVE PREJUDICE...

11:53.079 --> 11:54.380
PREJUDICES LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE

11:54.380 --> 11:56.449
THAT’S BEEN FORMED WITH ALL THE

11:56.449 --> 11:59.018
9/11 AND EVERYTHING THAT’S BEEN

11:59.018 --> 12:00.286
GOING ON.

12:00.286 --> 12:02.855
I’M A LIVE-AND-LET-LIVE TYPE OF

12:02.855 --> 12:04.123
PERSON.

12:04.123 --> 12:07.093
AND AS LONG AS PEOPLE ARE GOOD

12:07.093 --> 12:11.931
CITIZENS-- LIKE I TRY TO BE--

12:11.931 --> 12:12.932
IT’S OKAY WITH ME.

12:12.932 --> 12:14.200
>> I DON’T WANT SHARIA LAW IN

12:14.200 --> 12:14.901
GEORGIA.

12:14.901 --> 12:15.668
>> Reporter: WE WERE ABLE TO

12:15.668 --> 12:16.936
TRACK DOWN ONE CRITIC WHO

12:16.936 --> 12:18.204
WOULD SPEAK PUBLICLY.

12:18.204 --> 12:19.572
CHAD LEGERE WORKS AT A FIRE-

12:19.572 --> 12:20.974
PROOFING COMPANY AND LIVES IN A

12:20.974 --> 12:22.642
NEIGHBORING GEORGIA TOWN.

12:22.642 --> 12:23.910
HE SAYS FROM WHAT HE’S SEEN OF

12:23.910 --> 12:26.112
GROUPS LIKE ISIS AND AL QAEDA,

12:26.112 --> 12:27.280
HE CAN’T TRUST THE INTENTIONS OF

12:27.280 --> 12:28.681
ANY MUSLIMS.

12:28.681 --> 12:30.717
DO YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

12:30.717 --> 12:31.884
BEHIND THIS MOSQUE?

12:31.884 --> 12:32.986
I MEAN, THEY SAY, "WE’VE BEEN

12:32.986 --> 12:34.187
LIVING IN THIS COMMUNITY FOR

12:34.187 --> 12:36.022
DECADES"-- SOME OF THEM, 20-30

12:36.022 --> 12:37.190
YEARS-- "WE’VE RAISED OUR

12:37.190 --> 12:38.925
FAMILIES, WE GO TO SCHOOL, AND

12:38.925 --> 12:40.126
WE’VE NEVER SHOWN A TRACE OF

12:40.126 --> 12:41.127
VIOLENCE."

12:41.127 --> 12:43.830
DOES THAT EXAMPLE NOT CONVINCE

12:43.830 --> 12:45.765
YOU THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE

12:45.765 --> 12:46.699
DIFFERENT INTENTIONS THAN YOU

12:46.699 --> 12:47.900
THINK?

12:47.900 --> 12:50.503
>> LIKE I SAID, PROVE IT.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.538
GO ON RECORD CONDEMNING ISIS.

12:52.538 --> 12:55.041
I HAVEN’T SEEN IT.

12:55.041 --> 12:55.775
AND DEFINITELY NOT ON A

12:55.775 --> 12:57.610
WIDESPREAD LEVEL.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.478
WHY ARE CHRISTIANS RUNNING

12:58.478 --> 12:59.178
AROUND SCARED?

12:59.178 --> 13:00.346
WHY DID THEY... WHY DID THEY

13:00.346 --> 13:01.514
NEED TO PUT A MOSQUE INSIDE A

13:01.514 --> 13:02.782
SHOPPING CENTER?

13:02.782 --> 13:04.484
WHAT’S THE NEXT STEP?

13:04.484 --> 13:05.618
WAL-MARTS?

13:05.618 --> 13:06.753
WE GOING TO HAVE A MOSQUE AT

13:06.753 --> 13:07.920
EVERY WAL-MART?

13:07.920 --> 13:09.055
>> WHAT THEY’VE SEEN IN THE NEWS

13:09.055 --> 13:12.158
MEDIA IS A SMALL, YOU KNOW,

13:12.158 --> 13:14.961
GROUP OF PEOPLE ACTING UPON

13:14.961 --> 13:16.362
THEMSELVES, CALLING THEMSELVES

13:16.362 --> 13:17.664
MUSLIMS AND DOING THE THINGS

13:17.664 --> 13:18.998
THAT ARE HEINOUS CRIMES.

13:18.998 --> 13:20.767
AND WE AS MUSLIMS IN AMERICA,

13:20.767 --> 13:24.237
YOU KNOW, DEFINITELY DO NOT

13:24.237 --> 13:26.072
CONDONE THOSE ACTS AT ALL.

13:26.072 --> 13:28.041
WE CONDEMN THOSE ACTS.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.709
WE ARE AGAINST THOSE AS MUCH AS

13:29.709 --> 13:30.710
ANYBODY ELSE.

13:30.710 --> 13:31.644
>> Reporter: YOU MENTIONED THAT

13:31.644 --> 13:33.646
YOU CONDEMN THESE ACTS, AND THIS

13:33.646 --> 13:34.414
IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

13:34.414 --> 13:36.516
HEARD FROM PEOPLE IS THAT THEY

13:36.516 --> 13:37.950
FEEL THAT THE AMERICAN MUSLIM

13:37.950 --> 13:39.986
COMMUNITY DOESN’T DO ENOUGH TO

13:39.986 --> 13:41.621
CONDEMN THE ACTS OF ISIS AND AL

13:41.621 --> 13:42.422
QAEDA.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.923
WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT?

13:43.923 --> 13:45.992
>> I’M REALLY, YOU KNOW, TRYING

13:45.992 --> 13:48.027
TO DO THIS FOR PAST SO MANY

13:48.027 --> 13:49.128
YEARS.

13:49.128 --> 13:51.330
IT’S JUST DON’T KNOW HOW ELSE

13:51.330 --> 13:53.032
CAN WE GO OUT AND REACH OUT TO

13:53.032 --> 13:54.267
THE COMMUNITY AND TELL THEM THAT

13:54.267 --> 13:55.968
WE’VE DONE THAT AND CONTINUE TO

13:55.968 --> 13:57.070
DO THAT.

13:57.070 --> 14:00.273
THERE ARE WEB SITES WHICH GIVES

14:00.273 --> 14:02.341
LINKS AFTER LINKS AFTER LINKS

14:02.341 --> 14:03.576
WHERE MUSLIMS, NOT ONLY IN THE

14:03.576 --> 14:05.178
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BUT ALL

14:05.178 --> 14:07.180

14:07.180 --> 14:08.014
THESE ACTS.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.649
AND WE CONTINUE TO DO THAT

14:09.649 --> 14:10.983
BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY NOT

14:10.983 --> 14:11.684
ISLAM.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.454
>> I’M A PRACTICING CATHOLIC.

14:14.454 --> 14:15.755
YOU KNOW, I DON’T UNDERSTAND

14:15.755 --> 14:17.690
THEIR RELIGION, BUT I KNOW THAT

14:17.690 --> 14:19.125
OUR FOUNDING FATHERS MEANT IT

14:19.125 --> 14:20.126
WHEN THEY PENNED THE

14:20.126 --> 14:22.228
CONSTITUTION, AND THAT MEANS

14:22.228 --> 14:23.563
THAT WHETHER I AGREE WITH IT OR

14:23.563 --> 14:24.497
NOT, THEY’VE GOT THE RIGHT TO BE

14:24.497 --> 14:25.298
THERE.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.332
>> Reporter: BUT CITY COUNCIL

14:26.332 --> 14:27.533
MEMBER WELSH SAYS THE ANTI-

14:27.533 --> 14:28.901
MUSLIM VITRIOL ONLY GOT WORSE

14:28.901 --> 14:30.737
WHEN THE CITY COUNCIL HAD TO

14:30.737 --> 14:32.839
FINALLY VOTE TO APPROVE OR DENY

14:32.839 --> 14:34.307
THE PROPOSED MOSQUE.

14:34.307 --> 14:35.808
WELSH, WHO BY DAY IS A

14:35.808 --> 14:37.543
CHIROPRACTOR, WIFE AND MOM OF

14:37.543 --> 14:39.178
TWO YOUNG GIRLS, SAYS THE DAY

14:39.178 --> 14:41.080
OF THAT VOTE WAS A SCARY ONE.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.081
>> THE MONDAY OF THE VOTE,

14:42.081 --> 14:43.483
AROUND 4:00 IN THE AFTERNOON, I

14:43.483 --> 14:45.685
WAS HERE IN MY OFFICE, AND A

14:45.685 --> 14:47.887
POLICE OFFICER CAME OVER IN THE

14:47.887 --> 14:48.921
MIDDLE OF MY PATIENT HOURS AND

14:48.921 --> 14:49.856
SAID THAT SHE NEEDED TO SPEAK TO

14:49.856 --> 14:50.990
ME.

14:50.990 --> 14:51.791
AND I WAS LIKE, "I’M REALLY

14:51.791 --> 14:52.859
BUSY."

14:52.859 --> 14:53.793
AND SHE SAID, "NO, I HAVE TO

14:53.793 --> 14:55.094
TALK TO YOU NOW."

14:55.094 --> 14:58.097
AND MY FACEBOOK INFORMATION, MY

14:58.097 --> 14:59.932
CHILDREN’S PICTURES, MY OFFICE

14:59.932 --> 15:02.101
PHONE NUMBER, MY HOME ADDRESS,

15:02.101 --> 15:03.736
MY OFFICE FACEBOOK PAGE HAD ALL

15:03.736 --> 15:08.307
BEEN RELEASED ONTO A HATE SITE.

15:08.307 --> 15:11.711
AND SENDING ME SOME VERY GRAPHIC

15:11.711 --> 15:14.080
TORTURE PICTURES OF ISIS AND

15:14.080 --> 15:14.914
SAYING, "THIS IS THE KIND OF

15:14.914 --> 15:15.815
THING THAT YOU’RE TRYING TO

15:15.815 --> 15:16.749
BRING TO OUR COMMUNITY, WHAT

15:16.749 --> 15:18.751
KIND OF PERSON ARE YOU?"

15:18.751 --> 15:19.886
AND AT THAT POINT, I GOT A

15:19.886 --> 15:20.953
LITTLE RATTLED.

15:20.953 --> 15:22.455
>> ANTI-ISLAMIC PROTESTERS

15:22.455 --> 15:24.157
DEMONSTRATED OUTSIDE KENNESAW

15:24.157 --> 15:24.924
CITY HALL.

15:24.924 --> 15:25.858
>> Reporter: THE POLICE ESCORTED

15:25.858 --> 15:26.859
WELSH OVER TO CITY HALL FOR THE

15:26.859 --> 15:27.693
VOTE.

15:27.693 --> 15:28.661
PROTESTERS HAD ALREADY BEEN

15:28.661 --> 15:30.096
GATHERING, MANY FROM OUT OF

15:30.096 --> 15:31.497
TOWN, AND THEY WERE HAPPY TO

15:31.497 --> 15:32.198
SPEAK OUT.

15:32.198 --> 15:33.166
>> TO ME, IT IS A THREAT TO MY

15:33.166 --> 15:34.534
FREEDOM, MY LIBERTIES AND

15:34.534 --> 15:36.602
EVERYTHING I OWN, INCLUDING MY

15:36.602 --> 15:38.271
KIDS’ LIVES AND MY LIFE, FOR

15:38.271 --> 15:39.172
THAT MATTER.

15:39.172 --> 15:40.673
>> THEY’RE TRAINING THEIR KIDS

15:40.673 --> 15:41.974
HOW TO DO TERRIBLE THINGS TO

15:41.974 --> 15:44.610
AMERICANS, AND WE’RE TRYING TO

15:44.610 --> 15:45.545
STOP IT.

15:45.545 --> 15:46.379
>> Reporter: THAT NIGHT, THE

15:46.379 --> 15:47.747
CITY COUNCIL VOTED DOWN THE

15:47.747 --> 15:49.682
PROPOSED MOSQUE, 4-1.

15:49.682 --> 15:51.117
WELSH WAS THE ONLY ONE VOTING

15:51.117 --> 15:51.984
IN FAVOR.

15:51.984 --> 15:53.352
THE CITY COUNCIL DIDN’T GIVE ANY

15:53.352 --> 15:54.754
REASON WHY THEY REJECTED THE

15:54.754 --> 15:56.522
MOSQUE PROPOSAL, AND NO ONE ON

15:56.522 --> 15:57.824
THE COUNCIL APART FROM WELSH

15:57.824 --> 15:59.225
WOULD TALK WITH US.

15:59.225 --> 16:00.393
THE MAYOR OF KENNESAW HAS SAID

16:00.393 --> 16:01.694
THAT THE DEBATE HAD NOTHING TO

16:01.694 --> 16:02.862
DO WITH RELIGION.

16:02.862 --> 16:04.063
INSTEAD, HE SAID IT WAS BASED ON

16:04.063 --> 16:05.965
CONCERNS ABOUT PROPER ZONING,

16:05.965 --> 16:08.301
PARKING AND TRAFFIC CONGESTION.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.569
BUT ATLANTA ATTORNEY DOUG

16:09.569 --> 16:11.003
DILLARD SAYS THOSE CAN’T BE THE

16:11.003 --> 16:12.138
SOLE REASONS.

16:12.138 --> 16:14.707
>> PARKING, TRAFFIC, HOURS OF

16:14.707 --> 16:15.975
OPERATION, ALL THAT KIND OF

16:15.975 --> 16:18.010
THING CAN BE DEALT WITH,

16:18.010 --> 16:19.846
BUT THEY CANNOT BE, IN AND OF

16:19.846 --> 16:21.247
THEMSELVES, A REASON TO DENY THE

16:21.247 --> 16:22.281
APPLICATION.

16:22.281 --> 16:23.049
>> Reporter: DILLARD IS BUILDING

16:23.049 --> 16:24.617
A LAWSUIT AGAINST KENNESAW ON

16:24.617 --> 16:26.452
BEHALF OF THE MOSQUE GROUP.

16:26.452 --> 16:28.187
HE REPRESENTED TWO OTHER MOSQUES

16:28.187 --> 16:29.589
IN TWO OTHER GEORGIA TOWNS IN

16:29.589 --> 16:31.023
RECENT YEARS WHO’D BEEN DENIED

16:31.023 --> 16:33.292
PERMITS TO BUILD OR EXPAND, AND

16:33.292 --> 16:34.660
BOTH TIMES HE’D HELPED THE

16:34.660 --> 16:36.262
MOSQUES MOVE FORWARD.

16:36.262 --> 16:38.164
DILLARD SAYS KENNESAW, JUST LIKE

16:38.164 --> 16:39.966
THOSE OTHER TOWNS, IS VIOLATING

16:39.966 --> 16:41.234
BOTH CONSTITUTIONAL AND

16:41.234 --> 16:42.735
FEDERAL PROTECTIONS AGAINST

16:42.735 --> 16:44.303
RELIGIOUS DISCRIMINATION.

16:44.303 --> 16:45.404
DILLARD SAYS JUST LOOK AT THAT

16:45.404 --> 16:46.672
PENTECOSTAL CHURCH THAT WAS

16:46.672 --> 16:47.707
ALLOWED IN THAT OTHER STRIP

16:47.707 --> 16:48.908
MALL.

16:48.908 --> 16:49.976
HE SAYS KENNESAW CAN’T

16:49.976 --> 16:51.277
GREENLIGHT A CHRISTIAN CHURCH

16:51.277 --> 16:52.545
AND THEN TURN AROUND AND DENY

16:52.545 --> 16:53.846
THE MUSLIM MOSQUE.

16:53.846 --> 16:54.747
>> I THINK THE REASON FOR THE

16:54.747 --> 16:55.982
OPPOSITION IS THAT THIS IS A

16:55.982 --> 16:56.716
GROUP OF MUSLIMS.

16:56.716 --> 16:57.617
THEY DON’T WANT THEM TO WORSHIP

16:57.617 --> 16:59.518
IN KENNESAW, PERIOD.

16:59.518 --> 17:00.453
THEY DON’T CARE WHERE YOU PUT

17:00.453 --> 17:01.254
THEM.

17:01.254 --> 17:02.255
>> Reporter: BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY

17:02.255 --> 17:03.189
EVIDENCE THAT THAT’S THE CASE?

17:03.189 --> 17:04.557
>> ONLY THROUGH THEIR ACTIONS

17:04.557 --> 17:05.725
HAVING APPROVED CHRISTIAN AND

17:05.725 --> 17:06.926
OPPOSING THE MUSLIMS, AND IF YOU

17:06.926 --> 17:09.095
LOOK AT THE OPPOSITION--

17:09.095 --> 17:12.698
"TERRORISTS GO HOME"-- IT’S

17:12.698 --> 17:14.767
PRETTY EVIDENT THAT THE

17:14.767 --> 17:19.205
OPPOSITION IS UNINFORMED AND IS

17:19.205 --> 17:21.340
PUTTING FORTH AN ARGUMENT THAT’S

17:21.340 --> 17:22.608
NOT LAWFUL.

17:22.608 --> 17:23.476
>> Reporter: ON TOP OF DILLARD’S

17:23.476 --> 17:25.144
PROPOSED LAWSUIT, THE U.S.

17:25.144 --> 17:26.245
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TOLD THE

17:26.245 --> 17:27.813
NEWSHOUR IT WAS ALSO LOOKING

17:27.813 --> 17:30.016
INTO THE SITUATION IN KENNESAW.

17:30.016 --> 17:33.085
GIVEN THE IMMENSE BLOWBACK AND

17:33.085 --> 17:35.721
THAT THE MOSQUE WAS VOTED DOWN,

17:35.721 --> 17:37.456
DO YOU WISH YOU HAD NOT STEPPED

17:37.456 --> 17:39.158
OUT AND PUBLICLY DECLARED

17:39.158 --> 17:41.327
YOURSELF IN FAVOR?

17:41.327 --> 17:43.095
>> I DON’T LIKE THE PUBLICITY, I

17:43.095 --> 17:44.297
DON’T LIKE THE SPOTLIGHT, I

17:44.297 --> 17:47.033
DON’T LIKE ANY OF THAT.

17:47.033 --> 17:48.100
I STILL THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT

17:48.100 --> 17:52.705
THING TO DO, FOR ME.

17:52.705 --> 17:53.873
AND I WOULD STILL DO IT AGAIN.

17:53.873 --> 17:55.074
>> Reporter: FACING A POSSIBLE

17:55.074 --> 17:56.709
LAWSUIT AND A POSSIBLE FEDERAL

17:56.709 --> 17:58.511
INVESTIGATION, THE KENNESAW CITY

17:58.511 --> 17:59.812
COUNCIL LAST WEEK MADE A

17:59.812 --> 18:01.614
DRAMATIC TURNAROUND.

18:01.614 --> 18:02.715
THE FOUR MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL

18:02.715 --> 18:04.350
WHO’D VOTED NO ASKED THAT THEIR

18:04.350 --> 18:05.885
VOTES BE WITHDRAWN AND CHANGED

18:05.885 --> 18:07.586
TO YES VOTES.

18:07.586 --> 18:08.754
THAT MADE FOR A UNANIMOUS

18:08.754 --> 18:10.856
APPROVAL OF THE MOSQUE’S PERMIT.

18:10.856 --> 18:12.425
IF NOTHING CHANGES, SUPPORTERS

18:12.425 --> 18:13.659
OF THE MOSQUE SAY THEY’LL DROP

18:13.659 --> 18:15.561
THEIR LAWSUIT AND HOPEFULLY SOON

18:15.561 --> 18:17.997
BEGIN WORK PREPARING THE SITE.

18:25.237 --> 18:26.038
>> Sreenivasan: YOU PROBABLY

18:26.038 --> 18:27.006
HEARD THAT DURING HIS NEWS

18:27.006 --> 18:28.574
CONFERENCE YESTERDAY, PRESIDENT

18:28.574 --> 18:29.542
OBAMA TOOK THE APPARENTLY

18:29.542 --> 18:31.177
UNPRECEDENTED STEP OF ONLY

18:31.177 --> 18:32.411
TAKING QUESTIONS FROM FEMALE

18:32.411 --> 18:33.112
REPORTERS.

18:33.112 --> 18:33.946
>> CARRIE BUDOFF.

18:33.946 --> 18:34.814
CHERYL BOLEN.

18:34.814 --> 18:35.748
JULIE PACE.

18:35.748 --> 18:36.782
LESLIE CLARK.

18:36.782 --> 18:37.516
ROBERTA RAMPTON.

18:37.516 --> 18:38.417
>> Sreenivasan: IT MIGHT BE A

18:38.417 --> 18:39.719
VERY SMALL EXAMPLE OF HOW THE

18:39.719 --> 18:41.120
PRESIDENT, OFTEN CRITICIZED FOR

18:41.120 --> 18:42.955
HIS CAUTION, IS NOW DOING THINGS

18:42.955 --> 18:44.724
HIS OWN WAY AS HE BEGINS HIS

18:44.724 --> 18:46.892
LAST TWO YEARS IN OFFICE.

18:46.892 --> 18:47.893
FOR MORE, WE ARE JOINED BY PETER

18:47.893 --> 18:49.528
BAKER, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER AT

18:49.528 --> 18:50.563
THE "NEW YORK TIMES."

18:50.563 --> 18:53.699
SO IS THIS PRESS CONFERENCE AN

18:53.699 --> 18:55.668
EXAMPLE OF THIS NEW PRESIDENT

18:55.668 --> 18:56.769
OBAMA THAT WE’RE SEEING IN THE

18:56.769 --> 18:58.170
LAST SIX WEEKS?

18:58.170 --> 18:59.438
>> YEAH, THAT’S A GOOD QUESTION.

18:59.438 --> 19:01.674
THE TRUTH IS I WAS IN THE ROOM,

19:01.674 --> 19:03.042
HAD MY QUESTION READY TO GO, AND

19:03.042 --> 19:06.012
I DIDN’T EVEN NOTICE THAT IT WAS

19:06.012 --> 19:06.779
ONLY WOMEN BEING ASKED.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.247
THE TRUTH IS, THERE ARE A LOT OF

19:08.247 --> 19:09.782
STRONG, POWERFUL, AND INCREDIBLY

19:09.782 --> 19:11.150
TALENTED WOMEN IN THE WHITE

19:11.150 --> 19:12.084
HOUSE PRESS CORPS SO IT’S HARDLY

19:12.084 --> 19:14.620
AN UNUSUAL THING TO HAVE THEM

19:14.620 --> 19:15.621
ASK QUESTIONS OF THE PRESIDENT.

19:15.621 --> 19:16.389
BUT WHAT’S INTERESTING, OF

19:16.389 --> 19:17.256
COURSE, IS THE PRESIDENT IS

19:17.256 --> 19:18.691
COMING OFF A PERIOD WHERE HE’S

19:18.691 --> 19:19.725
SUPPOSED TO BE IN LAME DUCK

19:19.725 --> 19:21.293
MODE, HAVING LOST RATHER

19:21.293 --> 19:22.395
DECISIVELY THE MIDTERM

19:22.395 --> 19:23.129
ELECTIONS.

19:23.129 --> 19:24.530
INSTEAD, HE’S CUT A CLIMATE DEAL

19:24.530 --> 19:25.197
WITH CHINA.

19:25.197 --> 19:26.632
HE’S ISSUED AN IMMIGRATION ORDER

19:26.632 --> 19:28.000
THAT’S PRETTY SWEEPING.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.402
AND THIS WEEK, OF COURSE, THE

19:29.402 --> 19:30.703
BIG DIPLOMATIC OPENING TO CUBA.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.505
SO, IF HE’S A LAME DUCK, HE

19:32.505 --> 19:34.607
CLEARLY HASN’T GOTTEN THE MEMO.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.108
HE WANTS TO SHOW HE’S NOT A LAME

19:36.108 --> 19:37.076
DUCK AND WE’LL SEE HOW FAR HE

19:37.076 --> 19:37.810
CAN TAKE IT.

19:37.810 --> 19:38.677
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ARE THE

19:38.677 --> 19:39.812
CALCULATIONS, AT LEAST FROM THE

19:39.812 --> 19:40.746
WHITE HOUSE, THAT YOU’RE HEARING

19:40.746 --> 19:42.114
THAT WENT INTO THIS?

19:42.114 --> 19:43.382
CLEARLY IT WASN’T A SURPRISE

19:43.382 --> 19:44.316
THAT HE HAD ALL THESE THINGS

19:44.316 --> 19:47.920
LINED UP, AND WAS IT DEPENDENT

19:47.920 --> 19:49.455
ON HOW THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS

19:49.455 --> 19:51.357
TURNED OUT?

19:51.357 --> 19:52.691
>> EACH OF THESE, OF COURSE, IS

19:52.691 --> 19:53.659
A DIFFERENT THING.

19:53.659 --> 19:54.994
HE HAD A TRIP TO CHINA SCHEDULED

19:54.994 --> 19:55.861
FOR AFTER THE ELECTION,

19:55.861 --> 19:57.196
REGARDLESS OF HOW THE ELECTION

19:57.196 --> 19:58.064
TURNED OUT, AND THEY’VE BEEN

19:58.064 --> 19:59.398
NEGOTIATING THE CLIMATE DEAL FOR

19:59.398 --> 20:00.232
QUITE A WHILE.

20:00.232 --> 20:01.834
THIS CUBA DEAL HAS BEEN IN THE

20:01.834 --> 20:02.968
WORKS FOR 18 MONTHS.

20:02.968 --> 20:04.203
I DON’T THINK IT’S DEPENDENT ON

20:04.203 --> 20:05.204
THE ELECTION.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.505
I DO THINK THE ELECTION, THOUGH,

20:06.505 --> 20:08.874
AT LEAST ACCORDING TO HIS AIDES,

20:08.874 --> 20:10.509
HAS GIVEN HIM A SENSE OF FEELING

20:10.509 --> 20:11.710
LIBERATED NOT JUST FROM THE

20:11.710 --> 20:13.679
CAMPAIGN BUT EVEN FROM HIS OWN

20:13.679 --> 20:14.380
DEMOCRATS.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.681
HE’S BEEN TAKING ON HIS OWN

20:15.681 --> 20:17.716
FELLOW ALLIES IN CONGRESS ON A

20:17.716 --> 20:19.085
COUPLE OF OCCASIONS SINCE THE

20:19.085 --> 20:19.485
ELECTION.

20:19.485 --> 20:21.153
HE NO LONGER FEELS WEDDED TO

20:21.153 --> 20:22.321
THEM IN A WAY THAT HE FEELS HE

20:22.321 --> 20:23.322
HAS TO WORRY ABOUT THEIR

20:23.322 --> 20:24.323
ELECTION CHANCES BECAUSE THE

20:24.323 --> 20:25.357
CAMPAIGN IS OVER.

20:25.357 --> 20:27.560
HE CAN TAKE ON REPUBLICANS WHEN

20:27.560 --> 20:29.195
IT COMES TO THING LIKE

20:29.195 --> 20:29.728
IMMIGRATION.

20:29.728 --> 20:30.696
HE CAN TAKE ON THE DEMOCRATS

HAVE BEEN WORKING ON.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.422

20:56.422 --> 20:57.823
LOST BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS AND

20:57.823 --> 21:00.359
TOOK AWAY A MESSAGE EXACTLY THE

21:00.359 --> 21:01.994

21:01.994 --> 21:03.162
THAT ELECTION THOUGHT IT WAS.

21:03.162 --> 21:04.530
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A MANDATE TO

21:04.530 --> 21:05.131
GET OUT OF IRAQ.

21:05.131 --> 21:06.432
HE WENT THE OPPOSITE WAY.

21:06.432 --> 21:07.099
HE DOUBLED DOWN.

21:07.099 --> 21:07.933
HE SENT MORE TROOPS.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.034
HE CHANGED THE STRATEGY.

21:09.034 --> 21:10.269
HE SAID WE’RE GOING TO TAKE ONE

21:10.269 --> 21:11.170
MORE SHOT AT WINNING THIS THING

21:11.170 --> 21:12.438
AND I DON’T CARE IF THERE IS A

21:12.438 --> 21:13.572
POLITICAL PRICE TO BE PAID.

21:13.572 --> 21:14.540
AND IT DID PAY OFF FOR HIM

21:14.540 --> 21:15.941
BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE WENT DOWN

21:15.941 --> 21:18.244
SUBSTANTIALLY THE NEXT YEAR AND

21:18.244 --> 21:19.445
HE WAS ABLE TO LEAVE BEHIND AN

21:19.445 --> 21:20.579
IRAQ AT THE END OF HIS TERM THAT

21:20.579 --> 21:21.480
LOOKED A WHOLE LOT BETTER THAN

21:21.480 --> 21:24.183
THE ONE HE HAD IN FRONT OF HIM

21:24.183 --> 21:25.217
AT THE END OF THAT MIDTERM.

21:25.217 --> 21:27.453
HE DID DEFY, IN EFFECT, THE

21:27.453 --> 21:28.487
RESULT OF THAT MIDTERM, AT LEAST

21:28.487 --> 21:30.656

21:30.656 --> 21:30.222
WAS THE RESULT OF THAT MIDTERM.

21:30.222 --> 21:32.324
