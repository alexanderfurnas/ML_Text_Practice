HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.
Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff are
away.

00:08.141 --> 00:12.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: As
candidates storm
Indiana ahead of tomorrow's
primary, both

00:12.246 --> 00:17.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parties' front-runners aim to
finally shake
their rivals with enough Hoosier
State delegates

00:17.618 --> 00:19.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to clinch the nomination.

00:19.419 --> 00:24.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead: It is the fifth
anniversary of
Osama bin Laden's death -- what
the raid of

00:24.057 --> 00:28.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the al-Qaida leader and
mastermind of the
9/11 attacks means for the U.S.
today.

00:28.929 --> 00:34.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Plus: how farmer and
philanthropist Howard
Buffett is improving agriculture
both here

00:34.468 --> 00:36.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and in Africa's most devastated
areas.

00:36.737 --> 00:39.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOWARD BUFFETT, Philanthropist:
Well, you
got to have a goal.

00:39.406 --> 00:41.174 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

00:41.208 --> 00:42.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD BUFFETT: But we're not
going to end
world hunger, but, you know, I
think every

00:42.542 --> 00:47.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
step we can take in that
direction is something
positive.

00:47.781 --> 00:51.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:51.084 --> 00:55.489 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:55.522 --> 01:08.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It's the eve
of the presidential
primaries in the Hoosier State;
57 delegates

01:08.302 --> 01:12.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are at stake for Republicans.
And Ted Cruz
is trying to wrestle whatever he
can away

01:13.006 --> 01:14.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from his rival Donald Trump.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang has our report.

01:16.143 --> 01:18.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: You are the problem,
politician. You
are the problem.

01:18.612 --> 01:24.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Ted Cruz went for
broke today,
trying to pull off a crucial
primary win in

01:24.151 --> 01:29.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Indiana. This afternoon, he
faced off with
backers of Republican
front-runner Donald

01:29.756 --> 01:31.525 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

01:31.558 --> 01:33.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
I think anyone that wants to be
president

01:33.293 --> 01:34.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
owes it to the people of this
state to come
in front of you and ask for your
support.

01:35.028 --> 01:38.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm running to be everyone's
president,
those who vote for me and those
who don't.

01:38.231 --> 01:39.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: We don't want you.

01:39.900 --> 01:42.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: Well, you're
entitled to your
view, sir. And I will respect
it.

01:42.803 --> 01:43.270 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:43.303 --> 01:44.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Do the math.

01:44.972 --> 01:46.106 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:46.139 --> 01:46.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: You asked Kasich to drop
out. It is your
turn.

01:46.707 --> 01:47.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ: Well...

01:47.341 --> 01:49.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Take your own words.

01:49.176 --> 01:53.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But the words drop
out don't seem
to be in Cruz's vocabulary, not
yet anyway.

01:53.180 --> 01:59.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: I am in for the
distance as
long. As we have a viable path
to victory,

01:59.119 --> 02:01.288 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I am competing to the end.

02:01.321 --> 02:06.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the reason is simple.
Listen, this isn't
about me. It isn't about Donald
Trump. It

02:06.760 --> 02:11.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
isn't about any of the
candidates. This is
about our country and our
future.

02:11.098 --> 02:16.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: An Associated Press
analysis has
Cruz trailing Trump in the race
for the nomination

02:16.203 --> 02:22.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by more than 400 delegates. Cruz
won't win
the delegates he needs to win
for a first-ballot

02:22.242 --> 02:26.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nomination, so he is trying to
keep Trump
from locking up the nomination
before the

02:26.046 --> 02:28.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
convention in Cleveland.

02:28.548 --> 02:32.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump spent the day making his
final pitch
in the Indianapolis area.

02:32.252 --> 02:36.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Honestly, if we win Indiana,
it's over. It's

02:36.890 --> 02:37.424 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
over.

02:37.457 --> 02:39.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:39.159 --> 02:41.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And if we don't, I
will win
it next week, or the week after,
or the week

02:42.029 --> 02:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after. It's fine, because they
have no path,
whereas I have a very easy path.
I mean, we

02:46.466 --> 02:48.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will win it on the first ballot.

02:48.368 --> 02:52.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Farther south, in
Evansville, Democrat
Bernie Sanders was whipping up
support, not

02:52.906 --> 02:57.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just for the Indiana primary,
but also for
his effort to keep his campaign
alive until

02:57.711 --> 02:59.713 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the convention.

02:59.746 --> 03:01.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
The way the system works is, you
have establishment

03:01.982 --> 03:09.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidates who win virtually all
of the superdelegates.
It makes it hard for insurgent
candidacies

03:09.890 --> 03:16.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like ours to win. But you know
what? We're
going to fight for every last
vote. And we're

03:16.530 --> 03:17.597 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going to...

03:17.631 --> 03:19.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:19.366 --> 03:23.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Hillary Clinton has a
commanding
lead in delegates and seemed to
be looking

03:23.503 --> 03:26.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
beyond the convention. Today,
she campaigned
in Kentucky.

03:26.440 --> 03:31.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Here in Eastern Kentucky, and
obviously West

03:31.678 --> 03:38.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Virginia, and Southeast Ohio,
Appalachia coal
has taken a huge hit. Talk about
a ripple

03:38.218 --> 03:40.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
effect. It is just decimating
communities.

03:40.887 --> 03:44.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Late today, she paid
a visit to
West Virginia.

03:44.257 --> 03:47.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

03:47.761 --> 03:51.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We will take a
deeper look
at the presidential campaign
with Politics

03:51.465 --> 03:54.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Monday right after the news
summary.

03:54.234 --> 03:58.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
U.S. said progress
is being made toward restoring a
truce in

03:58.538 --> 04:03.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syria. That came as the Syrian
military extended
its own unilateral cease-fire in
some areas,

04:03.677 --> 04:07.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
including Damascus. But violence
continues
to rage farther north in Aleppo.

04:07.380 --> 04:12.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. Secretary of State John
Kerry was in
Geneva today meeting with the
U.N.'s envoy

04:12.185 --> 04:17.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Syria. Kerry expressed
optimism, but stopped
short of detailing truce
proposals.

04:17.090 --> 04:23.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: We are
working over these next hours
intensely in

04:23.163 --> 04:33.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
order to try to restore the
cessation of hostilities
and at the same time to raise
the level of

04:33.039 --> 04:41.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
accountability that will
accompany the day-to-day
process of implementing this
cease-fire.

04:41.314 --> 04:44.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: To that end,
Kerry, who
later spoke by phone with his
counterpart

04:44.818 --> 04:50.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Moscow, said the U.S. and
Russia agreed
to station personnel around the
clock in Geneva

04:50.056 --> 04:52.626 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to better monitor a new truce.

04:52.659 --> 04:56.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An Islamic State car bomb killed
at least
18 people and wounded dozens
more in Southwestern

04:56.329 --> 05:01.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Baghdad today. Workers used
shovels and water
hoses to clear debris following
the blast.

05:01.835 --> 05:06.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many of those killed were Shiite
pilgrims
commemorating the death of a
revered eighth

05:06.139 --> 05:07.941 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
century imam.

05:07.974 --> 05:14.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Puerto Rico has defaulted on a
$422 million
bond payment that was due today.
Its officials

05:14.781 --> 05:19.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
warned, the U.S. territory's
debt crisis could
soon worsen without the help of
Congress.

05:19.586 --> 05:23.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Washington, White House
spokesman Josh
Earnest said he hopes this
creates a -- quote

05:23.089 --> 05:30.330 align:left position:0%,start line:66.67% size:100%
-- "new sense of urgency for
lawmakers" to
restore Puerto Rico's debt
restructuring authority. The
island's default

05:30.330 --> 05:33.099 align:left position:0%,start line:66.67% size:100%
-- "new sense of urgency for
lawmakers" to
restore Puerto Rico's debt
restructuring authority. The
island's default

05:53.954 --> 05:57.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will likely prompt lawsuits from
creditors,
and could foreshadow more
problems to come

05:57.891 --> 06:01.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when a much larger payment is
due July 1.

06:01.528 --> 06:05.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nearly all of Detroit's 97
public schools
were forced to close today after
teachers

06:05.265 --> 06:09.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
staged their latest sick-out.
They protested
the possibility that some of
them won't get

06:09.603 --> 06:13.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
paid through the summer if the
debt-stricken
school district doesn't receive
more funding

06:13.940 --> 06:19.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the state. Today's closure
impacted some
46,000 students.

06:19.312 --> 06:22.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cancer researchers today issued
a warning
to New England residents who get
their drinking

06:22.983 --> 06:27.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
water from private wells. A
study from the
National Institutes of Health
found a correlation

06:27.621 --> 06:33.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between bladder cancer and
arsenic levels
in Maine, New Hampshire and
Vermont wells.

06:33.460 --> 06:37.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bladder cancer incidence in the
region is
20 percent higher than the rest
of the country.

06:37.430 --> 06:42.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The risk is even greater if
wells were dug
before 1960, when arsenic-based
pesticides

06:42.936 --> 06:44.771 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were common.

06:44.804 --> 06:48.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The person behind the digital
currency Bitcoin
may have finally been
identified, after years

06:48.875 --> 06:52.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of speculation. Craig Wright, an
Australian
entrepreneur and computer
scientist, told

06:52.512 --> 06:58.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
several news agencies today he
invented the
currency back in 2009. Bitcoins
allow consumers

06:58.451 --> 07:03.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to purchase goods or services
and exchange
money anonymously without
involving banks

07:03.556 --> 07:05.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or other third parties.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In an interview with the BBC,
Wright said
he came forward with reluctance.

07:07.927 --> 07:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRAIG WRIGHT, Entrepreneur: I
didn't decide.
I had people decide this matter
for me. And

07:13.533 --> 07:19.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are making life difficult,
not for me,
but my friends, my family, my
staff. I don't

07:19.739 --> 07:24.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want money. I don't want fame. I
don't want
adoration. I just want to be
left alone.

07:24.344 --> 07:27.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But several
publications
have questioned Wright's claim.
Earlier today,

07:28.014 --> 07:31.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke to Andy Greenberg, a
senior writer
from "Wired" via Google
Hangouts. He said

07:31.751 --> 07:34.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today's revelation has raised
even more questions.

07:34.354 --> 07:41.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDY GREENBERG, "Wired": This
has only gotten
hairier as a story. It was
unclear at first

07:41.528 --> 07:45.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether this was a hoax or
whether we had
found the creator of Bitcoin.
And I think

07:46.032 --> 07:48.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have only gone further down
that rabbit
hole.

07:48.601 --> 07:53.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

On Wall Street today, stocks
bounced back
after last week's losses. The
Dow Jones industrial

07:57.744 --> 08:04.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average gained 117 points to
close at 17891.
The Nasdaq rose 42 points. And
the S&amp;P 500

08:04.951 --> 08:06.753 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
added 16.

08:06.786 --> 08:11.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first U.S. cruise liner in
nearly 40 years
docked in Cuba this morning.
Passengers waved

08:11.391 --> 08:16.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to locals as the 700-passenger
ship operated
by Carnival Cruise subsidiary
Fathom Travel

08:16.529 --> 08:21.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pulled into Havana. The arrival
follows President
Obama's restoration of ties with
Cuba in late

08:25.905 --> 08:30.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some history was made in
English soccer
today. Leicester City has won
the Barclays

08:30.577 --> 08:36.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Premier League after overcoming
5,000-to-1
odds. The Foxes finished near
the bottom of

08:36.983 --> 08:40.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the league last year, but lost
only three
times this season, and clinched
the title

08:40.754 --> 08:46.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
today, when second-place
Tottenham played
to a tie. It's Leicester City's
first championship

08:46.192 --> 08:47.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the club's 132-year history.

08:47.927 --> 08:53.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Politics
Monday, a look ahead to
Indiana's make-or-break

08:53.333 --> 08:58.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election for Ted Cruz; then, CIA
director
Leon Panetta on the fight
against al-Qaida

08:58.538 --> 09:04.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
five years after Osama bin
Laden's death;
how Warren Buffett's son is
helping Africa

09:04.411 --> 09:18.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
feed itself; and much more.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All eyes are on Indiana in the
race for the
White House.

09:21.528 --> 09:25.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We examine the heightened
significance of
the Hoosier State in 2016 with
our Politics

09:26.032 --> 09:30.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Monday team, Tamara Keith of NPR
and Amy Walter
of The Cook Political Report.

09:30.670 --> 09:34.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, one of the things that we
saw Ted Cruz
say in that earlier piece was a
viable path

09:35.008 --> 09:39.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the candidacy, right, that
he's in this
until that ends. Does that end
tomorrow night

09:39.512 --> 09:41.347 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for him?

09:41.381 --> 09:43.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Hari,
I have been arguing that it's
actually already

09:43.716 --> 09:45.618 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
over.

09:45.652 --> 09:49.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think that the race
effectively ended last
week with the primaries up and
down the Northeast

09:50.023 --> 09:55.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Corridor, and Donald Trump
putting up such
big numbers. He's ahead in the
polls right

09:55.929 --> 10:01.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now in Indiana. He's ahead in
California.
It's going to be, I think, all
but impossible

10:01.634 --> 10:05.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for him to be stopped before we
get to the
convention.

10:05.205 --> 10:09.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even then, I think he's
going to get the
1,237 votes he needs before the
convention.

10:09.809 --> 10:15.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just think the momentum is
strongly behind
him. Cruz never caught on. The
stop Trump

10:15.548 --> 10:20.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
movement, it always had an
antagonist, which
was Donald Trump, but it never
had a protagonist.

10:20.320 --> 10:24.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that was its biggest
challenge.
But there was never a challenge
to voters,

10:24.591 --> 10:27.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here's what you can support. It
was always,
here is what you can be against.

10:27.861 --> 10:31.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Voters want to vote -- support
someone. And
they also like supporting a
winner. And right

10:31.664 --> 10:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now, Donald Trump looks like a
winner.

10:33.399 --> 10:38.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, what about
those stop
Trump folks? Are they in denial?
Is this an

10:38.071 --> 10:39.405 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
inevitability?

10:39.439 --> 10:40.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: They're
still working it.

10:40.740 --> 10:42.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Right.

10:42.542 --> 10:46.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And Ted Cruz is
campaigning
extremely hard. His campaign,
between his

10:46.045 --> 10:52.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
various surrogates, now his vice
presidential
pick, Carly Fiorina, they had 10
campaign

10:52.218 --> 10:55.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stops in a single day. They are
working very
hard in Indiana.

10:55.755 --> 11:03.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it seems like, if Donald
Trump wins in
Indiana, after this disarmament
pact was announced

11:03.396 --> 11:12.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Governor John Kasich, and,
really, Ted
Cruz has had Donald Trump to
himself mostly,

11:12.372 --> 11:17.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if he can't win, Donald Trump's
going to be
able to make a very strong
argument: What

11:17.076 --> 11:19.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are you doing if you can't win
in Indiana?

11:19.145 --> 11:24.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if Donald Trump is able to
win all of
the delegates in Indiana, he'd
only need -- he

11:24.517 --> 11:29.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would be 85 percent of the way
to clinching.
That's quite a long way toward
clinching.

11:29.222 --> 11:32.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This alliance
between Kasich
and Cruz, it sort of was on, on
a Tuesday,

11:32.926 --> 11:37.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then off by a Saturday. Is
it kind of
still on? It seems that Kasich
wasn't campaigning

11:37.196 --> 11:38.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Indiana today.

11:39.032 --> 11:42.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: No, he wasn't, but
the stop Trump
movement has spent almost as
much money on

11:42.669 --> 11:47.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
television -- these are these
outside super
PACs -- in Indiana as they did
in Wisconsin,

11:47.574 --> 11:50.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where obviously Ted Cruz was
successful.

11:50.076 --> 11:54.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as I said, I think that
voters are desperately
looking for someone to vote for.
So, this

11:54.681 --> 12:00.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
idea of just voting against
Donald Trump really
not catching fire. Plus, the one
who is getting

12:00.119 --> 12:05.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the momentum beyond what you're
seeing in
the polling data is the
endorsements, Donald

12:05.491 --> 12:10.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump picking up endorsements
from royalty
in Indiana, everybody from Lou
Holtz, the

12:10.763 --> 12:14.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
former Notre Dame coach, to
Bobby Knight,
the former Indiana coach.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Sports are --
college sports
are huge.

12:17.236 --> 12:20.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Sports, big deal.
The ring, the
basketball ring, very big in
Indiana.

12:20.740 --> 12:21.274 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

12:21.307 --> 12:22.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Right.

12:22.275 --> 12:23.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, let's shift gears to the
Democratic side.

12:23.676 --> 12:25.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

12:25.612 --> 12:29.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Bernie Sanders
still fighting
it out. Is this as much of a
race now in Indiana?

12:29.115 --> 12:35.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Bernie Sanders --
in Indiana,
Bernie Sanders is
demographically favored.

12:35.188 --> 12:42.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The state looks good for him in
that way.
Polling shows him ahead --
trailing somewhat,

12:42.195 --> 12:43.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
shows Clinton ahead.

12:44.030 --> 12:48.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But if -- talking to the
campaigns, you get
the feeling that they don't
really trust the

12:48.301 --> 12:53.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
polling and that they think
Bernie could -- Bernie
Sanders could win in Indiana.

12:53.172 --> 12:58.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the challenge there, though,
is he could
wake up Wednesday morning and be
further behind

12:58.911 --> 13:05.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the chase for pledged
delegates than he
was when he started. And what I
mean is that

13:05.852 --> 13:12.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he at this point needs to win
every remaining
contest by about 25 points --
that's a lot

13:12.558 --> 13:16.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- if he wants to catch up to
Hillary Clinton
in pledged delegates.

13:16.629 --> 13:22.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why he held a press
conference yesterday
and he started pitching the idea
very publicly

13:22.835 --> 13:29.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of flipping superdelegates. He
proposed having
superdelegates support the will
of the voters

13:29.876 --> 13:35.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in their state. If that were to
happen -- we
did the calculations -- and
Sanders would

13:35.648 --> 13:40.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still be behind by about 500
delegates, combining
superdelegates and pledged
delegates.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And the argument
also doesn't
really work very well.

13:43.890 --> 13:47.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not very consistent with
the Bernie Sanders
message, which has been, I'm one
of you, I'm

13:47.427 --> 13:49.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the people, the people are
standing up.

13:49.562 --> 13:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, right now, the people have
been voting
for Hillary Clinton. He's losing
the popular

13:53.933 --> 13:57.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vote. He's only got about 41
percent of the
popular vote, compared to her,
somewhere around

13:57.537 --> 14:00.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
56 percent. The pledged delegate
count, he
is behind.

14:00.907 --> 14:05.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So to argue that the way I'm
going to win
is to get the insiders and the
establishment

14:05.545 --> 14:10.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to put me over the top, that
sort of rings
hollow for the guy who is
running to break

14:11.017 --> 14:12.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
up the establishment.

14:12.752 --> 14:15.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tamara Keith,
meanwhile,
we have seen Hillary Clinton
almost pivot

14:15.054 --> 14:16.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
toward a general election
posture.

14:16.989 --> 14:18.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: That's absolutely
happening.

14:18.791 --> 14:24.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's campaigning in Appalachia
today and
tomorrow, a driving tour of
these states.

14:24.797 --> 14:30.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what she's doing, it is a
combination.
It is -- she's definitely in
these states,

14:30.203 --> 14:34.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaigning for these states,
but she's using
messaging and talking about
issues that she

14:34.640 --> 14:37.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thinks will carry her into the
general election.

14:37.110 --> 14:43.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other thing is, she is also
fighting with
Donald Trump, and there was the
woman card

14:43.716 --> 14:48.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comment that Donald Trump made.
He's made
it repeatedly, but he also made
it on primary

14:48.755 --> 14:54.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night last Tuesday. Her campaign
announced
today that they raised $2.4
million in three

14:54.327 --> 14:58.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
days on the woman card; 40
percent of those
were new donors.

14:58.464 --> 15:02.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Wow. So, she
has got kind
of two flanks that she's
battling on.

15:02.068 --> 15:05.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes, although I
would argue she's
spending really more time
focusing on the

15:05.772 --> 15:10.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
general election, and basically
saying to
Bernie Sanders this weekend, I
hired general

15:10.042 --> 15:16.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election campaign managers in
the big swing
states. That's where my focus
is. Yes, I'm

15:16.816 --> 15:19.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still going to campaign for the
primary, but
the general election really has
started.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Amy Walter,
Tamara Keith,
thanks so much.

15:21.888 --> 15:27.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

15:27.760 --> 15:33.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Thank you.

15:33.599 --> 15:39.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Five years
ago,U.S. special
operations forces launched one
of the most

15:39.839 --> 15:46.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
daring raids in history. They
invaded a U.S.
ally to kill the most wanted man
on the planet.

15:46.112 --> 15:49.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I recorded this conversation
last week with
"NewsHour" special correspondent
Nick Schifrin,

15:49.582 --> 15:54.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who visited the scene shortly
after the battle.

15:54.987 --> 15:59.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nick Schifrin was the first
Western reporter
to arrive in Abbottabad,
Pakistan, that day,

15:59.892 --> 16:05.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and delivered exclusive,
extraordinary video,
images from inside the compound
just hours

16:05.698 --> 16:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
after bin Laden was killed.

16:07.834 --> 16:12.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the time, Nick was ABC News
correspondent
in the region. And now he's a
"NewsHour" special

16:12.905 --> 16:13.573 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
correspondent.

16:13.606 --> 16:14.740 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he joins me in the studio.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, what did we see in that
video?

16:16.475 --> 16:20.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Hari, we saw how
the world's
most wanted man lived and how he
died.

16:20.713 --> 16:25.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In terms of how he lived, we see
a bedroom,
a large bed, bigger than any bed
anywhere

16:25.918 --> 16:30.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
else in the house. We saw the
medications
he was on, very simple
medications available

16:31.023 --> 16:37.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the local pharmacy. We saw a
pantry where
there was a week's worth of food
stored up.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We saw so many signs of
children.

16:39.498 --> 16:45.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a red wagon outside in
the backyard.
There were 12 kids living there.
Half of them

16:45.171 --> 16:50.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were bin Laden's. We also saw a
satellite
dish outside. That was a one-way
communication

16:50.076 --> 16:54.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
device used to watch TV on that
dish, of course,
never used it to communicate
with the outside

16:54.747 --> 16:56.582 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
world.

16:56.616 --> 16:59.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, we saw how he
died, the pools
of blood in his bedroom and the
room of Khaled,

16:59.218 --> 17:04.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his son, and the mess that Navy
SEALs left
behind. They ransacked the room
where all

17:04.290 --> 17:08.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the computers were. And all the
files from
those computers became what
intelligence officials

17:08.961 --> 17:10.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
referred to as the Abbottabad
files.

17:10.897 --> 17:16.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Here we are
five years later.
The news is almost -- almost on
a daily basis

17:16.302 --> 17:21.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mentions ISIS. It doesn't
mention al-Qaida
so much. Is there -- explain the
shift.

17:21.774 --> 17:23.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Yes.

17:23.509 --> 17:28.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think, as one longtime
al-Qaida puts it,
al-Qaida has kind of like become
Microsoft.

17:28.681 --> 17:33.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's still got a decent share of
the market,
but it's not preeminent. It's
not really seen

17:33.386 --> 17:36.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as cutting edge. And it doesn't
really appeal
to the younger generation.

17:36.822 --> 17:41.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is because, of course
what we call
core al-Qaida, the al-Qaida
leadership as

17:41.060 --> 17:46.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was defined in 9/11 and the
years after,
has been decimated. And that
started before

17:46.332 --> 17:51.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bin Laden was killed, about two
or three years
before, probably 2009. The CIA
moved a lot

17:51.203 --> 17:56.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of assets and intelligence and
technology
into the region, and drones
started picking

17:56.108 --> 17:57.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
off these leaders.

17:57.810 --> 18:00.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What about the
al-Qaida
affiliates that have spread in
other parts

18:00.046 --> 18:03.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the world and still seem
pretty active?
I mean, are these essentially
franchise operations?

18:03.883 --> 18:05.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: That's exactly
what it is.

18:05.651 --> 18:09.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there was a reason that they
were created
even before bin Laden was
killed, because

18:09.855 --> 18:14.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
core al-Qaida was on the run. So
you had to
have these affiliates. And they
still have

18:14.560 --> 18:19.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some success. And that's really
still the
threat of al-Qaida today, the
most prominent

18:19.131 --> 18:22.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one, al-Qaida in the Arabian
Peninsula, based
in Yemen.

18:22.501 --> 18:26.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the group that has come
closest to
attacking the West. You had the
underwear

18:26.305 --> 18:30.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bomber, if you remember, that
print cartridge
bomb that didn't go off. And,
also, one of

18:30.343 --> 18:35.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the members of the team that
attacked Charlie
Hebdo in Paris probably got
training from

18:35.281 --> 18:37.049 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
al-Qaida.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what they have succeeded at
recently is
one of bin Laden's other core
tenants, not

18:40.019 --> 18:46.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only attacking the West, but
really ingratiating
the local population, again,
something ISIS

18:46.092 --> 18:47.760 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
doesn't do.

18:47.793 --> 18:52.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what AQAP has done in Yemen
recently is
worked with local tribal chiefs.
And that

18:52.498 --> 18:57.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has allowed them to actually
gain ground in
Yemen. So, right now, they are
actually doing

18:57.169 --> 18:59.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
quite well in Yemen.

18:59.038 --> 19:06.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's three more affiliates.
The most prominent
one, other than AQAP, is
al-Nusra in Syria,

19:06.278 --> 19:11.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
again, also working with the
local population,
working with other groups that
fight Assad,

19:11.484 --> 19:14.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
no longer only focused on the
West.

19:14.320 --> 19:19.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AQIM in Northwest Africa has had
some headline-grabbing
attacks recently, although not
quite clear

19:19.558 --> 19:26.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how organized they are as a
group anymore.
And, lastly, Al-Shabaab, totally
locally focused

19:26.332 --> 19:30.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the Somali government and
Kenyans who have
come into Somalia.

19:30.669 --> 19:35.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, to use a sports metaphor,
al-Qaida still
fields a team. They're still on
the field,

19:36.008 --> 19:40.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but not a lot of long passes
anymore, not
a lot of touchdowns, trying to
gain two, three

19:40.346 --> 19:45.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yards at a time. And the coach,
Zawahri, isn't
particularly well-liked by the
players, can't

19:45.418 --> 19:48.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
communicate that well. The bench
is very weak,
but still a threat.

19:48.554 --> 19:50.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Nick Schifrin,
thanks so much.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Thanks a lot,
Hari.

19:52.758 --> 19:57.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The raid on
bin Laden's
compound was watched closely by
President

19:57.530 --> 20:02.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama and his national security
advisers,
among them, Leon Panetta, who
was CIA director

20:02.968 --> 20:08.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the time. He watched the raid
unfold in
real time from the agency's
Langley headquarters.

20:08.707 --> 20:10.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he joins me now.

20:10.409 --> 20:14.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Secretary, what was that day
like for
you? It was a culmination of a
lot of work

20:14.380 --> 20:15.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that went into it for years.

20:15.614 --> 20:18.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEON PANETTA, Former U.S.
Secretary of Defense:
It was.

20:18.384 --> 20:24.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was an awful lot of work that
stretched
back 10 years, almost to 9/11.
And an awful

20:24.623 --> 20:31.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot of people deserve tremendous
credit for
that, the CIA, the intelligence
agencies,

20:31.363 --> 20:35.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those involved with the special
forces operation.

20:35.835 --> 20:43.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were just an awful lot of
people who
did various pieces of the
intelligence effort

20:43.242 --> 20:50.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the military effort that
resulted in the
raid itself. But it was -- it
was something

20:50.349 --> 20:58.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that -- as an individual
responsible for kind
of overseeing the operation from
the CIA,

20:58.090 --> 21:00.626 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it was a remarkable operation.

21:00.659 --> 21:04.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a lot of tribute goes to the
bravery and
courage of those who conducted
it.

21:04.096 --> 21:09.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Where is
al-Qaida now, meaning,
is the infrastructure, the
network that Osama

21:09.735 --> 21:12.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bin Laden exploited, does that
still exist?

21:12.271 --> 21:19.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEON PANETTA: We have done a
very good job
at decimating al-Qaida's
leadership, particularly

21:19.044 --> 21:20.846 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Pakistan.

21:20.880 --> 21:30.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, obviously, the bin
Laden operation
was kind of the primary effort
to go after

21:30.456 --> 21:36.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the spiritual leader of
al-Qaida. And so I
think, generally, a good job at
decimating

21:36.929 --> 21:38.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their leadership.

21:38.931 --> 21:45.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, al-Qaida's
probably metastasized,
as we have seen with other
terrorist operations

21:45.204 --> 21:50.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Middle East. There are
variations of
al-Qaida that are still
operating very much

21:50.509 --> 21:52.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the Middle East and North
Africa.

21:52.378 --> 21:56.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Have we
succeeded then as
a policy to degrade their
network to almost

21:56.815 --> 22:00.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
zero, or, as you mentioned, they
have sort
of sprung out into different
branch operations

22:00.753 --> 22:02.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in other parts of the world?

22:02.888 --> 22:07.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEON PANETTA: The reality is
that terrorism
remains a threat.

22:07.993 --> 22:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's metastasized into ISIS.
It's metastasized
into Boko Haram and Al-Shabaab.
And so it

22:14.633 --> 22:19.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
continues to be very much a
threat that the
United States and other
countries in the world

22:19.838 --> 22:23.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have to focus on. This is a
long-term effort.

22:23.375 --> 22:27.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have had some success, there
is no question
about it. We have gone after
their leadership.

22:27.313 --> 22:32.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have done well to prevent
another 9/11-type
attack, but there remains an
awful lot more

22:32.918 --> 22:35.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
work to be done in order to
protect this country.

22:35.521 --> 22:40.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Five years on,
have we fully
understood the complicity of
Pakistan in all

22:40.125 --> 22:42.061 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this?

22:42.094 --> 22:52.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEON PANETTA: It's -- it's been
a challenging
period to develop the
relationship with Pakistan.

22:52.204 --> 23:02.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, Pakistan was helpful
in being able
to work with us in many areas.
Certainly,

23:02.114 --> 23:06.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the intelligence area, we
worked together.
On military efforts, we worked
together. But,

23:06.418 --> 23:13.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the same time, Pakistan was
difficult because
they had a close relationship to
various terrorist

23:13.993 --> 23:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
networks, and you were never
quite sure just
exactly where their loyalties
would lie.

23:21.033 --> 23:25.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was for that reason, very
frankly,
that when we were looking at the
bin Laden

23:25.904 --> 23:30.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
operation, which we would have
preferred,
frankly, to have worked with
Pakistan. But

23:30.809 --> 23:35.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are so many questions
raised about whether
or not we could trust them that
the president

23:35.414 --> 23:37.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
decided that we should do it
alone.

23:37.249 --> 23:41.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: When you look
at the landscape
from your vantage point, it
seems like the

23:41.553 --> 23:47.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terrorists learned more from us
about how
we hunted down bin Laden, how we
went after

23:47.326 --> 23:49.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
organizations, their leadership
infrastructure.

23:49.328 --> 23:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now we're in an era where
terror groups
operate almost singularly, in
cells. And it's

23:54.199 --> 23:58.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hard to find a single person
that runs anything
that we can go after.

23:58.103 --> 24:06.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEON PANETTA: Well, you're
right, in the sense
that, just as we have learned
how to confront

24:06.812 --> 24:12.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terrorist groups and try to
track them and
go after their planning for
possible attacks

24:12.518 --> 24:15.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in this country, they have
learned as well.

24:15.087 --> 24:22.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have learned, you know, a
lot of our
technology, our process, how we
operate. And

24:22.361 --> 24:29.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the result is that they operate
much more
in a lone wolf fashion, in the
sense that,

24:29.034 --> 24:38.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, they do outreach, they
have individuals
that are well-placed, but they
minimize the

24:38.444 --> 24:42.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contacts. They minimize the
planning. And
that makes them even a greater
threat.

24:42.748 --> 24:45.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Secretary Leon
Panetta,
thanks so much for joining us.

24:45.317 --> 24:48.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LEON PANETTA: Thank you very
much.

24:48.454 --> 24:58.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

24:58.797 --> 25:02.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Katie Couric's
exclusive interview with the
refugees Pope

25:03.001 --> 25:08.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Francis brought back from
Greece. And does
Malia Obama's decision to take a
gap year

25:08.807 --> 25:11.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
before college mean the trend is
going mainstream?

25:11.577 --> 25:17.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: Africa has vast
agricultural potential,
yet, over the past half-century,
its per capita

25:17.316 --> 25:22.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
food production has declined
drastically.
In fact, it's gone from being a
net food exporter

25:22.855 --> 25:25.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to now importing much of its
food.

25:25.424 --> 25:30.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reasons are complex, but
they include
rapid population growth,
political strife

25:30.162 --> 25:31.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and weak institutions.

25:31.964 --> 25:35.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As part of our ongoing
collaboration with
"The Atlantic," we profile an
American farmer

25:35.300 --> 25:40.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and philanthropist who has made
it his mission
to reverse the trend in Africa.

25:40.606 --> 25:48.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Howard Buffett is
a serious
farmer. He is a conservationist,
intent on

25:48.080 --> 25:51.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
finding better, more sustainable
ways to grow
food.

25:51.550 --> 25:57.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he is a teacher, sharing
what he knows
with farmers in Africa, giving
them tools

25:57.823 --> 25:59.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to better feed their people.

25:59.591 --> 26:03.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD BUFFETT, Philanthropist:
This is all
going to take nutrients out of
the soil.

26:03.061 --> 26:08.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He is also a man
with a lot
of money to spend on making
those things happen.

26:08.467 --> 26:13.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been described that one of
your goals
or your main goal is ending
world hunger.

26:13.539 --> 26:15.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOWARD BUFFETT: Well, you got to
have a goal.

26:15.974 --> 26:17.743 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

26:17.776 --> 26:21.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD BUFFETT: But we're not
going to end
world hunger, but, you know, I
think every

26:21.313 --> 26:24.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
step we can take in that
direction is something
positive.

26:24.983 --> 26:25.651 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Just slam it.

26:25.684 --> 26:27.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You just slam it?

26:27.119 --> 26:28.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOWARD BUFFETT: Hard. There. You
got it.

26:28.821 --> 26:31.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, now, what do
you call this
machine again?

26:32.024 --> 26:37.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOWARD BUFFETT: 82-25-R John
Deere. It's a
tractor.

26:37.095 --> 26:39.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Howard Buffett
loves his toys.

26:39.998 --> 26:43.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD BUFFETT: My mom always
told me I didn't
have enough Tonka toys when I
grew up, so

26:43.936 --> 26:45.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think I have them now.

26:45.737 --> 26:51.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mom would be the
late Susan
Buffett, who died in 2004. And
dad, you guessed

26:51.610 --> 26:56.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it, is Warren Buffett, one of
the world's
richest men.

26:56.114 --> 27:02.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You grew up in Nebraska. What
was it like?
I mean, what do you remember
about being in

27:02.888 --> 27:04.356 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this family?

27:04.389 --> 27:07.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOWARD BUFFETT: I think people
think it was
different because of my dad.

27:07.893 --> 27:12.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the truth is, when I was
growing up, my
dad wasn't well-known at all. We
grew up in

27:12.498 --> 27:17.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a very normal environment, went
to public
schools, walked down to the bus
stop and went

27:17.236 --> 27:18.871 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to school.

27:18.904 --> 27:21.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At the same time,
your dad
-- because of your dad's
success, you were

27:21.406 --> 27:23.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leading a pretty comfortable
upbringing.

27:23.308 --> 27:26.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD BUFFETT: Oh, we didn't
have to worry
about anything. And we were
always told that,

27:26.812 --> 27:30.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if we wanted to go to college,
it would be
paid for, if we wanted to go to
medical school,

27:30.516 --> 27:34.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it would be paid for, which is
kind of funny,
because none of the three of us
actually finished

27:34.386 --> 27:37.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
college. We all started, but we
never quite
made it all the way through.

27:37.756 --> 27:42.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just had a hard time adjusting
in college.
So I went out and I bought a
bulldozer, and

27:42.661 --> 27:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I started building terraces on
farm ground
and taking out trees and
building basements.

27:47.699 --> 27:50.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was something I always
wanted to do,
so I went out and did it.

27:50.636 --> 27:52.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what did that
lead to next?

27:52.437 --> 27:56.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HOWARD BUFFETT: Well,
ultimately, it led to
the fact that I'm sitting here,
because I

27:56.375 --> 28:01.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had some experiences with
neighbors who are
farmers and who let me get
involved in some

28:01.513 --> 28:04.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the fieldwork and some of the
things that
they did.

28:04.716 --> 28:07.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I really fell in love with
farming.

28:07.553 --> 28:11.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have a total of 4,500 acres.

28:11.123 --> 28:17.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Buffet's Illinois
farms can
produce more than 8,000 tons of
corn and soybeans

28:17.296 --> 28:23.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a year. But they're also
living laboratories,
part of research funded by the
Howard G. Buffett

28:23.402 --> 28:27.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Foundation, to improve
agriculture both here
and overseas.

28:27.439 --> 28:31.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD BUFFETT: So, what we have
in this field,
the first thing I want to point
out is all

28:31.977 --> 28:32.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the cornstalks from last year.

28:32.544 --> 28:33.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOWARD BUFFETT: We do no tillage
in this field,
zero.

28:35.781 --> 28:37.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why not?

28:37.583 --> 28:40.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD BUFFETT: Because it helps
build soil
health. You save fuel, because
you only make

28:41.019 --> 28:44.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one pass over this field,
instead of maybe
three or four.

28:44.523 --> 28:47.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, but you just
let the stalks
rot; is that basically it?

28:47.759 --> 28:49.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOWARD BUFFETT: Yes, exactly.

28:49.661 --> 28:52.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you pull this out, you
see the earthworm
right here, and the earthworm
right there?

28:52.230 --> 28:53.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Oh, my gosh, yes,
right there.

28:53.632 --> 28:55.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOWARD BUFFETT: OK?

28:55.334 --> 28:57.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, any gardener will tell you
this. Worms
are the best thing you can have.
But if I

28:57.970 --> 29:02.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take that shovel and I go to dig
up a shovel
worth of soil across the road,
where they

29:02.708 --> 29:06.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have tilled it year after year,
finding these
earthworms, it's pretty
unlikely.

29:06.445 --> 29:13.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Howard G.
Buffett foundation
plans to give away an estimated
$4 billion

29:13.085 --> 29:18.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the next 30 years, most of
the money
coming from shares of Berkshire
Hathaway,

29:18.357 --> 29:21.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the company founded by the
senior Mr. Buffett.

29:21.193 --> 29:25.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD BUFFETT: My dad gave us
this great
opportunity with the foundation,
and it was

29:25.163 --> 29:29.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
natural for me to look at
smallholder farmers
and see, well, how do we improve
agriculture,

29:29.701 --> 29:34.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and how do we make it so the
farmers feed
their families better?

29:34.106 --> 29:40.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Howard Buffett
has immersed
himself on the African continent
as few other

29:40.979 --> 29:42.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
philanthropists have.

29:42.648 --> 29:45.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD BUFFETT: My dad has said,
go out and
don't try to hit the ball out of
the park

29:45.817 --> 29:50.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every time, but don't be scared
to swing.
And swing means you're going to
miss, and

29:50.589 --> 29:54.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it means that you're going to
fail some of
the times.

29:54.760 --> 29:59.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The foundation
has invested
heavily in the strife-ridden
Democratic Republic

29:59.297 --> 30:01.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Congo.

30:01.099 --> 30:05.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD BUFFETT: We're building
three hydro
plants in Eastern Congo. And we
started the

30:05.337 --> 30:11.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first one in 2012-2013, in the
middle of very
intense conflict, with the M23
and the Congolese

30:11.777 --> 30:13.445 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government.

30:13.478 --> 30:18.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we had the site. When we
started, it was
shelled by RPGs and everything
else.

30:18.216 --> 30:23.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CALESTOUS JUMA, Harvard
University: The Democratic
Republic of the Congo is an area
where not

30:23.889 --> 30:29.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many donors are interested in
operating. And
so he's taking very high risks
in going to

30:29.928 --> 30:31.697 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those areas.

30:31.730 --> 30:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Harvard Professor
Calestous
Juma says Buffett's willingness
to take those

30:35.233 --> 30:38.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
risks has brought him respect
across the continent.

30:38.270 --> 30:43.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CALESTOUS JUMA: He's visited all
the African
countries. He's looked at what
happens, what's

30:43.241 --> 30:47.245 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happening on the ground. He is a
farmer himself.

30:47.279 --> 30:52.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Most other
foundations wouldn't
dare go into a country where
there's that

30:52.350 --> 30:56.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
level of conflict, where that --
where you
could see fighting break out.

30:56.888 --> 31:02.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOWARD BUFFETT: To me, those are
the people
who need the most help.

31:02.160 --> 31:06.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you're looking at the
most devastated
populations. You're looking at
devastated

31:06.431 --> 31:10.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
infrastructure, no governance,
no rule of
law. If you want to talk about
helping the

31:10.368 --> 31:13.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most impoverished populations,
you're talking
about going to where conflict
is. There's

31:13.839 --> 31:15.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
no doubt about that.

31:15.774 --> 31:20.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yet one of
Buffett's most ambitious
projects is in one of Africa's
currently most

31:20.545 --> 31:26.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
peaceful nations, Rwanda, where
the foundation
will spend half-a-billion
dollars, principally

31:26.985 --> 31:29.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to train young Rwandan farmers.

31:29.387 --> 31:36.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD BUFFETT: You would have
young adults
graduating with four-year
degrees in agricultural

31:36.795 --> 31:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
processing and plant science,
and things that
today they don't really have
access to.

31:41.733 --> 31:44.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And why is that
important?
Why does it matter?

31:44.169 --> 31:47.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD BUFFETT: Well, if you
want to advance
agriculture, I mean, look at
what we did in

31:47.539 --> 31:52.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this country. The university
system is what
built our agriculture into a
powerhouse originally.

31:52.878 --> 31:58.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CALESTOUS JUMA: Historically,
African agriculture
was considered to be something
that peasants

31:58.717 --> 32:03.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
did, therefore, didn't require
training.

32:03.121 --> 32:11.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in Illinois,
we see yet
another aspect of the
farmer-philanthropist,

32:11.329 --> 32:17.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Auxiliary Deputy Sheriff Howard
Buffett. For
the past four years, he's
volunteered for

32:17.903 --> 32:22.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a job it's safe to say few other
foundation
heads have held.

32:22.174 --> 32:26.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD BUFFETT: The one thing
that I have
gotten out of being an auxiliary
sheriff,

32:26.845 --> 32:32.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deputy sheriff, is seeing a
whole underside
of this country that I had no
idea existed.

32:32.617 --> 32:43.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, the poverty, the
domestic abuse, the
substance abuse, the attitude of
people about

32:43.261 --> 32:48.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of things, I mean, I have
been -- it's
hard to surprise me, but I have
been surprised

32:48.700 --> 32:51.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at some of the things I have
experienced and
seen as a deputy sheriff.

32:51.937 --> 32:53.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM SCHNEIDER, Macon County,
Illinois, Sheriff:
Howard Buffett is probably more
prepared than

32:54.005 --> 32:56.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a lot of other younger deputies
coming on.

32:56.708 --> 33:00.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Macon County
Sheriff Tom Schneider
sings his praises.

33:00.545 --> 33:07.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM SCHNEIDER: The amount of
hours that he
has put in with deputies, it is
-- basically

33:07.319 --> 33:12.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
surpasses everybody else. He
goes through
training on a daily basis, and
he's always

33:12.290 --> 33:15.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
educating himself to see how he
can perform
at a higher level.

33:15.760 --> 33:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, here you are,
somebody
who's seen the world, who's seen
a lot, and

33:20.999 --> 33:27.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yet this is something that only
in the last
few years you have been able to
witness up

33:27.038 --> 33:28.673 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
close.

33:28.707 --> 33:32.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD BUFFETT: I have witnessed
in a way
that a civilian, a normal
citizen wouldn't

33:32.143 --> 33:33.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be able to witness it.

33:33.945 --> 33:38.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You see it every single day. And
you're making
decisions about how to deal with
it, which

33:38.817 --> 33:40.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
makes it very real.

33:40.552 --> 33:43.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, my question
is, then
how do you decide, where's your
greater passion?

33:43.822 --> 33:48.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because you clearly have that
great passion
to make changes in a place like
Rwanda, but

33:48.593 --> 33:50.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you also -- you also clearly
have a passion
here.

33:50.896 --> 33:56.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD BUFFETT: Your first
obligation is always
at home. I mean, you can't ever
walk away

33:56.668 --> 34:02.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the responsibilities that
you have at
home. But I also think we have a
huge responsibility

34:02.807 --> 34:08.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
internationally, because we are
a leader.
And we need to maintain that
leadership.

34:08.179 --> 34:12.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, for me, I don't see that
-- you can't
separate them. They're both
critical. But

34:12.751 --> 34:16.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you cannot -- you can never walk
away from
your responsibilities at home.

34:16.154 --> 34:20.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does it bother
you that you're
known to so many people as
Warren Buffett's

34:20.558 --> 34:22.360 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
son?

34:22.394 --> 34:27.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD BUFFETT: Never bothered
me ever, never,
no. I don't think about it that
way. I feel

34:27.832 --> 34:29.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like I'm doing what I can do.

34:29.701 --> 34:36.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the truth is, I'm able to do
so many things
because of my dad that I
couldn't do otherwise.

34:36.741 --> 34:38.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's been an amazing father.

34:38.476 --> 34:43.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CALESTOUS JUMA: Howard Buffett
is someone
who has brought his own personal
experience

34:43.515 --> 34:48.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and integrity to probably one of
the world's
largest and critical challenges,
which is

34:48.720 --> 34:52.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being able to generate food
security for a
billion people.

34:52.691 --> 34:58.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think that takes
incredible courage
and commitment to be able to do
something

34:58.463 --> 35:00.165 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of that kind.

35:00.198 --> 35:03.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM SCHNEIDER: Here, within the
last week,
he was out with an officer that
had did an

35:03.768 --> 35:09.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
arrest, and the individual was
cold. He offered
up his coat to that individual,
so that they

35:09.774 --> 35:12.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would be warm. The individual
said, "Boo-fay."

35:12.944 --> 35:19.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he goes, "Yes, some people
say that -- well,
or Buffett, like Warren
Buffett."

35:19.117 --> 35:21.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he goes, "Yes, Yes, I have
heard of him."

35:21.419 --> 35:24.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the individual sits back and
goes, "Well,
you kind of look like him."

35:24.422 --> 35:26.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"Yes, I have heard that."

35:26.491 --> 35:30.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Never once did they even realize
that it was
Howard Buffett, his son.

35:30.895 --> 35:32.630 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

35:32.664 --> 35:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We want to
note that BNSF
Railway, an underwriter of this
broadcast,

35:35.734 --> 35:40.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is owned by Warren Buffett's
Berkshire Hathaway.
That connection had no impact on
the reporting

35:40.372 --> 35:44.509 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of this story.

35:44.542 --> 35:54.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two weeks ago, Pope Francis
visited refugees
on the Greek island of Lesbos, a
way station

35:54.586 --> 36:00.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two weeks ago, Pope Francis
visited refugees
on the Greek island of Lesbos, a
way station

36:00.191 --> 36:02.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on the migrant trail to Europe.

36:02.093 --> 36:06.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Though he was there but a few
hours, the pontiff
made headlines the world over
when he left

36:06.498 --> 36:11.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the island with three Syrian
families, 12
people in all, bound for Rome.

36:11.469 --> 36:15.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Late last week, Yahoo News
global anchor Katie
Couric sat down with four of the
refugees

36:15.874 --> 36:16.808 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at the Vatican.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here is a brief portion of that
interview.

36:18.743 --> 36:23.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE COURIC, Yahoo News: It
must be wonderful
to be safe, but it also must be
hard to leave

36:23.114 --> 36:24.149 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your country.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
®MD-UL /HASAN, Syrian Refugee:
Yes.

36:25.650 --> 36:27.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOUR, Syrian refugee: Yes.

36:27.485 --> 36:31.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUHILA, Syrian refugee (through
translator):
No doubt, God willing, we will
adapt to this

36:31.056 --> 36:33.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country, and, most importantly,
we will learn
Italian.

36:33.324 --> 36:34.426 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

36:34.459 --> 36:36.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATIE COURIC: Is it hard to
leave your home,
though?

36:36.661 --> 36:40.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUHILA (through translator): We
try and forget
that moment.

36:40.065 --> 36:44.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATIE COURIC: It must be nice
not to be frightened
every day.

36:44.335 --> 36:53.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NOUR: Yes, because, for a
moment, when were
in Turkey, I was afraid from the
sounds of

36:53.645 --> 36:55.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things. Every time the planes
passed, I was
very afraid for my son.

36:55.513 --> 36:59.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE COURIC: If you had a
chance to see the
pope -- have you been able to
see him at all,

36:59.551 --> 37:01.152 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Pope Francis?

37:01.186 --> 37:03.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HASAN: We don't know, but -- we
hope -- we
hope that we could meet him
again.

37:03.688 --> 37:06.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATIE COURIC: You met him when
you traveled
with him?

37:06.324 --> 37:06.691 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
NOUR: Yes.

37:06.724 --> 37:07.559 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
HASAN: Yes.

37:07.592 --> 37:08.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KATIE COURIC: And you met him in
Lesbos?

37:08.126 --> 37:08.960 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
HASAN: Yes.

37:08.993 --> 37:10.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOUR: Yes, just before...

37:10.161 --> 37:11.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KATIE COURIC: Just before you
got on the airplane?

37:11.696 --> 37:12.530 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
NOUR: Yes.

37:12.564 --> 37:13.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KATIE COURIC: What did you think
of him?

37:13.965 --> 37:19.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NOUR: He's very kind man. He's a
real human
being.

37:19.137 --> 37:29.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For me, I appreciate him more
than any Islamic
leader or Islamic religious man
or more than

37:29.848 --> 37:40.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any Arabic leader, because
nothing has been
done by these men like him, by
the Arabic

37:40.358 --> 37:43.027 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
leaders or by Muslim leaders.

37:43.061 --> 37:44.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KATIE COURIC: No one has done.

37:44.996 --> 37:53.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NOUR: No one has done the same
thing. Not
one has visited the camps. No
one has shown

37:53.571 --> 38:00.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the suffering people like him.
No one has
thought about us, although they
participate

38:00.578 --> 38:05.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with us the same religion, on
the same language.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATIE COURIC: And, Ramy, what
did you think
about the pope?

38:07.118 --> 38:08.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMY, ®MD-UL /Syrian Refugee
(through translator):
His actions didn't have to do
with our skin

38:08.920 --> 38:12.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
color and religion. And it has
proven that
human beings are brothers with
other human

38:12.824 --> 38:14.692 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
beings.

38:14.726 --> 38:18.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE COURIC: If you had a
chance to say something
to Pope Francis today, what
would you say?

38:18.496 --> 38:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMY (through translator): I
will thank him
from the bottom of my heart. And
I wish that

38:22.233 --> 38:24.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hope all Western and Arabic
countries do the
same.

38:24.702 --> 38:29.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATIE COURIC: What about you,
Suhila? What
would you say to the pope?

38:29.340 --> 38:34.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUHILA (through translator): I
will say to
him thank you. Because of him,
hope came back.

38:34.879 --> 38:38.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have come back to life and
we're living
our lives for those that we lost
in Syria.

38:38.850 --> 38:40.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KATIE COURIC: And what about
you, Nour?

38:40.185 --> 38:41.920 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

38:41.953 --> 38:44.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NOUR: I would like to say to him
also thank
you for giving me this
opportunity and for

38:44.255 --> 38:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
giving us security, for giving a
better life
for my son, the new life for my
son, stable

38:55.567 --> 39:05.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
life for my son. And I thank him
for all -- all
his prayers for the refugees.
And I thank

39:05.276 --> 39:07.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him for all the steps that he
has done for
the refugees.

39:08.012 --> 39:12.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Joining me now
is Katie
Couric.

39:12.717 --> 39:16.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Katie, this is almost a lottery
ticket that
the pope gave to these families.
How did it

39:16.621 --> 39:18.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
come about? How were they
chosen?

39:18.256 --> 39:22.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATIE COURIC: Well, you know,
the pope obviously
took this trip to Lesbos, Hari.

39:22.493 --> 39:29.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then I think he claims --
gives credit
to a top adviser and also sort
of the divine

39:29.934 --> 39:36.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being for inspiring him to go
ahead and take
these three families with six
children in

39:36.174 --> 39:39.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
total with him back to Rome.

39:39.077 --> 39:44.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, obviously, for secular
reasons, they
had to make sure that their
papers were in

39:44.215 --> 39:49.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
order, so they had to deal with
the Italian
and the Greek authorities to
ensure that everybody

39:49.821 --> 39:55.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had their documents in order and
that they
qualified for asylum. So, it was
really just

39:55.426 --> 40:01.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the luck of the draw that these
three families
did, in fact, qualify and the
pope said, please

40:01.099 --> 40:02.967 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
come with us.

40:03.001 --> 40:07.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they didn't realize until
they were getting
ready to board the plane, the
papal plane,

40:07.205 --> 40:12.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that in fact they were going
with the pope
back to Rome. So, they described
it as an

40:12.610 --> 40:19.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
"Alice in Wonderland"
experience. And you
can only imagine how thrilled
they were to

40:19.550 --> 40:25.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leave Lesbos, where I think the
conditions
are quite difficult, and finally
get to Rome.

40:25.523 --> 40:29.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, what was
the backstory
of these families? Were they
supporters of

40:29.727 --> 40:31.462 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
either the rebels or Assad?

40:31.496 --> 40:37.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE COURIC: You know, they
were caught in
the crossfire, the proverbial
crossfire.

40:37.468 --> 40:43.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The younger couple, Hasan and
Nour, were civil
engineers working outside. They
lived in a

40:43.608 --> 40:48.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suburb of Damascus and they were
working for
the government, but they were
not sympathetic

40:48.680 --> 40:55.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the Assad regime. So they
were caught between
all these different groups that
are against

40:55.520 --> 41:02.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Assad regime, anti-Assad
groups and ISIS
and all kinds of different
individuals.

41:02.627 --> 41:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have a 2-year-old son,
so, clearly,
they very felt very unsafe on a
daily basis.

41:08.766 --> 41:11.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they were worried that
people, because
they worked for the government,
would think

41:11.669 --> 41:15.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they were sympathetic to Assad,
which they
were not at all.

41:15.039 --> 41:21.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the other couple,
Suhila and Ramy,
he's a teacher and she's a
tailor. And they

41:21.346 --> 41:27.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lived in a city close to the
Iraqi border
that was surrounded by ISIS.
There was a lot

41:27.452 --> 41:31.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of hunger, people dying from
starvation, people
stranded there.

41:31.589 --> 41:37.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, again, they were caught
between these
two different worlds, the pro
Assad forces

41:37.662 --> 41:43.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the anti-Assad forces,
specifically ISIS.
So, they felt -- they feared for
their lives

41:43.501 --> 41:48.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and decided they should leave
with their children,
who are 18, 16 and 7.

41:48.106 --> 41:54.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus -- plus, I should mention,
Hari, that
both Hasan and the son, the
18-year-old son

41:54.679 --> 41:59.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Suhila and Ramy, were being
drafted to
fight in the war. And that's
another reason

41:59.884 --> 42:04.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they wanted to leave the
country, because
I guess they thought that that
would lead

42:04.355 --> 42:06.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to certain death.

42:06.124 --> 42:10.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, Katie, how
did these
families get to Lesbos to be
picked by the

42:10.461 --> 42:11.729 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pope?

42:11.763 --> 42:14.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATIE COURIC: Well, Hari, first,
they had
to make it to Turkey.

42:14.165 --> 42:19.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Hasan and Nour stayed in
Turkey for three
months just waiting to make the
treacherous

42:19.237 --> 42:25.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
journey across the Aegean Sea to
Lesbos. And
they had to try on four
different occasions.

42:25.543 --> 42:29.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were caught by the Turkish
authorities
twice. Once, they didn't want to
get in because

42:29.480 --> 42:31.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they thought it was too
dangerous.

42:31.249 --> 42:35.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can only imagine making this
journey with
a 2-year-old child. But they
finally made

42:35.920 --> 42:42.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it on the fourth try. And then
the other couple,
Ramy and Suhila, they were able
to get into

42:42.193 --> 42:46.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a rubber boat, but the motor
stopped working
in the middle of the Aegean Sea.
They had

42:46.898 --> 42:52.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to wait for very a nerve-racking
hour-and-a-half,
until, finally, it started
working again.

42:52.703 --> 42:57.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so you can only imagine just
how stressful
this is. One of the couples who
wasn't able

42:57.975 --> 43:04.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to join us, Hari, they have two
small children.
One of their children stopped
talking for

43:04.315 --> 43:09.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a period of time because that
child was so
traumatized. And another wakes
up in the middle

43:09.587 --> 43:11.389 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the night.

43:11.422 --> 43:16.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is really the human
cost of this
refugee crisis. And I think
hearing from these

43:16.260 --> 43:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
families personally, I think
that brought
that home in a way that, you
know, is in a

43:22.633 --> 43:24.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
way that we don't often hear.

43:24.402 --> 43:29.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I really was grateful that
we were able
to hear about their experiences
firsthand.

43:29.273 --> 43:31.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What are that
are plans
now? Are they going to stay in
Italy?

43:31.476 --> 43:35.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE COURIC: They are going to
stay in Italy.
They're learning to speak
Italian. Their children

43:36.013 --> 43:40.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are in school or in day care.
They're hoping
they're going to find some kind
of employment.

43:40.952 --> 43:47.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But unemployment is 12 in Italy,
37 percent,
if you can believe it, for
younger people.

43:47.391 --> 43:51.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why they were hoping to
go to France
or Germany. But I think, because
they have

43:51.662 --> 43:56.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been so embraced, Catholic
Charities is caring
for them, they have given them a
place to

43:56.400 --> 44:01.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stay, they're so grateful for
their security,
I think they're going to try to
build a new

44:01.072 --> 44:06.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
life in Italy and hopefully,
they say, return
to Syria one day, if they can.

44:06.244 --> 44:10.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yahoo News
global anchor
Katie Couric, thanks so much for
joining us.

44:10.948 --> 44:18.122 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KATIE COURIC: Thanks, Hari.

44:18.155 --> 44:24.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: As you have
likely heard
by now, Malia Obama has decided
to take a

44:24.662 --> 44:29.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so-called gap year before she
attends Harvard
University in 2017.

44:29.400 --> 44:33.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an idea that's taking hold
among more
students, often at elite
schools, but not

44:33.771 --> 44:35.106 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
only those.

44:35.139 --> 44:37.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham looks at the
broader trend.

44:37.341 --> 44:41.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It's estimated
that, last
year in the U.S., 30,000 to
40,000 students

44:41.979 --> 44:45.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tried out a gap year. And that's
a 20 percent
jump from the previous year.

44:45.416 --> 44:47.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, what are they, why the
growing interest?

44:47.785 --> 44:52.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To help fill in the picture, I'm
joined from
Boston by Joe O'Shea. He's the
author of "Gap

44:52.757 --> 44:57.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Year: How Delaying College
Changes People
in Ways the World Needs." He
also directs

44:57.495 --> 45:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Center for Undergraduate
Research and
Academic Engagement at Florida
State University.

45:01.899 --> 45:03.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, Joe, welcome.

45:03.868 --> 45:04.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH O'SHEA, Author, "Gap
Year: How Delaying
College Changes People in Ways
the World Needs":

45:04.235 --> 45:06.037 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

45:06.070 --> 45:08.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I think a lot
of our viewers
have this stereotype that a gap
year is for

45:08.906 --> 45:13.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rich kids to put on a backpack
and travel
around Europe and find
themselves. I know

45:13.644 --> 45:16.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's not totally true, so,
tell us, what
is a gap year?

45:16.814 --> 45:18.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSEPH O'SHEA: Sure.

45:18.549 --> 45:21.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are so many misconceptions
about what
a gap year is, and some people
think it's

45:21.285 --> 45:25.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just waiting around in your home
community,
maybe sitting on your parents'
couch, taking

45:25.089 --> 45:26.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a year off from school.

45:26.991 --> 45:31.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we think of gap year as
something very
different, a very powerful
educational experience.

45:31.095 --> 45:36.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a structured, deliberate
and purposeful
experience, in which students
challenge themselves

45:36.200 --> 45:40.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outside their comfort zones.
Often it involves
traveling or working or
interning, sometimes

45:40.871 --> 45:44.976 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
overseas, sometimes
domestically, but it's
designed as an experience that
accelerates

45:45.009 --> 45:47.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their personal growth and
prepares them for
college.

45:47.078 --> 45:50.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, could you
give me some
examples of actual gap year
activities that

45:50.748 --> 45:51.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
kids are doing now?

45:51.816 --> 45:53.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSEPH O'SHEA: Sure.

45:53.618 --> 45:58.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, City Year, for instance, one
in the U.S.
in which students -- or young
people work

45:58.222 --> 46:03.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in inner-city schools, is a
powerful one and
popular one. Many students go
overseas. An

46:03.728 --> 46:08.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
organization Global Citizen
Year, for instance,
or Omprakash work with local
community-based

46:08.199 --> 46:10.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
organizations in developing
communities around
the world.

46:10.568 --> 46:14.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And students will intern there.
Maybe they're
doing something with young
people or a community

46:14.572 --> 46:17.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
role or public health kind of
work. But it
really runs the spectrum.

46:17.875 --> 46:23.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Is there any
research indicating
what impact a gap year has on a
student?

46:23.781 --> 46:25.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSEPH O'SHEA: Sure.

46:25.583 --> 46:29.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have done some research both
in the American
Gap Association and in the
academic world.

46:29.820 --> 46:34.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what's very clear to us is
that, when
students take these kind of
structured, deliberate

46:34.358 --> 46:38.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gap years, that their growth is
really accelerated
across a number of ways.

46:38.195 --> 46:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They become better thinkers,
better people
and better citizens. And what is
really interesting

46:42.633 --> 46:45.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that they perform better when
they get
to college. They are more likely
to go to

46:45.836 --> 46:48.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
college, retain, and graduate
and get higher
GPAs.

46:48.239 --> 46:53.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, I realize
that this
can vary, but there has got to
be a cost associated

46:53.678 --> 46:56.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with this. Do we know how much
-- what does
it cost to take a gap year?

46:56.981 --> 46:58.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSEPH O'SHEA: Sure.

46:58.816 --> 47:04.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It really ranges and depends on
what you do.
Gap years can cost as much as
$30,000 a year,

47:04.655 --> 47:09.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but they can also cost very
little. There
are some programs like
Omprakash, for instance,

47:09.427 --> 47:13.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which works directly with
nonprofit organizations
around the world. And some of
them are free

47:13.431 --> 47:15.499 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
room and board for up to a year.

47:15.533 --> 47:18.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what is interesting is now
we're seeing
gap year organizations provide
increasing

47:18.969 --> 47:23.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
levels of scholarship to
students to support
low-income schools -- low-income
students

47:23.340 --> 47:28.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
-- sorry -- and many
universities, like my
university, Florida State,
subsidizing gap

47:28.979 --> 47:30.881 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
year experiences.

47:30.915 --> 47:35.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are, for the first year,
dedicating $50,000
in scholarships to support
low-income students

47:35.386 --> 47:37.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in their gap year experiences.

47:37.188 --> 47:40.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, help me
understand that.
Why would a university, which I
understand

47:40.558 --> 47:43.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they are increasingly
interested in this
-- why would colleges and
universities want

47:43.928 --> 47:45.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their students to do this?

47:45.730 --> 47:50.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH O'SHEA: Well, we now know
very clearly
that this is a transformational
educational

47:50.367 --> 47:52.069 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
experience.

47:52.103 --> 47:54.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, from our side, we know we're
going to
get really good and motivated
and purposeful

47:54.939 --> 47:59.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
students when they come back to
Florida State.
And many universities are
beginning to recognize

48:00.010 --> 48:02.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this and see it as a powerful
educational
intervention.

48:02.947 --> 48:09.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The students are going to retain
better, graduate
from the university. And we want
to spearhead

48:09.186 --> 48:13.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this and help signal to students
and their
families and other stakeholders
in the education

48:13.824 --> 48:17.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
system that gap years are an
important part
of the educational ecosystem.

48:17.595 --> 48:21.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, I
understand that there
are scholarships available for
low-income

48:21.465 --> 48:25.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
students, but isn't this still
mostly the
province of wealthier students?

48:25.469 --> 48:29.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH O'SHEA: Unfortunately,
gap years still
are mostly done by students in
the middle

48:29.774 --> 48:31.542 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
class and above.

48:31.575 --> 48:35.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's a real big problem
for America,
especially since we know how
beneficial gap

48:35.780 --> 48:39.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year education can be for
students to. And
to get that to scale, we're
going to need

48:39.984 --> 48:44.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
institutions and the government
at the federal
and state level to begin to
recognize gap

48:44.955 --> 48:48.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years and to federally and --
subsidize those
experiences for students.

48:48.692 --> 48:53.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, Joe
O'Shea, Florida
State University, thank you very
much.

48:53.631 --> 49:00.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOSEPH O'SHEA: Thank you.

49:00.604 --> 49:07.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally
tonight, as part
of our Broken Justice series, we
have a "NewsHour"

49:07.745 --> 49:09.547 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
essay.

49:09.580 --> 49:14.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Paton Blough opens up about his
bipolar disorder
and frequent encounters with law
enforcement.

49:14.118 --> 49:18.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATON BLOUGH, Founder, Rehinge:
I have two
labels I will carry the rest of
my life, bipolar

49:18.889 --> 49:21.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and convicted felon. They're not
mutually
exclusive.

49:21.792 --> 49:26.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have been arrested six
different times,
all the while in a delusional,
paranoid state

49:26.831 --> 49:32.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of mind caused by my illness.
What you know
about society and how people
typically behave

49:32.102 --> 49:36.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doesn't apply to me. I enter a
department
store, and it feels right to
immediately take

49:36.473 --> 49:38.275 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
off my shoes.

49:38.309 --> 49:42.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm convinced the government is
plotting to
control me, playing carefully
selected songs

49:42.313 --> 49:47.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the radio to persuade me into
making a
certain decision, so I change
the station

49:47.484 --> 49:55.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just to spite them. I throw
three fingers
up at a public security camera
and tell President

49:55.793 --> 49:58.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Obama to read between the lines.

49:58.963 --> 50:03.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No, the rules of society don't
apply to me,
not when I'm having one of my
episodes.

50:03.200 --> 50:05.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I just raise my hand like this.

50:05.803 --> 50:10.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My episodes, which are rare, can
happen at
any time and take many forms,
from creating

50:10.908 --> 50:16.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a piece of art, to aggressively
accusing UPS
employees of being government
workers smuggling

50:16.313 --> 50:18.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weapons through their delivery
routes.

50:18.716 --> 50:22.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm able to show you these
pictures because
my wife has documented these
episodes, so

50:22.853 --> 50:26.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we can learn more about
myself and ultimately
help others learn.

50:26.490 --> 50:31.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: My gosh, this is a mess.
You created
a studio up here, baby. You look
like a true

50:31.962 --> 50:32.796 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
artist.

50:32.830 --> 50:34.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PATON BLOUGH: You see, I'm not
alone.

50:34.732 --> 50:39.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than half of all prison and
jail inmates
have a mental health issue. You
can imagine

50:39.470 --> 50:43.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the kind of reaction someone
like me might
have when delusions trigger an
incident in

50:43.841 --> 50:48.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which a police officer wants to
engage with
me or, worse, arrest me.

50:48.879 --> 50:54.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Three of my six arrests went
relatively well,
with police getting me into
custody safely.

50:54.151 --> 50:58.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other three were extremely
violent, because,
in my head, I was fighting for
my life.

50:58.322 --> 51:02.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was Tased in the back of the
police car
in our hospital parking lot with
leg irons

51:02.393 --> 51:07.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and handcuffs on. And one of my
charges that
night were destruction of county
property,

51:07.665 --> 51:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
because I broke the leg irons.

51:09.466 --> 51:13.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thankfully, around six years
ago, my recovery
killed into high gear. I was
asked to share

51:13.971 --> 51:20.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my experiences with officers as
part of something
called crisis intervention
training. In my

51:20.311 --> 51:24.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
experience, most officers want
to help, but
often simply lack the training
to know what

51:24.214 --> 51:26.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to do in these tough situations.

51:26.083 --> 51:30.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One time, I was arrested by an
officer who
I believed naturally possess
many of the things

51:30.988 --> 51:35.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we train. He slowed down and
didn't force
the issue when I accused him of
being an undercover

51:35.960 --> 51:40.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agent. He waited for my brother
to come from
across town to bring my meds.

51:40.931 --> 51:45.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I accused him of giving me
a poisoned
bottle of water so I could take
my pills,

51:45.269 --> 51:49.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he immediately offered to take a
sip to prove
it was fine. There is no doubt
we need more

51:49.740 --> 51:51.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
officers like this today.

51:51.542 --> 51:55.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I came up with a training sheet
which quickly
describes for the police how to
deal with

51:55.579 --> 52:01.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
someone like myself. Let the
person think
they're in control. Slow down
and stay calm.

52:01.885 --> 52:04.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One thing I always tell them is
to imagine
the person they're dealing
they're dealing

52:04.621 --> 52:07.825 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with is their brother, mother or
good friend.

52:07.858 --> 52:12.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The biggest shame of my life has
been my criminal
record, but now I get to take
those experiences

52:12.596 --> 52:14.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and help my community.

52:14.398 --> 52:18.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%

tensions between

52:19.003 --> 52:22.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Arabs and Israelis can be high,
there's at
least one space where children
can leave their

52:23.007 --> 52:26.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anxieties at the door: on the
basketball court.
