OF NIGERIA'S MILITARY IN ACTIN

ON INFORMATION COMING FROM

THEY HAD SEEN THE GIRLS AN

DIFFICULTIES IN FINDING THES

02:04.667 --> 02:05.067

02:07.433 --> 02:09.567
THEY WERE INITIALLY TAKEN INTO

02:09.567 --> 02:11.367
THE ZAM BEESA FOREST

02:11.367 --> 02:13.067
TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA, THAT AREA

02:13.067 --> 02:15.500
IS EIGHT TIMES THE SIZE OF

02:15.500 --> 02:17.567
YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK.

02:17.567 --> 02:18.967
VERY DENSE FOREST, FAMIL

02:18.967 --> 02:21.967
MEMBERS WHO WENT IN THERE TO TRY

02:21.967 --> 02:23.900
AND FIND THE GIRLS SAID IT'S S

02:23.900 --> 02:25.667
DENSE THAT IT'S ACTUALLY DARK IN

02:25.667 --> 02:26.000
THERE.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
THE SUN LIGHT DOESN'T COME

02:29.000 --> 02:29.333
THROUGH.

02:29.333 --> 02:31.167
BUT WE'VE HEARD THAT SOME OF THE

02:31.167 --> 02:32.567
PLACES THEY'VE BEEN TAKEN TO

02:32.567 --> 02:35.833
INCLUDING ACROSS THE BORDERS

02:35.833 --> 02:37.033
INTO CHAD AND CAMEROON

02:37.033 --> 02:40.500
THERE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SEMI-

02:40.500 --> 02:41.000
ARID REGION.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.800
IT'S ON THE BRINK OF THE SAHAR

02:43.800 --> 02:43.933
DESERT

02:43.933 --> 02:46.267
SO YOU'RE TALKING A MASSIVE,

02:46.267 --> 02:47.767
MASSIVE AREA, AND IT'S LIK

02:47.767 --> 02:49.467
FINDING A NEEDLE IN THE HAYSTACK

02:49.467 --> 02:52.733
AND REALLY, I THINK EVERYONE HAS

02:52.733 --> 02:53.833
AGREED, THE ONLY WAY THEY'RE

02:53.833 --> 02:57.567
GOING TO FIND THESE GIRLS IS B

02:57.567 --> 02:59.067
ACTING ON INFORMATION FROM

02:59.067 --> 03:01.467
PEOPLE WHO'VE SEEN THEM.

03:01.467 --> 03:03.900
>> ARE THERE ANY WORKING

03:03.900 --> 03:06.833
THEORIES ON HOW SOMEONE, OR SOME

03:06.833 --> 03:09.300
GROUP COULD KEEP THIS LARGE

03:09.300 --> 03:11.067
GROUP QUIET OR HIDDEN FOR SO

03:11.067 --> 03:11.967
LONG A TIME?

03:11.967 --> 03:15.233
OR HAVE THEY BROKEN THE GROUP UP

03:15.233 --> 03:16.767
INTO SMALLER PARTS

03:16.767 --> 03:20.333
>> THE REPORTS WE'VE HAD ARE ALL

03:20.333 --> 03:21.100
UNVERIFIED, THAT THEY'VE

03:21.100 --> 03:22.600
PROBABLY BEEN BROKEN UP INTO

03:22.600 --> 03:23.767
SMALLER GROUPS, BECAUSE IT WOULD

03:23.767 --> 03:26.233
BE PRETTY UNMANAGEABLE

03:26.233 --> 03:28.633
WE'RE TALKING CURRENTLY ABOU

03:28.633 --> 03:29.200
276 GIRLS.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.067
53 ESCAPED

03:30.067 --> 03:32.900
THERE WERE MORE THAN 300 WHO

03:32.900 --> 03:35.267
WERE ABDUCTED IN THE FIRST

03:35.267 --> 03:35.733
PLACE.

03:35.733 --> 03:38.100
MONDAY NIGHT WILL BE THE

03:38.100 --> 03:40.433
MONTH-LONG ANNIVERSARY OF TH

03:40.433 --> 03:40.900
KIDNAPPING

03:40.900 --> 03:42.333
>> DO THE AUTHORITIES STIL

03:42.333 --> 03:46.167
THINK THAT THE GIRLS ARE ALIVE

03:46.167 --> 03:49.467
>> THE PRESIDENT IN A TELEVISION

03:49.467 --> 03:51.367
PROGRAM ON SUNDAY, HE SAID H

03:51.367 --> 03:53.867
WAS HAPPY TO KNOW THAT THE GIRLS

03:53.867 --> 03:55.133
WERE UNHARMED.

03:55.133 --> 03:59.033
HE WAS THEN UNABLE TO SAY HOW HE

03:59.033 --> 04:00.133
WOULD KNOW THAT.

04:00.133 --> 04:02.633
HE SAID THAT THEY HAD NO CONTACT

04:02.633 --> 04:05.333
WITH THE ABDUCTORS, DID NOT KNOW

04:05.333 --> 04:07.033
WHO THE ABDUCTORS ARE.

04:07.033 --> 04:08.833
SO IT WAS A RATHER STRANGE THING

04:08.833 --> 04:10.667
TO SAY

04:10.667 --> 04:12.367
I HAVE SPOKEN WITH A

04:12.367 --> 04:13.900
INTERMEDIARY WHO HAS NEGOTIATE

SO NOT CLEAN WATER

04:39.033 --> 04:41.300

BEING TOLD, EVERY TWO OR THREE

THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS WHO DIE

08:16.867 --> 08:20.367
WAITING FOR ORGAN TRANSPLANTS?

08:20.367 --> 08:25.667
SARAH JAMES REPORTS FROM SYDNEY,

08:25.667 --> 08:27.200
AUSTRALIA.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.967
>> IT'S JUST AFTER DAWN IN ONE

08:28.967 --> 08:30.967
OF THE WORLD'S MOST BEAUTIFU

08:30.967 --> 08:31.100
CITIES

08:31.100 --> 08:33.067
THIS MISTY MORNING,

08:33.067 --> 08:37.033
PICTURE-PERFECT START TO THE

08:37.033 --> 08:39.567
DAY.

08:39.567 --> 08:42.167
AND DANIAN LOOKS THE PICTURE O

08:42.167 --> 08:44.167
HEALTH, BUT THE IMAGE IS

08:44.167 --> 08:44.333
DECEPTIVE.

08:44.333 --> 08:46.300
>> I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR A

08:46.300 --> 08:47.000
KIDNEY TRANSPLANT AND AS FAR A

08:47.000 --> 08:48.733
I'M CONCERNED, I NEED TO BE AS

08:48.733 --> 08:50.467
FIT AS POSSIBLE TO GIVE MYSELF

08:50.467 --> 08:51.533
THE BEST POSSIBLE CHANCE O

08:51.533 --> 08:53.500
RECOVERING FROM MAJOR SURGERY.

08:53.500 --> 08:57.400
>>> DAMIAN INHERITED A RARE FORM

08:57.400 --> 08:58.967
OF KID DISEASE FROM HIS MOTHER

08:58.967 --> 09:00.767
IT CLAIMED HER LIFE WHEN HE WA

09:00.767 --> 09:01.567
JUST A BOY

09:01.567 --> 09:04.833
THE FACT THAT DAMIAN'S KIDNEYS

09:04.833 --> 09:06.600
DON'T WORK AFFECTS THE SIMPLES

09:06.600 --> 09:08.600
OF RITUALS, EVEN HIS CHOICE OF

09:08.600 --> 09:10.433
MORNING COFFEE

09:10.433 --> 09:12.333
>> I'LL GET A DOUBLE ESPRESSO.

09:12.333 --> 09:15.233
>> CAPPUCCINO HAS TOO MUCH MILK.

09:15.233 --> 09:18.267
HE HASN'T HAD SOUP IN A DECADE

09:18.267 --> 09:20.667
DAMIAN MUST RATION ALL LIQUI

09:20.667 --> 09:22.267
BECAUSE HIS BODY CAN'T GET RID

09:22.267 --> 09:25.900
OF FLUID, PUTTING HIM AT RISK OF

09:25.900 --> 09:26.700
SWELLING, HEART DAMAGE, OR

09:26.700 --> 09:29.767
STROKE FROM HIGH

09:29.767 --> 09:30.100
BLOOD PRESSURE

09:30.100 --> 09:33.267
>> YOU GOT TO CONSIDER THE FLUID

09:33.267 --> 09:35.700
A BOWL OF RICE ABSORBS WHEN IT'S

09:35.700 --> 09:36.533
COOKING.

09:36.533 --> 09:38.567
ALL THOSE THINGS GET TAKEN INT

09:38.567 --> 09:38.833
ACCOUNT.

09:38.833 --> 09:41.000
BECAUSE MY BODY CAN'T GET RID OF

09:41.000 --> 09:43.300
FLUIDS, I CAN'T HOLD THOSE

09:43.300 --> 09:47.800
THINGS FOR TWO DAYS.

09:47.800 --> 09:48.667
>> HIS DREAM

09:48.667 --> 09:50.367
>> BEING ABLE TO GO TO THE SIN

09:50.367 --> 09:56.000
AND DRINKING A GLASS OF WATER.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.533
>> SO EVERY OTHER DAY, DAMIA

09:58.533 --> 10:01.567
DOES WHAT 400,000 AMERICANS DO

10:01.567 --> 10:03.367
>> SO THIS IS WHERE YOU HAVE

10:03.367 --> 10:03.500
DIALYSIS

10:03.500 --> 10:05.533
>> IT IS INDEED, THIS IS THE

10:05.533 --> 10:06.333
DIALYSIS ROOM.

10:06.333 --> 10:08.233
>> WITHOUT DIALYSIS, HE WOULD BE

10:08.233 --> 10:10.933
DEAD IN A FEW WEEKS.

10:10.933 --> 10:13.967
THE MACHINE REMOVES EXTRA WATER,

10:13.967 --> 10:15.967
WASTE, AND SALT FROM HIS BOD

10:15.967 --> 10:17.967
AND KEEPS CHEMICALS LIKE

10:17.967 --> 10:22.433
POTASSIUM AT A SAFE LEVEL IN HIS

10:22.433 --> 10:22.700
BLOOD.

10:22.700 --> 10:24.700
THE PROGRAMMER IS TETHERED T

10:24.700 --> 10:26.533
THE MACHINE 25 HOURS A WEEK.

10:26.533 --> 10:27.267
AUSTRALIA HAS UNIVERSAL HEALTH

10:27.267 --> 10:29.767
CARE AND DAMIAN'S DIALYSIS

10:29.767 --> 10:31.700
TREATMENT, MORE THAN $50,000 A

10:31.700 --> 10:33.500
YEAR, IS COVERED BY TH

10:33.500 --> 10:33.800
GOVERNMENT

10:33.800 --> 10:36.467
IT'S A LIFE-SAVING PROCEDURE

10:36.467 --> 10:39.600
BUT NOT A CHEAP OR EASY ONE.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.133
>> THE DIALYSIS PROCESS INVOLVES

10:41.133 --> 10:43.633
PUTTING A COUPLE OF NEEDLES IN

10:43.633 --> 10:45.500
YOUR ARM AND THEN ESSENTIALL

10:45.500 --> 10:47.533
THE DIALYSIS MACHINE WORKS A

10:47.533 --> 10:49.567
YOUR ARTIFICIAL KIDNEY FOR FIV

10:49.567 --> 10:50.667
HOURS.

10:50.667 --> 10:52.233
UNFORTUNATELY, PUTTING NEEDLES

10:52.233 --> 10:54.933
IN YOUR ARM EVERY SECOND DAY

10:54.933 --> 10:56.167
DOES SORT OF GIVE THE ARM A BI

10:56.167 --> 10:57.000
OF A BEATING

10:57.000 --> 10:58.800
SO IT'S NOT LOOKING TOO PRETTY

10:58.800 --> 11:00.767
THESE DAYS

11:00.767 --> 11:01.767
>> BUT THERE'S ANOTHER COST.

11:01.767 --> 11:08.000
FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS, MOR

11:08.000 --> 11:10.500
THAN 3,800 DAYS AND NIGHTS, HE'S

11:10.500 --> 11:11.867
KEPT HIS CELL PHONE IN REACH

11:11.867 --> 11:13.833
HOPING FOR A CALL TO RUSH TO THE

11:13.833 --> 11:15.400
HOSPITAL BECAUSE A COMPATIBL

11:15.400 --> 11:16.367
KIDNEY HAS BEEN FOUND.

11:16.367 --> 11:18.167
BUT WHEN WE TALKED TO HIM IN

11:18.167 --> 11:19.833
FEBRUARY, THE CALL STILL HADN'

11:19.833 --> 11:20.700
COME

11:20.700 --> 11:23.300
THE UNCERTAINTY IS HARD ON HIM

11:23.300 --> 11:24.800
AND HIS TWO YOUNG SONS, AND HE

11:24.800 --> 11:26.667
SAYS IT'S ONE REASON HIS

11:26.667 --> 11:28.100
MARRIAGE FOUNDERED

11:28.100 --> 11:30.233
>> LIVING WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS A

11:30.233 --> 11:33.200
CHRONIC ILLNESS, IT'S ALMOST A

11:33.200 --> 11:34.567
DIFFICULT AS LIVING WITH A

11:34.567 --> 11:35.767
CHRONIC ILLNESS.

11:35.767 --> 11:37.200
GIVEN THE FACT THAT IT IMPACTS

11:37.200 --> 11:39.333
EVERY DAY, IT WEIGHED HEAVILY ON

11:39.333 --> 11:40.767
THE MARRIAGE AND VERY MUCH

11:40.767 --> 11:41.833
CHANGED WHO WE WERE AS PEOPL

11:41.833 --> 11:43.667
OVER THE TEN-YEAR PERIOD,

11:43.667 --> 11:45.367
THINK.

11:45.367 --> 11:47.933
>> DAMIAN'S STORY IS TYPICAL O

11:47.933 --> 11:48.900
THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES AND

11:48.900 --> 11:51.167
AUSTRALIA SEEKING ORGA

11:51.167 --> 11:51.267
TRANSPLANTS.

11:51.267 --> 11:53.067
IN AUSTRALIA, THE AVERAGE WAIT

11:53.067 --> 11:55.367
FOR A KIDNEY IS FOUR YEARS

11:55.367 --> 11:56.900
IN AMERICA, IT'S THREE TO FIVE

11:56.900 --> 11:59.100
YEARS, DEPENDING ON BLOOD TYPE

11:59.100 --> 12:02.700
BUT NOW A NEW AUSTRALIAN

12:02.700 --> 12:03.967
INITIATIVE HAS RAISED TH

12:03.967 --> 12:05.400
TRANSPLANTATION RATES HERE T

12:05.400 --> 12:07.567
THE HIGHEST ELF LEVEL IN A

12:07.567 --> 12:08.567
QUARTER CENTURY.

12:08.567 --> 12:11.067
>> THE KEY THING WE'VE DONE,

12:11.067 --> 12:13.400
WEAVE PICKED BEST PRACTICE FRO

12:13.400 --> 12:13.667
AROUND THE GLOBE

INCREASE COMMUNITY AWARENESS

12:29.933 --> 12:30.733
ACROSS AUSTRALIA

12:30.733 --> 12:32.533

VERY IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT

WITH YOUR FAMILY

12:40.167 --> 12:41.300
THAT THEY CAN GIVE SOMEONE THE

12:41.300 --> 12:44.267
SECOND CHANCE THAT I GOT

12:44.267 --> 12:46.833
BECAUSE GIVING THE GIFT OF LIF

12:46.833 --> 12:48.833
IS THE GREATEST GIFT

12:48.833 --> 12:49.900
>> THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS

OFFERED SPECIALIZED NEW TRAINING

TO SOME 600 HEALTH

12:53.333 --> 12:53.800
PROFESSIONALS, THEY HAVE THE

12:53.800 --> 12:54.900
DIFFICULT ROLE OF TALKING TO

TRANSPLANTS.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.200
A SOPHISTICATED COMPUTER IS USED

13:11.200 --> 13:12.967
TO IDENTIFY MATCHES BETWEEN SETS

13:12.967 --> 13:16.467
OF WOULD-BE DONORS AND WOULD-B

13:16.467 --> 13:17.767
RECIPIENTS, AND INSTITUTED PAI

OPERATIONS AND THEY WERE QUITE

13:55.567 --> 13:55.900
HARD

13:55.900 --> 13:57.333
TO SEE THE SUFFERING THE WHOLE

13:57.333 --> 13:58.800
TIME, I JUST THOUGHT, IF I CAN

13:58.800 --> 14:00.600

HOW ARE YOU GOING WITH THE PAIN?

14:20.800 --> 14:22.667
THAT I'M USING SICK PAY THAT I

14:22.667 --> 14:24.867
HAD SAVED UP, OR USING SOMETHING

14:24.867 --> 14:26.200
THAT I DON'T HAVE.

14:26.200 --> 14:30.367

14:30.367 --> 14:31.000
WORKING VERY WELL.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.433
THAT WAS GOOD OF YOUR SISTER

14:32.433 --> 14:33.233

14:36.367 --> 14:39.333
PEOPLE TO BE LIVING DONORS

HELPING MORE PEOPLE LIKE SIMON

SOMEBODY SAVED YOUR LIFE

14:44.100 --> 14:46.100
I OWE THEM MY LIFE, REALLY

14:46.100 --> 14:48.033
>> WHILE LIVING DONORS ARE

14:48.033 --> 14:49.533
IMPORTANT, SOME ORGANS CAN ONL

14:49.533 --> 14:52.233
COME FROM DECEASED DONORS, WHO

14:52.233 --> 14:54.100
JUST REGISTER THEIR CONSENT, BUT

14:54.100 --> 14:55.500
SINCE A POTENTIAL DONOR'

14:55.500 --> 14:57.800
DECISION CAN BE OVERRIDDEN B

14:57.800 --> 14:59.933
DISTRAUGHT RELATIVES, THEY SAY

14:59.933 --> 15:01.267
TRAINING STAFF FOR CONVERSATIONS

15:01.267 --> 15:03.333
WITH GRIEVING FAMILIES IS KEY.

15:03.333 --> 15:05.300
>> ORGAN DONATION IS A

15:05.300 --> 15:07.667
INCREDIBLY RARE EVENT, LESS THAN

15:07.667 --> 15:10.133
1% OF PEOPLE WHO DIE I

15:10.133 --> 15:12.000
HOSPITALS ARE POTENTIAL ORGA

15:12.000 --> 15:13.200
DONORS IN AUSTRALIA.

15:13.200 --> 15:16.733
IT'S A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE.

15:16.733 --> 15:20.533
AND WE NEED THE CIRCUMSTANCE

15:20.533 --> 15:21.067
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT

15:21.067 --> 15:24.100
>> ALL THIS THINKING AND

15:24.100 --> 15:26.667
PLANNING HAS CONTRIBUTED TO

15:26.667 --> 15:27.933
60% LEAP IN THE NUMBER OF DONORS

15:27.933 --> 15:30.233
IN AUSTRALIA IN THE PAST FOU

15:30.233 --> 15:30.733
YEARS.

15:32.900 --> 15:34.733
>> WE'RE NOT RESTING ON OU

15:34.733 --> 15:38.133
LAURELS, BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE

15:38.133 --> 15:40.233
CAN STILL CONTINUE TO CHANGE THE

15:40.233 --> 15:43.100
WAY IN WHICH WE MANAGE OUR

15:43.100 --> 15:44.367
DONATION PRACTICE IN AUSTRALIA

15:44.367 --> 15:46.033
AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE MORE

15:46.033 --> 15:47.933
TRANSPLANTS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

15:47.933 --> 15:49.000
WAITING.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.333

BUSIER

16:11.567 --> 16:14.200
YOU SAW THE CLINIC TODAY

16:14.200 --> 16:14.567
IT WAS CHAOS

16:14.567 --> 16:15.400
THAT'S GREAT

16:15.400 --> 16:17.000
LOVE CHAOS

16:17.000 --> 16:18.733
ORGANIZED CHAOS.

16:18.733 --> 16:18.867
>> IF YOU WERE TO GIVE AUSTRALIA

16:18.867 --> 16:21.200
A BADGE, WHAT WOULD YOU GIVE IT?

16:21.200 --> 16:22.667
>> I THINK WE HAVE HAD THE BADGE
