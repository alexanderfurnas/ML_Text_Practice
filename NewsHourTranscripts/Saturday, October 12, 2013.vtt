POSITION

02:57.233 --> 02:58.267
EARLIER THIS WEEK THERE WASN'T

02:58.267 --> 02:59.567
MOVEMENT AT ALL.

02:59.567 --> 03:01.567
IT SEEMS TO BE BOTH SIDES WERE

03:01.567 --> 03:04.333
VERY MUCH ENTRENCHED IN THEI

03:04.333 --> 03:04.467
POSITIONS, THAT THEY DID NOT

03:04.467 --> 03:05.967
WANT TO NEGOTIATE UNLESS THE

03:05.967 --> 03:07.800
OTHER SIDE WERE WILLING TO MAK

03:07.800 --> 03:08.367
CONCESSIONS.

03:08.367 --> 03:08.733
DEMOCRATS RIGHT NOW FEEL LIK

03:08.733 --> 03:11.333
THEY HAVE ALL THE LEVERAGE

03:11.333 --> 03:12.433
THERE WAS THAT NBC/"WALL STREE

03:12.433 --> 03:13.367
JOURNAL" POLL THAT SHOWE

03:13.367 --> 03:14.167
TERRIBLE NUMBERS FOR

03:14.167 --> 03:15.867
REPUBLICANS.

03:15.867 --> 03:18.700
THE DEMOCRATS ARE MOVING FORWARD

03:18.700 --> 03:19.433
WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT TH

03:19.433 --> 03:19.933
REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

03:19.933 --> 03:22.400
GIVE MORE IN THIS.

03:22.400 --> 03:23.033
AT THIS POINT, THEY FEEL LIK

03:23.033 --> 03:25.200
THE REPUBLICANS HAVE KEPT TH

03:25.200 --> 03:27.867
GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN AND ARE

03:27.867 --> 03:29.600
BASICALLY STEERING CONGRES

03:29.600 --> 03:30.900
TOWARDS THIS DEBT LIMIT DEADLINE

03:30.900 --> 03:32.400
WITH NO REAL WAY OUT

03:32.400 --> 03:34.367
>> IF THE SENATE REPUBLICANS

03:34.367 --> 03:35.567
MAKE MORE MODERATE CONCESSIONS

03:35.567 --> 03:40.133
OR APPROACHES TO THE STRAGS, HOW

03:40.133 --> 03:41.700
LIKELY IS IT THAT THE HOUS

03:41.700 --> 03:42.733
REPUBLICANS WILL GO ALONG WITH

03:42.733 --> 03:42.933
IT

03:42.933 --> 03:43.300
>> I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGES

03:43.300 --> 03:45.767
QUESTION RIGHT NOW

03:45.767 --> 03:47.667
I THINK WHAT MITCH McCONNELL I

03:47.667 --> 03:48.900
ABLE TO DO AND WHAT SENATE

03:48.900 --> 03:50.267
REPUBLICANS ARE ABLE TO DO MIGHT

03:50.267 --> 03:53.267
NOT BE THE SAME AS WHAT JOHN

03:53.267 --> 03:53.733
BOEHNER IS ABLE TO DO WITH HIS

03:53.733 --> 03:56.000
CAUCUS

03:56.000 --> 03:58.500
AT THE END OF THE DAY, SENAT

03:58.500 --> 03:59.967
REPUBLICANS AND SENATE DEMOCRATS

03:59.967 --> 04:01.100
DON'T COME TO AN AGREEMENT AND

04:01.100 --> 04:02.767
SEND IT UP TO THE HOUSE, IT WILL

04:02.767 --> 04:04.333
BE UP TO JOHN BOEHNER TO FIN

04:04.333 --> 04:05.667
ONLY A HANDFUL OF REPUBLICAN

04:05.667 --> 04:07.067
BECAUSE A MAJORITY OF HOUS

04:07.067 --> 04:08.067
DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT WILL BE

04:08.067 --> 04:08.267
THERE.

04:08.267 --> 04:09.533
ONE OF THE BIGGER QUESTIONS TO

04:09.533 --> 04:11.500
DATE IS HOW WILLING IS JOH

04:11.500 --> 04:13.867
BOEHNER TO MOVE A BILL THAT HE

04:13.867 --> 04:14.633
KNOWS WON'T HAVE THE SUPPORT O

04:14.633 --> 04:17.133
THE MAJORITY OF HIS CAUCUS

04:17.133 --> 04:18.967
TO DATE, IT'S BEEN UNWILLING

04:18.967 --> 04:20.267
BUT I THINK REPUBLICANS,

04:20.267 --> 04:21.233
PARTICULARLY REPUBLICANS I

04:21.233 --> 04:22.700
LEADERSHIP, HAVE BEEN HEARIN

04:22.700 --> 04:23.967
FROM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY.

04:23.967 --> 04:25.367
THEY'VE BEEN HEARING FROM WALL

04:25.367 --> 04:28.300
STREET, DONORS, PEOPLE WHO ARE

04:28.300 --> 04:30.000
TYPICALLY THE BREAD-AND-BUTTER

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
REPUBLICAN SUPPORTERS WHO AR

04:32.000 --> 04:35.700
QUESTIONING WHY THIS PARTY WOULD

04:35.700 --> 04:38.100
LET A EXTREME FACTION OF THEIR

04:38.100 --> 04:40.133
GROUP BASICALLY DECIDE THAT THEY

04:40.133 --> 04:41.467
COULD TAKE THIS DEBT LIMIT

04:41.467 --> 04:43.433
ARGUMENT TO THE BRINK AGAIN WHEN

04:43.433 --> 04:44.500
IT COULD HAVE SERIOUS ECONOMIC

04:44.500 --> 04:45.067
CONSEQUENCES

04:45.067 --> 04:47.300
>> WHAT HAPPENS TO THE TEA PARTY

04:47.300 --> 04:48.700
OR SENATOR TED CRUZ HAS BECOME

04:48.700 --> 04:49.267
ONE OF THE FACES OF THEI

04:49.267 --> 04:54.600
IDEOLOGY IN THIS ALL

04:54.600 --> 04:57.133
>> WELL, CRUZ HAS TAKEN

04:57.133 --> 04:58.533
DISTINCT APPROACH TO PROMOTING

04:58.533 --> 04:59.200
HIS AGENDA

04:59.200 --> 05:00.933
IF YOU LOOK AT SOMEONE LIK

05:00.933 --> 05:03.133
SENATOR RAND PAUL, FOR EXAMPLE

05:03.133 --> 05:04.900
WHO ALSO HAS A LOT OF TEA PART

05:04.900 --> 05:06.433
SUPPORT, HE'S BEEN MUCH MORE

05:06.433 --> 05:07.933
WILLING TO PLAY NICE WITH HI

05:07.933 --> 05:08.067
COLLEAGUES

05:08.067 --> 05:09.133
TO DEAL WITH MITCH McCONNELL, TO

05:09.133 --> 05:13.000
HAVE VOTES ON HIS MEASURES BUT

05:13.000 --> 05:14.967
NOT TO SIGN THE SUCCESS OF THOSE

05:14.967 --> 05:17.867
VOTES AS A BINARY WIN OR LOSE.

05:17.867 --> 05:18.400
AS LONG AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

05:18.400 --> 05:22.267
HIS POLICY ITEMS, HE'S HAPPY

05:22.267 --> 05:25.200
TED CRUZ IS NOT THAT WAY

05:25.200 --> 05:26.433
HE'S MADE THE FIGHT A LOT MORE

05:26.433 --> 05:29.067
DIFFICULT ABOUT REPUBLICANS BY

05:29.067 --> 05:30.767
MAKING IT ABOUT A HEALTH CAR

05:30.767 --> 05:32.533
LAW THERE WAS NO WAY TO REPEAL

05:32.533 --> 05:33.567
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE I

05:33.567 --> 05:35.200
FOR HIM IN THE REPUBLICA

05:35.200 --> 05:37.133
CONFERENCE OVER THE NEXT FEW

05:37.133 --> 05:38.500
YEARS IF REPUBLICANS ARE ABLE TO

05:38.500 --> 05:39.600
OPEN WITH DEMOCRATS TO OPEN UP

05:39.600 --> 05:43.233
THE.

05:43.233 --> 05:44.467
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S ALL THA

05:44.467 --> 05:44.800
INTERESTED IN DEALING WITH HIS

05:44.800 --> 05:47.033
COLLEAGUES

05:47.033 --> 05:48.267
HE SAID YESTERDAY THAT HE WENT

05:48.267 --> 05:49.267
OVER THE HEAD OF LEADERSHIP AN

05:49.267 --> 05:50.300
DEALT DIRECTLY WITH THE AMERICAN

05:50.300 --> 05:51.567
PEOPLE

05:51.567 --> 05:51.800
HE'LL ALWAYS HAVE GRASSROOTS

05:51.800 --> 05:54.100
SUPPORT.

05:54.100 --> 05:54.800
BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S

05:54.800 --> 05:56.900
ENOUGH TO EITHER ADVANCE ANY

05:56.900 --> 05:58.133
SORT OF NATIONAL RUN BECAUSE YOU

05:58.133 --> 05:59.933
NEED AN INFRASTRUCTURE I

05:59.933 --> 06:01.067
FUND-RAISING AND IT'S CERTAINL

06:01.067 --> 06:03.033
NOT ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH YOUR OWN

06:03.033 --> 06:04.433
COLLEAGUES TO GET ANYTHING DON

06:04.433 --> 06:05.167
LEGISLATIVELY.

06:05.167 --> 06:07.867
>> SENATOR REID HAS WARNED THE

06:07.867 --> 06:08.433
MARKETS WILL REACT NEGATIVEL

06:08.433 --> 06:10.900
MONDAY MORNING

06:10.900 --> 06:12.033
ANY REAL CHANCE THAT THERE I

06:12.033 --> 06:13.733
NOT A DEAL DONE BEFORE THE DEB

06:13.733 --> 06:15.867
LIMIT CLOCK RUNS OUT

06:15.867 --> 06:17.467
>> ANOTHER THING YOU HAVE TO

06:17.467 --> 06:20.133
REMEMBER IS THAT GIVEN SENAT

06:20.133 --> 06:21.567
PROCEDURE, IF ANY ONE SENATO

06:21.567 --> 06:23.867
OBJECTS, YOU COULD HAVE TO EAT

06:23.867 --> 06:24.867
UP TO 30 HOURS AFTER ORIGINA

06:24.867 --> 06:26.800
PROCEDURAL MOTION.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.367
SO ONE LIKE TED CRUZ COULD I

06:28.367 --> 06:29.067
FACT STEP IN AND TRY TO MAKE

06:29.067 --> 06:31.133
THAT CLOCK RUN OUT

06:31.133 --> 06:32.800
SO THERE IS SOME PRESSURE TO TRY

06:32.800 --> 06:35.433
TO GET SOMETHING EITHER TODAY OR

06:35.433 --> 06:35.700
TOMORROW

06:35.700 --> 06:37.533
BUT IF YOU DON'T WASTE THA

06:37.533 --> 06:38.867
TIME, EVEN IF THERE WERE A

06:38.867 --> 06:39.633
AGREEMENT TODAY, YOU WOULDN'

06:39.633 --> 06:42.033
SEE A VOTE UNTIL MONDAY MORNING.

06:42.033 --> 06:43.767
THEN IT WILL BE UP TO THE HOUS

06:43.767 --> 06:45.300
TO TAKE THOSE TWO, THREE DAY

06:45.300 --> 06:46.900
AND SEE IF THEY CAN PASS

06:46.900 --> 06:47.233
SOMETHING.

06:47.233 --> 06:48.133
BUT I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOIN

06:48.133 --> 06:48.567
TO HAVE MUCH OF A CHOICE TO SEND

06:48.567 --> 06:50.500
A BILL BACK.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.133
THEY HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO PAS

06:52.133 --> 06:53.700
WHATEVER THE SENATE SENDS THEM

06:53.700 --> 06:54.133
>> MEREDITH, THANKS SO MUCH.

06:54.133 --> 06:56.433
>> THANK YOU

06:56.433 --> 06:58.233
>>> OVERSEAS, NEW DETAILS AR

06:58.233 --> 06:59.533
EMERGING ABOUT THE DEATHS OF

06:59.533 --> 07:01.833
DOZENS OF MIGRANTS WHO DROWNED

07:01.833 --> 07:03.500
YESTERDAY AFTER THEIR BOAT

OUTSIDE OF IRAN.

19:56.800 --> 19:59.367
IN THE 1950s, '60s AND '70s,

19:59.367 --> 20:01.567
MODERN ART IN IRAN WAS THRIVING.

20:01.567 --> 20:04.400
IT COMBINED PERSIAN ARTISTIC

20:18.933 --> 20:20.367
WAS MODERNIZING.

20:20.367 --> 20:23.033
SO THE ARTISTS WERE ALSO

20:23.033 --> 20:24.533
MODERNIZING THEIR WORK IN MANY

20:24.533 --> 20:25.633
DIFFERENT WAYS

20:25.633 --> 20:28.400

20:46.867 --> 20:48.133
PERIOD WHEN ACTUALLY IRAN AN

20:48.133 --> 20:50.000

POLITICALLY AND CERTAINL

20:51.600 --> 20:51.867
CULTURALLY

20:51.867 --> 20:55.000

21:06.533 --> 21:08.500
DANGEROUS TO REGIMES

21:12.700 --> 21:16.767
OFTEN THE VOICE OF CRITICALITY

21:16.767 --> 21:20.900
THEY CRITIQUE ISSUES OF POWER.

21:20.900 --> 21:22.400
THEY CRITIQUE THINGS THEY SE

21:22.400 --> 21:23.567
AROUND THEM.

21:23.567 --> 21:24.867
AND I THINK THAT CAN SOMETIMES

21:24.867 --> 21:26.167
MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THOSE IN

POWER.

23:01.900 --> 23:03.900
SO THE TREATMENT THIS ONE HA

23:03.900 --> 23:05.300
BEEN GIVEN SHOULD TRANSLAT

23:05.300 --> 23:05.800
PERFECTLY INTO A MEDICINE THAT

23:05.800 --> 23:08.733
HUMANS CAN TAKE.

23:08.733 --> 23:10.067
ALZHEIMER'S SETS IN WHEN

23:10.067 --> 23:11.700
MISSHAPEN PROTEINS BUILD UP IN

23:11.700 --> 23:13.900
THE BRAIN.

23:13.900 --> 23:15.000
THE BRAIN SHUTS DOWN ITS OWN

23:15.000 --> 23:16.200
ABILITY TO PRODUCE ANY PROTEIN

23:16.200 --> 23:17.800
AT ALL

23:17.800 --> 23:19.900
BRAIN CELLS WHICH NEED PROTEIN

23:19.900 --> 23:23.067
FOR PROTECTION BEGIN TO DIE OFF.

23:23.067 --> 23:23.933
THIS LEADS TO SYMPTOMS LIK

23:23.933 --> 23:26.400
CONFUSION AND MEMORY LOSS.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.533
RESEARCHERS GAVE MICE THE NE

23:28.533 --> 23:29.900
DRUG WHICH CAN BE TAKEN AS A

23:29.900 --> 23:30.033
PILL

23:30.033 --> 23:30.633
THEY FOUND IT GOT PROTEI

23:30.633 --> 23:33.500
PRODUCTION MOVING AGAIN.

23:33.500 --> 23:34.567
SO WITH PROTECTION BACK IN

23:34.567 --> 23:35.733
PLACE, CELLS SURVIVE AND DISEASE

23:35.733 --> 23:38.567
CAN'T SPREAD

23:38.567 --> 23:40.333
THE TREATMENT CARRIES SOME

23:40.333 --> 23:41.400
SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS WHICH WIL

23:41.400 --> 23:42.567
HAVE TO BE ELIMINATED.

23:42.567 --> 23:43.633
BUT IT COULD BE AVAILABLE AS A

23:43.633 --> 23:45.633
MEDICINE AS SOON AS THAT'S DONE.

23:45.633 --> 23:48.367
>> IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET

23:48.367 --> 23:49.633
DRUGS TO MARKET.

23:49.633 --> 23:51.000
BUT THIS ISN'T YEARS AND YEARS

23:51.000 --> 23:51.400
AWAY

23:51.400 --> 23:53.967
MAYBE FIVE TO TEN YEARS.

23:53.967 --> 23:54.867
>> Reporter: IT'S BEEN DESCRIBED

23:54.867 --> 23:56.767
AS A MILESTONE, A MOMENT I

23:56.767 --> 23:58.900

24:02.400 --> 24:03.133

24:03.133 --> 24:06.533
>> IT IS A LANDMARK BUT TH

24:06.533 --> 24:06.733
BEGINNING OF A LONG JOURNEY, NOT

24:06.733 --> 24:15.900
THE END.
