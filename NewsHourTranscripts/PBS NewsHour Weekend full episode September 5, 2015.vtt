SAID TODAY EVERY ASYLUM SEEKER

01:10.604 --> 01:12.406
ARRIVING IN HER COUNTRY WILL GET

01:12.406 --> 01:14.141
A FAIR HEARING, AND THERE IS NO

01:14.141 --> 01:15.976
CAP ON THE NUMBER GERMANY WILL

01:15.976 --> 01:16.977
ACCEPT.

01:16.977 --> 01:18.512
THE JOURNEY OVER LAND COMES

01:18.512 --> 01:20.314
AFTER PEOPLE TYPICALLY LEAVING

01:54.781 --> 01:55.549
>> Reporter: 2:00 IN THE

01:55.549 --> 01:56.984
MORNING, AND QUITE SUDDENLY

01:56.984 --> 01:58.552
THEIR ORDEAL IN HUNGARY WAS

01:58.552 --> 01:59.653
OVER.

01:59.653 --> 02:00.854
JUST THREE HOURS AFTER THE

02:00.854 --> 02:02.456
HUNGARIAN GOVERNMENT FINALLY

02:02.456 --> 02:04.391
BACKED DOWN, THE BUSES WERE

02:04.391 --> 02:06.093
BEING LOADED.

02:06.093 --> 02:07.327
FOR FIVE DAYS, THEY'D LIVED IN

02:07.327 --> 02:08.996
SQUALOR OUTSIDE BUDAPEST

02:08.996 --> 02:10.097
STATION.

02:10.097 --> 02:11.898
NOW THEY WERE ON THE MOVE AND

02:11.898 --> 02:13.600
THEY WERE HAPPY.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.435
>> I FEEL REALLY AWESOME.

02:15.435 --> 02:17.404
IT'S GREAT, YEAH.

02:17.404 --> 02:19.306
I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT THESE

02:19.306 --> 02:20.140
BUSES ARE GOING TO GO TO

02:20.140 --> 02:21.141
AUSTRIA.

02:21.141 --> 02:25.245
>> GERMANY.

02:25.245 --> 02:26.013
>> Reporter: AND WITH THAT, IT

02:26.013 --> 02:27.247
WAS OFF TO THE AUSTRIAN BORDER

02:27.247 --> 02:29.316
AND BEYOND, A JOURNEY MANY

02:29.316 --> 02:30.917
THOUGHT MIGHT END IN HUNGARY

02:30.917 --> 02:33.153
WILL NOW TAKE THEM TO GERMANY,

02:33.153 --> 02:34.488
WHERE THEY BELIEVE THEY'LL BE

02:34.488 --> 02:35.922
WELCOMED AND GIVEN THE CHANCE OF

02:35.922 --> 02:37.991
A NEW LIFE.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.059
BEHIND THEM, IN THE UNDERGROUND

02:39.059 --> 02:41.428
CONCOURSE THEY CALLED HOME, LAY

02:41.428 --> 02:42.863
THE DETRITUS OF A NOW-

02:42.863 --> 02:44.998
ABANDONED REFUGEE CAMP.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.033
FROM BESIDE THE MOTORWAY, THE

02:46.033 --> 02:47.467
WEARY MARCHERS WHO'D SET OFF

02:47.467 --> 02:49.336
ON FOOT MANY PUNISHING HOURS

02:49.336 --> 02:51.171
EARLIER WERE PICKED UP FROM

02:51.171 --> 02:52.572
WHERE THEY SLEPT.

02:52.572 --> 02:55.042
THEY'D HAVE TO WALK NO LONGER,

02:55.042 --> 02:56.176
BUT THEIR DECISION TO GO ON

02:56.176 --> 02:57.844
ALONE HAD CLEARLY PUSHED THE

02:57.844 --> 03:00.680
AUTHORITIES INTO BACKING DOWN.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.482
AND NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON AS

03:02.482 --> 03:05.886
TORRENTIAL RAIN SWEPT THROUGH.

03:05.886 --> 03:06.887
BY EARLY MORNING, THEY WERE

03:06.887 --> 03:08.989
ACROSS THE BORDER AND WAITING

03:08.989 --> 03:10.524
PATIENTLY FOR A TRAIN THAT WOULD

03:10.524 --> 03:12.726
TAKE THEM WEST OR NORTH.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.027
THEY DIDN'T CARE WHICH, AS LONG

03:14.027 --> 03:16.296
AS IT WAS TO GERMANY.

03:16.296 --> 03:17.097
THE INHABITANTS OF THE BORDER

03:17.097 --> 03:18.598
TOWN OF NICKELSDORF HAD LAID OUT

03:18.598 --> 03:20.333
FOOD, DRINK, EVEN A SELECTION OF

03:20.333 --> 03:22.602
SECONDHAND CLOTHING.

03:22.602 --> 03:24.805
IN SMALL, WELL-ORGANIZED GROUPS,

03:24.805 --> 03:26.339
FAMILIES FIRST, THEY WERE

03:26.339 --> 03:28.208
ALLOWED ON TO A TRAIN, THIS ONE

03:28.208 --> 03:30.343
TO VIENNA.

03:30.343 --> 03:31.845
IN THEIR EXCITEMENT, SOME RAN TO

03:31.845 --> 03:33.580
THE CARRIAGES, ALTHOUGH, IN

03:33.580 --> 03:35.982
TRUTH, THERE WAS LITTLE NEED.

03:35.982 --> 03:36.550
>> THANK YOU.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.319
VERY, VERY HAPPY.

03:39.319 --> 03:40.087
>> Reporter: BACK IN HUNGARY,

03:40.087 --> 03:41.788
THERE ARE MANY THOUSANDS MORE

03:41.788 --> 03:43.657
STILL WAITING TO COME.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.025
100 BUSES HAVE BEEN PROMISED.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.294
THAT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH.

03:47.294 --> 03:48.328
THIS MORNING, NOT PREPARED TO

03:48.328 --> 03:50.030
WAIT, ANOTHER GROUP SET OFF TO

03:50.030 --> 03:51.798
WALK TO THE BORDER, THOUGH THIS

03:51.798 --> 03:53.400
TIME THEY MAY NOT HAVE TO TRUDGE

03:53.400 --> 03:55.268
AS FAR.

03:55.268 --> 03:58.105
IN MUNICH, THE FIRST WAVE OF

03:58.105 --> 04:00.874
THIS EXODUS STEPPED ON TO GERMAN

04:00.874 --> 04:03.310
SOIL WITH A WAVE AND A SMILE.

04:03.310 --> 04:05.212
AND NO WONDER-- A JOURNEY THAT

04:05.212 --> 04:07.314
FREQUENTLY STARTED IN SYRIA TOOK

04:07.314 --> 04:09.683
IN TURKEY, GREECE, MACEDONIA,

04:09.683 --> 04:13.186
SERBIA, HUNGARY, AUSTRIA, NOW AT

04:13.186 --> 04:14.688
AN END.

04:14.688 --> 04:15.489
>> Stewart: NEWSHOUR SPECIAL

04:15.489 --> 04:17.057
CORRESPONDENT MALCOLM BRABANT IS

04:17.057 --> 04:18.425
COVERING THE SURGE OF MIGRANTS

04:18.425 --> 04:20.160
INTO NORTHERN EUROPE AND HOW

04:20.160 --> 04:21.094
NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES ARE

04:21.094 --> 04:22.896
TREATING THE CRISIS DIFFERENTLY.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.898
THIS WEEK, A SYRIAN REFUGEE NOW

04:24.898 --> 04:26.666
IN SWEDEN TOLD HIM ABOUT HIS

04:26.666 --> 04:28.301
JOURNEY ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN

04:28.301 --> 04:30.904
SEA, LEAVING HIS FAMILY BEHIND.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.405
>> HOW CAN I BRING MY CHILDREN

04:32.405 --> 04:34.007
TO HERE?

04:34.007 --> 04:36.443
I CAN'T MAKE... PUT HIM IN THIS

04:36.443 --> 04:37.911
BOAT, DANGEROUS BOAT.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.479
I CAN'T DO THAT.

04:39.479 --> 04:41.114
FOR ME, MAYBE IT'S OKAY.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.883
BUT FOR MY CHILDREN, IT'S

04:42.883 --> 04:43.783
IMPOSSIBLE.

04:43.783 --> 04:44.518
>> Stewart: MALCOLM BRABANT

04:44.518 --> 04:46.052
JOINS ME NOW VIA SKYPE FROM

04:46.052 --> 04:47.287
COPENHAGEN, DENMARK.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.089
MALCOLM, IN TIMES OF DANGER, THE

04:49.089 --> 04:50.524
CONVENTIONAL WISDOM IS TO GET

04:50.524 --> 04:52.292
THE CHILDREN OUT, GET THEM TO A

04:52.292 --> 04:53.660
SAFER PLACE.

04:53.660 --> 04:54.795
BUT FROM YOUR REPORTING, THE

04:54.795 --> 04:56.296
OPPOSITE SEEMS TRUE IN THIS

04:56.296 --> 04:57.063
SITUATION.

04:57.063 --> 04:58.198
WHY IS THAT?

04:58.198 --> 04:58.932
>> Reporter: WELL, I THINK

04:58.932 --> 05:00.433
THAT PARENTS ARE GENUINELY

05:00.433 --> 05:02.068
TERRIFIED OF THE DANGERS IN

05:02.068 --> 05:04.004
THE MEDITERRANEAN.

05:04.004 --> 05:06.373
AS HE WAS SAYING, IT'S

05:06.373 --> 05:08.308
ABSOLUTELY A COMPLETE LOTTERY.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.109
IT'S RUSSIAN ROULETTE.

05:09.109 --> 05:10.043
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT SORT OF

05:10.043 --> 05:11.711
VESSEL YOU'RE GETTING INTO.

05:11.711 --> 05:12.512
THERE HAVE BEEN HORRENDOUS

05:12.512 --> 05:14.781
STORIES OF TRAFFICKERS BEATING

05:14.781 --> 05:16.383
PEOPLE DOWN INTO THE HOLDS OF

05:16.383 --> 05:18.785
BOATS, AND IT JUST TAKES A SMALL

05:18.785 --> 05:20.187
SHIFT IN THE BALANCE OF A BOAT

05:20.187 --> 05:21.421
WITH PEOPLE RUSHING TO ONE SIDE

05:21.421 --> 05:22.856
OR THE OTHER FOR IT TO TIP OVER

05:22.856 --> 05:24.324
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL SO HEAVILY

05:24.324 --> 05:25.058
OVERCROWDED.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.326
SO, THERE ARE MANY PARENTS

05:26.326 --> 05:28.461
TAKING THE DECISION THAT IT'S

05:28.461 --> 05:30.363
NOT WORTH RISKING THEIR

05:30.363 --> 05:32.199
CHILDREN'S LIVES, AND THEY'RE

05:32.199 --> 05:33.333
LEAVING THEM BEHIND AND THEY'RE

05:33.333 --> 05:35.468
COMING TO COUNTRIES WHERE'S THEY

05:35.468 --> 05:36.870
HOPE THERE WILL BE A GOOD FAMILY

05:36.870 --> 05:38.672
REUNIFICATION POLICY, AS

05:38.672 --> 05:39.506
SWEDEN HAS.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.208
BUT MR. AL HABASH, FOR EXAMPLE,

05:41.208 --> 05:42.676
HAS BEEN WAITING FOR TEN MONTHS.

05:42.676 --> 05:43.476
>> Stewart: THE WAR IN SYRIA

05:43.476 --> 05:45.378
HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS, BUT

05:45.378 --> 05:46.880
WHAT HAS BEEN THE CATALYST FOR

05:46.880 --> 05:50.817
ALL THESE PEOPLE LEAVING NOW?

05:50.817 --> 05:52.052
>> I THINK THERE ARE TWO THINGS,

05:52.052 --> 05:54.020
AS FAR AS WE CAN SEE, REALLY.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.455
RIGHT NOW, IT'S THE END OF THE

05:55.455 --> 05:57.657
SUMMER, AND THE MEDITERRANEAN

05:57.657 --> 05:58.892
SUDDENLY CHANGES FROM BEING A

05:58.892 --> 06:00.060
FAIRLY BENEVOLENT SEA AS IT HAS

06:00.060 --> 06:01.428
BEEN IN THE PAST THREE MONTHS

06:01.428 --> 06:02.862
INTO SOMETHING THAT IS VERY

06:02.862 --> 06:04.631
PERILOUS INDEED.

06:04.631 --> 06:06.833
THERE'S A WIND THAT BLOWS IN

06:06.833 --> 06:09.803
SEPTEMBER THAT CREATES WINDS OF

06:09.803 --> 06:12.005
FORCE 8-10, AND IT'S EXTREMELY

06:12.005 --> 06:12.772
DANGEROUS.

06:12.772 --> 06:13.673
EVEN JUST FOR THE THREE MILES

06:13.673 --> 06:15.475
THAT IT TAKES YOU TO GET ACROSS

06:15.475 --> 06:16.910
FROM THE TURKISH COAST TO AN

06:16.910 --> 06:17.844
ISLAND LIKE LESBOS, FOR

06:17.844 --> 06:19.145
EXAMPLE, THE WAVES CAN BE

06:19.145 --> 06:21.214
INCREDIBLY HIGH, SO BAD THAT

06:21.214 --> 06:23.216
GREEK FERRIES WON'T SAIL IN THIS

06:23.216 --> 06:24.150
KIND OF WEATHER.

06:24.150 --> 06:25.585
THERE IS A RUSH TO GET ACROSS

06:25.585 --> 06:27.220
BEFORE THE WEATHER CHANGES.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.989
BUT, ALSO, PEOPLE I HAVE BEEN

06:28.989 --> 06:30.290
SPEAKING TO ON LESBOS, ONE OF

06:30.290 --> 06:33.260
THE MAIN ISLANDS THAT THE PEOPLE

06:33.260 --> 06:34.527
COME TO IN GREECE, THEY'RE

06:34.527 --> 06:35.862
SAYING WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM

06:35.862 --> 06:37.163
THE SYRIANS IS THAT THE

06:37.163 --> 06:38.398
SITUATION INSIDE DAMASCUS, THE

06:38.398 --> 06:40.300
SYRIAN CAPITAL, IS BECOMING VERY

06:40.300 --> 06:41.968
GRAVE, INDEED, AND THERE IS AN

06:41.968 --> 06:42.669
IMPERATIVE TO GET OUT.

06:42.669 --> 06:44.437
MAYBE THERE IS SOMETHING

06:44.437 --> 06:45.538
HAPPENING ON THE VARIOUS

06:45.538 --> 06:47.073
WARFRONTS THERE THAT IS DRIVING

06:47.073 --> 06:48.608
PEOPLE OUT.

06:48.608 --> 06:51.478
ALL OF THE REFUGEES THAT YOU

06:51.478 --> 06:53.513
TALK TO ON THE VARIOUS STAGES OF

06:53.513 --> 06:54.781
THE ROUTE, THEY'RE ALL IN TOUCH

06:54.781 --> 06:56.416
WITH EACH OTHER.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.584
THEY KNOW WHICH PLACES ARE-- YOU

06:57.584 --> 06:59.352
KNOW, THE WAYS TO GO.

06:59.352 --> 07:00.153
THEY'RE GETTING MESSAGES

07:00.153 --> 07:02.022
BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS, AND, YOU

07:02.022 --> 07:03.256
KNOW, THEY MUST BE SORT OF ABLE

07:03.256 --> 07:04.524
TO READ THE RUNES TO SEE EUROPE

07:04.524 --> 07:07.160
IS WAVERING AT THE MOMENT.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.695
COUNTRIES DON'T WANT TO BE ON

07:08.695 --> 07:10.063
THE WRONG SIDE OF HISTORY

07:10.063 --> 07:11.331
BECAUSE THIS IS A VERY EMOTIONAL

07:11.331 --> 07:12.966
TIME FOR PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY

07:12.966 --> 07:14.501
AFTER THE PUBLICATION OF THAT

07:14.501 --> 07:16.403
TERRIBLE PICTURE OF THE LITTLE

07:16.403 --> 07:19.039
BOY WHO DROWNED IN BODRUM.

07:19.039 --> 07:19.839
>> Stewart: FROM YOUR

07:19.839 --> 07:20.774
REPORTING-- YOU'VE TALKED TO

07:20.774 --> 07:21.941
FOLKS WHO WERE BUSINESSMEN-- AND

07:21.941 --> 07:22.976
FROM OTHER STORIES THAT I'VE

07:22.976 --> 07:24.077
READ, THERE SEEMS TO BE A

07:24.077 --> 07:25.512
MIDDLE-CLASS AND UPPER-MIDDLE-

07:25.512 --> 07:27.814
CLASS MOVEMENT HERE OF PEOPLE

07:27.814 --> 07:29.749
DECIDING TO FINALLY LEAVE.

07:29.749 --> 07:31.184
WHY ARE THEY FINALLY DECIDING TO

07:31.184 --> 07:32.319
LEAVE?

07:32.319 --> 07:33.753
WHY DID THEY STAY IN PLACE?

07:33.753 --> 07:34.754
AND, TWO, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN

07:34.754 --> 07:36.222
FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE MONEY

07:36.222 --> 07:38.758
TO GET OUT?

07:38.758 --> 07:39.759
>> THE ONE THING THAT IS REALLY

07:39.759 --> 07:40.694
QUITE NOTICEABLE, ACTUALLY, IS

07:40.694 --> 07:42.495
THAT ON THE ROAD, THE PEOPLE WHO

07:42.495 --> 07:43.496
DO SEEM TO HAVE MONEY ARE

07:43.496 --> 07:44.698
SYRIANS.

07:44.698 --> 07:45.699
THEY ALL TALK ABOUT HAVING A

07:45.699 --> 07:47.834
FAIRLY PROSPEROUS LIFESTYLE.

07:47.834 --> 07:49.636
BUT IF YOU GO ON TO SOCIAL MEDIA

07:49.636 --> 07:52.172
AND LOOK AT PEOPLE FROM HUMAN

07:52.172 --> 07:53.506
RIGHTS WATCH, FOR EXAMPLE,

07:53.506 --> 07:54.274
THEY'VE BEEN POSTING PICTURES

07:54.274 --> 07:56.476
SAYING IF YOU WONDER WHY IT IS

07:56.476 --> 07:57.877
THAT PEOPLE ARE LEAVING NOW,

07:57.877 --> 07:59.179
HAVE A LOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH.

07:59.179 --> 07:59.979
AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS

07:59.979 --> 08:01.915
POSTING PICTURES OF PLACES LIKE

08:01.915 --> 08:03.717
KOBANE, THE PLACE ON THE

08:03.717 --> 08:06.586
TURKISH-SYRIAN BORDER WHERE

08:06.586 --> 08:07.887
THERE WAS A MASSIVE BATTLE

08:07.887 --> 08:10.090
BETWEEN ISIS AND THE KURDS, AND

08:10.090 --> 08:10.824
THE PLACE IS COMPLETELY

08:10.824 --> 08:11.858
FLATTENED.

08:11.858 --> 08:12.759
THEY'RE ALSO POSTING PICTURES OF

08:12.759 --> 08:14.894
HOMS, WHICH IS SYRIA'S THIRD

08:14.894 --> 08:16.096
CITY, AND THE PLACE IS

08:16.096 --> 08:17.597
ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED.

08:17.597 --> 08:18.465
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THERE'S

08:18.465 --> 08:19.666
NOTHING LEFT STANDING.

08:19.666 --> 08:20.633
AND SO, HOW PEOPLE CAN STAY

08:20.633 --> 08:23.136
THERE IS BEYOND BELIEF.

08:23.136 --> 08:24.003
SOME OF THE COOLER HEADS IN

08:24.003 --> 08:26.172
EUROPE WOULD SAY, WELL, HANG ON

08:26.172 --> 08:26.973
A MINUTE.

08:26.973 --> 08:28.508
THOSE PEOPLE COMING FROM SYRIA,

08:28.508 --> 08:29.342
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT COMING

08:29.342 --> 08:30.510
DIRECTLY FROM THE WAR.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.911
ONCE THEY GOT OUT OF THE COUNTRY

08:31.911 --> 08:32.946
THEY'VE BEEN IN SAFER PLACES

08:32.946 --> 08:34.681
LIKE IN TURKEY, LIKE IN JORDAN,

08:34.681 --> 08:36.082
SO THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY RUNNING

08:36.082 --> 08:37.183
AWAY FROM WAR.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.284
THEY WANT TO GET AWAY FROM THAT

08:38.284 --> 08:39.119
PARTICULAR AREA.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.053
BUT THEN YOU TALK TO PEOPLE IN

08:40.053 --> 08:42.088
THE REFUGEE AGENCIES AND OTHERS

08:42.088 --> 08:43.523
WHO HAVE BEEN TO THAT AREA AND

08:43.523 --> 08:45.658
SAY YOU JUST CANNOT STAY IN

08:45.658 --> 08:47.427
THESE TERRIBLE CONDITIONS IN THE

08:47.427 --> 08:49.729
REFUGEE CAMPS ON FRONT LINE

08:49.729 --> 08:51.431
STATES BECAUSE TEMPERATURES ARE

08:51.431 --> 08:52.432
JUST ABSOLUTELY APPALLING.

08:52.432 --> 08:53.633
THE CONDITIONS ARE NOT GREAT,

08:53.633 --> 08:54.634
AND THAT'S WHY THERE'S THIS BIG

08:54.634 --> 08:56.703
SHIFT TOWARDS EUROPE.

08:56.703 --> 08:57.537
>> Stewart: MALCOLM BRABANT,

08:57.537 --> 08:58.705
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING

08:58.705 --> 09:00.907
YOUR REPORTING.

09:00.907 --> 09:02.041
ONE WAY MIGRANTS GET TO AND

09:02.041 --> 09:03.643
THROUGH EUROPE IS WITH THE HELP

09:03.643 --> 09:05.612
OF SMUGGLERS WHO OFFER PASSAGE

09:05.612 --> 09:07.280
ON RICKETY BOATS, BY TAXI AND

09:07.280 --> 09:08.648
TRUCK, AND EVEN BY CHARTERED

09:08.648 --> 09:11.518
AIRCRAFT, ALL FOR A PRICE.

09:11.518 --> 09:13.486
A TRUCK WITH 71 DEAD MIGRANTS

09:13.486 --> 09:14.854
FOUND ALONG AN AUSTRIAN HIGHWAY

09:14.854 --> 09:16.256
LAST WEEK CALLED ATTENTION TO

09:16.256 --> 09:18.391
THE DANGERS OF SMUGGLING.

09:18.391 --> 09:19.759
IN THE LIBYAN COASTAL CITY OF

09:19.759 --> 09:21.628
ZUWARA YESTERDAY, 300 PEOPLE

09:21.628 --> 09:23.062
PROTESTED THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING

09:23.062 --> 09:25.331
AND THE RASH OF MIGRANTS DYING

09:25.331 --> 09:26.633
ON THEIR SHORE.

09:26.633 --> 09:27.467
"WASHINGTON POST" REPORTER

09:27.467 --> 09:28.268
MICHAEL BIRNBAUM HAS

09:28.268 --> 09:29.235
INVESTIGATED THE MIGRANT

09:29.235 --> 09:30.970
SMUGGLING TRADE AND JOINS ME NOW

09:30.970 --> 09:33.139
VIA SKYPE FROM BRUSSELS.

09:33.139 --> 09:34.774
MICHAEL, WHEN DID THIS KICK INTO

09:34.774 --> 09:37.410
HIGH GEAR AS A TRUE, FULL-

09:37.410 --> 09:39.279
FLEDGED BUSINESS?

09:39.279 --> 09:40.647
>> WELL, THIS HAS BEEN AN

09:40.647 --> 09:43.650
EVOLVING TRANSFORMATION OVER THE

09:43.650 --> 09:46.085
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AS THIS

09:46.085 --> 09:50.323
TREMENDOUS FLOW OF REFUGEES AND

09:50.323 --> 09:51.825
MIGRANTS HAS INCREASED INTO

09:51.825 --> 09:52.926
EUROPE.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.727
BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT A

09:54.727 --> 09:56.396
LOT OF PREEXISTING CRIMINAL

09:56.396 --> 09:59.299
NETWORKS, ESPECIALLY IN EASTERN

09:59.299 --> 10:01.334
EUROPE, HAVE SORT OF JUST

10:01.334 --> 10:02.802
CHANGED THEIR BUSINESS.

10:02.802 --> 10:03.670
THEY SEE THIS AS A GOOD

10:03.670 --> 10:05.071
OPPORTUNITY, AND NOW THEY'RE

10:05.071 --> 10:06.206
OFFERING THEIR SERVICES TO

10:06.206 --> 10:07.674
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO MAKE IT INTO

10:07.674 --> 10:08.875
WESTERN EUROPE.

10:08.875 --> 10:09.676
>> Stewart: AND I HAVE TO

10:09.676 --> 10:10.777
IMAGINE THE INTERNET HAS PLAYED

10:10.777 --> 10:12.545
A ROLE IN THIS EXPLODING.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.581
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

10:14.581 --> 10:17.050
IT'S NOW EASIER THAN EVER, IF

10:17.050 --> 10:19.152
YOU ARE A MIGRANT OR IF YOU ARE

10:19.152 --> 10:21.621
A REFUGEE, JUST TO LOOK,

10:21.621 --> 10:24.524
PARTICULARLY ON FACEBOOK.

10:24.524 --> 10:26.726
THERE ARE SMUGGLERS WHO JUST

10:26.726 --> 10:28.461
ADVERTISE THEIR SERVICES VERY

10:28.461 --> 10:32.365
OPENLY, USUALLY IN ARABIC, ON

10:32.365 --> 10:33.099
FACEBOOK.

10:33.099 --> 10:35.368
YOU CAN LOOK, YOU CAN FIND

10:35.368 --> 10:38.938
PROMISES OF PASSAGE FOR, YOU

10:38.938 --> 10:40.507
KNOW, WHATEVER KIND OF LEVEL OF

10:40.507 --> 10:42.075
SERVICE YOU WANT, BUT TYPICALLY

10:42.075 --> 10:43.776
FROM TURKISH REFUGEE CAMPS TO

10:43.776 --> 10:45.645
PARTICULAR COUNTRIES INSIDE

10:45.645 --> 10:46.446
EUROPE.

10:46.446 --> 10:48.047
AND THOSE PRICES RANGE ANYWHERE

10:48.047 --> 10:51.784
FROM $2,500 UP TO $10,000 OR

10:51.784 --> 10:52.819
EVEN MORE.

10:52.819 --> 10:53.820
>> Stewart: WITHOUT BEING FLIP,

10:53.820 --> 10:54.654
I'M GOING TO USE THE WORD

10:54.654 --> 10:55.488
"MENU."

10:55.488 --> 10:57.023
THERE ARE PRACTICALLY MENUS OF

10:57.023 --> 10:59.759
OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE OUT THERE.

10:59.759 --> 11:02.262
>> Reporter: WELL, THERE ARE A

11:02.262 --> 11:03.296
COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS-- THEY

11:03.296 --> 11:05.098
REALLY DO LOOK LIKE MENUS.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.533
THERE ARE ENTIRE LISTS THAT JUST

11:06.533 --> 11:08.735
GO DOWN WITH DIFFERENT PRICES.

11:08.735 --> 11:10.837
AND THE CHOICES RANGE BOTH FROM

11:10.837 --> 11:14.741
THE COUNTRY THAT YOU GO TO, THE

11:14.741 --> 11:15.542
COUNTRIES THAT ARE PARTICULARLY

11:15.542 --> 11:16.910
DESIRABLE ARE GERMANY AND

11:16.910 --> 11:17.744
SWEDEN.

11:17.744 --> 11:19.445
THEY'VE BEEN THE MOST OPEN TO

11:19.445 --> 11:21.981
REFUGEES.

11:21.981 --> 11:24.217
AND THEN THE LEVEL OF SERVICE

11:24.217 --> 11:25.318
ALONG THE WAY.

11:25.318 --> 11:28.588
SO THAT CAN RANGE ANYTHING FROM

11:28.588 --> 11:30.823
BELOW DECK ON A RICKETY FISHING

11:30.823 --> 11:32.959
BOAT COMING UP FROM EGYPT OR

11:32.959 --> 11:36.696
LIBYA THAT WILL TAKE YOU TO A

11:36.696 --> 11:38.731
GREEK OR ITALIAN ISLAND IN THE

11:38.731 --> 11:39.899
MEDITERRANEAN.

11:39.899 --> 11:42.802
AND I SPOKE TO A SWEDISH POLICE

11:42.802 --> 11:44.504
OFFICIAL WHO TOLD ME THAT IN ONE

11:44.504 --> 11:46.105
INSTANCE, THERE WAS EVEN A

11:46.105 --> 11:48.374
PRIVATE CHARTER JET THAT TOOK

11:48.374 --> 11:51.210
OFF FROM ISTANBUL, JUST FLEW

11:51.210 --> 11:52.478
STRAIGHT INTO STOCKHOLM, AND

11:52.478 --> 11:54.914
WHEN PEOPLE LANDED, THEY CLAIMED

11:54.914 --> 11:56.282
ASYLUM RIGHT WHEN THEY HIT THE

11:56.282 --> 11:57.116
TARMAC.

11:57.116 --> 11:57.951
>> Stewart: WHAT ARE PEOPLE

11:57.951 --> 11:59.419
DOING, WHAT ARE COUNTRIES DOING

11:59.419 --> 12:02.288
TO COMBAT THE SMUGGLING?

12:02.288 --> 12:05.258
>> WELL, JUST IN THE LAST WEEK,

12:10.797 --> 12:12.298
WERE FOUND DEAD ON THE SIDE OF A

12:12.298 --> 12:14.367
HIGHWAY, HAS SIGNIFICANTLY

12:14.367 --> 12:17.570
INCREASED HIGHWAY CONTROLS.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.739
THEY HAVE BEEN SEARCHING

12:19.739 --> 12:22.175
BASICALLY ALL TRUCKS AND VANS

12:22.175 --> 12:24.310
THAT ARE ENTERING AUSTRIA FROM

12:24.310 --> 12:25.745
HUNGARY.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.347
THAT'S BEEN A BIG EFFORT THAT

12:27.347 --> 12:29.048
TAKES A LOT OF WORK.

12:29.048 --> 12:31.184
THEY HAVE BEEN FINDING MORE

12:31.184 --> 12:33.186
INSTANCES OF PEOPLE SMUGGLING,

12:33.186 --> 12:34.287
INCLUDING A COUPLE OF VERY

12:34.287 --> 12:36.089
DANGEROUS SITUATIONS WHEN PEOPLE

12:36.089 --> 12:38.391
WERE, INDEED, LOCKED INTO THE

12:38.391 --> 12:40.593
BACK OF THESE VEHICLES WITHOUT

12:40.593 --> 12:41.794
MUCH AIR.

12:41.794 --> 12:45.164
BUT IT'S A TREMENDOUS CHALLENGE,

12:45.164 --> 12:47.800
AND, YOU KNOW, I WAS SPEAKING TO

14:33.473 --> 14:34.941
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN THEIR

14:34.941 --> 14:36.275
LIFETIMES.

14:36.275 --> 14:37.910
LISA SAYS SHE TOO IS A VICTIM OF

14:37.910 --> 14:40.513
BOTH RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.148
SHE HAD ENOUGH, SHE SAYS, WHEN A

14:42.148 --> 14:43.750
BOYFRIEND SLAPPED HER ACROSS THE

14:43.750 --> 14:45.418
FACE WHILE SHE CRADLED HER NINE-

14:45.418 --> 14:47.220
MONTH-OLD CHILD.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.622
>> AND I PACKED UP AND LEFT THE

14:49.622 --> 14:51.724
NEXT DAY, AND I NEVER WENT BACK.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.259
AND I VOWED THEREAFTER THAT NO

14:53.259 --> 14:55.461
MAN WILL EVER TOUCH ME AGAIN.

14:55.461 --> 14:57.663
I WILL NOT... MY BABIES WILL NOT

14:57.663 --> 14:58.998
KNOW THE LIFE THAT I HAD TO

14:58.998 --> 15:00.900
SURVIVE.

15:00.900 --> 15:01.801
>> Reporter: BRUNNER SAYS THAT

15:01.801 --> 15:03.436
AS AN ADULT, SHE SELDOM WENT TO

15:03.436 --> 15:05.204
THE POLICE AND THAT MUCH OF THAT

15:05.204 --> 15:06.372
HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT

15:06.372 --> 15:08.074
SOME OF THE MEN WHO ATTACKED HER

15:08.074 --> 15:10.443
WERE NOT NATIVE AMERICANS.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.178
SO, WHY DOES THAT MATTER?

15:12.178 --> 15:13.980
UP UNTIL RECENTLY, NON-NATIVE

15:13.980 --> 15:15.548
PEOPLE WERE IMMUNE FROM

15:15.548 --> 15:17.984
PROSECUTION IN TRIBAL COURTS.

15:17.984 --> 15:19.919
THAT'S CRUCIAL FOR TWO REASONS:

15:19.919 --> 15:21.687
ONE, THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYS

15:21.687 --> 15:23.956
NON-NATIVE MEN COMMIT THE VAST

15:23.956 --> 15:26.092
MAJORITY OF ASSAULTS AND RAPES

15:26.092 --> 15:28.795
AGAINST NATIVE WOMEN; AND TWO,

15:28.795 --> 15:30.496
FEDERAL ATTORNEYS, WHO ARE OFTEN

15:30.496 --> 15:32.198
THE ONLY LAWYERS WHO CAN TRY

15:32.198 --> 15:33.733
NON-NATIVES WHO COMMIT CRIMES ON

15:33.733 --> 15:35.668
RESERVATIONS, OFTEN DON'T

15:35.668 --> 15:37.069
PROSECUTE THEM.

15:37.069 --> 15:41.474
>> I KNEW WHEN I HAD BEEN RAPED

15:41.474 --> 15:43.676
AND BEEN VICTIMIZED AND WHATNOT,

15:43.676 --> 15:44.510
I NEVER TRIED TO REPORT IT

15:44.510 --> 15:46.379
BECAUSE NOTHING... I KNEW

15:46.379 --> 15:48.281
NOTHING WOULD EVER HAPPEN.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.049
I KNEW NOTHING WOULD BE DONE.

15:50.049 --> 15:51.150
>> WHEN YOU HAVE THE COMBINATION

15:51.150 --> 15:53.486
OF THE SILENCE THAT COMES FROM

15:53.486 --> 15:56.055
VICTIMS WHO LIVE IN FEAR AND A

15:56.055 --> 15:57.423
LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY BY

15:57.423 --> 15:58.958
OUTSIDE JURISDICTIONS TO

15:58.958 --> 16:00.793

16:00.793 --> 16:01.828
CREATED, IF YOU WILL, THE

16:01.828 --> 16:04.030
PERFECT STORM FOR DOMESTIC

16:04.030 --> 16:05.731
VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT,

16:05.731 --> 16:07.166
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT ALL THE

16:07.166 --> 16:08.434

>> Reporter: IN A 1978 DECISION,

16:11.337 --> 16:12.939

16:12.939 --> 16:14.774
INDIAN TRIBES WITH THEIR OWN

16:14.774 --> 16:16.075
TRIBAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS AND

16:16.075 --> 16:17.677

16:19.645 --> 16:21.547
CONGRESS CHANGED THE LAW.

16:21.547 --> 16:23.149
CONGRESS DIDN'T ACT FOR 35

16:23.149 --> 16:24.150
YEARS.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.518
THEN, TWO YEARS AGO, WHEN

ESSENTIALLY ABOVE THE LAW.

TRIBAL PROVISION IN VAWA DO TO

17:26.379 --> 17:28.047
HELP CLOSE THAT GAP?

EXACTLY THE SAME, INDIAN OR NON-

19:06.946 --> 19:08.447
AND HE THINKS THE CHANGE IN THE

19:08.447 --> 19:10.349

19:10.349 --> 19:11.784
NOT BE ALLOWED TO EXERT THEIR
