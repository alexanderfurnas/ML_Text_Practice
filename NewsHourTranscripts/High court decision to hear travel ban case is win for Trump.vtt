00:02.500 --> 00:04.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We turn
back now to the Supreme
Court's decision to take up
the Trump administration's

00:04.966 --> 00:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
travel ban and the ongoing
fight over the health
care replacement bill.

00:09.733 --> 00:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all that, it's time for
politics Monday with Tamara
Keith of NPR and Stu Rothenberg,

00:15.966 --> 00:18.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
senior editor at
Inside Elections.

00:18.700 --> 00:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome to both of you.

00:20.733 --> 00:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Tam, I'm going to start
with you on the Supreme Court
ruling on the travel ban.

00:23.566 --> 00:26.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It is a limited victory
for the president.

00:26.066 --> 00:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They did allow a
reinstatement of a part of it.

00:29.533 --> 00:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How much of a victory is it?

00:31.033 --> 00:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Well, it's a victory.

00:32.666 --> 00:36.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the president hasn't
had a lot of victories
on this travel ban.

00:36.300 --> 00:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been blocked in
various courts all the way
up to the Supreme Court.

00:40.333 --> 00:45.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was 0-2 in the appeals
courts before getting
to the Supreme Court.

00:46.766 --> 00:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now at least he will be
heard in the Supreme Court.

00:48.900 --> 00:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, it is not the 9-0 victory
that the president declared.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's not a decision yet.

00:54.666 --> 00:56.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's only a decision
to hear the case.

00:56.833 --> 00:58.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How
do you see it, Stu?

00:58.400 --> 01:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG, Inside
Elections: Yes, similarly.

01:00.200 --> 01:03.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I guess everything is a
win or loss, so it's a
win for the president.

01:03.633 --> 01:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't see it having dramatic
political implications, frankly.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think the lines
have been drawn.

01:08.300 --> 01:11.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You're either for the
ban or against the ban.

01:11.166 --> 01:14.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
To some extent, the
final decision has been
kicked down the road,
the can has been kicked

01:14.966 --> 01:16.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
down the road a bit.

01:16.233 --> 01:18.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, I think it's a
win for the president.

01:18.433 --> 01:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But compared to health care,
foreign policy, jobs, the
economy, I just don't see it as

01:24.366 --> 01:26.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a decisive issue.

01:26.400 --> 01:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, so
speaking of health care, we know
the debate in the Senate goes

01:30.433 --> 01:32.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

01:32.466 --> 01:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We heard Lisa Desjardins, Julie
Rovner talking with John Yang
earlier talking about where

01:36.066 --> 01:38.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the state of play is.

01:38.166 --> 01:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Tam, the Congressional
Budget Office weighed in with
-- and saying almost as many

01:44.300 --> 01:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - 22 million more Americans
would be hurt by this plan,
would lose coverage, which is

01:49.233 --> 01:51.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
almost as many as
the House plan.

01:51.333 --> 01:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, you have just heard
there's some reaction to
that from the White House.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Right.

01:55.433 --> 01:57.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House is reacting
much the way that it reacted
the last time the Congressional

01:57.933 --> 02:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Budget Office came out with
one of these blockbuster
reports saying millions
of people would lose

02:01.766 --> 02:03.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coverage.

02:03.766 --> 02:05.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're saying is that
the CBO hasn't always been
accurate and estimating health

02:05.766 --> 02:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care, so, all right, everyone,
just look in the other
direction, please ignore that.

02:12.733 --> 02:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the other point that the
statement makes is that the
president said he would repeal

02:15.366 --> 02:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and replace the Affordable Care
Act, and this bill does it,
and, therefore, that's what

02:20.133 --> 02:22.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they want.

02:22.133 --> 02:25.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, there are some in the
Senate who actually say the bill
doesn't repeal Obamacare, it's

02:25.600 --> 02:30.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more of a modification of the
preexisting structure, and
that is one of the objections.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are many out there.

02:34.133 --> 02:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stu, what is
the political state of play?

02:36.133 --> 02:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are the pressures on these
Republicans as they try to
decide what to do about this?

02:39.966 --> 02:43.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Well, I think
they're in a very difficult
position, a rock and a hard

02:43.033 --> 02:44.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
place.

02:44.266 --> 02:47.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
On one hand, they want
to accomplish something.

02:47.466 --> 02:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have a mandate from
conservatives, Republicans,
Trump backers to do something.

02:54.400 --> 02:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the other hand, they're
concerned about opinion back
home and they're concerned about

02:57.633 --> 02:59.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the coverage.

02:59.633 --> 03:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I got a release from
Mitch -- you got a release
from the White House.

03:01.333 --> 03:03.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I saw a release from
Mitch McConnell right
before I came on.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm glad we
are all well-covered here.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: And he said:
"The Senate will soon take
action on the bill that the

03:07.466 --> 03:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congressional Budget Office just
confirmed will reduce the growth
in premiums under Obamacare,

03:13.566 --> 03:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reduce taxes on the middle
class, and reduce the deficit."

03:15.066 --> 03:17.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Premiums, taxes, deficit.

03:17.066 --> 03:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What McConnell didn't
talk about was health
care, quality of coverage.

03:21.300 --> 03:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Or out-of-pocket
expenses, which this CBO
report says could be massive.

03:25.800 --> 03:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: And voters
care about these things.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They care a lot
about these things.

03:30.233 --> 03:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Stu, again,
as you -- you follow these, the
political pressures on these

03:36.600 --> 03:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
members of the Senate as
they think about - - the ones
who are you for reelection.

03:38.666 --> 03:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Judy, I
was looking at some numbers,
and it's really stunning.

03:42.500 --> 03:45.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's the one group, two
groups that are supposed to
benefit most from this health

03:45.600 --> 03:47.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
care bill?

03:47.633 --> 03:51.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Younger voters and healthier
people, right, because they have
been subsidizing older people

03:51.000 --> 03:53.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and people who
aren't as healthy.

03:53.033 --> 03:56.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what group is most opposed
to the American Health Care
Act and most critical of Donald

03:56.966 --> 03:59.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump?

03:59.033 --> 04:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Eighteen-to-34-year-olds,
younger voters, the kind of
voters that should like this.

04:02.900 --> 04:05.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, I think it's a real
problem for Republicans.

04:05.300 --> 04:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will
certainly see what happens.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's so much to ask about.

04:09.366 --> 04:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tam, the president has been
tweeting a lot over the weekend,
continuing to today, about

04:16.133 --> 04:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the reports that the
Obama administration had
information about Russian
hacking, interference

04:21.866 --> 04:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in last year's presidential
election and didn't do
a lot about it until
after the election.

04:27.633 --> 04:31.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president's going after
former President Obama, saying
he's the one to blame, he's

04:32.033 --> 04:34.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the one who obstructed.

04:34.200 --> 04:35.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Where does this
get the president?

04:35.900 --> 04:37.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How successful a
strategy is this?

04:37.966 --> 04:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: The president's
position on Russian hacking
and metaling in the election

04:41.833 --> 04:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is wildly confusing, because,
previously, he had said it
was a hoax that was invented

04:48.233 --> 04:51.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by the Democrats just to explain
their loss in the election.

04:51.100 --> 04:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now I guess he's OK with the
hoax, as long as it's President
-- former President Obama's

04:55.700 --> 04:57.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fault.

04:57.766 --> 05:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And President Trump does have
a remarkable ability to make
everything President Obama's

05:01.766 --> 05:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fault, one way or another.

05:03.833 --> 05:07.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stu, the
president has -- this
has been the monkey on
the president's back

05:07.733 --> 05:09.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for months and
months and months.

05:09.766 --> 05:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He doesn't like to talk about
it, but it seems as if this
particular report that came out

05:13.233 --> 05:16.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a couple days ago in
The Washington Post,
he seized on that.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STUART ROTHENBERG: I
think you're right.

05:18.666 --> 05:22.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's looking for some
explanation to prove
that he was right and
Obama is wrong, it's

05:22.700 --> 05:24.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all Obama's fault.

05:24.800 --> 05:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, I think President Obama
did -- one thing that Donald
Trump says is correct is that

05:29.100 --> 05:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama did assume that
Hillary Clinton was going to
win the election and that he

05:33.233 --> 05:36.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
could not take on
this issue publicly.

05:36.333 --> 05:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But can you imagine what Donald
Trump would have said if, a
few weeks before election,

05:40.900 --> 05:44.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Barack Obama got on
television and said it's
all about the Russians
taking over our elections?

05:44.966 --> 05:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump would have said, it's
rigged, the election is rigged.

05:46.733 --> 05:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: He already
was saying it was rigged.

05:48.500 --> 05:51.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that may have
influenced how the Obama
administration reacted.

05:51.900 --> 05:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's what they're saying.

05:53.933 --> 05:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, in fact,
privately, that's what the
Obama folks are saying.

05:56.033 --> 05:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just very quickly, something
that we kind of overlooked in
all the other news last week,

05:59.633 --> 06:03.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the was the announcement
by the Supreme Court that
they're going to take up, Stu,

06:03.233 --> 06:08.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a redistricting case
that affects the census,
that is going to have
a big effect on how

06:09.366 --> 06:11.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our politics potentially...

06:11.400 --> 06:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: This is
huge, or, as some people, say,
"yuge," because this goes to

06:16.933 --> 06:19.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the very heart of how
districts are drawn,
who draws the districts.

06:19.800 --> 06:24.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that goes to the very
heart of who gets elected and
which party benefits from how

06:24.000 --> 06:25.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the districts are drawn.

06:25.466 --> 06:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, this is a thing to
absolutely keep an eye on.

06:28.900 --> 06:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The court has been very reticent
to get involved on the issues
of is this a political question

06:33.566 --> 06:35.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or not?

06:35.266 --> 06:37.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But by taking the case,
I guess they're going
to address it at least.

06:37.633 --> 06:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The
backdrop is that the way
redistricting gerrymandering
has been happening,

06:44.233 --> 06:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tam, quickly, it has benefited
the Republicans, and this
is a chance to look at that.

06:47.566 --> 06:52.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, and
redistricting that has made
seats safe is influencing things

06:55.033 --> 06:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like this very health
care debate, because
members of Congress are
more worried, particularly

06:57.333 --> 07:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
