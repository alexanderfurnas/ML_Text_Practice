ALL THESE PEOPLE BEGAN TODAY.

01:15.709 --> 01:16.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

01:16.476 --> 01:17.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN FACT, TODAY WAS DECLARED A

01:17.945 --> 01:19.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATIONAL DAY OF MOURNING.

01:19.279 --> 01:21.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

NOW, IT WAS ORIGINALLY SCHEDULED

01:25.252 --> 01:28.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE A DAY OF CELEBRATION.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.324 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TODAY WOULD HAVE MARKED THE 50th

THE PASTA ALL' AMATRICIANA.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMATRICE IS THE TOWN WHERE I'M

01:39.266 --> 01:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STANDING RIGHT NOW, AND IT WAS

01:40.400 --> 01:43.370 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THE EPICENTER OF THIS QUAKE.

01:43.370 --> 01:45.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE OF THE SAD STORIES YOU COME

01:45.906 --> 01:48.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACROSS IS THE FACT THAT, BECAUSE

01:48.308 --> 01:50.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THIS FOOD FESTIVAL, THE

01:50.310 --> 01:51.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOWN'S POPULATION PRACTICALLY

01:51.979 --> 01:53.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOUBLED BECAUSE OF ALL THE

01:53.013 --> 01:54.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VISITORS WHO WERE HERE FROM

01:54.548 --> 01:56.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELSEWHERE IN ITALY AND EVEN

01:56.216 --> 01:58.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FURTHER AFIELD.

01:58.018 --> 01:59.419 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF COURSE THAT CELEBRATION DID

01:59.419 --> 02:00.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT TAKE PLACE.

02:00.287 --> 02:01.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSTEAD THERE WAS A STATE

02:01.888 --> 02:05.692 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FUNERAL IN A TOWN NEARBY HERE.

02:05.692 --> 02:07.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WERE LOTS OF SAD STORIES

02:07.260 --> 02:07.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOLD THERE.

02:07.995 --> 02:10.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE, HOWEVER, WAS SORT OF

02:10.330 --> 02:11.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UPLIFTING; IT WAS A STORY OF TWO

02:11.732 --> 02:14.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SISTERS, ONE WHO ACTUALLY SEEMED

02:14.034 --> 02:15.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO HAVE SACRIFICED HERSELF,

02:15.869 --> 02:17.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GRABBING ON TO HER LITTLE SISTER

02:17.037 --> 02:18.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO IS FOUR YEARS OLD.

02:18.372 --> 02:20.374 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BIG SISTER DIED BUT THE

02:20.374 --> 02:21.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LITTLE SISTER WAS ABLE TO

02:21.308 --> 02:22.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SURVIVE.

02:22.776 --> 02:23.477 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ABOUT

02:23.477 --> 02:25.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RESCUE TURNING INTO RECOVERY

02:25.612 --> 02:25.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EFFORTS?

02:25.979 --> 02:27.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT ABOUT THOSE WHO ARE STILL

02:27.047 --> 02:28.281 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MISSING?

02:28.281 --> 02:29.649 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, IN THIS CITY THERE ARE

02:29.649 --> 02:30.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APPROXIMATELY 20 PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:30.984 --> 02:32.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STILL UNACCOUNTED FOR.

02:32.953 --> 02:34.688 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TECHNICALLY THE RESCUE EFFORT IS

02:34.688 --> 02:35.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STILL ONGOING.

02:35.689 --> 02:36.857 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS A 100-HOUR WINDOW

02:36.857 --> 02:38.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN WHICH RESCUERS CAN STILL

02:38.759 --> 02:41.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPECT TO FIND, OR HOPE TO FIND

02:41.395 --> 02:43.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SURVIVORS, IF THE SURVIVORS HAVE

02:43.363 --> 02:45.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME ACCESS TO WATER.

02:45.065 --> 02:47.534 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOWEVER, THAT WINDOW IS NOW

02:47.534 --> 02:50.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLOSING, SO THE RESCUERS I SPEAK

02:50.170 --> 02:53.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO REALLY DON'T SEEM OPTIMISTIC.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY TELL ME THAT THEY ONLY

02:55.342 --> 02:56.510 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPECT TO RECOVER BODIES, AT

02:56.510 --> 02:57.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS POINT.

02:57.744 --> 02:59.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: THIS IS NOT A

02:59.012 --> 03:00.347 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REGION THAT'S UNFAMILIAR WITH

03:00.347 --> 03:01.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EARTHQUAKES, SOME OF THE

03:01.615 --> 03:03.383 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUILDINGS BEHIND YOU WERE

03:03.383 --> 03:06.053 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPPOSED TO BE RETRO-FITTED TO

03:06.053 --> 03:08.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE STRONGER, WHAT HAPPENED?

03:08.422 --> 03:09.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

03:09.689 --> 03:10.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELL, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

03:10.957 --> 03:13.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN FACT, A STATE PROSECUTOR HAS

03:13.026 --> 03:15.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPENED UP OVER A HUNDRED PROBES

03:15.862 --> 03:18.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO BUILDINGS THAT ALLEGEDLY

03:18.398 --> 03:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOULD HAVE BEEN STABLE, SHOULD

03:20.133 --> 03:21.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WITHSTAND A

03:21.735 --> 03:23.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUAKE LIKE THIS.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE QUESTION IS, WHY DIDN'T

03:25.238 --> 03:26.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY?

03:26.273 --> 03:27.808 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS IT A QUESTION OF, THE MONEY

03:27.808 --> 03:28.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEVER GETTING TO WHERE IT SHOULD

03:28.875 --> 03:29.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE?

03:29.776 --> 03:31.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS IT A QUESTION OF CORRUPTION?

03:31.845 --> 03:33.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN FACT, ITALY IS A COUNTRY THAT

03:33.513 --> 03:35.282 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS NO STRANGER WHEN IT COMES TO

03:35.282 --> 03:36.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CORRUPTION.

03:36.283 --> 03:38.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS A QUESTION THAT WE'RE

03:38.085 --> 03:40.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEARING ASKED WHEN IT COMES TO

03:40.320 --> 03:41.922 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RECONSTRUCTION PERIOD.

03:41.922 --> 03:44.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN FACT, THE ITALIAN

AGAINST MAFIA INFILTRATION.

03:49.996 --> 03:51.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ITALY, AS YOU KNOW, IS A SEISMIC

03:51.965 --> 03:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REGION, IT'S HAD LOTS OF

03:53.400 --> 03:54.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EARTHQUAKES IN THE PAST.

03:54.367 --> 03:57.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE HAVE BEEN CASES OF THESE

03:57.003 --> 03:59.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIG LUCRATIVE BUILDING CONTRACTS

03:59.673 --> 04:01.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

CONNECTIONS.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT OFFICIALS

04:03.710 --> 04:05.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE LOOKING OUT FOR RIGHT NOW.

04:05.545 --> 04:06.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

BY AN EXECUTIVE ORDER ISSUED

16:09.669 --> 16:11.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YESTERDAY, THE PAPAHANAUMOKUAKEA

16:11.704 --> 16:13.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARINE NATIONAL MONUMENT WILL

16:13.639 --> 16:15.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECOME THE LARGEST ECOLOGICAL

FOR MORE ON THE AREA AND SPECIES

16:22.381 --> 16:23.749 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WILL BE PROTECTED, I'M

16:28.988 --> 16:30.323 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, MATT, TELL ME, WHY THIS

16:30.323 --> 16:31.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PATCH OF OCEAN, WHAT IS SO

16:31.524 --> 16:32.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPECIAL ABOUT IT?

16:32.458 --> 16:33.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THIS IS AMAZING PLACE

16:33.893 --> 16:35.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN.

16:35.228 --> 16:36.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NORTHWEST HAWAIIAN ISLANDS

16:36.829 --> 16:39.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE PAPAHANAUMOKUAKEA IS A

16:39.298 --> 16:41.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY SPECIAL PLACE, OVER 7,000

16:41.667 --> 16:43.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARINE SPECIES.

16:43.236 --> 16:44.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TALKING ABOUT THE OLDEST

16:44.570 --> 16:47.039 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIVING ORGANISM ON EARTH--

16:47.039 --> 16:49.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A DEEP SEA CORAL THAT'S 4,500

16:49.942 --> 16:52.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARS OLD IS FOUND HERE.

16:52.011 --> 16:55.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GHOST OCTOPUS; CREATURES THAT

16:55.181 --> 16:57.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE ENDEMIC, FOUND ONLY IN THIS

16:57.717 --> 17:00.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRETCH OF OCEAN, UP TO 90% IN

17:00.453 --> 17:01.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CERTAIN LOCATIONS, ARE ONLY

17:01.988 --> 17:02.788 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOUND IN THIS STRETCH OF THE

17:02.788 --> 17:03.656 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OCEAN.

17:03.656 --> 17:04.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN, OF COURSE, ALL THE

17:04.724 --> 17:06.292 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAGNIFICENT MEGA-FAUNA THAT

17:06.292 --> 17:07.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERYBODY SEES IN THE "NATIONAL

17:07.660 --> 17:09.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GEOGRAPHIC" FILMS, LIKE WHALES

17:09.929 --> 17:11.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND TURTLES AND SHARKS AND MANTA

17:11.998 --> 17:13.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RAYS.

17:13.099 --> 17:15.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE AMAZING SEA BIRD LIFE AS

17:15.167 --> 17:15.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELL.

17:15.635 --> 17:18.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, IT'S A SPECTACULAR PIECE OF

17:18.938 --> 17:20.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OCEAN, AND WE'RE SO EXCITED THAT

17:20.940 --> 17:22.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S NOW BEEN PROTECTED IN

17:22.675 --> 17:23.409 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERPETUITY.

17:23.409 --> 17:24.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: SO, HOW DO YOU

17:24.143 --> 17:26.078 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTECT, SAY, SCHOOLS OF FISH

17:26.078 --> 17:27.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM THIS AREA THAT DECIDE TO GO

17:27.747 --> 17:29.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUTSIDE AND BACK IN, RIGHT?

17:29.315 --> 17:30.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, THIS IS ONE OF THE

17:30.182 --> 17:30.983 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCERNS THAT THE FISHING

17:30.983 --> 17:33.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDUSTRY HAS HAD FOR SOME TIME.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THERE ARE SOME CERTAIN

17:34.453 --> 17:35.788 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPECIES THAT DEFINITELY GO

17:35.788 --> 17:37.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEYOND THESE BORDERS, BUT WHILE

17:37.256 --> 17:39.225 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE IN THIS HUGE REFUGE--

17:39.225 --> 17:40.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT'S A MASSIVE REFUGE, IT'S

17:40.993 --> 17:43.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT 3.5 TIMES THE SIZE OF THE

17:43.162 --> 17:45.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATE OF CALIFORNIA-- THESE FISH

17:45.331 --> 17:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REPRODUCE

17:47.533 --> 17:50.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND GROW UNMOLESTED, SO THEY

17:50.569 --> 17:52.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE AN EXCELLENT CHANCE OF

17:52.405 --> 17:54.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PASSING ON THEIR GENES AND

17:54.340 --> 17:55.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPOPULATING.

17:55.508 --> 17:56.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: AND PUT THIS IN

17:56.642 --> 17:58.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERSPECTIVE OF THE LARGER OCEAN.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, WHILE WE TALK ABOUT

17:59.045 --> 18:00.046 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THREE TIMES THE SIZE OF

18:00.046 --> 18:01.547 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CALIFORNIA, PUT THAT IN

18:01.547 --> 18:03.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERSPECTIVE FOR ALL THE OCEAN

18:03.316 --> 18:06.752 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S NOT PROTECTED THIS WAY.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YEAH, SCIENTISTS ARE SAYING

18:08.154 --> 18:10.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE NEED TO PROTECT UP TO 30% OF

18:10.489 --> 18:11.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OCEAN.

18:11.624 --> 18:14.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW, IN HIGHLY

18:14.026 --> 18:15.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTECTED OR FULLY PROTECTED

18:15.494 --> 18:16.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARINE RESERVES, WE HAVE ABOUT

18:16.629 --> 18:18.464 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
3% OF THE OCEAN.

18:18.464 --> 18:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, WE STILL HAVE VERY LONG WAY

18:19.966 --> 18:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO GO.

18:21.233 --> 18:23.069 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT SAID, WE'VE COME A VERY

18:23.069 --> 18:24.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONG WAY IN A VERY SHORT

18:24.170 --> 18:24.904 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIMEFRAME.

18:24.904 --> 18:27.173 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN FACT, WHEN PAPAHANAUMOKUAKEA

18:27.173 --> 18:29.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS FIRST DESIGNATED IN 2006,

18:29.342 --> 18:32.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FIRST VERSION OF IT, BY

18:32.144 --> 18:34.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT BUSH, THAT WAS THE

18:34.246 --> 18:35.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LARGEST PROTECTED AREA IN THE

18:35.247 --> 18:35.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORLD.

18:35.681 --> 18:38.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE WERE DOWN AROUND .05% OF THE

18:38.818 --> 18:40.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OCEAN PROTECTED, JUST TEN YEARS

18:40.453 --> 18:41.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGO.

18:41.487 --> 18:42.755 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND NOW, WE'RE AT 3% OF THE

18:42.755 --> 18:44.590 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORLD'S OCEANS PROTECTED.

18:44.590 --> 18:46.292 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THIS, OF COURSE, SETS A

18:46.292 --> 18:47.493 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STANDARD FOR THE REST OF THE

18:47.493 --> 18:48.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORLD, AND HOPEFULLY A WAKE UP

18:48.627 --> 18:50.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CALL, THAT WE NEED TO START

18:50.463 --> 18:52.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKING BOLD ACTION, LIKE THE

18:52.765 --> 18:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT JUST TOOK.

18:54.133 --> 18:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT TOOK IT

18:54.800 --> 18:55.601 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO LONG?

18:55.601 --> 18:58.404 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY THE GAP IN YEARS BETWEEN

18:58.404 --> 18:59.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN GEORGE BUSH STARTED THIS

18:59.638 --> 19:00.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA

19:00.906 --> 19:02.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPANDED IT?

19:02.041 --> 19:04.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> NEW SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION

19:04.043 --> 19:05.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S JUST COME OUT IN THE LAST

19:05.945 --> 19:07.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECADE, IT'S REALLY NOT THAT

19:07.079 --> 19:08.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONG WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT

19:08.214 --> 19:10.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM THE SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVE.

19:10.483 --> 19:11.684 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE

19:11.684 --> 19:13.419 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORLD'S OLDEST LIVING ORGANISM,

19:13.419 --> 19:16.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR THE FACT THAT THESE ENDEMIC

19:16.222 --> 19:17.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEA CREATURES WERE FOUND OUT IN

19:17.990 --> 19:19.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE FURTHER DISTANCES.

19:19.625 --> 19:20.393 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY ALSO DIDN'T HAVE AS

19:20.393 --> 19:21.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUCH SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION

19:21.794 --> 19:22.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE

19:22.895 --> 19:24.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LARGE-SCALE AND THE INTER-

19:24.697 --> 19:26.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN ALL THE

19:26.799 --> 19:28.701 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENT SPECIES AND THEIR NEED

19:28.701 --> 19:31.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR SUCH A WIDE RANGE FOR

19:31.470 --> 19:33.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTECTION.

19:33.205 --> 19:35.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN, THE SPIRITUAL AND

19:35.408 --> 19:36.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CULTURAL CONNECTION TO THE

19:36.542 --> 19:37.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATIVE HAWAIIANS HAS REALLY COME

19:37.977 --> 19:39.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO THE FOREFRONT AS WELL.

19:39.378 --> 19:40.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: MATT, PUT THIS

19:40.513 --> 19:42.281 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KIND OF SPACE IN THE CONTEXT OF

19:42.281 --> 19:43.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLIMATE CHANGE, WHAT'S THE

19:43.582 --> 19:44.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VALUE?

19:44.550 --> 19:45.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YEAH, SCIENTISTS ARE VERY

19:45.651 --> 19:46.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXCITED ABOUT THIS AREA BEING

19:46.852 --> 19:48.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTECTED NOW.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.989 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FULLY INTACT ECOSYSTEMS ARE MUCH

19:49.989 --> 19:51.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE RESILIENT TO THE IMPACTS OF

19:51.557 --> 19:53.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLIMATE CHANGE.

19:53.259 --> 19:56.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION,

19:56.228 --> 19:57.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE VERY EXCITED THAT IT

19:57.863 --> 19:59.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL BE ONE OF THE, IF NOT THE

19:59.465 --> 20:01.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEST, LARGEST, CLIMATE REFUGES,

20:01.834 --> 20:02.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CERTAINLY FOR THE OCEAN, BUT

20:02.835 --> 20:04.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALSO FOR THE PLANET.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S SITUATED IN THE TROPICS,

20:06.105 --> 20:07.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT ALSO IN THE TEMPERATE OCEAN.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.974 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ACTUALLY TO THE FURTHER

20:08.974 --> 20:11.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NORTHERN END OF THE ISLAND CHAIN

20:11.077 --> 20:12.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE NOW PROTECTED MARINE

20:12.678 --> 20:14.213 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESERVE, THE WATER ACTUALLY

20:14.213 --> 20:16.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECOMES QUITE COOL.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE SCIENTISTS ARE HOPEFUL
