REQUIRE A PRINCE CHARMING.

ALL THE ADULT WOMEN IN MY LIFE

00:40.366 --> 00:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAD TO FIGHT AGAINST THE SAME

00:44.200 --> 00:45.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPECTATIONS-- GET MARRIED, HAVE

00:45.466 --> 00:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KIDS, LET SOMEONE ELSE MAKE

00:46.433 --> 00:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

00:53.366 --> 00:56.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVER THE YEARS, I BECAME MORE

00:56.766 --> 00:57.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND MORE CONVINCED: MARRIAGE--

00:57.733 --> 01:01.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP--

01:01.366 --> 01:03.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WAS A KIND OF WEAKNESS.

01:04.666 --> 01:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRONG WOMEN DIDN'T NEED ANYONE.

01:07.533 --> 01:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHILE I WAS IN COLLEGE, MY

01:08.933 --> 01:09.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FEMALE FRIENDS AND I WER

01:09.866 --> 01:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESSURED TO "LEAN IN" AND

01:12.400 --> 01:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRIVE FOR ONE PARTICULAR KIND

01:13.433 --> 01:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF SUCCESS: THE BEST, MOST

01:15.833 --> 01:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FULFILLING CAREER POSSIBLE.

01:17.366 --> 01:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR HIGH-ACHIEVING WOMEN MY AGE,

01:19.566 --> 01:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS WERE

01:21.333 --> 01:23.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUPPOSED TO BE FAR LESS

01:23.566 --> 01:24.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPORTANT, PUT ON THE BACK

01:24.866 --> 01:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BURNER UNTIL WE WERE WELL ON OUR

01:25.733 --> 01:27.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WAY TO A CORNER OFFICE.

01:27.833 --> 01:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS WHERE MY VALUES CLASHED

01:33.433 --> 01:34.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WITH REAL LIFE.

01:34.366 --> 01:36.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFTER GRADUATION, STARTED TO

01:36.466 --> 01:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WRITE A BOOK, AND ALL OF MY

01:37.400 --> 01:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WRITING CONTACTS WERE IN NEW

YORK.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE, I'D HAVE A MUCH STRONGER

01:41.033 --> 01:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROFESSIONAL NETWORK THAN I

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD LIVING IN ANY OTHER CITY.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT MY BOYFRIEND GOT A JOB IN

01:45.400 --> 01:48.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
D.C.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN I STARTED TELLING PEOPLE

01:50.366 --> 01:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT I WAS MOVING TO D.C. TO BE

01:51.833 --> 01:53.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH ROBERT, THEY ALL GAVE ME

01:53.500 --> 01:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS SORT OF SAD, PITYING LOOK.

01:56.933 --> 01:57.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY SAID THINGS LIKE, "REALLY?"

01:57.766 --> 02:01.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
"BUT YOU'RE SO YOUNG!"

02:01.433 --> 02:03.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I SPENT MY FIRST YEAR AFTER

02:03.666 --> 02:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GRADUATION SHADOWING FOUR OF MY

02:04.600 --> 02:05.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FEMALE CLASSMATES AND WRITING

02:05.533 --> 02:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THEIR TRANSITION FROM

02:08.600 --> 02:09.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COLLEGE TO REAL LIFE.

02:09.400 --> 02:11.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
IT WAS A TOUGH YEAR.

02:11.966 --> 02:13.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUR ENTIRE LIVES, WE'D BEEN

02:13.366 --> 02:15.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SURROUNDED BY THIS BIG,

02:15.833 --> 02:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPPORTIVE COMMUNITY: PARENTS,

02:17.433 --> 02:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TEACHERS, A GROUP OF FRIENDS OUR

02:20.300 --> 02:21.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OWN AGE.

02:21.533 --> 02:22.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN THAT ALL WENT AWAY, WE FELT

02:22.466 --> 02:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE ALONE THAN WE EVER HAD

02:24.233 --> 02:25.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
BEFORE.

02:25.400 --> 02:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE WANTED TO LEAN ON A PARTNER.

02:29.366 --> 02:32.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT MADE US FEEL INTENSELY

02:32.366 --> 02:33.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GUILTY.

02:34.200 --> 02:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETIMES, RELATIONSHIPS HELP US

02:35.133 --> 02:37.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIND OUR FOOTING IN AN ENTIRELY

02:37.366 --> 02:39.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
NEW WORLD.

02:39.833 --> 02:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MY POINT ISN'T THAT ALL WOMEN

02:41.366 --> 02:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOULD PRIORITIZE ROMANCE AFTER

02:43.100 --> 02:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GRADUATION, JUST THAT THOSE OF

02:44.300 --> 02:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
US WHO DO SHOULDN'T BE DEMONIZED

02:45.400 --> 02:49.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
FOR IT.

02:49.266 --> 02:50.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GUYS WHO FOLLOW THEIR

02:50.233 --> 02:51.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GIRLFRIENDS DON'T GET THE SAME

02:51.366 --> 02:52.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JUDGMENT.

02:52.200 --> 02:54.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
INSTEAD, THEY'RE OFTEN

02:54.500 --> 02:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CELEBRATED FOR BEING PROGRESSIVE

02:56.600 --> 02:57.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
OR MODERN.

02:57.566 --> 03:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE SAY, "THAT'S SO SWEET,"

03:01.400 --> 03:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR "WOW, HE REALLY LOVES HER."

03:03.833 --> 03:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE SHOULD ASK OURSELVES WHY

03:05.433 --> 03:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE DIFFERENT REACTIONS EXIST,

03:09.433 --> 03:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHY YOUNG WOMEN CONTINUE TO

03:12.633 --> 03:13.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BE JUDGED FOR MAKI
