11:36.745 --> 11:37.705
NONETHELESS, DEAL WITH ASSAD IS 
VERY, VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE    
HE'S ENTRENCHED IN POWER.       

11:37.707 --> 11:38.866
VERY, VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE    
HE'S ENTRENCHED IN POWER.

GROWTH OF ISIS.                 

11:41.720 --> 11:45.467
THIS ENTIRE CONFLICT AND THE    
GROWTH OF ISIS.                 
YES, WE DON'T HAVE ANY CAPABLE  

11:45.469 --> 11:47.192

YES, WE DON'T HAVE ANY CAPABLE

11:47.194 --> 11:48.120
YES, WE DON'T HAVE ANY CAPABLE  
ALLIES AS WE DO, TO SOME DEGREE 
AT LEAST, IN IRAQ.              

11:48.122 --> 11:49.547

AT LEAST, IN IRAQ.              
THUS, WE'RE STARTING IN IRAQ    
TRYING TO PUSH AGAINST ISIS, AND

11:52.169 --> 11:53.494
THUS, WE'RE STARTING IN IRAQ    
TRYING TO PUSH AGAINST ISIS, AND
THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL OFFENSES TO

11:53.496 --> 11:54.787
TRYING TO PUSH AGAINST ISIS, AND
THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL OFFENSES TO
THE NORTH OF BAGHDAD AND SOTHE

AND THEN WE'LL SEE HOW THE      

12:02.120 --> 12:03.743
APPROACH TO FIRST START IN IRAQ,
AND THEN WE'LL SEE HOW THE      
SITUATION DEVELOPS IN SYRIA

AND THEN WE'LL SEE HOW THE      
SITUATION DEVELOPS IN SYRIA
