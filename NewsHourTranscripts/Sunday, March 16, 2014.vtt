SO WHAT WAS IT LIKE AT THE POLLS

01:07.200 --> 01:10.633
TODAY?

01:10.633 --> 01:12.200
>> THE THING THAT SURPRISED ME

01:12.200 --> 01:14.167
TODAY WAS THE HIGH TURNOUT W

01:14.167 --> 01:16.000
DID OBSERVE AT THE FOUR POLLIN

01:16.000 --> 01:22.367
STATIONS HE WENT TO.

01:22.367 --> 01:24.467
THE ONE EXCEPTION WAS AT A

01:24.467 --> 01:27.700
DISTRICT THAT IS HEAVILY MUSLIM,

01:27.700 --> 01:29.800
THEY SAID THEY WOULD BOYCOTT THE

01:29.800 --> 01:31.400
VOTE AND IT WAS ONLY 10%

01:31.400 --> 01:34.167
THE VOTERS SEEM IN A CELEBRATORY

01:34.167 --> 01:34.500
MOVE

01:34.500 --> 01:36.900
THE HEAD OF ONE POLLS STATIO

01:36.900 --> 01:38.700
SAID ALL SLAVIC PEOPLE, THIS I

01:38.700 --> 01:40.600
A VERY BIG DAY FOR THEM.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.067
WHAT THEY SAID, THEY DON'T

01:43.067 --> 01:44.000
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS I

01:44.000 --> 01:48.367
CALLING -- CAUSING A HUG

01:48.367 --> 01:49.833
EAST/WEST CONFRONTATION.

01:49.833 --> 01:51.200
THE CONCERNS WERE PRACTICAL.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.333
THEY TALKED ABOUT HAVING MOR

01:52.333 --> 01:53.433
JOBS IN INVESTMENT IF THEY

01:53.433 --> 01:54.533
JOINED RUSSIA.

01:54.533 --> 01:55.833
THEY ALSO TALKED ABOUT FEELING

01:55.833 --> 01:57.367
MUCH MORE AT HOME WITH RUSSIA.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.200
YOU KNOW, THIS IS AN AREA THAT

01:59.200 --> 02:01.467
FOR 300 YEARS WAS PART OF RUSSIA

02:01.467 --> 02:04.567
AND THE SOVIET UNION, AND THEY

02:04.567 --> 02:05.700
ALMOST ALL COMPLAINED ABOU

02:05.700 --> 02:07.867
BEING FORCED TO FILL OUT FORMS

02:07.867 --> 02:10.100
IN UKRAINIAN, FOR EXAMPLE.

02:10.100 --> 02:12.833
SO THERE SEEMS TO BE A KIND OF

02:12.833 --> 02:15.167
YEARNING AND ALSO A FEELING THAT

02:15.167 --> 02:17.667
THE WORST -- IS HOSTILE, OR AT

02:17.667 --> 02:19.767
LEAST HAS PEOPLE IN IT HOSTILE

02:19.767 --> 02:21.400
TO TWO RUSSIAN SPEAKERS AN

02:21.400 --> 02:22.167
ETHNIC RUSSIANS HERE

02:22.167 --> 02:24.300
>> SPEAKING OF PRACTICAL

02:24.300 --> 02:25.800
MATTERS, HOW DOES CRIMEA BECOM

02:25.800 --> 02:26.700
A PART OF RUSSIA, HOW QUICKL

02:26.700 --> 02:28.900
COULD THAT HAPPEN?

02:28.900 --> 02:30.667
>> IT COULD HAPPEN QUITE

02:30.667 --> 02:34.167
QUICKLY, HARI.

02:34.167 --> 02:35.233
TONIGHT THE OFFICIAL RESULTS ARE

02:35.233 --> 02:37.600
SUPPOSED TO BEEN ANNOUNCED A

02:37.600 --> 02:40.200
THIS CELEBRATORY CONFERENCE.

02:40.200 --> 02:44.467
TOMORROW MORNING AT 10:00, THE

02:44.467 --> 02:46.567
CRIMEAN PARLIAMENT WILL MEET T

02:46.567 --> 02:48.067
EVALUATE THE RESULTS, BUT THEY

02:48.067 --> 02:49.833
HAVE ALREADY SAID IF THE PUBLI

02:49.833 --> 02:51.033
AFFIRMS THE IDEA THEY ARE READ

02:51.033 --> 02:52.233
TO VOTE.

02:52.233 --> 02:53.833
IN FACT THEY HAVE VOTED TO ASK

02:53.833 --> 02:54.600
RUSSIA TO JOIN

02:54.600 --> 02:56.033
OF COURSE, THERE IS A GROU

02:56.033 --> 03:02.100
HERE

03:02.100 --> 03:06.133
FEEL VERY ALIENATED, WE SPOKE TO

03:06.133 --> 03:07.800
A GROUP THAT SAID THEY DID NOT

03:07.800 --> 03:10.133
VOTE, THEY FEEL OSTRACIZED, AN

03:10.133 --> 03:11.500
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO PARTICIPAT

03:11.500 --> 03:13.033
IN SOMETHING THAT SEEMED

03:13.033 --> 03:14.167
LEGITIMATE TO THEM

03:14.167 --> 03:16.167
SO IT'S NOT A WHOLESAL

03:16.167 --> 03:17.633
ENDORSEMENT OF THIS, BUT I THINK

03:17.633 --> 03:19.567
IT'S GOING TO MOVE VERY FAST, AT

03:19.567 --> 03:21.667
LEAST ON THE CRIMEAN SIDE.

03:21.667 --> 03:23.567
>> ARE THEY READY FOR THIS KIN

03:23.567 --> 03:25.100
OF MOVE?

03:25.100 --> 03:26.767
IT'S A BIG DEAL.

03:26.767 --> 03:28.133
>> IT'S A HUGE STEP.

03:28.133 --> 03:30.467
WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER TH

03:30.467 --> 03:32.300
RUSSIANS WILL ACTUALLY COMPLET

03:32.300 --> 03:35.367
THIS CIRCLE, BUT THE PRIME

03:35.367 --> 03:46.567
MINISTER HERE, AKSENOV, HE'S

03:46.567 --> 03:49.800
ALREADY MADE -- AND TODAY TH

03:49.800 --> 03:52.033
LARGEST COMMERCIAL BANK PUT

03:52.033 --> 03:54.267
SIDE ON ITS DOORS SAYING A

03:54.267 --> 03:55.600
4:30, DAO YOU TO THE CONVERSIO

03:55.600 --> 03:57.933
FROM THE LOCAL CURRENCY TO

03:57.933 --> 03:59.600
RUBLES, THE BANK WILL NOT BE

03:59.600 --> 04:00.567
OPEN ON MONDAY

04:00.567 --> 04:01.733
WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE

04:01.733 --> 04:04.200
INCONVENIENCE.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.700
>> THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT.

04:05.700 --> 04:07.067
SO WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEX

04:07.067 --> 04:07.400
COUPLE DAYS, THE NEXT COMING

04:07.400 --> 04:10.167
WEEKS.

04:10.167 --> 04:13.033
>> WELL, HARI, THERE ARE STILL

04:13.033 --> 04:14.033
HUGE UNKNOWN AS.

04:14.033 --> 04:17.233
THE RUSSIAN DUMA HAS NOT VOTED

04:17.233 --> 04:19.267
HAS MADE MADE THIS OFFICIAL, AND

04:19.267 --> 04:20.567
THERE'S ANOTHER UNANSWERED

04:20.567 --> 04:22.333
QUESTION, WHICH IS HOW QUICKLY

04:22.333 --> 04:24.400
WILL VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT

04:24.400 --> 04:25.833
PUTIN AND THE RUSSIANS FOLLO

04:25.833 --> 04:27.467
THROUGH ON THEIR THREAT TO MOV

04:27.467 --> 04:30.033
INTO EASTERN UKRAINE TO PROTEC

04:30.033 --> 04:31.000
RUSSIAN SPEAKERS AND ETHNI

04:31.000 --> 04:34.333
RUSSIANS THERE

04:34.333 --> 04:35.767
AND OF COURSE HOW QUICKLY WILL

04:35.767 --> 04:37.833
THE U.S. AND THE EU MOVE T

04:37.833 --> 04:40.000
IMPOSE THE SANCTIONS THEY HAVE

04:40.000 --> 04:40.433
THREATENED

04:40.433 --> 04:42.233
TODAY THE WHITE HOUSE SAID I

04:42.233 --> 04:44.367
COULD BE A MATTER OF DAYS, BUT

04:44.367 --> 04:46.600
SECRETARY KERRY AND FOREIG

04:46.600 --> 04:51.033
MINISTER LAVROV DID HAVE A BIG

04:51.033 --> 04:52.033
CONVERSATION THIS MORNING AT

04:52.033 --> 04:54.300
THIS THEY TALKED ABOUT SOLVING

04:54.300 --> 04:55.600
THIS DIPLOMATICALLY THROUG

04:55.600 --> 04:57.033
CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES TO TH

04:57.033 --> 04:57.533
UKRAINE CONSTITUTION

04:57.533 --> 04:59.600
IT'S A COMPLICATED SET O

04:59.600 --> 05:01.067
ISSUES, BUT IT WOULD HAVE TO D

05:01.067 --> 05:02.933
WITH GRANTING MORE AUTONOMY TO

05:02.933 --> 05:06.300
SOME OF THESE REGIONS IN EASTERN

05:06.300 --> 05:07.833
UKRAINE, WHERE RUSSIAN SPEAKER

05:07.833 --> 05:09.267
ARE, IF NOT A MAJORITY, IF THE

05:09.267 --> 05:11.633
ARE HERE, THE ETHNIC RUSSIAN

05:11.633 --> 05:18.967
ARE A SIZABLE MINORITY

05:18.967 --> 05:22.833
I WOULD SAY THERE ARE.

05:22.833 --> 05:24.667
I SUPPOSE THERE IS A

05:24.667 --> 05:26.467
POSSIBILITY, PERHAPS REMOVE OF

05:26.467 --> 05:26.867
RESOLVING THIS DIPLOMATICALLY IN

05:26.867 --> 05:29.400
SOME FASHION

05:44.100 --> 05:45.500
BORDERING RUSSIA, WHERE THERE IS

05:45.500 --> 05:47.833
A LARGE RUSSIAN-SPEAKING

05:47.833 --> 05:50.633
POPULATION, AS ITN'S JOHN IRVINE

BRETHREN HERE IN DONESK SHOWED

06:06.900 --> 06:09.600
THEIR DESIRE TO FOLLOW SUIT BY

06:09.600 --> 06:13.300
ATTACKING SYMBOLS OF EYE CRANIAN

06:13.300 --> 06:13.867
AUTHORITIES.

06:13.867 --> 06:15.833
EMPOWERED BY THE PRESENCE OF THE

06:15.833 --> 06:17.533
RUSSIAN ARMY JUST OVER THE

NEARBY BORDER, BESIEGED TH

06:21.700 --> 06:25.567
OFFICE OF THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR.

06:25.567 --> 06:28.000
UKRAINIAN RIOT POLICE WERE SOO

06:28.000 --> 06:28.200
OVERWHELMED.

06:28.200 --> 06:28.967
THE OFFICERS MAY HAVE BEEN

06:28.967 --> 06:29.167
DRESSED FOR A FIGHT, BUT THE

06:29.167 --> 06:32.600
WOULDN'T

06:32.600 --> 06:33.733
THIS IS A DIFFICULT SITUATIO

06:33.733 --> 06:36.600
FOR THESE UKRAINIAN POLICE

06:36.600 --> 06:36.800
OFFICERS

06:36.800 --> 06:38.433
TO SOME EXTENT, THEY HAVE TO

06:38.433 --> 06:40.333
TOLERATE THESE PROTESTS BECAUS

06:40.333 --> 06:42.333
THEY ARE FULLY AWARE THAT TH

06:42.333 --> 06:43.333
KREMLIN IS WATCHING DEVELOPMENTS

06:43.333 --> 06:51.900
HERE VERY CLOSELY.

06:51.900 --> 06:54.100
EVENTUALLY THIS LITTLE PIECE O

06:54.100 --> 06:55.933
UKRAINIAN RULE WAS OVERWHELMED

06:55.933 --> 07:07.067
BY RUSSIA'S INFLUENCE.

07:07.067 --> 07:08.533
THEY HAVE A TASTE FOR IT NOW AND

07:08.533 --> 07:10.233
ANOTHER TARGET, THE HEADQUARTERS

07:10.233 --> 07:12.733
OF THE UKRAINIAN SECURIT

07:12.733 --> 07:12.933
SERVICES

07:12.933 --> 07:14.500
THE BUILDING APPEARED TO BE WELL

07:14.500 --> 07:16.567
DEFENDED, BUT AGAIN, THESE WER

07:16.567 --> 07:17.233
RIOT POLICE REDUCED TO USING KID

08:24.133 --> 08:26.033
DESIRE TO PERHAPS GAIN

08:26.033 --> 08:27.133
INDEPENDENCE AND JOAN RUSSIA

08:27.133 --> 08:28.600
THEY HAD IT KIND OF UNOFFICIAL

08:28.600 --> 08:30.533
AND ACTUALLY ILLEGAL REFERENDU

08:30.533 --> 08:31.533
ON THE SQUARE TODAY.

08:31.533 --> 08:33.133
IT SEEMED LIKE ABOUT 10,00

08:33.133 --> 08:34.533
PEOPLE CAME AND THEY WER

08:34.533 --> 08:39.267
CHANTING RUSSIA, PUTIN SAVE US

08:39.267 --> 08:48.133
YOU KNOW SLACKING OFF S AND SO

08:48.133 --> 08:49.767
THEN THEY HAD THIS BIG VOTE,

08:49.767 --> 08:51.333
WHICH FRANKLY IS MEANINGLESS

08:51.333 --> 08:53.033
HAS FOR CONSEQUENCES, BUT IS

08:53.033 --> 08:55.133
JUST TO SHOW A STRENGTH, AND

08:55.133 --> 08:56.733
THEN JUST OUTSIDE, ABOUT 3

08:56.733 --> 08:58.600
METERS FROM WHERE I'M SITTIN

08:58.600 --> 08:59.633
NOW, THEY ARE CURRENTLY TRYING

08:59.633 --> 09:01.333
TO STORM THE GOVERNMEN

09:01.333 --> 09:01.567
BUILDING

09:01.567 --> 09:04.133
AND IT'S VERY HARD TO TELL WHA

09:04.133 --> 09:05.467
PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION

09:05.467 --> 09:07.100
HERE SUPPORT WHAT THEY'RE DOING,

09:07.100 --> 09:09.433
BUT CERTAINLY THIS MINORITY IS

09:09.433 --> 09:10.067
INCREDIBLY VOCAL

09:10.067 --> 09:11.767
>> SO THIS IS A CITY WHERE

09:11.767 --> 09:13.433
NEIGHBOR IS FIGHTING NEIGHBOR ON

09:13.433 --> 09:14.833
THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE?

09:14.833 --> 09:15.500
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.967
I MEAN, ON THE STREETS THERE ARE

09:17.967 --> 09:19.100
CONSTANT ARGUMENTS BREAKING OU

09:19.100 --> 09:20.933
BETWEEN PEOPLE, SOME OF WHOM

09:20.933 --> 09:22.567
KNOW EACH OTHER, BUT SIMPL

LOOKED THROUGH THE HOMES OF TH

STORY HAS CHANGED SO MUCH, THE

12:05.767 --> 12:08.167
FOCUS IS NOW ON THE PILOT.

12:12.167 --> 12:15.800
INVESTIGATIONS

12:15.800 --> 12:16.600
>> WELL, THEY ACTUALLY DON'T

12:16.600 --> 12:19.133
HAVE A LOT

12:19.133 --> 12:20.833
IN TERMS OF RAW DATA AND I

TERMS OF WHERE THE PLANE MAY

HAVE BEEN AND SATELLITE IMAGER

AND SORT OF PINGS THAT HAVE GONE

12:44.733 --> 12:47.433
THESE PEOPLE WERE AND WHAT THEIR

MOTIVATIONS MAY HAVE BEEN, THE

U.S. HAS FAR LESS VISIBILITY

THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'

FRUSTRATED OFFICIALS HERE IN

>> IN SOME OF YOUR REPORTING

YOU POINTED OUT THAT MALAYSIAN

12:57.933 --> 13:00.100
RADAR ESSENTIAL PICKED U

13:00.100 --> 13:02.633
THIS -- MILITARY RADAR DID, BU

13:02.633 --> 13:04.967
NOBODY SENT UP A WARNING FLARE

13:04.967 --> 13:06.867
THERE WERE JETS READY TO

13:06.867 --> 13:07.867
SCRAMBLE, BUT NOBODY DID

13:07.867 --> 13:09.667
>> CORRECT, AND THERE'S A LOT OF

13:09.667 --> 13:11.000
QUESTIONS THAT HAVE COME OUT

13:11.000 --> 13:12.967
ABOUT THE MA LAZE, BUT WHY THE

13:12.967 --> 13:14.333
HAVEN'T BEEN SHARING MOR

13:14.333 --> 13:15.667
INFORMATION SOONER AND WHY I

13:15.667 --> 13:17.333
TOOK THEM OVER A WEEK TO COM

13:17.333 --> 13:18.500
OUT AND MAKE THE DECLARATION

13:18.500 --> 13:23.100
THEY DID THE OTHER DAY ABOUT THE

13:23.100 --> 13:26.100
TRANSPONDERS AND HOW THE

13:26.100 --> 13:27.467
THOUGHT IT WAS FOUL PLAY

13:27.467 --> 13:28.933
AS THE AMERICANS LOOK AT THIS,

13:28.933 --> 13:30.933
THEY SAY, WELL, WE HAVE A LOT OF

13:30.933 --> 13:32.267
EXPERTISE AND COULD HELP, BU

13:32.267 --> 13:33.967
THE MALAYSIANS DON'T WANT TO

13:33.967 --> 13:35.500
LOOK LIKE THEY CAN'T DO IT O

13:35.500 --> 13:37.100
THEIR OWN AND THEY DON'T WANT US

13:37.100 --> 13:39.167
TO DO IT FOR THEM.

13:39.167 --> 13:40.233
SO THE U.S. STANDS ON TH

13:40.233 --> 13:42.967
OUTSIDE LIKE MANY OF US AN

13:42.967 --> 13:45.067
LOOKS IN AND THEORYIZES, BUT

13:45.067 --> 13:46.367
DON'T KNOW MUCH MORE THAN ANY OF

13:46.367 --> 13:47.767
US DO.

13:47.767 --> 13:49.667
>> HOW COSTLY HAS THAT TIM

13:49.667 --> 13:49.933
BEEN

13:49.933 --> 13:51.867
IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT ALL

13:51.867 --> 13:53.867
THESE PLANES AND SHIPS HAVE BEEN

13:53.867 --> 13:55.800
LOOKING, REALLY IN THE WRONG

13:55.800 --> 13:55.933
AREA

13:55.933 --> 13:58.467
>> LOOK, THE PROBLEM IS TH

13:58.467 --> 14:01.733
OCEAN THERE IS JUST SO BIG AND

14:01.733 --> 14:03.933
SO FAST, AND THERE'S SO MUCH

14:03.933 --> 14:05.633
AREA THAT CAN BE COVERED

14:05.633 --> 14:08.467
BECAUSE THE TRANSPONDERS WEN

14:08.467 --> 14:09.833
OFF, THEY HAVE VERY LITTLE CLU

14:09.833 --> 14:10.667
OF WHERE IT COULD BE

14:10.667 --> 14:12.267
IF THE PLANE HAD HYPOTHETICALL

14:12.267 --> 14:14.667
BLOWN UP AS IT WAS GOING ON IT

14:14.667 --> 14:15.867
ROUTE, THEN THEY WOULD HAVE

14:15.867 --> 14:17.333
CLEAR IDEA OF WHERE TO LOOK.

14:17.333 --> 14:19.667
THERE WOULD BE SORT OF A NARROW,

14:19.667 --> 14:20.900
SORT OF AREA THAT THEY COULD

14:20.900 --> 14:22.533
LOOK THROUGH ON THE WATER, BUT

14:22.533 --> 14:24.767
THEY ESSENTIALLY HAVE AN ENTIR

14:24.767 --> 14:26.100
OCEAN TO LOOK AT

14:26.100 --> 14:28.167
THAT'S REALLY, REALLY DIFFICULT.

14:28.167 --> 14:31.600
THERE'S EVEN SOME FOLKS WHO THEY

14:31.600 --> 14:33.767
THINK MAY NEVER EVEN FIND IT

14:33.767 --> 14:35.233
THAT'S PROBABLY THE ISSUE HERE

14:35.233 --> 14:38.633
>> BASED ON ALL YOUR REPORTING

14:38.633 --> 14:40.433
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE MOS

14:40.433 --> 14:41.333
LIKELY SCENARIO?

14:41.333 --> 14:43.200
>> UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THE

14:44.733 --> 14:45.067
OCEAN.

14:45.067 --> 14:46.767
IT SEEMS FAR-FETCHED TO THIN

LANDED AND NO ONE HAS DETECTED

14:50.833 --> 14:51.200
IT

14:51.200 --> 14:54.433
IF YOU TALK TO AVIATION EXPERTS,

14:54.433 --> 14:56.267
THEY SAYI DIFFICULT TO SORT OF

14:56.267 --> 14:58.000
HIDE A PLANE OF THIS SIZE AN

16:58.500 --> 17:00.600
ACCORDING TO HIS FAMILY.

17:00.600 --> 17:01.800
BRENNER'S FINAL REQUEST WAS TO

17:01.800 --> 17:04.367
BE BURIED WITH $100 IN SMALL

17:04.367 --> 17:06.400
BILLS IN HIS LEFT SOCK, JUST I

17:06.400 --> 17:07.900
CASE, HE SAID, TIPPING I

17:07.900 --> 17:09.000
RECOMMENDED WHERE I'M GOING.

17:09.000 --> 17:24.133
DAVID BRENNER WAS 78

17:24.133 --> 17:26.100
>>> WE WANT TO TURN TO ANOTHER

17:26.100 --> 17:29.333
STORE THAT'S GOTTEN A LOT LESS

17:29.333 --> 17:30.533
ATTENTION, OUTBREAKS O

17:30.533 --> 17:31.133
MEALSLES

17:31.133 --> 17:34.300
IT'S PART OF A LARGER STORY THAT

17:34.300 --> 17:36.433
INFECTIOUS DISEASES THAT ALL BUT

17:36.433 --> 17:38.267
DISAPPEARED IN THE U.S. ARE NO

17:38.267 --> 17:38.400
REAPPEARS.

17:38.400 --> 17:41.067
THE CDC SAYS THE NUMBER OF

17:41.067 --> 17:43.167
MEALSLE CASES WAS THREE TIME

17:43.167 --> 17:45.167
NORMAL AND MORE THAN 20 CASE

17:45.167 --> 17:46.700
HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN NEW YORK

17:46.700 --> 17:47.267
THIS YEAR.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.133
YESTERDAY I SPOKE WITH STEVE

17:49.133 --> 17:50.767
MORSE AT THE MELLMAN SCHOOL OF

17:50.767 --> 17:52.667
PUBLIC HEALTH AT COLUMBI

17:52.667 --> 17:52.867
UNIVERSITY

17:52.867 --> 17:55.400
I BEGAN BY ASKING HIM WHAT H

17:55.400 --> 17:57.933
THOUGHT WAS BEHIND IS THE TREN

17:57.933 --> 18:00.467
>> MEALSLES IS VACCINE

18:00.467 --> 18:02.133
PREVENTABLE, SO TO A LARGE

18:02.133 --> 18:03.133
EXTENT IT'S BECAUSE OF THE

18:03.133 --> 18:04.833
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT BEING

18:04.833 --> 18:07.333
IMMUNIZED OR TOO YOUNG TO BE

18:07.333 --> 18:08.000
IMMUNIZED.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.600
NORMALLY WE START RECOMMENDING

18:09.600 --> 18:11.167
IMMUNIZATION AT ABOUT ONE YEAR

18:11.167 --> 18:13.333
BUT, FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAD A

18:13.333 --> 18:15.533
OUTBREAK LAST SUMMER I

18:15.533 --> 18:18.000
BROOKLYN, LARGELY BECAUSE TH

18:18.000 --> 18:19.533
DECISION IN THOSE COMMUNITIE

18:19.533 --> 18:21.933
CAUSE TO WAIT BEFORE IMMUNIZIN

18:21.933 --> 18:24.167
THE CHILDREN, AND VACCINATE THEM

18:24.167 --> 18:24.400
LATER.

18:24.400 --> 18:25.867
SO SOME OF THE YOUNGER CHILDRE

18:25.867 --> 18:27.233
GOT INFECTED

18:27.233 --> 18:29.067
>> SO HOW MUCH OF THIS I

18:29.067 --> 18:30.767
RELATED TO PEOPLE COMING IN FROM

18:30.767 --> 18:32.233
OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD

18:32.233 --> 18:34.567
AND THEN COMBINING WITH THOS

18:34.567 --> 18:36.267
POPULATIONS HERE THAT AREN'T

18:36.267 --> 18:36.800
IMMUNIZED?

18:36.800 --> 18:38.967
>> IN MOST CASES, THAT'S WHAT'

18:38.967 --> 18:39.133
HAPPENING.

18:39.133 --> 18:41.000
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PLACES I

18:41.000 --> 18:43.100
THE NETHERLANDS, FOR EXAMPLE

18:43.100 --> 18:45.133
WHERE FOR VARIOUS REASONS THER

18:45.133 --> 18:47.167
ARE COMMUNITIES, VARIOUS

18:47.167 --> 18:49.267
RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES, FOR

18:49.267 --> 18:51.467
EXAMPLE, THAT REFUSE

18:51.467 --> 18:51.800
IMMUNIZATION

18:51.800 --> 18:53.200
THEY JUST DON'T WANT TO BE

18:53.200 --> 18:53.867
IMMUNIZED.

18:53.867 --> 18:56.967
OCCASIONALLY A CASE WILL BREAK

18:56.967 --> 18:58.600
OUT THERE IN THAT POPULATION

18:58.600 --> 19:00.167
SOMEONE WILL COME OVER HERE AN

19:00.167 --> 19:02.100
INTRODUCE IT, AND MOST OF TH

19:02.100 --> 19:04.100
POPULATION IS IMMUNIZED AN

19:04.100 --> 19:05.933
PROTECTED, BUT NOT EVERYBODY

19:05.933 --> 19:07.833
>> WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHE

19:07.833 --> 19:08.867
INFECTIOUS DISEASES THAT KEE

19:08.867 --> 19:09.933
YOU UP AT NIGHT?

19:09.933 --> 19:11.633
WHEN I WAS LOOKING THIS UP

19:11.633 --> 19:14.000
SCARLET FEVER CASES ARE UP AT

19:14.000 --> 19:15.700
24-YEAR HIGHS IN THE UK.

19:15.700 --> 19:17.067
OBVIOUSLY IN THIS GLOBAL AND

19:17.067 --> 19:18.900
CONNECTED WORLD, PEOPLE AR

19:18.900 --> 19:20.633
CARRYING DISEASES, ALONG WIT

19:20.633 --> 19:22.567
THEIR LUGGAGE AS THEY CARRY TO

19:22.567 --> 19:22.933
AND FROM

19:22.933 --> 19:28.633
>> THE ONE THAT WORE ME Z WORR

19:28.633 --> 19:30.300
ME THE MOST IS THE ONE WE DON'

19:30.300 --> 19:31.267
KNOW ABOUT

19:31.267 --> 19:32.300
SCARLET FEVER HAS BEEN WITH US

19:32.300 --> 19:33.900
FOR A LONG TIME.

19:33.900 --> 19:35.300
MY MOTHER WAS HOSPITALIZED WIT

19:35.300 --> 19:37.933
IT 60 OR 70 YEARS AGO, AND I

19:37.933 --> 19:39.267
WAS VERY COMMON THEN

19:39.267 --> 19:40.867
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT WAXES

19:40.867 --> 19:44.667
AND WANES, AND THE STREP TOE

19:44.667 --> 19:48.600
COKE US BACTERIUM OF WHICH IT IS

19:48.600 --> 19:53.867
A MEMBER, IS WITH US ALL THE

19:53.867 --> 19:55.333
SOMETIME

19:55.333 --> 19:57.133
STREP THROAT, FOR EXAMPLE, BUT

19:57.133 --> 19:58.900
SOME OF THE DIFFERENT FORMS SEEM

19:58.900 --> 20:00.467
TO HAVE THEIR OWN VARIABLE

20:00.467 --> 20:01.533
PATTERNS, AND THEN OF COURSE W

20:01.533 --> 20:05.300
HAVE MENINGITIS, WHICH IS ALSO

20:05.300 --> 20:06.967
BACTERIAL, BUT AN UNUSUAL TIME

20:06.967 --> 20:09.167
FOR WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE A

20:09.167 --> 20:11.300
EFFECTIVE VACCINE YET IN THI

20:11.300 --> 20:12.367
COUNTRY, ALTHOUGH WE WILL BE

20:12.367 --> 20:12.967
LICENSING THAT SOON.

20:12.967 --> 20:15.700
>> HOW MUCH OF THIS IS KIND OF

20:15.700 --> 20:17.367
OUR OWN SUCCESS LEADING TO A

20:17.367 --> 20:18.733
CERTAIN TYPE OF COMPLACENCY.

20:18.733 --> 20:20.667
YOU SAID YOUR MOTHER HAD SCARLET

20:20.667 --> 20:21.033
FEVER.

20:21.033 --> 20:22.200
YOU HAD FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE OF

20:22.200 --> 20:22.500
IT

20:22.500 --> 20:24.100
YOU KNEW WHAT TO BE FEARFUL OF

20:24.100 --> 20:24.233
IT

20:24.233 --> 20:26.500
MOST OF US HAVE NOT SEEN POLIO

20:26.500 --> 20:28.333
OR MEALSLES IN OUR LIFETIME.

20:28.333 --> 20:29.733
>> I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY

20:29.733 --> 20:30.000
TRUE

20:30.000 --> 20:31.933
FOR THE DISEASES THAT AR

20:31.933 --> 20:33.700
VACCINE PREVENTABLE, AND MOR

20:33.700 --> 20:35.600
AND MORE ARE, I HAD MEALSLES

20:35.600 --> 20:37.300
WHEN I WAS A CHILD AND THEN IN

20:37.300 --> 20:40.167
FACT A VACCINE WAS DEVELOPED A

20:40.167 --> 20:41.433
FEW YEARS LATER.

20:41.433 --> 20:42.733
IT'S POSSIBLE TO BE IMMUNIZE

20:42.733 --> 20:44.200
AND NOT HAVE TO EXPERIENCE WHA

20:44.200 --> 20:45.900
SO MANY OF US WENT THROUGH

20:45.900 --> 20:47.967
EARLIER, BUT FOR THE VACCINE

20:47.967 --> 20:49.533
PREVENTABLE DISEASES, VERY OFTEN

20:49.533 --> 20:51.100
IT'S JUST THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE

20:51.100 --> 20:52.900
AFRAID TO BE IMMUNIZED, AFRAID

20:52.900 --> 20:54.333
TO HAVE THEIR CHILDREN IMMUNIZED

20:54.333 --> 20:56.067
FOR WHATEVER REASON, AND DEPENDS

20:56.067 --> 21:00.900
ON THEIR NEIGHBORS TO PROTEC

21:00.900 --> 21:01.500
THEM

21:01.500 --> 21:04.100
MEALSLES IS EXTREMEL

21:04.100 --> 21:05.133
TRANSMISCIBLE, SO YOU NEED A

21:05.133 --> 21:06.367
HIGH LEVEL OF IMMUNIZATION T

21:06.367 --> 21:07.133
PROTECT PEOPLE

21:07.133 --> 21:08.467
SO THE COMPLACENCY I THINK I

21:08.467 --> 21:11.267
THE FACT THAT WE DON'T SEE THE

21:11.267 --> 21:13.367
THREAT QUITE THE WAY WE DID 50

21:13.367 --> 21:16.267
YEARS AGO, OR PERHAPS EVEN

21:16.267 --> 21:16.500
25IER.

21:16.500 --> 21:17.900
STEVEN MORSE FROM COLUMBIA

21:17.900 --> 21:19.367
