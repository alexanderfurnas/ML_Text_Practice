Judy Woodruff.

00:05.772 --> 00:08.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
North Carolina sues the federal
government

00:12.646 --> 00:17.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to protect a controversial
bathroom law. The
U.S. attorney general vows the
Department

00:18.018 --> 00:21.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Justice stands with the
transgender community.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We talk with North Carolina's
governor, Pat
McCrory.

00:24.825 --> 00:29.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And it's
Politics Monday.
The general election has all but
started,

00:29.663 --> 00:32.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
yet both parties brace for
contentious conventions.

00:32.399 --> 00:38.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Monday, 20
years after a brutal and bloody
civil war,

00:38.138 --> 00:41.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how Bosnia is reconciling with
its Muslim
population.

00:41.241 --> 00:44.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILORAD DODIK, President, Serb
Republic (through
translator): What we can do is
to ensure that

00:44.444 --> 00:49.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we don't behave in an inhumane
way. Regardless
of our religion, nationality and
ideology,

00:50.050 --> 00:51.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we shouldn't harm each other.

00:51.485 --> 00:58.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

(BREAK)

01:01.628 --> 01:12.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: North Carolina
refused today
to stop enforcing a law that
bars new protections

01:12.339 --> 01:16.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for gays, lesbians, bisexuals
and transgender
people.

01:16.376 --> 01:20.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Governor Pat McCrory
announced
he won't comply with a Justice
Department

01:20.547 --> 01:25.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
demand. Instead, McCrory
announced he's suing
the Justice Department, and he
accused the

01:25.752 --> 01:27.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Obama administration of
overreaching.

01:27.654 --> 01:32.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. PAT MCCRORY (R), North
Carolina: I do
not agree with their
interpretation of federal

01:32.192 --> 01:38.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
law. We believe a court, rather
than a federal
agency, should tell our state,
our nation

01:38.966 --> 01:42.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and employers across the country
what the
law requires.

01:42.803 --> 01:47.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In Washington,
Attorney
General Loretta Lynch announced
Justice is

01:47.207 --> 01:52.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
filing its own civil rights suit
against the
state. She said restricting
bathroom access

01:53.046 --> 01:56.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
for transgender people is
state-sponsored
discrimination.

01:56.550 --> 02:00.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORETTA LYNCH, U.S. Attorney
General: None
of us can stand by when a state
enters the

02:00.988 --> 02:07.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
business of legislating identity
and insist
that a person pretend to be
something or someone

02:07.527 --> 02:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they are not or invents a
problem that
doesn't exist as a pretext for
discrimination

02:13.900 --> 02:15.669 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and harassment.

02:15.769 --> 02:18.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We will have
an interview
with Governor McCrory right
after the news

02:18.472 --> 02:20.407 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
summary.

02:20.507 --> 02:23.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: Cooler
temperatures and light rain
brought some relief

02:23.844 --> 02:29.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the fire zone around Fort
McMurray, Canada.
That gave officials a chance to
get back into

02:29.282 --> 02:35.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the devastated city and see the
damage firsthand.
More than 80,000 people have
been evacuated

02:35.856 --> 02:38.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and it's unclear when they will
be able to
go home.

02:38.658 --> 02:43.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A
tough-talking mayor has
been elected president of the
Philippines

02:43.196 --> 02:49.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in today's election. Rodrigo
Duterte has vowed
to wipe out corruption and kill
criminals.

02:49.803 --> 02:54.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's also raised eyebrows with
sex jokes and
foul language. Still, millions
of Filipinos

02:54.541 --> 02:59.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supported him in a bid for
radical change
after years of grinding poverty,
poor services

02:59.679 --> 03:01.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and insurgent violence.

03:01.581 --> 03:06.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Brazil, the
impeachment
of President Dilma Rousseff was
put on hold

03:06.119 --> 03:11.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today, at least temporarily. The
head of the
Lower House of Congress annulled
April's vote

03:11.458 --> 03:17.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on impeachment charges two days
before the
Senate was to vote on suspending
Rousseff.

03:17.297 --> 03:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She reacted cautiously to the
news.

03:19.966 --> 03:24.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DILMA ROUSSEFF, Brazilian
President (through
translator): I have just
learned, the same

03:24.738 --> 03:28.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way you have, that an injunction
has been
accepted and that, therefore,
the process

03:28.442 --> 03:33.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been suspended. But I don't
have this
information officially. I am
speaking here

03:33.146 --> 03:37.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because I could not in any way
pretend I wasn't
aware of the same thing you are.
But it is

03:37.584 --> 03:39.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not official. I do not know the
consequences.

03:39.686 --> 03:45.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The issue may now
return to
the Lower House of Brazil's
Congress, delaying

03:45.158 --> 03:48.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the impeachment process by days
or weeks.

03:48.295 --> 03:52.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: North Korea's
supreme leader
got a new title today, party
chairman. The

03:52.699 --> 03:58.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
move came as the ruling Workers'
Party wrapped
up its first congress in 36
years. State television

03:58.271 --> 04:02.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
showed the elaborate meeting,
where Kim Jong-un
pledged to further strengthen
North Korea's

04:02.242 --> 04:06.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nuclear weapons capability in
quality and
quantity.

04:06.546 --> 04:10.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Also today, three BBC
journalists were expelled
from North Korea over their
reporting.

04:10.684 --> 04:14.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, this
was swearing-in day for
Ferguson, Missouri's

04:14.888 --> 04:21.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
first black police chief.
Delrish Moss takes
over a mostly white force in a
city that's

04:21.628 --> 04:28.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two-thirds black. The killing of
Michael Brown
in 2014 led to federal findings
of widespread

04:28.168 --> 04:31.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
racial bias and profiling by
Ferguson police.

04:31.638 --> 04:35.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There's word
that poisonings
from electronic cigarettes are
surging among

04:35.909 --> 04:41.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
young children. Nationwide
Children's Hospital
in Columbus, Ohio says
preschoolers can put

04:41.915 --> 04:47.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
e-cigarettes in their mouths and
drink liquid
nicotine. It causes vomiting and
other symptoms.

04:47.654 --> 04:53.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cases surged from 14 a month in
January of
2012 to 223 a month by last
spring.

04:53.960 --> 04:58.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wall Street's
week got off
to a lackluster start. The Dow
Jones industrial

04:58.298 --> 05:08.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average lost 34 points to close
below 17706.
The Nasdaq rose 14 and the S&amp;P
500 added a

05:08.241 --> 05:09.976 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
point.

05:10.076 --> 05:12.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And the planet
Mercury made
a rare transit across the face
of the sun

05:12.879 --> 05:18.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today. NASA animation depicted
the tiny planet
crossing between Earth and sun
over seven-and-a-half-hours.

05:18.685 --> 05:24.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The actual event, viewed by a
satellite, showed
Mercury as a black dot against
the glowing

05:24.791 --> 05:30.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
solar surface. Mercury's transit
happens only
about 13 times every 100 years.

05:30.197 --> 05:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
we talk with
North Carolina's governor about
the federal

05:34.201 --> 05:39.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fight to protect the state's
bathroom law;
Donald Trump's battle to unite
the Republican

05:39.606 --> 05:48.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Party; Saudi Arabia ousts the
most powerful
man in oil; and much more.

05:48.215 --> 06:01.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It was an openly
contentious
day, as the fight intensified
over a controversial

06:01.161 --> 06:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
state law in North Carolina,
restricting bathroom
use to one's gender at birth.

06:06.967 --> 06:11.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both the state's governor and
legislature
sued the federal government,
rejecting the

06:11.538 --> 06:15.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Justice Department's view that
the law violates
civil rights.

06:15.308 --> 06:20.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we heard a few moments ago,
U.S. Attorney
General Loretta Lynch vowed to
stand by the

06:20.780 --> 06:22.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
transgender community.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are joined now by North
Carolina's Republican
governor, Pat McCrory.

06:24.818 --> 06:25.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Governor McCrory, welcome.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.087 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You know...

06:27.187 --> 06:30.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GOV. PAT MCCRORY (R), North
Carolina: Thank
you, Judy.

06:30.457 --> 06:32.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you for
being with us.

06:32.425 --> 06:35.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know what the attorney
general said today.
She said the Justice Department
is going to

06:35.695 --> 06:43.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
take action to block
implementation of this
law. So, will you comply with
that move by

06:43.670 --> 06:47.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Justice? Or will you go ahead
and try to continue
to implement?

06:47.107 --> 06:50.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GOV. PAT MCCRORY: No, we're
actually taking
them to court also.

06:50.710 --> 06:57.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is what we are seeking,
is clarity
in the judicial system to
further define gender

06:57.117 --> 07:02.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
identity and gender identity's
usage in our
restrooms in our high schools,
our junior

07:02.289 --> 07:07.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
highs, our elementary schools,
our universities
and our highway rest stops.

07:07.260 --> 07:11.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We just -- we are seeking basic
clarity of
this, because the executive
branch doesn't

07:11.898 --> 07:17.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have the power to interpret law.
That's the
power of the judicial branch.
And that's what

07:17.604 --> 07:19.406 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we're seeking.

07:19.506 --> 07:23.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what the attorney general
has done now
with her new ruling is basically
all employers

07:23.910 --> 07:29.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the United States of America
and all universities
in the United States of America,
based upon

07:29.516 --> 07:35.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her letter of interpretation, is
saying that
all employers must allow gender
identity in

07:35.288 --> 07:39.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the private sector for any
employer over 15
employees.

07:39.359 --> 07:46.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That means a man who believes
they're a woman
would be able to go into a
woman's restroom,

07:46.700 --> 07:51.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
locker room or shower facility.
And that's
where the dispute is, and we're
asking for

07:51.304 --> 07:56.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
basic clarity of that. It is a
very complex
and emotional issue. And I think
the courts

07:56.743 --> 08:00.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are the right way to do it. And
then, sooner
or later, I think the U.S.
Congress has got

08:00.113 --> 08:02.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to get clarity on this whole
issue also.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Governor,
we will see
how it plays out legally.

08:04.651 --> 08:09.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I'm sure you heard the
attorney general
say today -- she said this
amounts to state-sponsored

08:09.656 --> 08:16.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
discrimination. She compared it
to the Jim
Crow laws of decades ago,
wherein African-American,

08:16.830 --> 08:22.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
black Americans were not allowed
to use restrooms
that white people were. She said
this is harming

08:22.936 --> 08:24.571 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
innocent people.

08:24.671 --> 08:29.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. PAT MCCRORY: That's
extremely divisive
rhetoric and dangerous rhetoric,
which is

08:29.409 --> 08:34.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
totally be related to an issue
on whether
a male or female should use a
male bathroom

08:35.081 --> 08:36.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or a female restroom.

08:36.916 --> 08:41.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, my chief of staff,
whose father was
a civil rights pioneer in
Durham, where the

08:41.755 --> 08:46.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attorney general also grew up,
we were watching
that together. And he went,
don't -- don't

08:46.393 --> 08:48.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
go there. There is absolutely no
connection.

08:49.062 --> 08:54.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is an issue which is really
about privacy
vs. equality and that balance.
And people

08:55.068 --> 08:59.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have an expectation of privacy,
according
to many of our citizens, not
just in North

08:59.806 --> 09:03.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carolina, but, again, this is
now going to
be a nationwide issue. When you
go to a restroom

09:04.077 --> 09:08.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or to a locker room or to a
shower facility,
there is an expectation of
privacy, that the

09:08.848 --> 09:14.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only other people in that room,
in a very
private moment, I might add,
will be people

09:14.220 --> 09:16.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the same gender.

09:16.122 --> 09:20.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have got to resolve this
very complex
and new issue that was actually
brought up

09:20.960 --> 09:23.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the left, political left, not
the political
right.

09:23.596 --> 09:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Governor --
Governor,
as I'm sure you also know, what
the transgender

09:27.600 --> 09:31.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
community would argue is that
their privacy
is at stake as well.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we heard the attorney
general say, she
said -- and I guess this is the
language in

09:34.941 --> 09:42.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the lawsuit -- they say this is
causing transgender
people to suffer emotional harm,
mental anguish,

09:42.215 --> 09:45.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
distress, humiliation,
indignity.

09:45.118 --> 09:48.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you acknowledge that there is
that effect
from this law?

09:48.922 --> 09:54.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. PAT MCCRORY: I acknowledge
we need to
work this out. And what we do in
North Carolina

09:54.260 --> 09:59.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and what many states are doing
right now -- I
think over 27 other states have
almost identical

09:59.532 --> 10:05.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
laws as North Carolina, so this
is not just
a North Carolina issue -- is, we
-- I actually

10:06.039 --> 10:10.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
encourage other types of
arrangements for
people of transgender.

10:10.977 --> 10:18.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It might be a unisex restroom or
shower facility
that is not in a multipurpose
area, to respect

10:18.384 --> 10:23.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
both the unique needs of a
transgender or
to meet the unique needs of
girls and boys

10:23.790 --> 10:27.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and men and women and their
families, which
are the norms that we have been
using in America

10:27.827 --> 10:31.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for generations. It is a very
complex issue.

10:31.130 --> 10:36.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm extremely sensitive to
people's gender
identity, which is a brand-new
term in the

10:37.036 --> 10:42.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last several years. But they are
now interpreting,
not only gender identity.
There's a new term,

10:42.342 --> 10:47.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gender expression, which has not
been clearly
defined. And we need to get that
definition.

10:47.981 --> 10:51.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't think it's the
executive branch's
role to define that.

10:51.851 --> 10:55.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that belongs either in
the courts.
Or, frankly, I think the U.S.
Congress needs

10:56.022 --> 11:01.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to quit ignoring this issue.
And, by the way,
I'm talking to my Republicans. I
think they

11:01.160 --> 11:04.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need to get clarity on this
issue for all
of the nation and all employers.

11:05.098 --> 11:10.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Governor McCrory,
do you know
anyone who is transgender, and,
if so, what

11:10.703 --> 11:12.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have they said to you about
this?

11:12.705 --> 11:17.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. PAT MCCRORY: You know,
different reactions.
Some of the transgender
community that I have

11:17.343 --> 11:21.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talked to is frankly upset that
the political
left brought this up, because
they didn't

11:21.381 --> 11:23.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think there was much of a
problem.

11:23.283 --> 11:27.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I didn't know -- we weren't
having a problem
in North Carolina until the city
of Charlotte,

11:27.887 --> 11:32.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
before that, the city of
Houston, brought
up a mandate for all private
sector employers.

11:32.191 --> 11:37.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I might add, just six months
ago, the
city of Houston rejected by a 61
percent of

11:37.230 --> 11:39.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the vote of the people a similar
mandate.

11:39.732 --> 11:45.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And no one, including the
attorney general,
attacked the city of Houston.
But, for some

11:45.705 --> 11:50.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reason, they're now attacking
the state where
she grew up in. And, again, this
is not just

11:51.044 --> 11:56.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a North Carolina issue. This
needs clarity
by the courts and by the U.S.
Congress.

11:56.382 --> 12:02.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think we should have
different anti-discrimination
laws relating to this across the
nation. I

12:02.488 --> 12:09.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think this is a federal issue,
as most discrimination
laws are. And I think we need
consistency.

12:09.696 --> 12:13.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is where the courts
need to step
in. And I am very, very
sensitive to all sides

12:13.399 --> 12:15.068 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of this issue.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly,
Governor, we
have just a few seconds left. We
know that

12:17.270 --> 12:21.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a number of businesses have
expressed their
unhappiness about this, said
that they're

12:21.140 --> 12:25.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
either not going to move to the
state or they're
not going to bring events to the
state. How

12:25.178 --> 12:29.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
big a hit are you prepared to
take to see
North Carolina take financially?

12:29.115 --> 12:30.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GOV. PAT MCCRORY: Well, that's
why I am taking
it to the courts.

12:31.084 --> 12:36.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are had one business, PayPal,
which, by
the way, does business in Sudan,
and Iran

12:36.322 --> 12:41.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Saudi Arabia, where the gay
and lesbian
community is not welcomed at
all. In fact,

12:41.728 --> 12:47.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are killed. So there is a
little selective
hypocrisy by one or two
companies.

12:47.467 --> 12:51.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we want to work with the
private sector.
And, again, this is not just a
North Carolina

12:51.304 --> 12:54.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issue. This is going to be an
issue for the
entire United States, and I
think the federal

12:55.041 --> 13:00.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government does need to step in
through the
courts or through the U.S.
Congress and give

13:00.213 --> 13:05.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us all clarity in not only state
government,
but local governments throughout
the United

13:05.485 --> 13:06.853 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

13:06.953 --> 13:10.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: North Carolina
Governor Pat
McCrory, we thank you.

13:10.690 --> 13:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GOV. PAT MCCRORY: Thank you very
much, Judy.

13:21.000 --> 13:27.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the race
for the White
House and one major divide
between Donald

13:27.907 --> 13:31.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump and Hillary Clinton: how
they will approach
women voters.

13:31.811 --> 13:35.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang reports.

13:35.915 --> 13:38.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
How are you?

13:39.085 --> 13:40.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: I'm doing well. How are
you?
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Good.
JOHN YANG: For Hillary Clinton,
this is what
a pivot to the general election
looks like.

13:41.087 --> 13:45.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Looking beyond tomorrow's West
Virginia primary,
the Democratic front-runner was
talking family

13:45.692 --> 13:47.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
issues in Virginia.

13:47.694 --> 13:52.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I would
like to see
us look at universal pre-K in
the school system.

13:52.932 --> 13:59.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then we need to take a hard look
at how we
have a child care system that
does provide

13:59.172 --> 14:02.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
quality child care at an
affordable cost.

14:02.475 --> 14:06.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It's not just that
rival Bernie
Sanders is favored in West
Virginia.

14:06.279 --> 14:10.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
Don't let anybody tell you this
campaign is

14:10.116 --> 14:11.818 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
over.

14:11.918 --> 14:15.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: It's that this
bedroom community
outside Washington, D.C., is
likely to be

14:15.254 --> 14:20.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a key battleground in November.
One challenge
for the candidate who wants to
be the first

14:20.560 --> 14:27.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
woman president? Winning the
votes of suburban
women, like Amy Fitzgerald of
Chantilly, Virginia.

14:27.667 --> 14:32.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She voted for Clinton in the
primary, but
says the former secretary of
state doesn't

14:32.538 --> 14:34.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
understand the challenges of her
life.

14:34.741 --> 14:38.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY FITZGERALD, Virginia: It's
like she's
a puppet. Like I said, it's like
somebody

14:39.045 --> 14:44.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is handing her a piece of paper
and says,
OK, this is what America wants
to hear. This

14:44.117 --> 14:48.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is what you need to say. And
it's not really,
truly coming from her heart.

14:48.488 --> 14:53.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mary McLean twice
voted for Barack
Obama and then for Donald Trump
in Virginia's

14:54.093 --> 14:57.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
primary. Now she says she hoping
for a third
candidate.

14:57.964 --> 15:03.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY MCLEAN, Virginia: When it
comes to Hillary
Clinton, I think -- I get the
impression,

15:03.169 --> 15:08.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as much as she champion's
women's rights and
the rights -- the importance of
family, say

15:08.908 --> 15:12.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was, I would say, in the pockets
of big banks
when it came to the bailout.

15:12.478 --> 15:18.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Clinton's focus today
on suburban
women in this swing county in a
swing state

15:18.117 --> 15:23.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is part of her general election
strategy,
trying to win over independents
and Republicans

15:23.656 --> 15:26.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
uncomfortable with Donald Trump.

15:26.159 --> 15:30.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Over the weekend, Trump
criticize Clinton
over her husband's infidelities.

15:30.329 --> 15:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
And Hillary was an enabler, and
she treated

15:34.233 --> 15:40.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women horribly. Just remember
this. And some
of those women were destroyed,
not by him,

15:40.940 --> 15:45.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but by the way that Hillary
Clinton treated
them after everything went down.

15:46.012 --> 15:50.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The all-but-certain
Republican
nominee has also been waging
verbal warfare

15:50.416 --> 15:52.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with party leaders.

15:52.451 --> 15:57.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, House Speaker Paul Ryan
seemed to try
to ease tensions with Trump,
telling The Milwaukee

15:57.423 --> 16:02.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Journal Sentinel that he would
step down as
co-chairman of this July's
Republican Convention

16:02.562 --> 16:08.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if that's what Trump wants.
"He's the nominee.
I will do whatever he wants with
respect to

16:08.134 --> 16:09.902 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the convention."

16:10.002 --> 16:14.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump is also looking ahead,
today naming
former rival-turned-supporter
Chris Christie

16:14.740 --> 16:18.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to head the transition team for
a potential
administration.

16:18.377 --> 16:22.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang in Stone
Ridge, Virginia.

16:23.049 --> 16:28.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That brings us to
Politics
Monday with Amy Walter of The
Cook Political

16:28.321 --> 16:31.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Report and Tamara Keith of NPR.

16:31.257 --> 16:37.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, let's talk about Hillary
Clinton out on
the campaign trail today,
clearly trying to

16:37.196 --> 16:42.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
appeal, Tamara, to women voters
to make the
case that she's the one. And
yet, as you just

16:42.768 --> 16:47.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
heard in that John Yang report,
it is a mixed
picture. How mixed is it?

16:47.773 --> 16:51.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: It is
more mixed for Donald Trump than
it is for

16:51.811 --> 16:59.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton. Let's just be
clear. And
generally speaking, there is a
gender gap.

16:59.285 --> 17:08.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Going back to 1980, there is a
gender gap,
where women voters tend to favor
the Democrats.

17:08.127 --> 17:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the last -- all those years,
they have
favored the Democrat. And so she
has demographics

17:14.533 --> 17:19.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on her side, certainly. But she
is working
hard. And, as John Yang pointed
out, she was

17:20.006 --> 17:27.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there in this very swing county
where the
-- where the congresswoman, the
new congresswoman

17:27.446 --> 17:32.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who represents that district,
has said she's
not ready yet to support Donald
Trump. She's

17:32.785 --> 17:33.452 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a Republican.

17:33.552 --> 17:34.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: New Republican.

17:34.587 --> 17:35.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Yes.

17:35.321 --> 17:35.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's right.

17:35.922 --> 17:37.757 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Amy.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes, I would say
Hillary Clinton
has a problem with women. Donald
Trump's problems

17:39.759 --> 17:41.560 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are bigger.

17:41.661 --> 17:44.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you look at the last
polling that
has come out nationally, among
suburban women

17:45.031 --> 17:48.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- and, obviously, where we saw
the report
from John today, that's the key
area, swing

17:48.768 --> 17:55.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
area -- she was at minus-10 in
terms of her
approval ratings among suburban
women. However,

17:55.975 --> 17:57.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Donald Trump was at minus-46.

17:57.910 --> 18:02.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as you saw from these women
-- I have
sat down -- I'm sure you have
too on the campaign

18:02.281 --> 18:06.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trail. I have sat in focus
groups with women
in other suburbs. And what they
are saying

18:07.053 --> 18:12.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, they don't really love
Donald Trump or
what he -- his tone, his
temperament. They

18:12.658 --> 18:14.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like some of his positions on
the issues.

18:14.593 --> 18:19.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, more importantly, they are
not in love
with Hillary Clinton. They are
-- she's still

18:19.465 --> 18:22.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to have to work to get
them there. The
women who said they were voting
for her were

18:22.935 --> 18:26.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doing it much more as a vote
against Donald
Trump than for her.

18:26.505 --> 18:31.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, is there room
for Donald
Trump to gain with women,
Tamara? How do you

18:31.277 --> 18:32.144 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
read that?

18:32.244 --> 18:33.245 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, he certainly
has room.

18:33.346 --> 18:34.480 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

18:34.580 --> 18:36.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: There is lots of
running space
there.

18:36.449 --> 18:42.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not clear whether or not he
can actually
make up that ground. And how
does he do it?

18:42.421 --> 18:48.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, probably by changing the
way he's talking
right now, because, every time
he goes out,

18:48.728 --> 18:51.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he says another thing or repeats
something.

18:51.998 --> 18:58.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This woman's card, for instance,
that was
-- I don't know how many people
came on my

18:58.571 --> 19:03.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Twitter feed and said, I support
Bernie Sanders,
but, wow, this woman card thing
makes me want

19:03.709 --> 19:06.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to support Hillary Clinton,
things like that.

19:06.212 --> 19:10.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Donald Trump has a challenge
on his hands,
certainly.

19:10.216 --> 19:14.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about --
Amy, what about
Hillary Clinton? I mean, where
does she -- how

19:14.120 --> 19:17.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
does she get women more
enthusiastic about
her?

19:17.590 --> 19:19.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: She has to do two
things.

19:19.625 --> 19:25.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One, she has to convince voters
that it is
more than just a bad thing to
vote for Donald

19:25.898 --> 19:28.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump; it's a big risk. And I
think you're
going to be hearing that over
and over again.

19:28.968 --> 19:31.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We heard -- the dangerous Donald
was part
of the rhetoric.

19:31.570 --> 19:36.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's going to be on issues,
not just about
women's issues, but security. Do
you feel

19:36.442 --> 19:41.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
safe with him as the commander
in chief? So,
many of those sorts of
undertones, you are

19:41.113 --> 19:45.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to hear in advertising, I
think, both
from Hillary Clinton and others.

19:45.885 --> 19:51.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, at the end of the day,
though, if 2008
was hope and change,
unfortunately, I think

19:51.190 --> 19:55.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2016 is going to be fear and
loathing. And
it is going to be much more
about who do you

19:55.428 --> 19:57.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dislike less than who you like
more.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Brace ourselves
for it.

19:59.565 --> 20:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: It could be a very
grim six
months.

20:01.100 --> 20:04.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's talk
a little bit
more about Donald Trump.

20:04.470 --> 20:11.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Clearly, Tamara, we're
witnessing some kind
of split, not just split,
mega-divisions inside

20:12.011 --> 20:16.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Republican Party, as one
Republican after
another figures out what he or
she is going

20:16.782 --> 20:20.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do. How serious is this split
in the party
right now?

20:20.386 --> 20:23.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: It is very
serious. And it is
very public.

20:23.189 --> 20:28.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the mere fact that there is
a nominee,
essentially -- there's nothing
standing between

20:28.694 --> 20:35.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump, the nomination --
and his party
is not falling in line is a
significant sign,

20:35.701 --> 20:40.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that there are various members
of Congress,
the speaker of the House saying
he's not ready

20:40.372 --> 20:42.141 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
yet.

20:42.241 --> 20:48.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think that the
establishment Republicans
don't know what to do. They
still don't know

20:48.114 --> 20:51.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what to do with Donald Trump.
You know, the
whole never Trump movement was
about, well,

20:52.084 --> 20:55.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he is not conservative enough.
He's not a
real Republican.

20:55.154 --> 20:59.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Well, voters didn't care.
Republican voters
didn't care. And so I think that
the Republican

21:00.025 --> 21:04.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
establishment is now in this
place of just
not knowing what to do, how to
proceed, how

21:04.597 --> 21:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to keep their party, the party
that they think
it is or should be.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
this?

21:10.436 --> 21:12.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And I think there's
a big -- I
think there is a big divide
between how Republicans

21:12.505 --> 21:15.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Washington see this and how
Republican
voters are seeing this.

21:16.008 --> 21:20.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is what I am watching. I'm
less concerned
about what Paul Ryan and other
elites are

21:20.746 --> 21:24.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doing. I'm much more concerned
about how Republican
voters feel. And right now, it
is true they

21:25.084 --> 21:29.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are divided, only 72 percent of
Republicans
right now saying that they would
vote for

21:29.722 --> 21:32.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump up against Hillary
Clinton. That
is very low.

21:32.458 --> 21:38.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Normally, you want to hit 90
percent. If that
number starts moving closer to
90 percent,

21:38.931 --> 21:42.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then whether Paul Ryan is with
him or not
is not as significant. If it
doesn't move,

21:42.835 --> 21:46.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then that shows that Paul Ryan
reflects a
lot of the views of the
Republican Party.

21:46.338 --> 21:49.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you do hear,
just quickly
to both of you, the argument
from the Trump

21:49.208 --> 21:54.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
camp that, yes, we may not have
all Republicans
on board, but we are broadening
the picture

21:54.446 --> 21:56.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of voters who we can appeal to.

21:56.615 --> 21:58.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: That is exactly
what they are
saying.

21:58.784 --> 21:59.685 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

21:59.785 --> 22:01.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And it's not showing
up at all.

22:01.720 --> 22:04.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, his numbers with all
these groups
that you are talking about,
women, Democrats,

22:05.024 --> 22:10.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Latinos, younger voters,
independents, she
is doing better among them than
Obama did

22:10.396 --> 22:12.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
against Mitt Romney.

22:12.364 --> 22:16.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, is it -- so,
is this just
what they say while they figure
out what they're

22:16.702 --> 22:17.136 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going to do?

22:17.236 --> 22:19.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

22:19.305 --> 22:23.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Unless you say it's over,
looking at the demographics,
the Clinton campaign is very
concerned about

22:23.909 --> 22:28.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump. They are concerned
that this
is -- that people think this is
going to be

22:28.280 --> 22:31.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
easy for her. And it's not.

22:31.183 --> 22:36.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Chris Christie said, Donald
Trump threw
out the playbook. And I think
every one is

22:36.956 --> 22:38.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trying to figure out how to
react.

22:39.024 --> 22:40.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we have a
little bit
of time left...

22:41.093 --> 22:41.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: We have a lot of
time...

22:41.594 --> 22:42.995 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

22:43.095 --> 22:45.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... between now
and November
to see what's going on.

22:45.297 --> 22:51.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tamara Keith, Amy Walter, great
to you have
both. Thank you.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

22:54.640 --> 22:59.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Glad to be here.

22:59.578 --> 23:01.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

23:01.880 --> 23:06.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
reconciling the
Muslim population in the Balkans
after a brutal

23:06.785 --> 23:12.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
civil war; an investigation
sheds light on
rampant sexual abuse in private
schools; and

23:13.025 --> 23:17.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how America is struggling to
recycle its electronic
waste.

23:17.329 --> 23:23.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: Saudi Arabia's bold
plan to diversify
its economy by moving away from
oil, while

23:23.469 --> 23:26.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
facing a rise in Iran's
influence in the region.

23:26.672 --> 23:30.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We examine the kingdom's
challenges with Simon
Henderson, director of the Gulf
and Energy

23:30.542 --> 23:35.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Policy Program at the Washington
Institute,
and Sarah Ladislaw, a senior
fellow at the

23:35.614 --> 23:39.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Center for Strategic and
International Studies,
where she is director of its
energy and national

23:39.685 --> 23:40.619 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
security program.

23:40.719 --> 23:42.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Sarah, let me start with you.

23:42.621 --> 23:45.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Oil prices have gone up in the
last few days,
maybe because of the fires in
Canada. But

23:45.858 --> 23:51.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how big of an impact is the
change in specifically
oil or energy leadership in
Saudi Arabia?

23:52.064 --> 23:53.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH LADISLAW, Center for
Strategic and International
Studies: Well, it's pretty
significant, especially

23:53.799 --> 23:58.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you take the long view of
leadership on
energy policy within Saudi
Arabia.

23:58.570 --> 24:04.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think both of the response
that they had
the response that they had to
the oil -- the

24:04.510 --> 24:09.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of overcapacity in oil
supply in the
oil market in 2014, which have
led to the

24:09.715 --> 24:15.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
period we are now, where you
have sort of
lower oil prices, was really the
turning point

24:15.120 --> 24:19.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the way people viewed the
role that Saudi
Arabia was going to play in the
markets.

24:19.758 --> 24:24.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what happened over the
weekend was
a much-anticipated leadership
shift that falls

24:24.129 --> 24:27.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in line with that broader
message of, you
know, we're going to play a new
and different

24:28.033 --> 24:32.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
role in the oil market. We have
a new sort
of economic diversification
strategy. And

24:32.805 --> 24:36.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now we're going to have both the
institutional
structure and sort of the
leadership to lead

24:36.375 --> 24:38.210 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Simon
Henderson, how much
of this has to do with a power
grab or power

24:41.013 --> 24:46.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
struggle or shuffle inside Saudi
Arabia, the
deputy crown prince, Mohammed
Bin Salman,

24:46.251 --> 24:48.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
putting his fingerprint on
things?

24:48.153 --> 24:48.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIMON HENDERSON, Washington
Institute For
Near East Policy: Well, he's
certainly putting

24:49.021 --> 24:51.023 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his fingerprint on things.

24:51.123 --> 25:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a young man, 30 years
old. And he
has risen from nowhere, or
mostly nowhere.

25:00.466 --> 25:07.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he is the son of the king,
King Salman,
and so when King Salman came to
the throne

25:07.272 --> 25:12.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last year, since then, this
young man has
had a meteoric rise.

25:12.778 --> 25:18.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he appears to have a vision,
an economic
vision. He's announced a grand
plan for vision

25:18.951 --> 25:29.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2030, which is a much less of a
role for oil.
And I suspect also he's got a
vision for himself,

25:29.428 --> 25:32.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he wants to be the next
king of Saudi
Arabia.

25:32.731 --> 25:38.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Sarah, what
about that Vision
2030 project, the idea we equate
or we connect

25:38.404 --> 25:43.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Saudi Arabia with oil in our
heads, the idea
that they could be less
fossil-fuel-dependent

25:43.942 --> 25:45.744 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in 15 years?

25:45.844 --> 25:48.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH LADISLAW: Well, I think it
follows along
the lines of what you have seen
coming out

25:48.614 --> 25:53.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of Saudi Arabian energy
ministers and political
leadership for awhile, which is
this recognition

25:53.652 --> 25:56.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the energy landscape is
changing, right?

25:56.188 --> 25:59.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They understand that climate
change is an
issue that a lot of different
countries take

25:59.591 --> 26:03.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seriously. They have talked
about it quite
openly. They are involved in
most of the major

26:03.328 --> 26:06.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
multilateral initiatives to deal
with climate
change.

26:06.765 --> 26:10.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think if we weren't
talking about their
broad reform effort, we would be
talking about

26:10.402 --> 26:15.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their need to undertake economic
reform at
some point, given the outlook
for oil markets,

26:15.107 --> 26:18.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
given the role -- the outsized
role that it
plays in their own economy. And
so, in many

26:19.077 --> 26:26.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ways, this new vision is
actually an extension
and a much bolder extension of
domestic economic

26:26.685 --> 26:31.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reform that people have thought
needed to
happen in the kingdom for a long
time.

26:31.223 --> 26:34.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the thing that people
are surprised
about is that it's happening at
a much faster

26:34.593 --> 26:38.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pace than people are used to
seeing coming
from the Saudi kingdom.

26:38.630 --> 26:42.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Put this in
perspective
to the struggle that is
happening between

26:42.434 --> 26:45.270 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Saudi Arabia and Iran right now.

26:45.370 --> 26:52.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIMON HENDERSON: It's such a
struggle. And
it dominates so much thinking,
certainly in

26:52.177 --> 26:54.079 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Riyadh.

26:54.179 --> 27:00.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The house of Saud, the Saudi
family, are immensely
suspicious of Iran and, frankly,
on religious

27:00.919 --> 27:06.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terms, as Sunni Muslims, they're
very suspicious
of Shiite Muslims of Iran. On
top of that,

27:06.592 --> 27:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Iranian nuclear program
concerns them.
And they think the deal which
the Obama administration

27:14.666 --> 27:17.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
led last year is a lousy deal.

27:17.569 --> 27:22.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they're very concerned
about that.
For the moment, though, it's a
question of

27:22.975 --> 27:30.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
oil price. Originally, when the
Saudis allowed
the price of oil to fall, their
target were

27:30.115 --> 27:36.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. shale producers. And to an
extent, they
have made it uncomfortable for
U.S. shale

27:36.421 --> 27:41.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
producers. But they have got a
new target
now, which is Iran, which wants
to expand

27:41.927 --> 27:44.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
its oil production.

27:44.196 --> 27:50.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If that's going to happen, the
Saudis don't
want the Iranians to get much
revenue out

27:50.435 --> 27:56.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of it. So, they -- this is an
additional argument
why they want to keep the price
of oil comparatively

27:56.909 --> 27:58.744 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
low.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Sarah
Ladislaw, how do they
stay competitive here? Iran
wants to wake

28:00.979 --> 28:05.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up out of these sanctions. They
want to get
their market going and find a
lot of customers.

28:05.183 --> 28:09.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, Saudi Arabia
can pull more
crude oil out of the ground
faster than anyone

28:09.321 --> 28:12.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
else. And -- but they need that
money for
their society to function.

28:12.824 --> 28:14.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SARAH LADISLAW: It's a great
question.

28:14.826 --> 28:18.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I think when you look at
the -- what
the Saudis contribute to the oil
market historically

28:18.497 --> 28:22.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and currently, it's about 10
million barrels
a day. And they have, as you
said, the lowest

28:22.434 --> 28:25.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
listing costs in the world. And
they have
spare capacity, which means they
can bring

28:25.904 --> 28:27.706 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more on quickly.

28:27.806 --> 28:32.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that the real challenge
for them is
-- looking at this period long
term, is to

28:32.110 --> 28:37.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
try and insulate their economy
from volatile
oil markets, right? I mean, part
of what people

28:37.182 --> 28:42.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see in their activity today is
some of this
sort of geopolitical rivalry.

28:42.487 --> 28:46.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you look at it from an
oil market perspective
back in 2014, there is really
nothing they

28:46.325 --> 28:51.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could have done to stabilize oil
markets at
that time. And, therefore,
they're using the

28:51.463 --> 28:56.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
market to basically get rid of
the higher
cost oil in the system and then,
you know,

28:56.401 --> 29:01.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
look for being able to keep a
market share
perspective going forward.

29:01.206 --> 29:04.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been fairly successful thus
far. We were
oversupplied by about two
million barrels

29:05.077 --> 29:08.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a day about a year-and-a-half
ago. And things
are starting to come into
balance. The question

29:08.880 --> 29:15.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going forward really for any
major oil-producing
economy is, how in charge of
their oil economy

29:15.520 --> 29:22.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will they be? What kind of --
what can they
do to ratchet up or down
production?

29:22.160 --> 29:25.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for them, it's really a
question of how
dependent they are on that
revenue.

29:25.564 --> 29:29.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Sarah Ladislaw,
Simon Henderson, thanks so much.

29:29.101 --> 29:35.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SARAH LADISLAW: Thank you.

29:35.340 --> 29:44.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The nation of
Bosnia-Herzegovina
remains bitterly divided more
than 20 years

29:44.416 --> 29:51.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after a vicious civil war. Tens
of thousands
died, and millions were made
refugees.

29:51.289 --> 29:56.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bosnian Serbs were largely
responsible for
driving Muslim families from
their homes during

29:56.428 --> 30:02.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the early stages of the war. Now
many hope
the reopening of a United
Nations Heritage

30:02.868 --> 30:09.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Site, a mosque, in the Serbian
town of Banja
Luka is a big step on the road
to reconciliation.

30:09.941 --> 30:13.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant has
the story.

30:13.979 --> 30:23.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The Muslim call
to prayer
rang out from the 16th Century
Ferhadija Mosque

30:24.089 --> 30:31.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
23 years to the day that Serb
militiamen blew
it to pieces; 10,000 Muslims
traveled to Banja

30:31.296 --> 30:36.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Luka to witness this act of
renaissance, a
generation after the Serbs had
attempted to

30:36.601 --> 30:42.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
systematically erase not only
the population,
but also their culture and
heritage.

30:42.674 --> 30:49.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ibrahim Ahmedbasic lost his legs
in one of
the worst single attacks of the
war. He was

30:49.381 --> 30:55.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
21 when a Serb mortar exploded
in the town
of Tuzla, killing 71 and
injuring 250.

30:55.420 --> 30:59.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IBRAHIM AHMEDBASIC, Bosnian
Muslim (through
translator): When the mosques
began to be

30:59.291 --> 31:04.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reconstructed, people started to
coexist again.
So you can see, people are
capable of living

31:04.296 --> 31:06.098 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
normally.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The Bosnian War
was the most
vicious of those that
accompanied the break

31:08.967 --> 31:14.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up of former Yugoslavia, largely
because of
the population's complicated
ethnic and religious

31:14.372 --> 31:21.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mix. The conflict began in a
wave of nationalism
in 1992, when the Christian
Orthodox Bosnian

31:21.680 --> 31:27.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Serbs attempted a land grab and
attacked areas
occupied by predominantly
Catholic Bosnian

31:27.452 --> 31:29.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Croats and Muslims.

31:29.621 --> 31:35.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 1993, the country fragmented
still further,
when the Croats launched an
offensive against

31:35.627 --> 31:42.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Muslims. Peace finally
arrived in 1995
with a deal signed in Dayton,
Ohio. The accord

31:43.001 --> 31:49.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
preserved Bosnia as a single
state, but as
two separate entities, a
Muslim-Croat federation

31:49.307 --> 31:55.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the Serb Republic; 21 years
later, the
divisions are as entrenched as
ever.

31:56.014 --> 32:00.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Banja Luka is the capital of the
Serb Republic,
which makes the restoration of
the mosque

32:00.385 --> 32:07.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so symbolic. It took 15 years to
reconstruct.
Craftsmen employed 16th century
techniques

32:07.759 --> 32:13.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and recovered 75 percent of the
original masonry
that had been discarded in city
dumps and

32:13.598 --> 32:15.667 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in nearby lakes.

32:15.767 --> 32:24.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OSMAN KOZLIC, Imam: This is one
of the most
beautiful mosques in Balkan, not
just in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

32:24.910 --> 32:28.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Osman Kozlic is
the imam
of this World Heritage Site.

32:28.914 --> 32:34.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What is your message
specifically to the Serbs
in terms of reconciliation and
trying to move

32:34.519 --> 32:36.254 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on?

32:36.354 --> 32:41.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OSMAN KOZLIC: Our mosques, our
cathedrals,
our temples belong to all of
them, belong

32:41.626 --> 32:52.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to us. This is holy place, not
only for me,
as a Muslim, but it's holy place
for Catholics,

32:52.370 --> 33:00.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Orthodox Serbs. And if we
are -- think
in that way, we have a good
future.

33:00.712 --> 33:06.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The mosque has
special meaning
for 21-year-old Emir
Galijasevic, even though

33:06.251 --> 33:11.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was born just a year before
the war ended.
His family came from Banja Luka
and were among

33:11.790 --> 33:14.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those driven out during the
ethnic cleansing.

33:14.125 --> 33:17.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMIR GALIJASEVIC, Bosnia: All
the criminals
who had done bad things in the
war had to

33:17.896 --> 33:24.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be going from the court. But I
still think
people can still live together.
We can still

33:24.202 --> 33:34.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be friends and work together and
be as a mirror
to other place in Europe, that
multiculturalism

33:34.813 --> 33:41.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can live, and it's, I think, the
best example
of this is this mosque in this
town.

33:41.486 --> 33:46.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But segregation
has been
exacerbated by economic
stagnation. On both

33:46.658 --> 33:52.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sides of the tangible partition,
unemployment
is sky-high, especially among
the young. When

33:53.031 --> 33:58.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
part of Yugoslavia, this region
was reasonably
productive. Now it's anything
but.

33:58.670 --> 34:02.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Potential investors are
frightened away by
corruption and political
uncertainty.

34:03.074 --> 34:10.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pero Slavnic, a former major in
the Bosnian
Serb army, is campaigning for
better benefits

34:10.315 --> 34:16.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and pensions for military
veterans. Financial
hardship contributed to his
divorce. Three

34:16.354 --> 34:21.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of his sons are unemployed. And
he is weary
of politicians manipulating
public opinion.

34:21.593 --> 34:24.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PERO SLAVNIC, Bosnia (through
translator):
I think we are now further away
from being

34:24.863 --> 34:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
together without borders than
just after the
war. When foundations are
flawed, you become

34:29.301 --> 34:33.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
skeptical about everything,
including the
hand that reaches for you from
the other side.

34:33.872 --> 34:38.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are constantly asking, is
this an honest
hand? We have a lot of problems
in the area

34:38.176 --> 34:39.844 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of trust.

34:39.945 --> 34:44.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This would have
been the
perfect occasion for the Bosnian
Serb leader,

34:44.883 --> 34:50.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Milorad Dodik, to address the
issue of reconciliation.
Of all the dignitaries present,
his words

34:50.188 --> 34:54.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
would have carried most
significant, because,
after all, for many Muslims,
Banja Luka represents

34:54.960 --> 34:56.728 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the lion's den.

34:56.828 --> 35:00.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was due to make a keynote
speech, but he
clearly didn't like the tone of
this event

35:00.632 --> 35:06.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and elected not to speak. So, to
find out
what he thought, we headed past
the glittering

35:06.671 --> 35:09.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Serb Orthodox church to the
presidential palace
of the Serb Republic.

35:09.975 --> 35:14.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILORAD DODIK, President, Serb
Republic (through
translator): I am sorry that
Ferhadija was

35:14.279 --> 35:19.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
destroyed. But since then, we
were the ones
to support its reconstruction.
Evil times

35:19.384 --> 35:23.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happen. But people can't choose
those times.
We were born in that period.

35:23.788 --> 35:28.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what we can do is to ensure
that we don't
behave in an inhumane way.
Regardless of our

35:28.727 --> 35:32.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
religion, nationality and
ideology, we shouldn't
harm each other.

35:32.364 --> 35:37.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But former
Austrian diplomat
Valentin Inzko is skeptical.
He's responsible

35:37.769 --> 35:42.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the civilian implementation
of the Dayton
peace accord and is concerned
that Dodik's

35:42.207 --> 35:48.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
threat to secede from Bosnia is
poisoning
the atmosphere.

35:48.246 --> 35:53.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
gave some money for this
renovated mosque.
On the other side, the refugee
return is many

35:53.752 --> 35:59.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
times not so easy. People have
problems with
papers, et cetera. In schools,
they don't

35:59.424 --> 36:02.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- they're not allowed them to
speak their
own language.

36:02.594 --> 36:07.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He invented a different name for
the Bosnian
language and so on. So we have
to measure

36:07.132 --> 36:09.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
him on the ground, in the field.

36:10.035 --> 36:14.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This student
dormitory in
the wartime Bosnian Serb capital
Pale, a short

36:15.073 --> 36:20.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
distance from Sarajevo, is the
most current
source of Inzko's concerns. It
was named in

36:20.278 --> 36:25.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
honor of the wartime leader
Radovan Karadzic,
just as he was being sentenced
in late March

36:25.683 --> 36:29.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to 40 years imprisonment for
crimes against
humanity and genocide.

36:30.021 --> 36:36.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALENTIN INZKO: Imagine in our
country, we
would have such dormitories
glorifying Nazi

36:36.161 --> 36:42.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people, et cetera. It's totally
unacceptable
and this is really something
where Mr. Dodik

36:42.167 --> 36:43.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has crossed a red line.

36:44.069 --> 36:48.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: In Sarajevo,
besieged for
three years during the war,
Professor Muhamed

36:48.239 --> 36:54.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Hamidovic is a symbol of
reconciliation. His
wife was killed by a Serb mortar
fired from

36:54.279 --> 36:59.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the surrounding hills. He led
the reconstruction
of the Banja Luka mosque, but he
too is disillusioned.

36:59.784 --> 37:04.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MUHAMED HAMIDOVIC, Bosnia
(through translator):
We are still living in the past.
We need a

37:04.589 --> 37:09.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new global system. We need a new
approach
for young people. The current
situation is

37:09.894 --> 37:16.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
horrible. I have a son who
doesn't know where
to go or what to do. For five
years, he's

37:16.868 --> 37:22.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unemployed. That's a tragedy.
We're talking
about reconciliation, and that's
so abstract

37:22.273 --> 37:24.042 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to me.

37:24.142 --> 37:28.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Back in Pale,
Radovan Karadzic's
old stomping ground, three young
students

37:28.213 --> 37:33.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are weary of the lack of hope,
and of being
tainted by the Serb wartime
legacy that has

37:33.485 --> 37:35.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nothing to do them.

37:35.386 --> 37:38.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANOJELA BOROVCANIN, Bosnian Serb
Law Student:
It is really pointless to make
some differences

37:38.623 --> 37:45.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because people, because we are
all made of
bones and blood. And we are all
here for some

37:46.097 --> 37:51.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reason. We are here to live, and
we are here
to love, and we are here to
improve this world.

37:51.536 --> 37:58.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NENAD SAVIC, Bosnian Serb Law
Student: Bosnia-Herzegovina
is a place with too many fights
between people.

37:58.743 --> 38:02.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: They were affected by
everything that
happened here a long time ago
and people think

38:02.647 --> 38:08.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- still cannot let it go. And
that kind of
depressing. And there is like no
opportunity.

38:08.553 --> 38:14.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you go somewhere else, you
see all those
opportunities, and what can you
actually do

38:14.225 --> 38:16.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and what you cannot do here in
my country.

38:16.895 --> 38:22.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: If the
Ferhadija Mosque is
to be a component in breaking
down the barriers,

38:22.367 --> 38:26.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Western officials believe more
Muslims need
to pluck up the courage to
return to their

38:26.638 --> 38:29.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
former homes in what is still
the Serb heartland.

38:29.641 --> 38:38.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the Serbs also need to offer
genuine guarantees.
Ordinary people on either side
are forging

38:38.550 --> 38:42.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bonds. But it's widely accepted
that politicians
are getting in the way.

38:43.021 --> 38:49.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Banja Luka.

38:49.861 --> 39:01.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The past
couple of years
have brought new revelations
about sexual

39:01.105 --> 39:05.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
abuse at private schools. At
least eight private
schools in New England have
launched or disclosed

39:06.044 --> 39:08.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
investigations this year.

39:08.179 --> 39:13.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now a Boston Globe investigation
has opened
a wider window on the scope of
the problem.

39:13.284 --> 39:18.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The report done by the Spotlight
unit that
exposed the sexual abuse scandal
in the church

39:18.156 --> 39:24.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
found at least 67 New England
schools have
faced accusations since 1991.
The Globe also

39:24.662 --> 39:31.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
found more than 200 former
students say they
have been assaulted or harassed,
and years

39:31.135 --> 39:33.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of alleged cover-ups in some
cases.

39:33.338 --> 39:36.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
St. George's School in Rhode
Island is one
school under investigation.

39:36.975 --> 39:43.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anne Scott is a survivor who was
allegedly
raped in 1977 at the school by a
former athletic

39:43.781 --> 39:48.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trainer when she was 15. Her
family later
brought a lawsuit, but the Globe
said the

39:49.053 --> 39:54.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
school fought back with its own
suit and pressured
her to sign a gag order.

39:54.259 --> 39:56.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here's part of what she told The
Globe.

39:56.194 --> 40:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE SCOTT, Abuse Survivor: They
really turned
hostile and were trying to come
after that,

40:02.800 --> 40:09.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deposing all our neighbors,
deposing all my
roommates, all community
members.

40:09.540 --> 40:16.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I got shocked. I wasn't as
strong then,
I think, to put it in context,
as I am now.

40:16.581 --> 40:22.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it became a lot of pressure.
I just said,
no amount of money is worth
tearing my family

40:22.654 --> 40:28.126 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
apart.

40:28.226 --> 40:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you are assaulted as a
child and a victim
of rape, you lose your voice.
You lose your

40:35.500 --> 40:44.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
soul. You are sort of destroyed
as a person,
your confidence, your
self-image. And the

40:44.976 --> 40:50.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gag order just seals all that
in.

40:50.214 --> 40:54.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The trainer
died in 1996.

40:54.819 --> 40:59.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lawyers for victims now say as
many as 50
alumni from the school were
abused, mostly

41:00.091 --> 41:01.392 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
by staff.

41:01.492 --> 41:03.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Todd Wallack is a member of the
Spotlight
team, joins me now.

41:03.828 --> 41:07.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, give us an idea of how
widespread this
is. This isn't just a couple of
private schools

41:07.999 --> 41:09.734 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in New England.

41:09.834 --> 41:16.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TODD WALLACK, The Boston Globe:
No, it's much
wider than a lot of us ever
imagined.

41:16.140 --> 41:23.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We originally started reporting
on this after
Anne Scott, the survivor you
featured, broke

41:23.214 --> 41:28.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her silence, broke the gag order
and spoke
out about the abuse that she
suffered at St.

41:28.419 --> 41:34.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
George's in December. And that
prompted other
victims to come forward, many
after decades

41:34.258 --> 41:36.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and decades where they had kept
this secret.

41:36.828 --> 41:42.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we started building a list.
And it kept
getting longer and longer. Some
were reported

41:42.934 --> 41:49.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before individually. Others
hadn't. We looked
through lawsuits. We talked to
lawyers. Since

41:49.807 --> 41:54.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our story on Sunday, we have
been getting
flooded with tips about
additional schools,

41:54.245 --> 42:00.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
showing that we have not even
captured the
full scope of all the abuse
that's gone on.

42:00.685 --> 42:04.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Given by the
nature of their
name, private schools, they are
private institutions,

42:04.989 --> 42:11.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do they have to report alleged
-- or abuse
by teachers to the state, like
public schools

42:11.229 --> 42:13.030 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do?

42:13.131 --> 42:16.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TODD WALLACK: Generally, in
public schools,
teachers are required to be
licensed, and

42:16.367 --> 42:21.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're overseen by licensing
agencies that
can publicly discipline them and
let other

42:21.139 --> 42:24.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people be aware of potential
problems.

42:24.575 --> 42:29.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That isn't true with private
schools, which
generally don't have to license
their educators.

42:29.881 --> 42:34.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're also not subject to
public records
law. They're not overseen by
public school

42:34.352 --> 42:36.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
boards with open meetings laws.

42:36.387 --> 42:44.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So a lot of this information is
kept secret.
They are able to sign
confidentiality agreements.

42:44.495 --> 42:50.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for that reason, it allows a
lot of the
abuse to remain secret. It
potentially allows

42:50.735 --> 42:52.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
abusers to go to other schools.

42:52.637 --> 42:55.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There were
actually abusers
that were moving from school to
school, but

42:56.073 --> 43:00.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the parents in these new
schools, or the faculty,
nobody actually knew that.

43:00.611 --> 43:02.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TODD WALLACK: Yes, exactly.

43:02.613 --> 43:09.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a person that worked
at St. George's,
for instance, George (sic)
Thompson, who had

43:09.520 --> 43:16.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been accused by, I believe, a
dozen students
of inappropriate touching, went
to another

43:16.527 --> 43:23.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
school, Taft, a few years ago
with great recommendations.
And Taft had no idea that he had
been previously

43:23.935 --> 43:25.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
subject to those allegations.

43:25.870 --> 43:31.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
St. George's hadn't told the
state, and said
at the time they didn't realize.
It was -- fell

43:31.375 --> 43:37.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
under the definition of sexual
abuse and needed
to be reported. And we found 11
people who

43:37.782 --> 43:41.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had been accused went on to
other schools.

43:41.152 --> 43:44.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, what do
the schools
say? What is their rationale or
justification

43:44.989 --> 43:47.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for taking so long to go public
with this
information?

43:48.059 --> 43:53.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TODD WALLACK: Well, in some
cases, schools
will say a lot of these abuses
happened in

43:53.664 --> 43:59.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the '60s or '70s or '80s, and
they now know
more about how to handle it than
they once

43:59.570 --> 44:01.372 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
did.

44:01.472 --> 44:05.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some will say that sexual abuse
allegations
are very tricky. They want to
respect the

44:05.376 --> 44:12.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
privacy of the victims. They
want to also
be cognizant that they can't
always prove

44:12.250 --> 44:20.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allegations. In a lot of cases,
you have an
alumnus who makes some
accusation, and the

44:20.124 --> 44:23.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
staffer is the only other person
who was in
the room, and the staffer denies
it.

44:23.995 --> 44:30.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they say they're trying to be
careful about
not ruining somebody's career.
Some of those

44:30.468 --> 44:34.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
students who have been abused
say they are
too worried about their
reputation and wish

44:35.006 --> 44:40.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they had done more to at least
tell the community
about the allegations and find
out whether

44:40.645 --> 44:42.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there are other students Wanting
to come forward.

44:42.847 --> 44:45.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Todd Wallack
of The Boston Globe, thanks so
much.

44:45.650 --> 44:47.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TODD WALLACK: Thank you.
Appreciate it.

44:47.585 --> 45:02.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You buy a new
smartphone or
computer, and you take your old
one to a local

45:02.767 --> 45:05.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recycler. It's the green thing
to do, right?

45:05.336 --> 45:10.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, it turns out a lot of
those devices
may not be getting recycled at
all.

45:10.508 --> 45:16.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From Seattle member station KCTS
and public
media's environmental
partnership EarthFix,

45:16.480 --> 45:21.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Ken Christensen and Katie
Campbell, who tells
the tory, follow the e-waste
trail.

45:21.819 --> 45:25.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM PUCKETT, Founder, Basel
Action Network:
So, everybody, this is scenario
one. We're

45:25.523 --> 45:31.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
buying equipment. We look around
and see what
they have and we start haggling
over the price.

45:31.596 --> 45:32.496 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So any questions?

45:32.597 --> 45:33.998 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: No, sir.

45:34.098 --> 45:36.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIM PUCKETT: I think it's right
up here about
a quarter of a mile.

45:37.068 --> 45:42.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE CAMPBELL, Jim Puckett is
leading a team
that's going undercover to find
out what actually

45:43.040 --> 45:46.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happens to electronics that are
sent to U.S.
recyclers.

45:46.310 --> 45:50.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM PUCKETT: Most of the public
still thinks
that the recyclers are
recycling, and that

45:50.715 --> 45:52.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they are going to recycle right
there in America.

45:52.984 --> 45:54.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It shows us 10 meters out.

45:54.952 --> 45:58.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE CAMPBELL: Puckett is the
founder of
the Basel Action Network, a
Seattle-based

45:58.723 --> 46:02.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
watchdog group that investigates
the afterlife
of electronics.

46:02.360 --> 46:06.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM PUCKETT: We are basically
trying to stop
the rich countries from dumping
their hazardous

46:06.497 --> 46:07.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
waste onto poor countries.

46:07.865 --> 46:10.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KATIE CAMPBELL: In this case,
China.

46:10.334 --> 46:12.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: They're running.

46:12.269 --> 46:14.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JIM PUCKETT: Running away?

46:14.805 --> 46:16.540 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:16.641 --> 46:21.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE CAMPBELL: To get inside, a
local driver
and translator posed as e-waste
buyers.

46:21.412 --> 46:30.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
Hello? We're here
to buy goods. We just want to
see the electronics.

46:30.988 --> 46:37.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE CAMPBELL: With people
buying new computers
and other electronics more
frequently than

46:37.928 --> 46:43.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ever, electronic waste is now
the fastest-growing
waste stream in the world. On
top of that,

46:43.534 --> 46:48.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it contains toxic materials that
can poison
people and the environment.

46:48.406 --> 46:53.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This investigation began months
ago, when
Puckett's team put GPS tracking
devices inside

46:53.511 --> 46:58.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
200 old computers, printers and
TVs. Then
they dropped them off at
locations across

46:58.449 --> 47:04.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the country at recycling
facilities, donation
centers and electronics
take-back programs,

47:04.689 --> 47:07.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
including some of the industry's
most reputable
companies.

47:07.324 --> 47:11.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM PUCKETT: We sat back and
said, where are
they going to go? And the little
devices went

47:12.063 --> 47:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out and spoke to us, saying,
this is where
I am.

47:15.166 --> 47:18.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE CAMPBELL: Puckett's group
partnered
with Carlo Ratti of the
Senseable City Lab

47:18.502 --> 47:20.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology.

47:20.337 --> 47:23.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARLO RATTI, Senseable City Lab:
Tracking
is really the first step in
order to design

47:23.974 --> 47:29.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a better system. One of the
surprising things
we discovered is how far waste
travels. You

47:29.113 --> 47:33.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see this kind of global e-waste
flows that
actually almost cover the whole
planet.

47:33.484 --> 47:38.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE CAMPBELL: Each device
traveled an average
of about 2,500 miles, and around
a third of

47:39.023 --> 47:45.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the tracked computers were
exported. Of those,
most ended up here. Hong Kong is
home to one

47:45.863 --> 47:51.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the world's busiest ports.
Ships deliver
more cargo than is possible to
inspect.

47:51.235 --> 47:55.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a result, Hong Kong has a
reputation for
being a transit point for
illegal trade and

47:55.773 --> 48:03.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
smuggling of all kinds. Most of
the exported
tracked devices led Puckett to a
little known

48:03.814 --> 48:05.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
part of Hong Kong called the New
Territories.

48:05.950 --> 48:09.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIM PUCKETT: It's really a
frontier. It's
really cowboy land out there.

48:09.787 --> 48:14.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE CAMPBELL: Puckett followed
one tracked
printer here to a place that
calls itself

48:14.191 --> 48:14.992 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a farm.

48:15.092 --> 48:16.327 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Farmland.

48:16.427 --> 48:21.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIM PUCKETT: Farmland? Yes,
that's a great
farm in there.

48:21.132 --> 48:27.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You would have no idea that
there was a huge
scrap yard there until you look
over the fence.

48:28.072 --> 48:31.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE CAMPBELL: Inside, they
found printers
being taken apart by immigrant
workers.

48:31.709 --> 48:36.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM PUCKETT: I am looking for
asset tags to
tell me where the material came
from. I look

48:36.447 --> 48:40.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the environmental harm
issues. I look
for the workstations to see how
these workers

48:40.985 --> 48:42.720 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
might be exposed.

48:42.820 --> 48:47.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE CAMPBELL: Many of the
workers handle
hazardous material without
protective gear.

48:47.158 --> 48:50.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One concern? Printer toner, a
probable carcinogen.

48:50.494 --> 48:55.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JIM PUCKETT: There is no
protections of this
labor force. There's no
occupational laws

48:55.266 --> 48:57.568 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that are going to protect them.

48:57.668 --> 49:01.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE CAMPBELL: Jackson Lau is
the head of
the Hong Kong Recycling
Association. He runs

49:01.939 --> 49:06.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a licensed recycling facility in
the New Territories.
And he says the junkyards in the
area that

49:06.710 --> 49:09.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
import e-waste are unlicensed
and unregulated.

49:09.346 --> 49:13.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKSON LAU, Hong Kong Recycling
Association
(through translator): These old
electronics

49:13.250 --> 49:17.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are usually being sorted and
dismantled, because
the leftover components are
worthless. They

49:18.088 --> 49:20.024 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
are being dumped
indiscriminately.

49:20.124 --> 49:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIM PUCKETT: Look at the tubes,
many, many
tubes thrown on the ground here.

49:28.666 --> 49:33.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KATIE CAMPBELL: The white
fluorescent tubes
light up LCD screens. Each of
them contains

49:33.604 --> 49:35.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mercury, and even a tiny amount
can be a neurotoxin.

49:35.973 --> 49:40.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM PUCKETT: Day in and day out,
these workers
are completely oblivious to this
hazard, are

49:41.011 --> 49:47.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
smashing these. The tubes are
breaking right
in front of their faces, and
mercury is very

49:47.251 --> 49:48.319 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
toxic.

49:48.419 --> 49:49.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): Do
you wear a
mask?

49:49.587 --> 49:51.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): No.

49:51.455 --> 49:57.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I ask him that if he
knows that the
white tubes are dangerous. He
has no idea.

49:57.294 --> 50:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE CAMPBELL: The United
States is the only
developed nation that hasn't
ratified an international

50:02.867 --> 50:08.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
treaty to stop First World
countries from
dumping e-waste on developing
nations. Other

50:08.906 --> 50:14.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
developed nations set e-waste
collection mandates
and require electronics
manufacturers to pay

50:14.411 --> 50:16.680 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for domestic e-waste processing.

50:16.780 --> 50:21.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Further, the United States has
no federal
laws requiring electronics to be
recycled.

50:22.019 --> 50:27.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Half of states allow electronics
to be dumped
in landfills.

50:28.092 --> 50:33.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Shegerian is the CEO of
Electronics Recycling
International, the largest
e-waste recycling

50:33.497 --> 50:35.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
company in the United States.

50:35.299 --> 50:37.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN SHEGERIAN, CEO, Electronics
Recycling
International: It takes hundreds
of employees

50:38.002 --> 50:41.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in each facility to do the real
work of electronic
recycling.

50:41.772 --> 50:46.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE CAMPBELL: He says that
some recyclers
are exporting to cut costs,
because, in the

50:46.577 --> 50:49.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last two years, their biggest
source of revenue
has plummeted.

50:50.080 --> 50:55.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN SHEGERIAN: At the height of
the market,
when we would go to sell steel,
plastic, aluminum,

50:55.786 --> 51:03.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gold, silver, palladium, copper,
we were getting
about 14 to 15 cents a pound
more than we

51:03.294 --> 51:05.162 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are today.

51:05.262 --> 51:09.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Dell Reconnect, an
exciting program
that makes getting rid of old
technology easy.

51:09.967 --> 51:14.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE CAMPBELL: Dell was the
first major computer
manufacturer to ban the export
of nonworking

51:14.471 --> 51:19.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
electronics to developing
countries. They
partnered with Goodwill,
allowing people to

51:19.343 --> 51:24.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drop off old computers of any
brand for free
to be refurbished or recycled.
The electronics

51:24.748 --> 51:28.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are either dismantled on site or
sent to Dell's
recycling partners.

51:28.619 --> 51:32.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dell says that more than 400
million pounds
of e-waste have been diverted
from U.S. landfills

51:32.756 --> 51:37.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because of their program. But
the Basel Action
Network and MIT's investigation
concluded

51:37.928 --> 51:41.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the tracking devices placed
in old computers
and dropped off at participating
Goodwill

51:41.999 --> 51:47.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
locations ended up in Hong Kong,
China, Taiwan,
and Thailand.

51:47.137 --> 51:49.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Beth Johnson manages Dell's
program.

51:49.206 --> 51:50.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETH JOHNSON, Dell Reconnect: If
there's something
that did not follow the system,
we would certainly

51:50.741 --> 51:55.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want to know about it and we
would certainly
take corrective action.

51:55.412 --> 52:00.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE CAMPBELL: In a written
statement, Goodwill
Industries said it is committed
to responsible

52:00.351 --> 52:06.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recycling, and encouraged its
member organizations,
which are autonomous, to review
their contracts

52:06.156 --> 52:08.359 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Dell.

52:08.459 --> 52:11.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in Hong Kong, Puckett finds
more clues
to the scale of the problem.

52:11.295 --> 52:18.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM PUCKETT: A laptop with an
LCD screen,
ending up here in Hong Kong in
New Territories

52:18.135 --> 52:21.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from the Los Angeles school
system. Unbelievable.

52:21.705 --> 52:26.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE CAMPBELL: Puckett finds
electronics
from U.S. police departments,
jails, hospitals,

52:26.777 --> 52:28.579 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and libraries.

52:28.679 --> 52:32.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM PUCKETT: The government is
always trying
to save taxpayers' money. So
they are obliged

52:33.050 --> 52:35.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in some cases to always do the
cheapest thing.

52:35.519 --> 52:38.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATIE CAMPBELL: For now, market
forces are
driving e-waste exports.

52:38.355 --> 52:40.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIM PUCKETT: Just throwing it on
the bank
here.

52:40.290 --> 52:43.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KATIE CAMPBELL: Without a
federal law banning
the export of e-waste, there's
little incentive

52:44.094 --> 52:46.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the industry to change.

52:46.330 --> 52:51.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For KCTS and the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Katie
Campbell.

52:51.435 --> 53:00.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tune in
tonight on PBS for
a special two-night event
examining the nation's

53:00.711 --> 53:05.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rising gun violence. Watch new
documentary
films from "Independent Lens,"
"Peace Officer"

53:05.249 --> 53:10.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and "The Armor of Light,"
followed by special
town hall discussions hosted by
NPR's Michel

53:10.788 --> 53:12.056 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Martin.

53:12.156 --> 53:13.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm
Hari Sreenivasan.

53:13.323 --> 53:15.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

53:15.292 --> 53:18.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening. For all of us at the
"PBS NewsHour,"

53:18.662 --> 53:28.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.
