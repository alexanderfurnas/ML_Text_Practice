JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:06.406 --> 00:07.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.407 --> 00:08.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And I'm Miles
O'Brien.

00:08.408 --> 00:10.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:

00:10.210 --> 00:11.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE (R), Vice President
of the United
States: The action that people
are seeing

00:11.144 --> 00:13.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in these early days is just the
beginning.

00:13.046 --> 00:16.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In his first
television interview
since the inauguration, Vice
President Mike

00:16.483 --> 00:17.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pence sits down with me to talk
the first
days in office and the
president's Supreme

00:17.484 --> 00:19.319 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Court pick.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: I do believe that,
as Judge Gorsuch
travels across Capitol Hill in
the weeks ahead,

00:21.221 --> 00:22.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sitting down with Republicans
and Democrats,
they're going to see what the
president saw.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Also ahead this
Wednesday:
a deep-dive look at Judge
Gorsuch, and what

00:24.324 --> 00:26.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his past decisions can tell us
about the future
of the court.

00:26.326 --> 00:27.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, in Ghana,
how clean cooking
technology may help reduce
exposure to dangerous

00:27.227 --> 00:27.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
smoke for mothers and their
children.

00:27.494 --> 00:29.263 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

00:29.296 --> 00:30.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KWAKU POKU ASANTE, Kintampo
Health Research
Center: I'm really committed to
this because

00:31.031 --> 00:31.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
millions of people die from
these illnesses,
and we have to do something
about it.

00:31.565 --> 00:32.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have to stop it.

00:32.833 --> 00:33.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:33.133 --> 00:34.902 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:34.935 --> 00:43.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
has named his
Supreme Court nominee, and now
the battle

00:43.510 --> 00:45.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
begins for his confirmation.

00:45.946 --> 00:50.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senators form both political
parties began
lining up today, and Mr. Trump
warned Democrats

00:50.651 --> 00:52.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not to filibuster.

00:52.319 --> 00:54.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins begins our
coverage.

00:54.354 --> 00:59.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The president
was out early
today, touting the man he wants
on the high

00:59.993 --> 01:01.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
court, Neil Gorsuch.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
He is just a spectacular man.

01:03.830 --> 01:10.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think he will be a spectacular
-- you tell
me, how would they go about
opposing him?

01:10.304 --> 01:12.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's perfect in almost every
way.

01:12.339 --> 01:16.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That at a
meeting of conservative
and business groups, from the
Chamber of Commerce,

01:16.143 --> 01:20.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to the National Rifle
Association, to the
National Right to Life
Foundation.

01:20.480 --> 01:25.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump vowed to push through
Gorsuch, and,
if Democrats filibuster, he said
Senate Majority

01:25.686 --> 01:28.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Leader Mitch McConnell should do
what it takes.

01:28.155 --> 01:33.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: If we end up with
that gridlock,
I would say, if you can, Mitch,
go nuclear,

01:33.527 --> 01:40.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
because that would be an
absolute shame, if
a man of this quality was caught
up in this

01:40.767 --> 01:42.602 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
web.

01:42.636 --> 01:45.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The so-called
nuclear option,
considered a monumental change
in rules, would

01:45.839 --> 01:52.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allow the Senate to confirm a
nominee with
a simple majority, rather than
60 votes.

01:52.879 --> 01:55.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator McConnell met with
Gorsuch on Capitol
Hill today.

01:55.916 --> 01:59.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the Senate floor, no mention
of the nuclear
option.

01:59.186 --> 02:04.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But McConnell stressed that
Democrats supported
Gorsuch to be a federal appeals
judge in 2006.

02:04.491 --> 02:06.259 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: He
was confirmed without any votes
in opposition.

02:08.929 --> 02:16.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's right, Madam President,
not a single
Democrat opposed Judge Gorsuch's
nomination.

02:16.670 --> 02:24.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not Senator Barack Obama, not
Senator Hillary
Clinton, not Senators Joe Biden
or Ted Kennedy.

02:24.044 --> 02:28.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But Minority
Leader Chuck
Schumer said any talk of a rule
change should

02:28.849 --> 02:29.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be off the table.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.618 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: The
answer shouldn't be to change
the rules of

02:33.520 --> 02:42.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Senate, but to change the
nominee to someone
who can earn 60 votes; 60 votes
produces a

02:42.062 --> 02:43.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
mainstream candidate.

02:43.997 --> 02:48.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Already several
Democrats
said they will try to hold up
Gorsuch's confirmation,

02:48.802 --> 02:54.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including Elizabeth Warren of
Massachusetts
and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, among
others.

02:54.474 --> 02:59.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many are still outraged over the
Republican
refusal last year to consider
Merrick Garland,

02:59.613 --> 03:03.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
former President Obama's pick to
fill the
Supreme Court vacancy.

03:03.316 --> 03:07.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As it stands, all 52 Senate
Republicans are
expected to support Gorsuch.

03:07.821 --> 03:11.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They need at least eight other
votes to get
to 60.

03:11.425 --> 03:17.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One possible factor, 23
Democratic senators
are up for reelection in 2018,
including 10

03:17.998 --> 03:21.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in states that Mr. Trump won
last November.

03:21.268 --> 03:28.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Senate did vote today to
confirm former
ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson for
secretary

03:28.341 --> 03:30.143 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of state.

03:30.177 --> 03:34.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the nominee for attorney
general, Alabama
Senator Jeff Sessions, made it
out of committee

03:34.314 --> 03:36.149 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on a straight, party-line vote.

03:36.183 --> 03:41.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In an extraordinary hearing,
Republicans on
the Senate Finance Committee
suspended their

03:41.054 --> 03:46.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rules to push through nominees
for treasury
secretary, Steve Mnuchin, and
health and human

03:46.359 --> 03:51.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
services, Tom Price, that after
Democrats
boycotted and froze the
committee, which requires

03:51.465 --> 03:54.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at least one Democrat be
present.

03:54.167 --> 03:58.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In response, Republican Chairman
Orrin Hatch
moved to suspend that rule.

03:58.138 --> 04:00.107 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:00.140 --> 04:03.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ORRIN HATCH (R), Utah: We took
some unprecedented
actions today due to the
unprecedented obstruction

04:03.310 --> 04:05.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on the part of our colleagues.

04:05.178 --> 04:08.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Elsewhere,
Democrats delayed
committee votes on the nominees
to head the

04:08.181 --> 04:13.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Environmental Protection Agency,
Scott Pruitt,
and Office of Budget and
Management, Mick

04:13.386 --> 04:15.255 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mulvaney.

04:15.288 --> 04:19.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, two Republican
senators, Lisa Murkowski
of Alaska and Susan Collins of
Maine, broke

04:19.960 --> 04:25.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ranks to say they wouldn't vote
for Mr. Trump's
choice for education secretary,
Betsy DeVos.

04:25.565 --> 04:27.367 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:27.400 --> 04:31.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN COLLINS (R), Maine: I'm
concerned that
Mrs. DeVos' lack of experience
with public

04:31.738 --> 04:41.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
schools will make it difficult
for her to
fully understand, identify and
assist with

04:41.248 --> 04:42.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
those challenges.

04:42.649 --> 04:45.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: No Democrats
have said they
will vote for DeVos.

04:45.285 --> 04:50.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If all other Republicans back
her, she would
end up with a 50-50 vote and
Vice President

04:50.223 --> 04:53.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mike Pence would have to break
the tie.

04:53.093 --> 04:56.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that critical vote on Betsy
DeVos is expected
Friday -- Judy.

04:56.596 --> 05:01.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lisa, you
reported a moment
ago that Mr. Gorsuch, Judge
Gorsuch, hit the

05:01.301 --> 05:02.402 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ground running.

05:02.435 --> 05:04.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They feel pressure to get this
thing moving
quickly?

05:04.271 --> 05:05.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: They do.

05:05.272 --> 05:07.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is an incredibly aggressive
timeline.

05:07.073 --> 05:12.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy, today, Mr. Gorsuch had six
meetings
at the Capitol, five of those
with Republicans.

05:12.612 --> 05:16.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Interesting, that's approaching
the total
number of Republicans who ever
met with Merrick

05:16.983 --> 05:19.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Garland just today.

05:19.352 --> 05:22.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans are trying to define
him as middle
of the road.

05:22.355 --> 05:24.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats, of course, are not so
sure.

05:24.791 --> 05:30.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Lisa, you
also referred
to 10 Democrats who you said are
-- suggested

05:30.830 --> 05:32.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are important to this process.

05:32.832 --> 05:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do we know about them?

05:33.833 --> 05:34.801 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's a pivotal group.

05:36.703 --> 05:40.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We already know one of those
Democrats, Sherrod
Brown of Ohio, is a no vote on
Mr. Gorsuch.

05:40.407 --> 05:44.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So that leaves nine more for the
eight votes
the Republicans would need.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have to get almost all of
them.

05:46.246 --> 05:49.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most of them are holding back,
not really
tipping their hand yet, but I
talked to perhaps

05:49.616 --> 05:52.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the most critical one, Joe
Manchin of West
Virginia today.

05:52.619 --> 05:56.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Interesting, Judy, he told me he
has some
real concerns about Mr. Gorsuch.

05:56.623 --> 05:58.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Specifically, he said campaign
finance.

05:58.758 --> 06:03.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Gorsuch has ruled against
stricter campaign
finance, and Joe Manchin said
that that's

06:03.797 --> 06:05.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a concern of his.

06:05.599 --> 06:09.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And finally,
Lisa, turning
to the Cabinet, when does it
look as if, if

06:09.302 --> 06:13.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you know, the president is going
to get all
these Cabinet choices confirmed?

06:13.807 --> 06:16.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I love that
question, because
I have to tell you the
atmosphere up here

06:16.843 --> 06:18.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is nothing like I have ever
experienced.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's such a frenzy.

06:19.412 --> 06:20.547 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But that's the bottom line.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.482 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

06:22.515 --> 06:26.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, given the way Democrats
are handling
things right now, blocking,
delaying, questioning

06:27.020 --> 06:31.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as much as they can, I think it
will be weeks
before President Trump could see
all of his

06:31.858 --> 06:33.560 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Cabinet nominees in place.

06:33.593 --> 06:38.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa Desjardins
reporting for
us from the Capitol, thank you,
Lisa.

06:38.498 --> 06:44.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Well, we turn now to my
interview at the White
House today with Vice President
Mike Pence.

06:44.037 --> 06:46.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's his first since assuming
the office.

06:46.239 --> 06:51.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I began by asking the former
Indiana governor
how he thinks the first few days
have gone,

06:51.378 --> 06:53.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a time some have described as
turbulent.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE, Vice President of
the United States:
I think we're off to a great
start.

06:56.149 --> 07:01.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the American people are
seeing in
President Trump a leader who is
keeping his

07:01.454 --> 07:02.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
word to the American people.

07:02.822 --> 07:05.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We like to say we're in the
promise-keeping
business.

07:05.225 --> 07:11.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, literally, from the first
day of this
administration, we have been
working to put

07:11.131 --> 07:17.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into effect the policies that
the president
campaigned on, and that we
really do believe

07:17.904 --> 07:20.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will strengthen America at home
and abroad.

07:20.240 --> 07:24.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, big
announcement last night,
the president announced his
choice to fill

07:24.878 --> 07:28.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that vacancy on the Supreme
Court, Judge Neil
Gorsuch.

07:28.615 --> 07:35.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think virtually everybody
agrees he is eminently
qualified to be on the court.

07:35.922 --> 07:40.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats are pointing out, so
was Merrick
Garland eminently qualified, but
Republicans

07:40.393 --> 07:43.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
didn't give him a hearing for
nine months.

07:43.330 --> 07:45.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why is this different?

07:45.231 --> 07:52.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: Well, first, let me
agree with
you strongly that Judge Neil
Gorsuch is exceptionally

07:52.172 --> 07:55.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
qualified to serve on the
Supreme Court of
the United States.

07:55.809 --> 08:01.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He actually was confirmed
unanimously by the
United States Senate for the
10th Circuit

08:01.047 --> 08:09.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a decade ago, and has an
academic career that
spans from Columbia to Harvard
to Oxford.

08:09.622 --> 08:12.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And yet he's a man of the West,
a fourth-generation
Coloradan.

08:12.258 --> 08:19.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think he brings practical,
real-world
experience, but an extraordinary
intellect

08:19.332 --> 08:24.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to succeed, not replace, the
late Justice
Antonin Scalia.

08:24.838 --> 08:31.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I know the president's
grateful that Judge
Gorsuch is willing to step
forward.

08:31.111 --> 08:35.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's one more
example of President
Trump keeping his word to the
American people

08:35.749 --> 08:41.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to appoint to the court someone
who will be
faithful to the Constitution and
apply the

08:41.521 --> 08:43.356 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
law as written.

08:43.390 --> 08:47.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But if the
Republicans weren't
willing to hold a hearing for
nine months

08:47.827 --> 08:55.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for President Obama's pick for
that vacancy,
why should Democrats do the same
thing?

08:56.002 --> 08:58.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: Well, we understand
there's some
angst.

08:58.705 --> 09:03.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have talked to Republican
and Democrat
members of the Senate about last
year.

09:03.176 --> 09:08.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it was a vacancy in an
election year.

09:08.681 --> 09:15.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's important to
remember that
the court itself, the federal
government itself

09:15.889 --> 09:17.924 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
belongs to the American people.

09:17.957 --> 09:22.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the decision that the
majority made was
essentially to put the direction
of the court

09:22.996 --> 09:26.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the appointment of this
justice in the
hands of the American people.

09:26.132 --> 09:27.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they did that.

09:27.967 --> 09:32.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in President Trump, they
elected someone
who's committed to appoint
someone in the

09:32.806 --> 09:35.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tradition of the late Justice
Antonin Scalia.

09:35.475 --> 09:37.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He did that last night.

09:37.343 --> 09:43.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the very broad and
bipartisan
support that you're witnessing
for Judge Gorsuch

09:43.817 --> 09:51.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a reflection both of his
character, of
his career, but also a gratitude
that President

09:51.524 --> 09:54.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump has followed through and
done exactly
what he said he would do one
more time.

09:54.427 --> 09:57.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Democrats say
they are
going to look at his record.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have a lot of questions.

09:58.331 --> 10:01.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They want to see if he's in the
mainstream.

10:01.067 --> 10:07.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they decide to slow this
down, this process
down, should the Senate majority
leader, Mitch

10:07.707 --> 10:14.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
McConnell, go ahead and change
the rules,
so that, instead of 60, which it
is now, votes

10:14.547 --> 10:17.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
required, it would only take 50,
the so-called
nuclear option?

10:17.684 --> 10:22.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know the president said this
morning go
ahead and go nuclear, he said to
Senator McConnell.

10:22.822 --> 10:24.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you think that's what he will
do?

10:24.724 --> 10:31.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: President Trump and
I and our
whole administration are
extraordinarily enthusiastic

10:31.431 --> 10:36.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the opportunity to see
Judge Gorsuch
confirmed by the Senate.

10:36.069 --> 10:40.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's one of the reasons why I
accompanied
him to Capitol Hill today to get
those conversations

10:40.840 --> 10:42.575 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
started.

10:42.609 --> 10:47.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But let me also say we're very
heartened by
the response now of seven
Democrat members

10:47.514 --> 10:51.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Senate who have said that
they believe
the judge deserves an up-or-down
vote.

10:51.684 --> 10:57.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I do believe that, as Judge
Gorsuch travels
across Capitol Hill in the weeks
ahead, sitting

10:57.557 --> 11:02.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down with Republicans and
Democrats, they're
going to see what the president
saw, someone

11:02.395 --> 11:10.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who is a first-class intellect,
a fourth-generation
Coloradan, and someone who in a
fair and impartial

11:10.970 --> 11:15.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way is going to uphold the
Constitution and
apply the law as written.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you don't...

11:17.043 --> 11:20.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: And we believe that
he will get
that same level of consideration
that the

11:20.713 --> 11:25.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nominees in the first term for
President Clinton
received, the nominees for
President Obama

11:25.585 --> 11:27.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
received in their first term.

11:27.420 --> 11:30.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you don't
think the Senate
Majority Leader McConnell will
have to resort

11:30.757 --> 11:31.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to so-called nuclear option?

11:31.824 --> 11:34.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: I'm hopeful that he
doesn't.

11:34.260 --> 11:36.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm hopeful that he doesn't.

11:36.296 --> 11:43.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president and our entire
team are committed
to supporting Judge Gorsuch's
nomination.

11:43.503 --> 11:47.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do believe that, when you
look at those
first term nominations of
President Clinton...

11:47.574 --> 11:49.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

11:49.075 --> 11:52.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: ... and of President
Obama, none
of those were filibustered.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
All four received broad
bipartisan support.

11:54.314 --> 12:02.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all were considered and
resolved in the
Senate in a matter of 60 to 70
days.

12:02.355 --> 12:09.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do believe that once members
of the Senate
in both parties have a chance to
sit down

12:09.062 --> 12:11.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Judge Gorsuch, we're going
to see the
same level of bipartisan
support.

12:11.965 --> 12:17.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to turn
now to the immigration
executive order that was issued
over the weekend.

12:17.403 --> 12:21.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We looked this up.

12:21.174 --> 12:27.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And since 2001, 9/11, 82 percent
of the fatal
attacks by Islamic extremists in
this country

12:27.447 --> 12:32.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were committed by either legal
permanent residents
or citizens.

12:32.285 --> 12:35.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The rest were committed by
people who were
not from these seven countries
that this ban

12:36.022 --> 12:36.990 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
applies to.

12:37.023 --> 12:37.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MIKE PENCE: Right.

12:38.024 --> 12:38.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, is this the
right answer?

12:39.025 --> 12:41.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: I believe it is.

12:41.694 --> 12:46.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump has no higher
priority than
the safety and security of the
American people.

12:46.199 --> 12:53.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he made it clear in this
election, particularly
in the wake of the terrorist
attack in Paris,

12:53.706 --> 13:00.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where individuals had used a
refugee program
to gain access to that country,
the president

13:00.279 --> 13:02.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
made it clear that we were going
to pause.

13:02.749 --> 13:06.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We were going to implement
extreme vetting.

13:06.285 --> 13:12.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And focusing on countries that
the Obama administration
and the Congress have identified
as being

13:12.925 --> 13:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problematic, being in many ways
compromised
by terrorism, having a pause
that ensures

13:20.400 --> 13:25.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the people that are coming into
the country
don't represent a threat to our
people or

13:25.238 --> 13:27.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to our communities is of
paramount importance.

13:27.340 --> 13:34.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Even though
they're not the
countries from which those who
perpetrated

13:34.213 --> 13:36.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
terrible acts come?

13:36.082 --> 13:42.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: Well, the reality
is, is there's
a -- as you have seen American
forces on the

13:42.522 --> 13:49.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
move overseas just in the last
week, and the
loss of life of a courageous
Navy SEAL...

13:49.262 --> 13:51.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Yemen.

13:51.097 --> 13:56.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: ... we are in a
struggle against
radical Islamic terrorism,
al-Qaida and ISIS.

13:56.035 --> 14:02.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president, in his campaign
for office,
made it clear that he would make
a priority

14:02.175 --> 14:09.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of confronting radical Islamic
terrorism abroad,
but also adding new measures to
ensure that

14:09.115 --> 14:13.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
individuals wouldn't be coming
into this country
with the motivation to harm our
people.

14:13.786 --> 14:21.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we really do believe that
this temporary
pause with regard to the
countries other than

14:21.260 --> 14:29.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syria, temporary pause where we
evaluate our
screening process and ensure
that people coming

14:29.202 --> 14:31.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into the country don't represent
a threat,
is appropriate.

14:31.104 --> 14:35.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I want to
pick up on
what you said, because a number
of even Republican

14:35.475 --> 14:42.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
senators, John McCain, Lindsey
Graham, Ben
Sasse, former CIA Director
Michael Hayden,

14:42.315 --> 14:46.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have said their concern is that,
by doing
what the administration has
done, it's going

14:46.519 --> 14:51.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to not make this country safer,
but it's going
to encourage -- those overseas
who are trying

14:51.691 --> 14:57.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to recruit new people into the
jihadist movement
are going to use this as an
excuse and say,

14:57.830 --> 15:03.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see, we told you the U.S.
doesn't like anybody
who is Muslim.

15:03.970 --> 15:07.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In other words, they're saying
it's going
to have the opposite of the
intended effect.

15:07.140 --> 15:10.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: I'm aware of those
comments.

15:10.943 --> 15:12.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I respectfully disagree with
them.

15:12.945 --> 15:23.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I truly do believe that
President Trump making
decisions to pause our various
immigration

15:23.256 --> 15:28.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
programs and refugee programs
for a period
of time, so that we can ensure
that there

15:28.561 --> 15:34.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are new safeguards in place,
just as Secretary
Kelly described this week, is in
keeping with

15:34.801 --> 15:37.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the expectation of the American
people.

15:37.470 --> 15:43.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have to tell you, having
been a governor
and now having the privilege to
serve as vice

15:43.376 --> 15:50.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president, it heartens me to
know the passion
that President Trump has for
ensuring that

15:50.383 --> 15:56.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our system of immigration, the
way people
come into this country is
operated in a way

15:56.222 --> 16:01.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that puts safety and security
and the well-being
of every American, regardless of
their race

16:01.694 --> 16:03.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or creed, first and foremost.

16:03.629 --> 16:09.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you not only
have, as I
said, bipartisan senators making
some of these

16:09.569 --> 16:14.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comments, but thousands, people
who work at
the State Department have signed
a letter

16:14.674 --> 16:18.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying they think this is going
to lead to
the country being less safe.

16:18.344 --> 16:21.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We heard the press secretary at
the White
House, Sean Spicer, say, if they
don't -- if

16:21.447 --> 16:24.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're not on board, don't stay
in your job.

16:24.483 --> 16:26.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that how you view this, their
dissent?

16:27.019 --> 16:33.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: Well, obviously,
there's a history
of and a tradition even within
the State Department

16:33.793 --> 16:35.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for dissenting opinions.

16:35.561 --> 16:40.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I can tell you, working with
President
Trump closely and seeing the way
he operates

16:40.132 --> 16:43.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
as a leader, he's always
interested in a broad
range of opinions.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.972 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But make no mistake about it.

16:46.005 --> 16:49.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want, in this administration,
people that
share the president's vision for
a safer America...

16:49.275 --> 16:50.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, they should
leave?

16:50.743 --> 16:55.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: ... for a stronger
America, for
a more prosperous America.

16:55.047 --> 17:01.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I believe, as Secretary
Kelly laid out,
Judy, in that press conference
this week,

17:01.387 --> 17:08.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that people are getting a better
sense of
the direction, the focus of this
executive

17:08.394 --> 17:09.929 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
order.

17:09.962 --> 17:13.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're making sure that all due
process rights
of individuals are respected.

17:13.532 --> 17:18.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All orders from courts that have
been imposed
in recent days are being
respected.

17:18.771 --> 17:25.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Secretary Kelly, with his
vast background
in military, is bringing his
abilities and

17:25.711 --> 17:30.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
his judgment to bear to
implement that order
in a way that I believe is a
great source

17:30.416 --> 17:33.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of comfort and confidence for
the American
people.

17:33.419 --> 17:34.854 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But let's be clear again.

17:34.887 --> 17:38.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is what President Trump
said he was going
to do in the election.

17:38.791 --> 17:42.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what the American people
have seen in
these early days of the
administration is

17:42.628 --> 17:44.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that President Trump is a man of
his word.

17:44.697 --> 17:49.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just quickly,
you, the president
and others have said this is not
a ban on

17:49.168 --> 17:51.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Muslims, it is very specific to
these countries.

17:51.704 --> 17:57.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are those out there
who are reading
this as the beginning of what
they fear will

17:57.376 --> 17:59.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be a religious test.

17:59.345 --> 18:05.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are you confident that this is
not going to
lead to some sort of religious
litmus test

18:05.084 --> 18:08.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for people coming into this
country, that
America will continue to welcome
people of

18:08.421 --> 18:09.388 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all faiths?

18:09.422 --> 18:12.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MIKE PENCE: Oh, I'm very
confident of that.

18:12.058 --> 18:16.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our religious liberty, our
religious pluralism
is a hallmark of America,
celebrated by our

18:16.996 --> 18:21.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people and reflected on all over
the world.

18:21.300 --> 18:25.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the focus of the
president's action
here is very clear.

18:25.738 --> 18:29.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that is identifying
countries that the
Obama administration and the
Congress have

18:29.709 --> 18:37.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
confirmed lack the kind of
internal safeguards
so we can know who these people
are for certain

18:37.383 --> 18:42.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who are seeking to gain
admission to our country.

18:42.154 --> 18:48.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's just simply appropriate for
us to pause
to look at everyone who's
applying to come

18:48.361 --> 18:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in from those areas that have
been compromised
by terrorism, and ensure that
the people,

18:53.399 --> 18:57.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as the president says, the
people that come
to this country love this
country and want

18:57.436 --> 18:59.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be a part of our communities
and our nation.

18:59.705 --> 19:04.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There are voices
coming from
the Capitol, members of Congress
who are saying

19:04.910 --> 19:07.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they were not adequately
consulted.

19:07.413 --> 19:11.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas
was saying the
president needs to consult with
Congress.

19:11.517 --> 19:16.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, some staff was brought in,
but there
needs to be more consultation.

19:16.622 --> 19:21.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: I will tell you
that, in the early
days of this administration, we
have been

19:21.127 --> 19:26.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
engaging very rigorously on a
broad range
of issues with members of the
Senate.

19:26.365 --> 19:29.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're going to continue to
improve those
efforts.

19:29.201 --> 19:31.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's with Republicans and
Democrats.

19:31.704 --> 19:39.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the course of the president's
consideration
of his nominees to the Supreme
Court, he dispatched

19:39.979 --> 19:42.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me to Capitol Hill to talk with
Republicans
and Democrats.

19:42.915 --> 19:46.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He met with Republican and
Democrat leaders
in the Oval Office.

19:46.652 --> 19:51.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what you're going to
continue to see
on an increasing basis is more
consultation

19:51.791 --> 19:53.692 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and more input.

19:53.726 --> 19:57.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the end of the day, the
American people
are going to continue to see
strong and decisive

19:57.163 --> 20:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leadership from President Trump
that I think
will make America great again.

20:00.800 --> 20:05.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Moving through a
lot of reporting
in the last few days about Steve
Bannon, the

20:05.704 --> 20:11.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
adviser to the president, having
more influence
than anyone else now on the
president.

20:11.811 --> 20:17.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And looking at his background,
running Breitbart
News, being an advocate of
limiting immigration,

20:18.017 --> 20:24.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
keeping out people from the
United States
who are not, in his view,
welcome here, are

20:24.824 --> 20:27.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you comfortable with the amount
of influence
Mr. Bannon has?

20:27.626 --> 20:32.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: I'm very comfortable
with the
fact that there's only one
person in charge

20:32.932 --> 20:33.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the Trump administration.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's President Donald
Trump.

20:35.167 --> 20:36.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

20:36.402 --> 20:39.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: But we value, we
value Steve Bannon's
input.

20:39.805 --> 20:44.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here's an individual who served
in uniform,
was a captain in the United
States Navy, a

20:44.743 --> 20:50.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
partner at Goldman Sachs, a
successful businessperson
who brings a strong perspective
into discussions.

20:50.049 --> 20:55.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But to be around President
Trump, I can tell
you, Judy, it's very dynamic.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.356 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He leads by asking questions.

20:57.389 --> 21:02.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He asks for input from everyone
in the senior
circle and a lot of people
outside the circle.

21:02.495 --> 21:04.196 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And then he makes decisions.

21:04.230 --> 21:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the action that people
are seeing
in these early days is just the
beginning.

21:07.766 --> 21:13.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's a prelude to the
kind of energetic
and decisive leadership the
American people

21:13.772 --> 21:15.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
haven't seen for a while in the
Oval Office.

21:15.574 --> 21:17.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm honored to be a small
part of it.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, three
very quick
questions.

21:18.811 --> 21:22.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The border wall with Mexico,
there was talk
of a 20 percent tax.

21:22.948 --> 21:24.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that going to happen?

21:24.717 --> 21:29.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: We're working right
now with the
Congress on tax reform
legislation that I

21:29.555 --> 21:35.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expect will come this spring and
will be part
of the president's commitment to
get this

21:35.895 --> 21:37.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
economy moving again.

21:38.030 --> 21:39.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But make no mistake about it.

21:39.832 --> 21:45.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether it be our negotiations
with countries
in bilateral trade agreements,
or whether

21:45.938 --> 21:53.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it be in developing reforms of
our tax code,
we are determined to support the
president's

21:53.279 --> 22:02.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vision to take the incentives
out that make
it attractive for companies to
pull up stakes

22:02.154 --> 22:06.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
like in my home state of
Indiana, and leave
and take jobs out of the country
down to Mexico

22:06.759 --> 22:08.594 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and elsewhere.

22:08.627 --> 22:12.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We really believe that we can
bring about
changes in the tax code that
will make America

22:12.665 --> 22:16.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more attractive for investment
and job creation
and business.

22:16.402 --> 22:21.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the president's also made it
very clear
that he wants to put -- he wants
to put new

22:21.173 --> 22:25.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
elements in the tax code that
are going to
have companies pay a price if
they decide

22:25.444 --> 22:29.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to take jobs out of the country
and then sell
their goods back into the United
States.

22:29.748 --> 22:34.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly
about priorities,
a lot of talk about tax cuts --
you just mentioned

22:34.253 --> 22:41.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that -- about infrastructure,
and about health
care, about not just getting rid
of the Obamacare

22:42.027 --> 22:43.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
plan, but replacing it.

22:43.896 --> 22:45.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is one of those a priority over
the others?

22:45.764 --> 22:49.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: The president made
very clear
to leaders in Congress from
right after the

22:49.435 --> 22:55.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election that repealing and
replacing Obamacare
will be the first priority of
this administration.

22:55.040 --> 23:00.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have been working very
closely with
leaders of the House and Senate
to formulate

23:00.045 --> 23:02.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a plan that will happen
simultaneously.

23:02.548 --> 23:05.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the other piece of this
that's very
important.

23:05.184 --> 23:09.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president made it clear that
he expected
the Congress, while they take
action to repeal

23:09.888 --> 23:16.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the most corrosive elements of
Obamacare,
the taxes, the mandates, the
things that are

23:16.528 --> 23:22.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suppressing job creation and
driving up the
premiums for working families
across the country.

23:22.768 --> 23:26.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he made it very clear that,
in the very
same breath, he wants to see the
Congress

23:26.472 --> 23:32.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bring forward the kind of
replacement plan,
both through legislation and we
will support

23:32.211 --> 23:37.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with executive action, that will
create a
better health care system that
expands consumer

23:37.049 --> 23:41.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
choices and drives down the cost
of health
insurance for every American.

23:41.287 --> 23:43.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Final question.

23:43.455 --> 23:48.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The tone coming from this
administration,
you -- the folks out there who
voted for President

23:48.794 --> 23:53.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump and for you, the polls are
already showing
they're very happy with what
they're seeing.

23:53.966 --> 23:59.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At the same time, in the
president's inaugural
address, you could argue the
immigration order,

23:59.371 --> 24:03.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some of the president's tweets,
there's a
sense that it's not a -- there's
not an effort

24:03.942 --> 24:09.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to reach beyond the base, people
who supported
this president and you
originally.

24:09.048 --> 24:13.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is that the message you want the
American
people to have right now, that
it's not going

24:13.085 --> 24:20.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be an outward-looking,
inviting-in message,
that it's going to be more of a,
you know,

24:20.326 --> 24:23.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're going to continue to talk
to those who
sent us here?

24:23.629 --> 24:28.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: I think there's two
messages coming
out in these early days, Judy.

24:28.767 --> 24:32.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Number one is, President Trump's
going to
keep the promises he made to the
American

24:32.338 --> 24:37.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
people through decisive
executive action and
through legislation.

24:37.609 --> 24:41.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the other message is the
same one he delivered
on election night, that he's
committed to

24:41.914 --> 24:45.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
being the president for every
American.

24:45.217 --> 24:50.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have sat in that Roosevelt
Room in the West
Wing as he's brought in people,
labor union

24:50.155 --> 24:55.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaders recently, to sit down
with people
who largely didn't support him
in the campaign

24:55.561 --> 24:57.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and say, how can we work
together?

24:57.429 --> 25:01.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was there in New York when he
brought together
high-tech executives, many of
whom actually

25:01.400 --> 25:04.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
strongly supported our opponent
in the election.

25:04.536 --> 25:08.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he simply sat down and said,
how do we
make it more possible for you to
create more

25:08.774 --> 25:11.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
good-paying jobs in the United
States?

25:11.076 --> 25:15.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, as time goes on, it is
going to be
more apparent to more Americans
that President

25:15.547 --> 25:17.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump is going to be president
for everyone.

25:17.549 --> 25:23.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Vice President
Mike Pence,
we thank you very much for
talking with us.

25:23.122 --> 25:31.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: Thank you, Judy.

25:31.964 --> 25:38.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In other news
today: President
Donald Trump made a surprise
trip to honor

25:38.771 --> 25:42.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the first U.S. serviceman killed
in combat
since he took office.

25:42.875 --> 25:48.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chief Special Warfare Officer
William Ryan
Owens, a Navy SEAL, died Sunday
in a raid

25:48.313 --> 25:51.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on al-Qaida installation in
Yemen.

25:51.417 --> 25:56.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president and his daughter,
Ivanka, flew
to Dover Air Force Base,
Delaware, as the

25:56.955 --> 25:58.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
remains returned.

25:58.123 --> 26:00.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The ceremony was kept private,
at the family's
request.

26:00.492 --> 26:04.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The White House
also issued
a warning today to Iran.

26:05.030 --> 26:09.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It follows the Islamic
Republic's test launch
of a ballistic missile this
week.

26:09.768 --> 26:13.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The president's national
security adviser,
Michael Flynn, came to the White
House Briefing

26:13.772 --> 26:15.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Room this afternoon to address
the issue.

26:15.674 --> 26:18.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL FLYNN, National Security
Adviser:
President Trump has severely
criticized the

26:18.944 --> 26:24.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
various agreements reached
between Iran and
the Obama administration, as
well as the United

26:24.450 --> 26:26.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nations, as being weak and
ineffective.

26:26.919 --> 26:31.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead of being thankful to the
United States
for these agreements, Iran is
now feeling

26:31.223 --> 26:32.391 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
emboldened.

26:32.424 --> 26:35.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As of today, we are officially
putting Iran
on notice.

26:35.160 --> 26:39.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: White House
officials said
later that they are reviewing
how to respond.

26:39.998 --> 26:44.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Iran's defense
minister confirmed
the missile firing, but he said
-- quote -- "We

26:44.703 --> 26:48.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will not let any foreigner
meddle with our
defense issues."

26:48.106 --> 26:52.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: A U.S. watchdog
agency is warning
that the government of
Afghanistan now controls

26:53.011 --> 26:55.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
less than 60 percent of its
territory.

26:55.914 --> 27:02.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The special inspector general
for Afghan reconstruction
says that's down 15 percent from
2015.

27:02.421 --> 27:06.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Government forces have retreated
in the face
of Taliban and Islamic State
militants.

27:06.425 --> 27:11.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Britain's
departure from the
European Union, Brexit, is one
step closer

27:11.563 --> 27:13.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to becoming reality.

27:13.398 --> 27:18.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The House of Commons voted today
to authorize
the beginning of formal talks
with the E.U.

27:18.837 --> 27:23.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bill now goes to committee,
before a final
vote in the full Commons next
week.

27:24.009 --> 27:27.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It also requires approval by the
House of
Lords.

27:27.246 --> 27:31.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: President Trump's
immigration
order will not apply to green
card holders,

27:31.517 --> 27:35.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so they don't need waivers --
that word from
the White House today.

27:35.487 --> 27:39.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Legal permanent residents were
thrown into
confusion when the order was
issued.

27:39.458 --> 27:41.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Officials later said they'd be
granted waivers.

27:41.560 --> 27:44.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the president's spokesman
said that's
not necessary.

27:44.162 --> 27:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
We have interpreted the guidance
to all of

27:47.799 --> 27:52.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these agencies to both the
acting secretary
of state, the acting attorney
general, and

27:52.337 --> 27:56.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the acting secretary of homeland
security
that the guidance is that all
individuals

27:56.675 --> 28:00.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
responsible for the
administration implementation
of this order, that that doesn't
apply.

28:00.746 --> 28:04.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They no longer need a waiver,
because, if
they are a legal permanent
resident, they

28:04.850 --> 28:06.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
won't need it anymore.

28:06.518 --> 28:09.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Meanwhile, the
U.S. Customs
and Border Patrol has a new
boss.

28:09.488 --> 28:12.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Career CBP official Ronald
Vitiello got the
nod.

28:12.991 --> 28:18.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The border agents' union backed
President
Trump in the election, and
supported Vitiello.

28:18.163 --> 28:23.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: House Republicans
moved today
to rescind regulations from
President Obama's

28:23.602 --> 28:25.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
final days in office.

28:25.437 --> 28:30.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their first vote overturned a
December rule
that barred dumping coal mining
debris into

28:30.342 --> 28:31.977 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nearby streams.

28:32.010 --> 28:37.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Congressional Review Act
allows recisions
of rules imposed since last
June.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It also bars similar regulations
in the future.

28:39.785 --> 28:44.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: President Trump's
pick to lead
the Veterans Department says
letting vets

28:44.323 --> 28:48.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see private doctors might help
cut long wait
times.

28:48.093 --> 28:51.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Shulkin is currently the
VA's top health
official.

28:51.196 --> 28:55.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He told his Senate confirmation
hearing today
that he supports partial, but
not full, privatization.

28:56.001 --> 28:59.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SHULKIN, Secretary of
Veterans Affairs
Nominee: There will be far
greater accountability,

28:59.171 --> 29:05.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dramatically improved access,
responsiveness
and expanded care options, but
the Department

29:05.844 --> 29:09.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Veteran Affairs will not be
privatized
under my watch.

29:09.548 --> 29:14.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If confirmed, I intend to build
a system that
puts veterans first, and allows
them to get

29:14.119 --> 29:18.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the best possible health care
and services
wherever they may be, in the VA
or in the

29:18.390 --> 29:20.258 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
community.

29:20.292 --> 29:23.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Shulkin also
cautioned that
it could take years to fix the
wait time problem

29:23.495 --> 29:25.230 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for good.

29:25.263 --> 29:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Army Corps of
Engineers
confirmed today that it has
begun reviewing

29:27.899 --> 29:32.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an easement for the Dakota
Access Pipeline
in part of North Dakota.

29:32.571 --> 29:37.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A spokesman said that doesn't
mean that permission
for use of the land has been
granted.

29:37.576 --> 29:40.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump says he wants
the pipeline
completed.

29:40.212 --> 29:43.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Protesters have vowed to fight
any decisions
with legal action.

29:43.548 --> 29:49.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Volkswagen will
pay $1.2 billion
in its latest settlement over
emissions cheating.

29:49.488 --> 29:53.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The German automaker filed
documents in federal
court in San Francisco last
night.

29:53.892 --> 29:59.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It agrees to fix or buy back
almost 80,000
cars with larger diesel engines.

29:59.331 --> 30:05.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An earlier settlement provided
$15 billion
to owners of 500,000 cars with
smaller diesel

30:05.904 --> 30:07.506 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
engines.

30:07.539 --> 30:10.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Federal
Reserve left its
key interest rate unchanged
today.

30:10.642 --> 30:14.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It said it wants more time to
monitor economic
progress.

30:14.413 --> 30:19.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial
average gained almost 27 points
to close near

30:19.251 --> 30:21.420 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
19891.

30:21.453 --> 30:25.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose nearly 28, and
the S&amp;P 500
added a fraction.

30:25.991 --> 30:31.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what sort
of Supreme Court justice would
Neil Gorsuch

30:31.063 --> 30:37.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be? -- we look at his record;
combating a
silent killer in Ghana; and a
new study reveals

30:37.769 --> 30:44.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
higher rates of cervical cancer
than previously
thought.

30:44.042 --> 30:57.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Now, for a closer
look at the
man who could shape the
conservative direction

30:57.622 --> 31:01.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the U.S. Supreme Court for
decades to come.

31:01.259 --> 31:07.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A national TV audience looked on
last night
as Judge Neil Gorsuch summed up
his judicial

31:07.666 --> 31:09.401 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
philosophy.

31:09.434 --> 31:11.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH, Supreme Court
Nominee: It is
the role of judges to apply, not
alter, the

31:11.203 --> 31:12.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
work of the people's
representatives.

31:12.671 --> 31:18.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A judge who likes every outcome
he reaches
is very likely a bad judge.

31:18.143 --> 31:23.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Gorsuch was
schooled at Columbia
University, obtained a Harvard
law degree,

31:23.982 --> 31:25.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and then a degree at Oxford.

31:25.751 --> 31:30.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He clerked for then-Justice
Byron White and
Justice Anthony Kennedy, who
still serves

31:30.689 --> 31:32.157 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the court.

31:32.190 --> 31:35.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he practiced law privately
before joining
the Department of Justice.

31:35.961 --> 31:41.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, in 2006, President Bush
nominated him
to the 10th Circuit Court of
Appeals based

31:41.233 --> 31:42.367 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Denver.

31:42.400 --> 31:45.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He won unanimous Senate
confirmation.

31:45.403 --> 31:50.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the decade since, Gorsuch has
made his
mark in several notable cases,
especially

31:50.809 --> 31:52.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on religious liberty.

31:52.644 --> 31:58.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He sided with the Hobby Lobby
challenge to
Obamacare, ruling for religious
organizations

31:58.450 --> 32:01.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
opposing a contraceptive
mandate.

32:01.186 --> 32:06.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In that decision, Gorsuch, along
with two
other judges, wrote: "For some,
religion provides

32:06.358 --> 32:11.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an essential source of guidance,
both about
what constitutes wrongful
conduct and the

32:11.196 --> 32:16.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
degree to which those who assist
others in
committing wrongful conduct
themselves bear

32:16.168 --> 32:18.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
moral culpability."

32:18.203 --> 32:22.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If confirmed, Gorsuch would fill
the seat
of the late Antonin Scalia.

32:22.808 --> 32:25.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last night, Gorsuch called
Scalia a lion of
the law.

32:25.911 --> 32:32.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, at age 49, Gorsuch has a
chance to bring
that same legal philosophy to
bear for decades

32:32.517 --> 32:34.753 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to come.

32:34.786 --> 32:39.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to dig into what we know
about that legal
philosophy, we are joined by two
longtime

32:39.691 --> 32:45.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Supreme Court watchers, Nina
Totenberg, legal
affairs correspondent for NPR,
and Marcia

32:45.230 --> 32:50.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Coyle, chief Washington
correspondent for
"The National Law Journal" and a
"NewsHour"

32:50.268 --> 32:51.236 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
regular.

32:51.269 --> 32:52.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thank you both for being with
us.

32:52.270 --> 32:54.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Nina, let's begin with you.

32:54.105 --> 32:58.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will look at a landmark case,
the Hobby
Lobby case, which gets into
religious freedom,

32:58.743 --> 33:00.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rights of employers vs.
employees.

33:01.012 --> 33:02.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's a real shorthand version
of it.

33:03.014 --> 33:08.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm going to read you a little
passage from
a ruling that was authored by
him in a lower

33:08.520 --> 33:10.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
court, obviously.

33:10.355 --> 33:14.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says this: "It is not for
secular courts
to rewrite the religious
complaint of a faithful

33:14.492 --> 33:19.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
adherent, or to decide whether a
religious
teaching about complicity
imposes too much

33:19.664 --> 33:25.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
moral disapproval on those only
indirectly
assisting wrongful conduct."

33:25.670 --> 33:31.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in this case, what happened
as a result
is that a small, closely held
company wasn't

33:31.509 --> 33:38.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
forced, as part of the
Affordable Care Act,
to provide birth control to its
employees.

33:38.250 --> 33:42.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What can we read into that as
far as it might
relate to other rulings, which
would come

33:42.520 --> 33:44.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the high court?

33:44.322 --> 33:48.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NINA TOTENBERG, NPR: This was a
dissent that
Gorsuch authored, and he was
vindicated by

33:48.727 --> 33:51.529 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a 5-4 vote on the Supreme Court.

33:51.563 --> 33:57.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what those who are concerned
about his
nomination would say, I think,
is that, if

33:57.936 --> 34:06.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you apply this rationale to, for
example,
gay rights, you could imagine
that, very easily,

34:06.945 --> 34:12.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he would side with business
owners who
don't want to serve gay people,
business owners

34:12.884 --> 34:21.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who might not want to employ gay
people, despite
laws to the contrary.

34:21.159 --> 34:24.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It could involve lots of
different kinds of
civil rights laws.

34:24.829 --> 34:31.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is really the tension
here that is
going to provoke a considerable
debate.

34:31.403 --> 34:35.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Marcia, obviously
a big issue,
is there a specific case in the
pipeline that

34:35.507 --> 34:40.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we know of that might rise to
the level of
the Supreme Court that might
test his feelings

34:40.278 --> 34:41.446 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on this?

34:41.479 --> 34:43.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, "The National Law
Journal":
Absolutely.

34:43.281 --> 34:46.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, there's a case pending
in the court
-- the court hasn't decided
whether to take

34:46.484 --> 34:55.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it up or not -- that involves a
bakery that
didn't want to bake a wedding
cake for a same-sex

34:55.560 --> 34:56.962 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
couple.

34:56.995 --> 35:03.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the claim here is that to do
so would
violate their religious beliefs.

35:03.635 --> 35:08.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this is something that civil
rights organizations
are concerned about.

35:08.406 --> 35:14.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There have been other cases
around the country
involving photographers who
wouldn't photograph

35:14.279 --> 35:18.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a same-sex wedding because of
their religious
beliefs.

35:18.817 --> 35:27.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, as Nina just said,
Judge Gorsuch's
dissent here does give some
concern to these

35:27.792 --> 35:33.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
civil rights organizations as to
how far you
can take not only his comments,
but the Supreme

35:33.965 --> 35:35.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Court's Hobby Lobby decision.

35:35.500 --> 35:39.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Everybody is
curious about
Roe v. Wade, of course, Nina.

35:39.304 --> 35:42.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Haven't seen anything where he
has weighed
in, in this realm.

35:42.440 --> 35:49.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he did write a book in 2006
on euthanasia
and assisted suicide, very much
opposed to

35:49.781 --> 35:51.516 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

35:51.549 --> 35:53.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can we interpret anything out of
that book
and his philosophy there and
apply that to

35:53.752 --> 35:55.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
how he might interpret the law?

35:55.286 --> 35:57.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you think?

35:57.088 --> 36:01.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NINA TOTENBERG: Well, in the
book, he talks
about the value of human life,
but, at the

36:01.359 --> 36:06.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
same time, he makes the argument
that individuals
should be able to refuse
treatment even if

36:06.698 --> 36:08.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it leads to their death.

36:08.500 --> 36:14.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think you can say he's
written on
point in any legal decision
about this.

36:14.239 --> 36:19.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Certainly, his vote will not
make the difference,
as long as the rest of the
members of the

36:20.011 --> 36:21.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
court remain the same.

36:21.713 --> 36:28.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will still be a 5-4 vote
upholding Roe,
or the core of Roe, as the court
put it.

36:28.353 --> 36:34.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And just this year, we saw
Justice Anthony
Kennedy write -- be the fifth
and decisive

36:34.926 --> 36:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vote in a case that struck down
the newest
wave of attempts to limit access
to abortion.

36:42.133 --> 36:45.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as long as he's there and
the other members
of the court remain the same,
it's not going

36:45.870 --> 36:47.639 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to change.

36:47.672 --> 36:53.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if he leaves or Justice
Ginsburg, who
is almost 84, leaves, or if
Justice Breyer,

36:53.311 --> 36:56.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who is 78, leaves, it will make
a difference.

36:56.081 --> 36:57.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then that would open the
door.

36:57.949 --> 37:03.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At that moment, a second Trump
nominee would
open the door to the possibility
of reversing

37:03.788 --> 37:04.889 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Roe.

37:04.923 --> 37:05.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Marcia, would you
concur with
that?

37:05.790 --> 37:07.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: I would.

37:07.725 --> 37:13.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think his book is a very
heavily researched,
very nuanced approach to the
issue of assisted

37:13.364 --> 37:15.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
suicide.

37:15.233 --> 37:20.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, as Nina said, he
comes down on
personal autonomy, but doesn't
seem to favor

37:20.105 --> 37:24.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government legalizing assisted
suicide.

37:24.442 --> 37:30.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And definitely in terms of the
politics of
the court on Roe v. Wade, his
vote will not

37:30.381 --> 37:32.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
make a difference right now.

37:32.350 --> 37:37.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The next -- if the next justice
leaves, particularly
Justice Kennedy or someone on
the left side

37:38.022 --> 37:45.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the bench, then we could face
an overturning
of a 44-year-old precedent.

37:45.630 --> 37:51.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So, Nina, with
all that in
mind, what is the strategy from
the Democrats'

37:51.436 --> 37:55.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
side of the Senate as it
approaches this nomination?

37:55.173 --> 38:00.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NINA TOTENBERG: Well, it's a
rather exquisite
calculus that they have to make,
because they

38:00.845 --> 38:05.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't have the votes to prevail,
at least
at the moment.

38:05.316 --> 38:12.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's assume that there's a --
the confirmation
hearing is uneventful,
relatively speaking,

38:12.624 --> 38:15.059 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and we are where we are today.

38:15.093 --> 38:20.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, I imagine most Democrats
are going to
vote against this nominee, but
they don't

38:20.265 --> 38:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have the votes to defeat him
outright.

38:22.267 --> 38:24.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then the question is, do they
filibuster?

38:24.502 --> 38:31.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, if they filibuster, the
Republicans
could, as say they, go nuclear,
and abolish

38:31.142 --> 38:34.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the filibuster rule for Supreme
Court nominees.

38:34.345 --> 38:40.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what they're really worried
about, I suspect,
is not this nomination, but the
next nomination,

38:40.552 --> 38:45.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which could change the balance
of the court
for generations to come.

38:45.690 --> 38:51.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, though,
Democrats in the
Senate are under enormous
pressure from the

38:51.696 --> 38:56.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
left flank and from their own
constituents
in the Democratic Party who are
out in the

38:56.401 --> 39:01.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
streets, who are outraged by
everything that
has gone on in the last two
weeks, the first

39:01.139 --> 39:05.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
two weeks of the Trump
administration.

39:05.310 --> 39:11.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in much the way that the
street, the Republican
street led the Republican Party
in the election

39:11.983 --> 39:16.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this year, the Democratic street
is leading
the Democratic Party in the
Senate.

39:16.154 --> 39:18.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Marcia, are they
going to go
nuclear?

39:18.356 --> 39:20.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: I don't know.

39:20.658 --> 39:23.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I'm not sure they have a
coherent strategy
at the moment.

39:23.661 --> 39:28.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, sometimes, we also put
too much emphasis
on the abortion issue.

39:28.433 --> 39:34.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm sure the Democrats and their
supporters,
the marchers who were here
during the Women's

39:34.739 --> 39:39.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
March on Washington, there were
many other
issues that they see that may be
coming to

39:39.410 --> 39:45.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Supreme Court as a result of
President
Trump's executive orders, and
perhaps future

39:45.049 --> 39:46.951 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
actions as well.

39:46.985 --> 39:54.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the stakes are -- in
terms of the Supreme
Court, are much higher than just
abortion.

39:54.459 --> 39:59.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I also sense there is still
a lot of anger
on the Democratic side of the
Senate in the

39:59.931 --> 40:05.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way that President Obama's
nominee was treated,
Judge -- Chief Judge Merrick
Garland.

40:05.536 --> 40:10.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's some sentence of wanting
to have payback
for that.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But we have to wait and see.

40:12.844 --> 40:17.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NINA TOTENBERG: I have to say
that I have
talked to a lot of Democrats
today, and my

40:17.949 --> 40:25.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sense is that the -- on all of
these issues,
their constituents are more
angry than they

40:25.723 --> 40:30.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are, and they were pretty mad
about the way
Merrick Garland was treated in
their view.

40:30.261 --> 40:34.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were furious, but not as
furious as their
constituents are.

40:34.132 --> 40:38.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Nina Totenberg,
Marcia Coyle,
two of the best court watchers
in the land,

40:38.403 --> 40:40.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you both very much.

40:40.872 --> 40:48.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: My pleasure.

40:48.780 --> 40:57.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nearly half the
world's population,
three billion people, cook using
stoves that

40:57.622 --> 40:59.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
burn wood or charcoal.

40:59.490 --> 41:05.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That seemingly harmless act is
silently killing
millions every year because of
regular exposure

41:05.930 --> 41:07.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to harmful smoke.

41:07.699 --> 41:12.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An international alliance is on
a mission
now to reduce those deaths by
distributing

41:12.503 --> 41:15.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
100 million cleaner stoves
around the world.

41:15.640 --> 41:20.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But some health experts doubt
whether those
new stoves can truly save lives.

41:20.411 --> 41:25.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Hari Sreenivasan reports in a
story produced
with Global Health Frontiers,
researchers

41:25.683 --> 41:28.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Ghana are trying to find the
answer.

KWAKU POKU ASANTE, Kintampo
Health Research
Center: Most of our communities
and households

41:36.627 --> 41:43.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Ghana, and actually in
Africa, are rural
by nature, and therefore they
depend on wood

41:43.167 --> 41:46.504 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to cook their food, to heat
their water.

41:46.537 --> 41:51.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Dr. Kwaku Poku
Asante is
the head of research at the
Kintampo Health

41:51.209 --> 41:53.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Research Center of the Ghana
Health Service.

41:53.845 --> 41:57.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's leading a study on the
effects of wood
smoke on the health of women and
children

41:57.815 --> 41:58.916 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in rural Ghana.

DR.

42:00.785 --> 42:05.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KWAKU POKU ASANTE: The women who
do commercial
cooking with the traditional
cookstoves, they

42:05.923 --> 42:10.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get a very large amount of smoke
coming out

And, sometimes, you see them
with their kids
on their back, and that is
really a problem.

HARI SREENIVASAN: Household air
pollution
from the burning of biomass
fuel, like wood

42:20.538 --> 42:25.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and charcoal, is known to cause
respiratory
diseases, such as pneumonia, as
well as chronic

42:25.743 --> 42:27.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pulmonary and cardiovascular

KWAKU POKU ASANTE: I'm really
committed to
this, because millions of people
die from

42:32.784 --> 42:35.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these illnesses, and we have to
do something
about it.

42:35.553 --> 42:37.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have to stop it.

ABENA YAWSON, Kintampo Health
Research Center:
This is the pediatric ward for
Kintampo Municipal

42:47.932 --> 42:48.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hospital.

42:48.933 --> 42:51.068 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You can see it's very busy.

42:51.102 --> 42:55.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This baby was admitted because
of fever and
cough.

42:55.706 --> 43:01.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The mother noted she was
breathing with difficulty,
and we actually have diagnosed
the child as

43:01.612 --> 43:03.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
having bronchial pneumonia.

43:03.281 --> 43:07.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's using charcoal in a
traditional cookstove
to cook.

43:07.285 --> 43:13.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are times that, when
she's cooking,
and she's fanning the fire, she
coughs, because

43:13.925 --> 43:15.960 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
she gets to inhale smoke.

43:15.993 --> 43:20.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Pregnant women
and their
children face the most risk from
these diseases,

43:21.032 --> 43:25.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the objective of this study
in Kintampo
is to look at the impact of
household air

43:25.203 --> 43:31.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pollution on low birth weight
and pneumonia
among about 1,400 pregnant women
and their

43:31.709 --> 43:35.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
children in 35 communities in
the study area.

Professor Darby Jack at Columbia
University
is a partner with the Ghanaians
on the project,

43:40.218 --> 43:42.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supported by the U.S. National
Institutes
of Health.

43:42.220 --> 43:46.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARBY JACK, Columbia University:
We recruit
women during pregnancy, and we
give them a

43:46.224 --> 43:51.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clean-burning cookstove, either
LPG, which
is the propane or butane, the
same thing you

43:51.329 --> 43:56.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
probably cook with in your
backyard grill,
or a stove called the BioLite,
which is an

43:56.567 --> 44:01.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
efficient biomass burning stove,
and can reduce
emissions by about half.

44:01.339 --> 44:06.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The study
measures exposure
to carbon monoxide from the
cookstoves and

44:06.110 --> 44:11.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to small particles in the smoke,
particulates
that can penetrate deep into
lungs and enter

44:11.082 --> 44:12.884 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the bloodstream.

44:12.917 --> 44:16.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARBY JACK: So, we deploy
personal monitors
that mothers can wear and the
children can

44:16.787 --> 44:19.023 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wear for 72 hours at a time.

44:19.056 --> 44:23.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: At regular
intervals, exposure
monitors are collected and their
data is downloaded.

44:23.694 --> 44:26.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DARBY JACK: We set out to test
two hypotheses.

44:26.597 --> 44:31.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first is that reducing
exposure to household
air pollution will increase
birth weight.

44:31.035 --> 44:36.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the second hypothesis
is that reduced
exposure will reduce the rate of
pneumonia

44:36.707 --> 44:38.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the first year of life.

44:38.543 --> 44:42.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The core questions here are, how
clean is
clean enough?

44:42.613 --> 44:44.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, number two, what
technologies will
bring us there?

44:44.949 --> 44:46.684 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

44:46.717 --> 44:50.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KWAKU POKU ASANTE: We are not in
a position
to recommend any of the stoves
that we have

44:50.388 --> 44:51.355 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tested.

44:51.389 --> 44:53.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That will be left with the
policy-makers.

44:53.691 --> 44:55.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Ours is to generate the
evidence.

44:55.493 --> 44:59.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The evidence
is still incomplete,
but results so far are
encouraging.

44:59.530 --> 45:01.432 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

45:01.465 --> 45:05.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABENA YAWSON: I'm sure all the
household actually
might have gotten high exposure
to smoke because

45:05.570 --> 45:10.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of how close it is also to the
building that
they live in.

45:10.274 --> 45:17.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is what the woman was
using until
the BioLite was given to her.

45:17.415 --> 45:24.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She actually enjoys cooking with
the BioLite
because she doesn't get sore
eyes after cooking,

45:24.121 --> 45:29.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the coughs that used to be
very frequent
with the traditional cookstove
are also not

45:29.961 --> 45:30.928 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

45:30.962 --> 45:35.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, the baby hasn't been ill
since birth.

45:35.066 --> 45:38.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He has very good reflexes.

45:38.603 --> 45:39.971 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's pink.

45:40.004 --> 45:42.473 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's not pale.

45:42.506 --> 45:48.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he's looking generally very
beautiful
and healthy.

45:48.379 --> 45:49.347 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Bye-bye.

45:49.380 --> 45:51.215 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

45:51.248 --> 45:55.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KWAKU POKU ASANTE: I would like
to see, in
the next decade, to see the
burden of pneumonia

45:55.786 --> 45:59.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
come down and also to see people
use improved
cookstoves.

45:59.991 --> 46:05.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would like to see a commitment
from other
partners, if we show the
evidence that the

46:05.997 --> 46:10.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
use of improved cookstoves
reduces the burden
of many diseases.

46:10.568 --> 46:15.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And there's
another benefit
to be expected from improved
cookstoves.

46:15.373 --> 46:19.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Women and young girls spend
hours every day
gathering wood for fuel.

46:19.477 --> 46:23.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Released from that burden, they
could spend
more time going to school or
caring for their

46:23.547 --> 46:24.515 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
children.

MILES O'BRIEN: Now: the toll of
cervical cancer
and recent findings that suggest
its death

46:41.766 --> 46:43.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rate is higher than we thought.

46:43.534 --> 46:47.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the focus of our weekly
segment the
Leading Edge.

46:47.271 --> 46:52.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Estimates had shown more than
4,000 women
in the U.S. die from cervical
cancer each

46:52.543 --> 46:57.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
year, and that the death rate
dropped dramatically
over past decades.

46:57.314 --> 47:02.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But an analysis published in the
journal "Cancer"
found the mortality rate is
higher than previously

47:02.553 --> 47:06.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thought, and it is significantly
higher among
African-American women.

47:06.991 --> 47:11.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The findings were particularly
concerning
because cervical cancer can
often be prevented

47:11.729 --> 47:16.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through better screening, and
the HPV vaccine
can prevent some cases.

She has been writing about these
findings
and the implications for her
clinical practice,

47:26.977 --> 47:28.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and she joins us now to tell us
a little bit
more.

47:29.013 --> 47:30.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dr. Caudle, good to have you
with us.

47:30.514 --> 47:31.582 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

47:31.615 --> 47:32.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JENNIFER CAUDLE, Rowan
University: Thanks
so much.

47:32.783 --> 47:34.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Tell us what's
new about this
study.

47:34.085 --> 47:35.352 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

47:35.386 --> 47:37.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER CAUDLE: Well, I think
it's actually
quite profound.

47:37.288 --> 47:42.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a family physician myself, as
a woman myself,
I thought that the results of
the study were

47:42.159 --> 47:43.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
actually quite staggering.

47:43.994 --> 47:48.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Basically, researchers found
that we'd been
underestimating the levels of
cervical cancer

47:48.532 --> 47:50.501 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mortality.

47:50.534 --> 47:54.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And not only that, but we have
also been underestimating
the amount of racial disparities
that exist

47:54.972 --> 47:56.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in cervical cancer mortality.

47:56.373 --> 48:00.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, basically, the problem is
bigger and worse
than we thought.

48:00.845 --> 48:02.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that it's actually
quite significant.

48:02.680 --> 48:06.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, so, let's,
first of all,
talk about the underestimation
in general.

48:06.250 --> 48:07.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How could something like that
happen?

48:07.785 --> 48:10.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was a study of studies,
taking a second
look at numbers, right?

48:10.921 --> 48:11.889 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

48:11.922 --> 48:13.190 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JENNIFER CAUDLE: That's right.

48:13.224 --> 48:13.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And what did they
find that
others overlooked?

48:13.924 --> 48:14.892 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

48:14.925 --> 48:16.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JENNIFER CAUDLE: Right.

48:16.627 --> 48:17.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, that's a great question,
because the
key here -- and I always say the
devil is

48:17.328 --> 48:19.230 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the details.

48:19.263 --> 48:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The key with this particular
study is, they
took into account whether a
woman had a hysterectomy

48:22.833 --> 48:24.635 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or not.

48:24.668 --> 48:27.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, when we talk about
hysterectomy, a complete
hysterectomy often is when a
woman has her

48:27.505 --> 48:29.306 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cervix removed.

48:29.340 --> 48:32.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, if you can imagine, if a
woman doesn't
have a cervix, her chance of
getting cervical

48:32.243 --> 48:34.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cancer is slim to none.

48:34.345 --> 48:39.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That, along with the fact that
black women
tend to have a higher prevalence
of hysterectomies,

48:39.316 --> 48:43.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you can see how both of those
factors, when
they're actually taken into
consideration,

48:43.854 --> 48:45.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can cause the results that we
saw.

48:45.623 --> 48:49.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, basically, when researchers
looked at
whether a woman had a
hysterectomy or not,

48:49.794 --> 48:54.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we found that our prior results
actually had
been underestimated, and more
women had cervical

48:54.832 --> 48:58.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cancer mortality rates, higher
rates, and
more racial disparities that
than we thought.

48:58.636 --> 49:02.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So, you really
don't have to
be a scientist to realize that,
if you remove

49:02.807 --> 49:05.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the group of people who don't
have a cervix
at all, you are going to have a
different

49:06.010 --> 49:07.778 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
set of numbers.

49:07.812 --> 49:11.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But let's -- help us understand
a little bit
more about why African-American
women might

49:11.916 --> 49:13.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
disproportionately be affected.

49:13.684 --> 49:14.652 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

49:14.685 --> 49:15.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JENNIFER CAUDLE: Right.

49:15.853 --> 49:17.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm really glad that we're
talking about
this.

49:17.655 --> 49:21.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I wrote my op-ed piece, you
know, I was
speaking as a family physician,
but also as

49:21.659 --> 49:22.726 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a black woman.

49:22.760 --> 49:25.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And racial disparities in health
care, it's
not new.

49:25.996 --> 49:30.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unfortunately, we see racial
disparities in
health care in cervical cancer
here, but also

49:30.568 --> 49:32.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in many other cancers and other
conditions.

49:32.670 --> 49:36.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But one of the things that we're
looking at
is why exactly these racial
disparities exist.

49:36.740 --> 49:41.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, yes, there are many
organizations that
have been working on this sort
of topic globally.

49:41.145 --> 49:42.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And there's not one answer.

49:43.013 --> 49:47.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we do think there might be
some reasons
why black women have higher
rates of cervical

49:47.751 --> 49:53.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cancer mortality, some of those
being access
to care, the ability to get
screened early,

49:53.157 --> 49:58.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get screened period, the type
of cancer
that black women get vs. white
women, and

49:58.162 --> 49:59.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the types of treatments that are
offered.

49:59.964 --> 50:05.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, those are some of the things
that have
been posed as possibilities as
to why we see

50:05.469 --> 50:06.437 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the discrepancy.

50:06.470 --> 50:09.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the bottom line is, it's
unfortunate.

50:09.540 --> 50:11.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's something we have to
keep talking
about.

50:11.375 --> 50:14.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: This is a
particularly poignant
one for those of us here at the
"NewsHour."

50:14.678 --> 50:19.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, in November, we lost
Gwen Ifill
to gynecological cancer, a
different kind

50:19.216 --> 50:21.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of gynecological cancer.

50:21.051 --> 50:25.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the case of cervical cancer,
I know it's
very difficult for families who
are affected,

50:25.856 --> 50:29.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because, with screening, and in
some cases
a vaccine, it can be prevented.

50:29.960 --> 50:30.928 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

50:30.961 --> 50:32.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JENNIFER CAUDLE: That's right.

50:32.897 --> 50:34.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's, I think, one of the
most important
points here, is, as we're
looking at the global

50:34.865 --> 50:38.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issue of why are there racial
disparities,
why are there higher mortality
rates than

50:38.702 --> 50:41.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we thought, we also need to look
at what we
do have.

50:41.272 --> 50:42.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And you're right.

50:42.506 --> 50:44.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have a screening tool to
screen for cervical
cancer.

50:44.608 --> 50:47.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the Pap smear, along with
the HPV Testing.

50:47.344 --> 50:51.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We also have the HPV, or human
papilloma virus,
vaccine.

50:51.181 --> 50:54.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was made available in 2006,
and it is
indicated for young women.

50:54.585 --> 50:59.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It doesn't protect against all
strains of
HPV that can cause cervical
cancer, but it

50:59.456 --> 51:01.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
does protect against many of
them.

51:01.158 --> 51:04.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the hope is that, in further
years, we're
going to see the benefit of that
vaccine.

51:04.528 --> 51:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: As we speak here
in Washington,
the Trump administration,
Congress appears

51:09.099 --> 51:12.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
poised to reverse Obamacare, the
Affordable
Care Act.

51:12.436 --> 51:13.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What should we do about that?

51:13.737 --> 51:15.472 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

51:15.506 --> 51:17.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER CAUDLE: We know the
Affordable Care
Act provided care to maybe some
millions,

51:17.308 --> 51:18.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
20 million or so people.

51:18.943 --> 51:22.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the question is, what's
going to happen
if that changes and how it
changes?

51:22.212 --> 51:24.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there are so many question
marks that
we don't have.

51:24.748 --> 51:28.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One thing I know, as a family
physician, though,
is that we have to -- whatever
system we go

51:28.118 --> 51:33.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to next, whatever -- however
Obamacare changes
or doesn't change, we need to
make sure that

51:33.324 --> 51:36.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people still have access to
quality and affordable
care.

51:36.460 --> 51:40.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we need to make sure that
we're really
reinforcing preventative
services, because

51:40.331 --> 51:45.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things like colonoscopies, and
Paps, and mammograms,
not only do they save lives, but
they save

51:45.069 --> 51:46.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
money down the line.

51:46.904 --> 51:49.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's one of the things
that we're talking
about here with cervical cancer
screening

51:49.940 --> 51:52.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is, we have got to make sure
that these preventative
services are there.

51:52.843 --> 51:57.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Dr. Jennifer
Caudle, thank

in Vice President
Pence's office has seen a lot of
history.

interviewed him
where past vice presidents and
presidents,

52:17.301 --> 52:20.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
including Teddy Roosevelt, have
left their
marks, literally.
