JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.271 --> 00:07.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.107 --> 00:11.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: a
critical threat
in Britain, new arrests tied to
the Manchester

00:11.945 --> 00:17.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attack, as police search for a
network allegedly
behind the bomber.

00:17.617 --> 00:21.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also ahead this Wednesday:
one-on-one with
senator Dianne Feinstein.

00:21.755 --> 00:26.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A key member of the Intelligence
Committee
weighs in on the state of the
Russia investigations

00:26.659 --> 00:32.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the revelation that former
FBI Director
James Comey kept records of his
meetings with

00:32.065 --> 00:33.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
President Trump.

00:33.066 --> 00:34.834 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D),
California: One way
or another, they're going to be
turned over.

00:36.936 --> 00:39.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it's just a question of
time.

00:39.305 --> 00:43.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His documents are fundamental to
the issue
of his firing.

00:43.643 --> 00:51.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Then, we are in
Rome for President
Trump's first meeting with the
pope.

00:51.484 --> 00:58.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Plus: celebrating the
intersection between
music and technology.

00:58.625 --> 01:02.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown takes us to a
festival pushing
the boundaries of sound.

01:02.629 --> 01:08.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUZANNE CIANI, Composer: There's
something
to be said about all music being
some translation

01:08.201 --> 01:11.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of our languaging, our way of
communicating.

01:11.671 --> 01:12.839 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's a language.

01:12.872 --> 01:14.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is a new language.

01:14.908 --> 01:23.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:23.316 --> 01:26.052 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:26.086 --> 01:35.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The investigation
into Monday
night's bombing in Manchester,
England, is

01:35.728 --> 01:41.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
spreading; 22-year-old
British-born Salman
Abedi blew himself up at a
concert Monday

01:41.768 --> 01:44.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
night, killing 22 people.

01:44.370 --> 01:48.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, police in Libya arrested
his father
and younger brother.

01:48.775 --> 01:52.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
British officials say Abedi
recently returned
from Libya.

01:52.445 --> 01:55.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Meanwhile, several more arrests
in Manchester.

01:55.215 --> 01:59.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ciaran Jenkins of Independent
Television News
has that story.

01:59.752 --> 02:06.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CIARAN JENKINS: This is now a
hunt for Salman
Abedi's accomplices, armed
police and special

02:06.226 --> 02:09.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forces forcing their way into a
Central Manchester
property earlier.

02:09.829 --> 02:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It took a controlled explosion
to get them
in.

02:13.500 --> 02:19.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the south of Manchester,
three more arrests,
and another in Wigan tonight,
followed the

02:19.172 --> 02:21.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
arrest yesterday of Abedi's
older brother.

02:21.608 --> 02:26.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, there is a real urgency to
police activity
in this city today.

02:27.013 --> 02:31.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Remember, the current threat
level means an
attack is expected imminently.

02:31.184 --> 02:35.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police want to know if there are
more bombs
in circulation, or if there are
other potential

02:35.788 --> 02:40.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attackers and, crucially, who
made this man's
deadly device.

02:40.527 --> 02:45.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Police have yet to say
definitively if it
was the work of an accomplice,
but, this afternoon,

02:45.932 --> 02:49.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the first confirmation that
Abedi didn't act
alone.

02:49.702 --> 02:54.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you believe somebody else put
the bomb
together, and are you searching
for that person?

02:54.174 --> 02:56.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is this a search now for a
bomb-maker?

02:56.075 --> 02:58.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IAN HOPKINS, Greater Manchester
Chief Constable:
I think it's very clear that
this is a network

02:59.012 --> 02:59.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that we are investigating.

03:00.013 --> 03:03.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, as I said, it continues at
apace.

03:03.049 --> 03:08.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's extensive investigations
going on
and activity taking place across
Greater Manchester

03:09.022 --> 03:10.723 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as we speak.

03:10.757 --> 03:15.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CIARAN JENKINS: The threat level
is at its
highest for the first time in 10
years, the

03:15.461 --> 03:22.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
army enlisted to protect key
landmarks at
Buckingham Palace and in
Westminster.

03:22.035 --> 03:26.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Manchester armed police patrol
Piccadilly
Station and the Arndale shopping
center.

03:26.639 --> 03:31.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: It's not going to stop me
going about
my daily life or anything like
that.

03:31.377 --> 03:33.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just something in the back
of the mind
that's a bit scary.

03:33.680 --> 03:40.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: It really all just feels
like a different
place, you know?

03:40.420 --> 03:44.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CIARAN JENKINS: As the hours
pass, we learn
a little more of the innocent
children who

03:44.857 --> 03:47.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were killed, and the adults who
accompanied
them.

03:47.994 --> 03:53.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michelle Kiss, a mother of
three, taken, her
family said, in the most
traumatic way.

03:53.499 --> 03:59.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Kelly Brewster, her friends
said she died
saving a young life, throwing
her body on

03:59.272 --> 04:02.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
her niece as the bomb exploded.

04:03.009 --> 04:07.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Saffie Rousso from Leyland was
the youngest
victim, 8 years old.

04:08.014 --> 04:13.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS UPTON, Headmaster: Saffie
was simply
a beautiful little girl in every
aspect of

04:13.186 --> 04:14.821 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the word.

04:14.854 --> 04:19.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was loved by everyone, and
her warmth
and kindness will be remembered
fondly.

04:19.626 --> 04:22.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Saffie was quiet and unassuming,
with a creative
flair.

04:22.895 --> 04:29.135 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CIARAN JENKINS: There is
resilience in a Manchester,
all too conscious of the
still-imminent threat,

04:29.168 --> 04:35.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but there is impatience too to
see those who
brought horror to this city
taken off the

04:35.608 --> 04:37.176 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
streets.

04:37.210 --> 04:41.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This evening,
police in Manchester
announced two more arrests.

04:41.681 --> 04:47.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Britain's home secretary
criticized U.S.
officials for leaking the name
of the bomber

04:47.086 --> 04:49.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and other information.

04:49.155 --> 04:53.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
Congressional
Budget Office issued its
analysis of the Republican

04:53.359 --> 04:58.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bill to replace Obamacare, a
bill that passed
the House of Representatives.

04:58.531 --> 05:04.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It estimates the measure would
leave 23 million
more Americans without health
insurance by

05:04.437 --> 05:05.571 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2026.

05:05.605 --> 05:09.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, that is one million fewer
than an earlier
version.

05:09.108 --> 05:15.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The report also projects deficit
reduction
of $119 billion over 10 years.

05:15.615 --> 05:17.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is slightly less than
before.

05:17.684 --> 05:21.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will take a closer look later
in the program.

05:21.754 --> 05:27.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Word has leaked that President
Trump disclosed
that the U.S. had positioned two
nuclear submarines

05:27.894 --> 05:29.729 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
off North Korea.

05:29.762 --> 05:35.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The New York Times is reporting
that Mr. Trump
revealed the information in an
April 29 phone

05:35.368 --> 05:38.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
call with Philippines President
Rodrigo Duterte.

05:38.805 --> 05:44.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to confidential
transcripts, he
also praised Duterte for doing
-- quote -- "an

05:44.043 --> 05:47.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unbelievable job" fighting
drugs.

05:47.246 --> 05:51.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thousands of drug suspects have
been killed
since Duterte took office.

05:51.751 --> 05:56.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fighting raged for a second day
in the Southern
Philippines, where Islamist
militants have

05:56.522 --> 05:58.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
seized control of a city.

05:58.491 --> 06:00.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At least 21 people have been
killed.

06:01.027 --> 06:05.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fighting broke out yesterday
in Marawi
City, on the island of Mindanao.

06:05.898 --> 06:09.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Duterte responded by
imposing martial
law.

06:09.669 --> 06:14.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thousands of residents fled the
area today
amid tight security, as Duterte
vowed to hunt

06:14.774 --> 06:17.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
down the militants.

06:17.176 --> 06:22.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RODRIGO DUTERTE, Philippine
President: If
I think you should die, you will
die.

06:22.248 --> 06:24.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
If you fight us, you will die.

06:24.584 --> 06:28.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If there is an open defiance,
you will die.

06:28.788 --> 06:33.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And if it means many people
dying, so be it.

06:33.993 --> 06:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Philippines
president also
said that he might extend
martial law nationwide

06:40.633 --> 06:44.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if the Islamic State group gains
a foothold.

06:44.504 --> 06:48.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Taiwan will become the first
Asian nation
to legalize same-sex marriage.

06:48.708 --> 06:55.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The country's constitutional
court ruled today
that a ban on such unions
violates the Taiwanese

06:55.081 --> 06:56.716 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
constitution.

06:56.749 --> 07:01.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now lawmakers have two years to
enact new
laws or amend the current
statutes.

07:01.654 --> 07:06.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they do not, couples will be
allowed to
submit a written document to
have their marriages

07:06.526 --> 07:08.327 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
recognized.

07:08.361 --> 07:13.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In economic news, Moody's rating
service lowered
China's credit rating by one
notch because

07:13.633 --> 07:15.768 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of its surging debt load.

07:15.802 --> 07:18.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Beijing protested the decision.

07:18.404 --> 07:23.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial
average gained 74 points to
close back above

07:23.709 --> 07:25.211 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
21000.

07:25.244 --> 07:31.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 24 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added six, marking a new record.

07:31.751 --> 07:36.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
I speak to
California Senator Dianne
Feinstein about

07:36.155 --> 07:42.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the latest in the Russia
investigation; the
president meets the pope, after
trading barbs

07:42.195 --> 07:52.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with him last year; Montana
prepares for a
special congressional election;
and much more.

07:52.238 --> 07:58.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with him last year; Montana
prepares for a
special congressional election;
and much more.

07:58.911 --> 08:04.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are now multiple
investigations into
Russian interference in the 2016
presidential

08:04.183 --> 08:07.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
election and any possible ties
to the Trump
campaign.

08:07.820 --> 08:14.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Capitol Hill, the probes have
expanded
to look into possible
obstruction and cover-up.

08:14.460 --> 08:17.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There are many questions
swirling around.

08:17.063 --> 08:21.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we put some of them to
Senator Dianne
Feinstein, Democrat of
California.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's a member of the Senate
Select Committee
on Intelligence.

08:24.537 --> 08:27.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's also ranking member of the
Senate Judiciary
Committee.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I spoke with her a short time
ago.

08:30.710 --> 08:33.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Feinstein, thank you
very much for
talking with us.

08:33.613 --> 08:40.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, about those memos that
were written
by former FBI Director James
Comey, I know

08:40.286 --> 08:43.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
your committee has been asking
for those.

08:43.189 --> 08:44.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Have you received them yet from
the FBI?

08:44.824 --> 08:46.058 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

08:46.092 --> 08:46.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D),
California: No, not
to my knowledge.

08:46.826 --> 08:47.793 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We have not.

08:47.827 --> 08:49.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you expect to
get them?

08:49.295 --> 08:50.530 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

08:50.563 --> 08:51.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Well, that's
an interesting
expectation.

08:51.564 --> 08:53.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And there are two answers.

08:53.099 --> 08:55.535 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
One is yes, and one is no.

08:55.568 --> 08:57.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think we're serious.

08:57.169 --> 08:59.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I believe we're serious.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then we have to take the
next step.

09:02.675 --> 09:10.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have invited very politely
the former director
to come and meet with us and be
able to ask

09:11.017 --> 09:12.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
him questions in public.

09:12.919 --> 09:17.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
However, he has agreed to go
before Intelligence,
which I appreciate.

09:17.189 --> 09:19.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm on the committee.

09:19.125 --> 09:25.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think he also ought to
provide the documents
to our committee and be willing
to come and

09:25.464 --> 09:26.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
explain those documents.

09:26.599 --> 09:29.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are the oversight committee,
after all.

09:29.735 --> 09:32.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has said he wants to make a
public appearance.

09:32.672 --> 09:40.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He will do that at Intelligence,
and I think
he also should provide those
documents and

09:40.179 --> 09:42.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
make an appearance at Judiciary
and explain
them.

09:42.815 --> 09:47.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How much of an
obstacle is
it, Senator, if those documents
are not turned

09:47.119 --> 09:48.087 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
over?

09:48.120 --> 09:49.822 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

09:49.855 --> 09:51.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Well, I mean,
one way or
another, they're going to be
turned over.

09:51.791 --> 09:55.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it's just a question of
time.

09:55.227 --> 10:02.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that his documents
are fundamental
to the issue of his firing.

10:02.635 --> 10:05.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How many times did he meet with
the president?

10:05.338 --> 10:07.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What were the circumstances?

10:07.373 --> 10:09.241 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What was said?

10:09.275 --> 10:22.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And was there any unusual
request, such as
leading to an investigation,
potential investigation

10:22.655 --> 10:24.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the president of the United
States?

10:25.024 --> 10:30.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think that that's
something that one
way or another is going to come
out, and those

10:30.663 --> 10:32.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
documents will come out.

10:32.698 --> 10:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's quite proper that they
do so.

10:34.533 --> 10:41.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what -- he kept notes to
be able to
protect himself in the event of
something

10:41.107 --> 10:43.009 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that's untoward.

10:43.042 --> 10:49.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, how much
of this investigation
do you expect may ultimately be
about any

10:49.448 --> 10:55.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
efforts by the president or by
the White House,
the administration, to stop or
slow down this

10:55.221 --> 10:56.188 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investigation?

10:56.222 --> 10:57.189 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

10:57.223 --> 10:59.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Hard to tell.

10:59.125 --> 11:02.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think I can answer that
at this stage.

11:02.995 --> 11:07.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the president -- it's
interesting
the president is apparently in
the process

11:07.199 --> 11:10.136 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of retaining outside counsel.

11:10.169 --> 11:17.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That would likely have to do
with events that
an investigation might reveal.

11:17.710 --> 11:23.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am one that believes that both
the House
Intelligence Committee and the
Senate Intelligence

11:23.082 --> 11:32.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Committee ought to add
investigators and people
with prosecutorial expertise to
the staff

11:32.525 --> 11:34.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for this investigation.

11:34.293 --> 11:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it has to be well -known
now that
even the 9/11 Commission had
about 100 staffers

11:40.933 --> 11:47.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and people with prosecutorial
experience and
investigative experience.

11:48.007 --> 11:53.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We, in the Intelligence
Committee, have our
intelligence staff, and they're
accustomed

11:53.879 --> 11:59.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to reading intelligence,
interpreting intelligence,
and they're very good at what
they do.

11:59.251 --> 12:05.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But one of the things that's
been brought
to my attention is that you need
technical

12:05.491 --> 12:06.459 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

12:06.492 --> 12:07.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you're going to follow the
money...

12:07.560 --> 12:08.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.362 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DIANNE FEINSTEIN: ... as
Representative Speier
said, and get involved with
financing, you

12:12.665 --> 12:20.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need financial people that will
show you how
to and, in fact, get the
appropriate information

12:20.873 --> 12:23.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the appropriate way.

12:23.342 --> 12:29.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it's an investigation you're
looking at,
you need people, I think, who
are trained

12:29.081 --> 12:30.049 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investigators.

12:30.082 --> 12:32.017 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
And...

12:32.051 --> 12:34.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator --
Senator, if I may,
it sounds as if you're saying
this investigation,

12:34.353 --> 12:39.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the potential size of it has
grown much larger
than even what it seemed to be a
week ago.

12:39.458 --> 12:40.426 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

12:40.459 --> 12:41.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Well, I think
that's right.

12:41.527 --> 12:43.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think that is happening.

12:43.462 --> 12:52.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, as events go and
comments are made
by principal parties, it adds to
the investigative

12:52.371 --> 12:55.374 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
material that's out there.

12:55.407 --> 13:01.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that what both the
House and the
Senate needs to do is create the
atmosphere

13:01.480 --> 13:10.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where Bob Mueller could come in
as an absolutely
responsible and respected former
prosecutor,

13:10.289 --> 13:16.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
former U.S. attorney, former
director of the
FBI, and be the special counsel,
and see that

13:16.629 --> 13:24.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the FBI counterterrorism
investigation and
criminal investigation -- it's
both -- are

13:25.004 --> 13:30.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
able to proceed as rapid -- is
able to proceed
as rapidly as possible.

13:30.276 --> 13:35.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Washington
Post reported
last Friday, Senator, I'm sure
you know, that

13:35.314 --> 13:40.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the investigation -- that there
is a -- quote
-- "person of interest" in this
investigation

13:40.820 --> 13:45.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who is a senior official in the
Trump White
House who's very close to the
president.

13:45.791 --> 13:46.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do you know who that is?

13:46.792 --> 13:47.760 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:47.793 --> 13:49.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIANNE FEINSTEIN: No, I do not.

13:49.161 --> 13:51.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I read the same article, but I
do not know
who that person is.

13:51.931 --> 13:56.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are you getting
the cooperation
from everyone you're seeking?

13:56.702 --> 14:02.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that General Flynn,
Michael Flynn,
has declined to turn over
documents, but,

14:02.274 --> 14:05.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other than General Flynn, are
there others
who are not cooperating?

14:05.644 --> 14:07.279 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:07.313 --> 14:10.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANNE FEINSTEIN: I think, with
respect to
the Judiciary Committee, Senator
Grassley

14:10.182 --> 14:12.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and I spoke on the floor.

14:12.618 --> 14:22.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have written letters
asking for materials
and asking that Mr. Comey,
inviting him to

14:22.294 --> 14:23.429 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
appear.

14:23.462 --> 14:26.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we perhaps need to do
more than just
invite.

14:26.866 --> 14:33.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's important that he
come before
the oversight committee that has
responsibility

14:33.239 --> 14:41.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for oversight of the FBI and at
least do us
the courtesy of appearing, and
that we should

14:41.313 --> 14:45.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be able to look at his material
and ask questions
about them.

14:45.517 --> 14:50.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, I think both Senator
Grassley -- are on
the same pathway to that.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, hopefully, we will be able
to accomplish
it.

14:53.058 --> 14:58.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Senator, I
want to turn
you to one other issue that's
much before

14:58.764 --> 15:04.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congress right now, and that is
the health
care reform bill that passed the
House of

15:04.603 --> 15:05.571 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Representatives.

15:05.604 --> 15:06.572 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:06.605 --> 15:07.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Oh, yes.

15:07.606 --> 15:09.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's now in the
Senate.

15:09.441 --> 15:12.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Congressional Budget Office
came up -- came
out just this afternoon with its
own estimate

15:12.411 --> 15:14.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the cost and the
implications.

15:14.847 --> 15:20.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And among other things, it says
that almost
as many people will be without
insurance under

15:20.719 --> 15:26.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this proposed legislation as
there was in
the original Republican
proposal.

15:26.458 --> 15:30.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it your sense that this bill
has a chance
in the U.S. Senate right now?

15:30.863 --> 15:31.964 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:31.997 --> 15:34.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Well, no one
knows what's
in it.

15:34.133 --> 15:39.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My understanding, there was a
committee of
about 12 men appointed from the
Senate to

15:39.705 --> 15:41.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
put together a bill.

15:41.473 --> 15:46.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the same mistake is
being made in
the Senate that was made in the
House, no

15:46.979 --> 15:48.647 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
public hearings.

15:48.681 --> 15:52.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The medical profession has no
chance to respond.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The insurance industry can't
respond.

15:54.954 --> 16:00.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those people that run hospitals
can't respond,
and the general public can't
respond.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's unbelievable.

16:02.928 --> 16:11.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the first time in my
over 20 years
in the Senate a big bill, a
costly bill, a

16:11.136 --> 16:20.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bill important to every single
American citizen
has no hearing and goes right on
to the floor

16:20.312 --> 16:22.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as some kind of secretive
document.

16:22.982 --> 16:26.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have no idea what's in the
Senate bill.

16:26.919 --> 16:29.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's not the way business
should be done.

16:29.955 --> 16:37.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It creates an atmosphere that
makes a bill
more difficult to pass, not less
difficult.

16:37.629 --> 16:40.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it certainly gets the
emotions going.

16:40.632 --> 16:45.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have 24 million people who
are going to
be without insurance.

16:45.571 --> 16:47.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It makes no sense to me.

16:47.373 --> 16:50.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we will
certainly all
be watching to see what happens
to it in the

16:50.743 --> 16:51.710 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Senate.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senator Dianne Feinstein, we
thank you.

16:53.512 --> 16:54.480 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:54.513 --> 16:56.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Thank you,
Judy.

16:56.382 --> 17:06.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we return to
the Manchester
attack and the ongoing
investigations happening

17:06.492 --> 17:10.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we return to
the Manchester
attack and the ongoing
investigations happening

17:10.863 --> 17:12.164 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Britain.

17:12.197 --> 17:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham takes a deeper
look.

17:14.066 --> 17:18.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As British
officials continue
to piece together who was behind
this attack,

17:18.203 --> 17:22.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and to try to stop another from
occurring,
we wanted to take a closer look
at just how

17:22.608 --> 17:25.277 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the U.K. handles
counterterrorism.

17:25.310 --> 17:27.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For that, I'm joined by R.P.
Eddy.

17:27.379 --> 17:31.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He served on the staff of the
National Security
Council during the Clinton
administration,

17:31.450 --> 17:33.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where he worked closely with
British officials.

17:33.452 --> 17:39.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he is the author, along with
Richard Clarke,
of "Warnings: Finding Cassandras
to Stop Catastrophes."

17:39.525 --> 17:41.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
R.P. Eddy, thanks very much for
being here.

17:41.827 --> 17:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wonder if you could just start
off telling
us the distinctions that U.K.
intelligence

17:48.233 --> 17:52.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and terror officials have as
compared to,
say, U.S. officials?

17:52.204 --> 17:55.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
R.P. EDDY, Former National
Security Council
Staff Member: Well, overall,
it's a fairly

17:55.474 --> 17:56.442 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
similar system.

17:56.475 --> 17:59.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is probably two key
differences.

17:59.044 --> 18:04.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is, it's easier to open up
investigations
and surveillance on individuals
in the U.K.,

18:04.917 --> 18:08.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
British citizens or others, than
it is in
the United States.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The second thing is that we have
an inverted
model.

18:10.322 --> 18:13.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the United States -- for
example, here,
I'm sitting in New York City.

18:13.225 --> 18:18.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The NYPD would go out and
collect much of
the intelligence about a
terrorist attack,

18:18.263 --> 18:24.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
potential terrorist attack, and
then the FBI
would make the arrest, depending
on the maturity

18:24.670 --> 18:26.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the intelligence collection
in the city.

18:26.839 --> 18:29.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In London, in the U.K., it's
opposite.

18:29.341 --> 18:34.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Metropolitan Police Service
or the local
police would actually do the
arresting, where

18:34.379 --> 18:37.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MI5 and MPS would do the
intelligence gathering.

18:37.649 --> 18:42.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the key difference is, it's
easier to
begin surveillance on people of
concern.

18:42.521 --> 18:48.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And the U.K.,
I know, also
has a wide network of CCTV
cameras, where

18:48.961 --> 18:53.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know that that's been a
relevant tool in
prior terror investigations.

18:53.098 --> 18:55.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
R.P. EDDY: It's a massive
difference.

18:55.200 --> 18:59.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they adapted the use of
closed-circuit
televisions much earlier than we
did in the

18:59.605 --> 19:01.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
United States in our major
cities.

19:01.607 --> 19:08.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And in every terrorist
investigation since
the '80s, CCTVs have been hugely
useful in

19:08.247 --> 19:11.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very quickly figuring out who
was behind it
and wrapping up the cell.

19:11.783 --> 19:17.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That and the laws, most of these
things are
children of growing up in the
era of the IRA

19:17.723 --> 19:19.491 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
threat.

19:19.525 --> 19:21.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So they addressed their
terrorism threat and
got over some of their learnings
earlier than

19:21.860 --> 19:23.562 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
we did.

19:23.595 --> 19:26.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Even so, with
all those
tools, it's clear that the U.K.
officials

19:26.798 --> 19:28.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
missed this particular plot.

19:28.767 --> 19:35.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it seems to me that this is
just an indication
of how difficult it is to
identify individuals

19:35.407 --> 19:39.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or maybe a group of individuals
who are trying
to plot quietly these types of
attacks.

19:39.945 --> 19:43.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
R.P. EDDY: Well, let's say
there's probably
two big reasons for that.

19:43.615 --> 19:45.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The first one is technological.

19:45.417 --> 19:49.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you have heard a number of
U.S. government
officials and British government
officials

19:49.588 --> 19:53.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the last three or four
years bemoan the
fact that it's much easier now
to encrypt

19:53.892 --> 19:58.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your communications on your cell
phone or
over the Internet to a
military-grade level

19:58.063 --> 19:59.932 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than it used to be.

19:59.965 --> 20:04.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in some instances, we're
blind as we try
to do collection on those
signals intelligence.

20:04.436 --> 20:07.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So that's the first reason that
it's a little
harder, or much harder.

20:07.506 --> 20:10.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The second reason is, ISIS is
different than
al-Qaida.

20:10.142 --> 20:14.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, part of why they're
different is, they're
interested in -- or they're more
willing to

20:14.746 --> 20:21.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allow or to foster what you
would call retail
attacks, small attacks by lone
wolves or people

20:21.320 --> 20:26.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are just sort of getting
converted into
extremism by ISIS, whereas
al-Qaida, as we

20:26.959 --> 20:32.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, is more interested in
large-scale attacks,
taking down huge buildings,
blowing up embassies,

20:32.497 --> 20:34.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
doing things simultaneously.

20:34.333 --> 20:38.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So the latter model, the
al-Qaida, is easier
to find, requires more planning,
and, of course,

20:38.804 --> 20:41.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
requires larger cells, requires
more training.

20:41.139 --> 20:46.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The ISIS model, of being an idea
of mass destruction,
is much harder to catch.

20:46.478 --> 20:49.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Someone can be just converted
into extremism
over the Internet.

20:49.548 --> 20:54.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They don't even have to meet
anybody, and
they can go off and carry out
smaller, harder-to-surveil,

20:54.820 --> 20:57.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
harder-to-stop terrorist
attacks.

20:57.089 --> 21:02.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The theater
that was the
site of this attack is what's
known as a soft

21:02.294 --> 21:06.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
target, a place where the
security apparatus
is just not that robust.

21:06.765 --> 21:12.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do we as a society writ
large go about
trying to harden places like
that?

21:12.604 --> 21:17.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Either we do that to try to
prevent these
types of things or we just, in
some level,

21:17.409 --> 21:21.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
try to become accustomed to the
fact that
this might be a more common
occurrence.

21:21.046 --> 21:24.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
R.P. EDDY: Well, we should never
become accustomed
to it.

21:24.650 --> 21:28.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would say, editorially, I
don't think
we should allow these
conversations that say,

21:28.120 --> 21:32.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
oh, it was only 22 people, look
how many died
from dirty water the same day.

21:32.557 --> 21:34.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those are both horrible things,
but they're
different.

21:34.926 --> 21:39.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Terrorism, these terrorist acts,
terrorize,
and they change things
politically and they

21:39.097 --> 21:40.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
change our way of life.

21:40.399 --> 21:43.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, can we accept that our soft
targets are
going to be hit?

21:43.935 --> 21:45.003 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

21:45.037 --> 21:47.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it very, very hard to protect
these soft
targets?

21:47.472 --> 21:48.573 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Absolutely.

21:48.607 --> 21:50.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Think about the last time you
went to the
airport.

21:50.375 --> 21:54.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you got through TSA, the
magnetometers,
you had a degree of safety.

21:54.246 --> 21:59.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as you waited in line,
queued up, 50 or
1,000 of you, you are a very
soft target.

21:59.384 --> 22:00.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The same thing happens at
theaters.

22:00.952 --> 22:03.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The same thing happens at
football games.

22:03.155 --> 22:07.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it's a very unfortunate
reality that we
really can't secure everything.

22:07.526 --> 22:12.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And ISIS is sort of
well-situated by allowing
or fostering these smaller
attacks to hit

22:12.764 --> 22:14.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
us at that weak point.

22:14.266 --> 22:17.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
R.P. Eddy, thank
you very much for your time.

22:17.469 --> 22:22.407 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
R.P. EDDY: Thanks for having me.

22:22.441 --> 22:33.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump's
first trip
abroad placed him at the Vatican
today, marking

22:33.518 --> 22:37.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump's first meeting with
the leader
of the Catholic Church.

22:37.556 --> 22:42.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant is in
Rome for us tonight, and he has
this report.

22:42.494 --> 22:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: It was a
meeting of two men
with a difficult history.

22:48.667 --> 22:53.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
After a public greeting,
President Trump and
Pope Francis spoke privately for
half-an-hour.

22:53.105 --> 22:59.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later, there were introductions
all around,
and group pictures, with Mr.
Trump smiling

22:59.411 --> 23:02.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
broadly, and the pontiff
stone-faced.

23:02.447 --> 23:04.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just a little over a year ago,
they clashed
publicly.

23:04.583 --> 23:09.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The pope took on the Trump
campaign pledge
to build a wall along the
U.S.-Mexico border.

23:09.221 --> 23:13.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
POPE FRANCIS, Leader of Catholic
Church (through
translator): A person who thinks
only about

23:13.225 --> 23:18.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
building walls, wherever they
may be, and
not building bridges, is not a
Christian.

23:18.397 --> 23:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The candidate
answered with
a dig of his own.

23:22.033 --> 23:25.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
For a religious leader to
question a person's

23:25.971 --> 23:27.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
faith is disgraceful.

23:27.339 --> 23:30.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Today, instead
of barbs,
they exchanged gifts.

23:30.842 --> 23:36.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump presented the pope
with a first-edition
set of Martin Luther King Jr.'s
works.

23:36.448 --> 23:40.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Francis offered his three main
teaching documents
and an olive branch medal.

23:40.986 --> 23:43.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We can use peace.

23:43.221 --> 23:47.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Later, after
touring the
Sistine Chapel and St. Peter's
Basilica, and

23:47.259 --> 23:49.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president offered a new
assessment of
the pope.

23:50.028 --> 23:51.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: He is something.

23:51.329 --> 23:52.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He is really good.

23:52.397 --> 23:53.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We had a fantastic meeting.

23:53.698 --> 23:55.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We had a fantastic tour.

23:55.033 --> 23:56.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was really beautiful.

23:56.835 --> 24:00.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: President
Trump's take on
his meeting with Pope Francis
differs greatly

24:00.672 --> 24:03.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the interpretation of
veteran Vatican
analysts.

24:03.809 --> 24:05.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They believe that the president
was exaggerating.

24:05.744 --> 24:10.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Vatican issued an unusually
brief statement
about the discussions.

24:10.182 --> 24:15.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICCARDO CRISTIANO, Journalist:
They qualified
the meeting as cordial, which
means that the

24:15.520 --> 24:24.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meeting wasn't a cold one, but a
cordial one,
but, in any case, it was not a
warm meeting.

24:24.996 --> 24:29.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Longtime
Vatican watcher
Riccardo Cristiano says he
doubts there was

24:29.334 --> 24:31.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
any meeting of minds.

24:31.069 --> 24:39.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICCARDO CRISTIANO: I think that
it was a
opportunity to meet, but also
The impression

24:39.077 --> 24:43.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is that they understood they
have different
perspectives.

24:43.148 --> 24:46.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Analyst Robert
Mickens was
far more upbeat.

24:46.952 --> 24:48.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He says it was a success for the
Vatican.

24:48.887 --> 24:51.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT MICKENS, Analyst: Pope
Francis is always
very gracious.

24:51.857 --> 24:55.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He likes to build bridges of
encounter.

24:55.260 --> 25:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's very, very important to get
the superpower
online with the soft power, the
Holy See.

25:01.967 --> 25:06.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The president
also met with
the Vatican's secretary of
state, who encouraged

25:06.705 --> 25:10.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
continued U.S. participation in
the Paris
climate agreement.

25:10.675 --> 25:15.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson
gave his
own appraisal on the flight from
Rome to Brussels.

25:15.914 --> 25:20.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary of
State: Well,
we had a good exchange on the
difficulty of

25:20.418 --> 25:26.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
balancing, addressing climate
change, responses
to climate change, and ensuring
that you still

25:26.458 --> 25:28.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have a thriving economy.

25:28.326 --> 25:32.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The president
arrived in
Brussels this evening for
meetings with European

25:32.631 --> 25:38.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Union and NATO officials, and
was greeted
by the Belgian prime minister
and royal family.

25:38.737 --> 25:44.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thousands of demonstrators also
turned out,
protesting the president's
immigration and

25:44.709 --> 25:46.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
environmental policies.

25:46.044 --> 25:53.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Rome.

25:53.318 --> 26:03.595 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

26:03.628 --> 26:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": how
the Trump
administration is changing the
makeup of the

26:08.500 --> 26:15.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EPA; the ripple effects of fake
news -- a
Democratic staffer's death
sparks conspiracy

26:15.240 --> 26:20.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
theories; plus, a festival that
melds technology
and music.

26:20.679 --> 26:25.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, let's go back to the
health care
battle and the new analysis that
came out

26:25.784 --> 26:31.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
late today from the
Congressional Budget Office
of the GOP bill that passed the
House of Representatives

26:31.423 --> 26:33.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
almost three weeks ago.

26:33.091 --> 26:35.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It now sits with the Senate.

26:35.260 --> 26:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The CBO found that the House
bill would lead
to 23 million more people being
uninsured

26:40.999 --> 26:49.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the year 2026 and it would
reduce the deficit
by about $119 billion over a
decade.

26:49.074 --> 26:52.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our Lisa Desjardins has been
studying the
numbers and watching the
politics of all of

26:52.744 --> 26:54.579 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this, and she joins me now.

26:54.613 --> 26:57.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Lisa, you have had a little
bit of time
to look at this.

26:57.782 --> 27:02.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Essentially, what is different
about the CBO's
look at this version of
Republican health

27:02.587 --> 27:04.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
care from what the earlier
version was?

27:04.723 --> 27:07.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, in those
top-line numbers,
not much.

27:07.559 --> 27:11.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The changes that the Republicans
made meant
that there was an improvement in
the number

27:11.262 --> 27:13.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of people with insurance by one
million people.

27:13.698 --> 27:16.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's something Republicans
were happy to
see, but it's not really very
much.

27:16.735 --> 27:22.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Judy, I think, overall, the
differences are
in the individual effects here.

27:22.040 --> 27:26.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We see from CBO a forecast that
says under
this Republican bill you would
see a wide

27:26.511 --> 27:31.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disparity, with the less healthy
seeing much
higher bills and also older
people seeing

27:31.883 --> 27:33.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
much higher bills.

27:33.685 --> 27:36.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, we know the
Republicans
were trying to do a number of
things with

27:36.054 --> 27:40.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this legislation to make it more
palatable
to more people to win not only
approval in

27:40.825 --> 27:42.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the House, but to win approval
in the Senate.

27:42.961 --> 27:45.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were trying to get premiums
down.

27:45.296 --> 27:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Talk about some of the changes
they made and
what the CBO is saying about
that?

27:48.199 --> 27:50.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The biggest
change a lot
of people would be familiar with
is, they

27:50.869 --> 27:55.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to give states the ability
to waive out
of requirements called essential
benefits.

27:55.340 --> 27:59.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are things that say any
health insurance
must cover the basics.

27:59.077 --> 28:01.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They want states to be able to
waive out of
that.

28:01.179 --> 28:05.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They also want states to be able
to waive
out of requirement on
preexisting conditions,

28:05.950 --> 28:09.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
allow insurers to charge more
for the sick
than they can now.

28:09.587 --> 28:14.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CBO looked at those potential
waiver changes
and what that mean for premiums.

28:14.492 --> 28:16.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's look at an example of what
we're talking
about.

28:16.761 --> 28:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, a 21-year-old
who's making,
say, $26,500, so, low-income --
that is who

28:21.700 --> 28:26.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is targeted at -- now that
21-year-old's
premium would be $1,700.

28:26.938 --> 28:31.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But under this bill in a state
that waives
out of those requirements, that
21-year-old

28:31.476 --> 28:33.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would pay $1,250.

28:33.945 --> 28:36.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's good for that healthy
21-year-old.

28:36.147 --> 28:40.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's look now instead at a
64-year-old American
paying $1,700 now.

28:40.618 --> 28:42.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But, Judy, look at that.

28:42.454 --> 28:47.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under this GOP bill, with the
waivers out
of requirements, the CBO thinks
that 64-year-old

28:47.292 --> 28:49.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would see their premiums
skyrocket.

28:49.994 --> 28:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Essentially, what the CBO has
found -- and
it's going to vary market to
market -- is

28:54.766 --> 28:58.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the less healthy and older
Americans
would see more costs.

28:58.937 --> 29:03.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, premiums are
part of the
story, but we know something
else that the

29:03.174 --> 29:07.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CBO was looking at was, frankly,
the overall
quality of health care under
this new legislation.

29:07.378 --> 29:09.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And this is
such an important
point.

29:09.347 --> 29:10.982 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have talked about premiums.

29:11.015 --> 29:13.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's sort of a buzzword in a
way, almost.

29:13.184 --> 29:17.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But CBO went deeper and said
that, in some
of these states with the
waivers, premiums

29:17.355 --> 29:22.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
may go down for some people,
but, overall,
they think that health care
costs could substantially

29:22.727 --> 29:27.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
increase, because what you're
getting are
health insurance packages that
cover a lot

29:27.332 --> 29:29.234 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
less.

29:29.267 --> 29:31.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you're sick, you might
have a low premium,
but you're going to pay a lot
more out of

29:31.903 --> 29:33.571 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pocket.

29:33.605 --> 29:37.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, Judy, I asked on a call I
just got off
of with the CBO about
stabilization.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are these markets going to be
stable?

29:39.611 --> 29:44.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They told me point blank they
think there
will be a stability problem in
these waiver

29:44.449 --> 29:46.284 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
markets.

29:46.317 --> 29:49.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say some people may not be
able to get
premiums at all and it would
take those markets

29:49.287 --> 29:52.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back to the days before the
Affordable Care
Act.

29:52.991 --> 29:55.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Essentially, Judy, more of a
gamble for Americans.

29:55.627 --> 29:58.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You would able to pay less, but
you would
have much higher risk.

29:58.263 --> 30:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sounds like this
is going to
be even more complicated than
what the Republicans

30:02.433 --> 30:06.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- it's going to make what they
sent over
more complicated and make it
challenging to

30:06.371 --> 30:08.106 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
get it passed.

30:08.139 --> 30:11.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I don't see any
Republicans
coming out with happy tweets or
statements

30:11.509 --> 30:12.777 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

30:12.811 --> 30:15.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No, Democrats are talking about
the CBO score,
not Republicans.

30:15.480 --> 30:25.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa Desjardins,
following
the story, thank you very much.

30:25.523 --> 30:30.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa Desjardins,
following
the story, thank you very much.

30:30.895 --> 30:36.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And sticking with politics,
Montana's at-large
seat in the U.S. House of
Representatives

30:36.367 --> 30:41.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is up for grabs, and Democrats
are eager to
frame the fight as a referendum
on President

30:41.840 --> 30:43.608 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

30:43.641 --> 30:47.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To discuss why tomorrow's
special election
is garnering national attention,
we are joined

30:47.612 --> 30:50.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by Anna Rau of Montana PBS.

30:50.415 --> 30:53.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Anna, thank you for joining us.

30:53.084 --> 30:54.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Montana is a very red state.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why is this even close?

30:56.421 --> 30:58.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNA RAU, Montana PBS: Well,
that's the question,
actually, going forward.

30:58.990 --> 31:03.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think people are watching
it from the
outside very closely, because it
has tightened

31:03.695 --> 31:05.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the last month.

31:05.496 --> 31:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have seen it go from maybe
15 -- 12 to
15 points, and then internal
polling within

31:08.266 --> 31:13.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the campaigns are showing closer
maybe eight
to 10 points, maybe six to eight
points, so

31:13.738 --> 31:16.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in some of the best polls for
the Democrats.

31:16.307 --> 31:18.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's talk
about the
candidates in this race.

31:18.676 --> 31:21.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Tell us just quickly the
differences between
the two of them.

31:21.512 --> 31:22.614 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ANNA RAU: OK.

31:22.647 --> 31:24.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, they're both outsiders,
political outsiders.

31:24.949 --> 31:29.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Rob Quist is a country
bluegrass player.

31:29.187 --> 31:31.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He played with the Mission
Mountain Wood Band
back in the '70s.

31:31.256 --> 31:34.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's very popular throughout the
state for
his music, but has absolutely no
political

31:34.993 --> 31:36.828 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
experience.

31:36.861 --> 31:41.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Greg Gianforte is a
millionaire from Bozeman
who made his money creating a
great business

31:41.733 --> 31:43.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Montana that employed over
500 people.

31:43.735 --> 31:47.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So he created all these
high-wage jobs in
the software business in
Bozeman.

31:47.705 --> 31:52.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So he has this kind of business
acumen behind
him, but, again, very little
political experience.

31:52.210 --> 31:57.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He did run for governor in
November, but lost
narrowly to Governor Bullock,
who was the

31:57.715 --> 31:59.484 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
incumbent.

31:59.517 --> 32:02.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think there was a
situation there where
the whole ticket went red,
except for the

32:02.153 --> 32:03.922 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
governor's race.

32:03.955 --> 32:07.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So some of those Republicans
actually crossed
when they got to Gianforte and
Bullock, and

32:07.125 --> 32:08.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
voted for Bullock.

32:08.927 --> 32:11.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that's been kind of a thing
here too that
Quist think he's got a shot, and
Democrats

32:11.629 --> 32:14.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think they have a shot because
of what happened
in the governor's race.

32:14.198 --> 32:16.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's kind of those two
candidates, very
colorful candidate.s

32:16.501 --> 32:22.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do polls and
your interviews
with voters tell you, though, is
most on voters'

32:22.273 --> 32:24.042 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
minds?

32:24.075 --> 32:28.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNA RAU: Well, early on in the
campaign,
it sounds like the two
candidates were saying

32:28.313 --> 32:33.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
public lands and regulations out
of Washington
were the big issues, because out
West we have

32:33.418 --> 32:35.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the extractive industries,
timber and mining.

32:35.987 --> 32:39.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so when it came to
Republican voters,
they were very concerned about
EPA regulation

32:40.024 --> 32:41.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and government overreach.

32:41.926 --> 32:45.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When it came to Democrat voters
and some Republican
voters, public lands and public
access was

32:45.797 --> 32:47.031 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a big issue.

32:47.065 --> 32:49.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Montana, we have over 25
million acres
of public land.

32:49.867 --> 32:51.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Also, health care.

32:51.636 --> 32:54.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the very end here, health
care has really
picked up, especially with
what's going on

32:54.472 --> 32:56.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Washington, D.C.

32:56.140 --> 32:59.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Gianforte and Quist have
come out very
strongly on the health care
bill.

32:59.644 --> 33:01.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And there's been some
controversy about their
positions on it.

33:02.013 --> 33:05.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Quist has made that a
cornerstone of his
campaign because he had a health
care issue

33:05.650 --> 33:11.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the '90s that he says
explains some of
his problems financially and is
in favor of

33:11.356 --> 33:13.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
maybe a single-payer program.

33:13.291 --> 33:17.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Gianforte, for his part, has
said he wouldn't
support the current repeal and
replace.

33:17.662 --> 33:20.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just very
quick final question.

33:20.331 --> 33:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much has Donald Trump,
President Trump,
come up in this campaign?

33:22.233 --> 33:24.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNA RAU: Well, JUDY WOODRUFF:
How much has
President Trump come up in this
campaign?

33:24.202 --> 33:28.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, Gianforte has said from
the very beginning,
make no mistake about this, this
is a referendum

33:28.339 --> 33:29.307 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on Donald Trump.

33:29.340 --> 33:32.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that he was very popular
in Montana.

33:32.343 --> 33:36.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Quist tries to make it --
his campaign
tries to make it less about
Trump and more

33:36.280 --> 33:38.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the characters of the
candidates and
their politics.

33:38.549 --> 33:40.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So they try to argue, it's not a
referendum.

33:40.618 --> 33:45.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you see thousands and
thousands of dollars
coming from small donors out of
state to Quist

33:45.223 --> 33:49.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in some support for him, maybe
the last stand
or the stand they're trying to
make in Montana

33:49.961 --> 33:52.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to say, we aren't happy with the
Trump -- with
what the Trump administration is
doing.

33:52.997 --> 33:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think, to a certain
extent, you have
to argue that Trump, the Trump
administration

33:56.134 --> 34:00.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and what has been coming out has
had an impact
on the race and certainly on
fund-raising

34:00.471 --> 34:01.973 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for Quist.

34:02.006 --> 34:04.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it will be interesting to
see how much
impact it has tomorrow night.

34:04.442 --> 34:08.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Anna Rau of
Montana PBS, thank
you very much.

34:08.246 --> 34:11.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANNA RAU: Yes, thank you.

34:11.616 --> 34:22.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: big changes
at the EPA
in the Trump administration.

34:22.527 --> 34:27.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a candidate, the president
vowed to get
rid of it in -- quote -- "almost
any form."

34:27.565 --> 34:32.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The budget he unveiled yesterday
would reduce
its budget by a third, more than
any other

34:32.470 --> 34:34.272 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
federal agency.

34:34.305 --> 34:39.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is less known is a series
of recent moves
that would give industry more of
a voice when

34:39.577 --> 34:43.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it comes to shaping its approach
to scientific
recommendations.

34:43.181 --> 34:46.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the focus of our Leading
Edge segment
tonight.

34:46.984 --> 34:48.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown looks at what's
afoot.

34:48.886 --> 34:53.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It all has to do
the way the
EPA and the government evaluate
science underlying

34:53.658 --> 34:55.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
many regulations.

34:55.426 --> 34:59.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier this month, the EPA and
the Interior
Department announced they would
review and

34:59.263 --> 35:03.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
overhaul who serves on key
scientific advisory
boards.

35:03.434 --> 35:08.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The EPA move attracted
particular notice,
since its administrator, Scott
Pruitt, decided

35:08.773 --> 35:14.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not to renew the contracts for
half the members
of the so-called Board of
Scientific Counselors.

35:14.545 --> 35:19.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our scientific correspondent,
Miles O'Brien,
is here now to help fill in the
picture.

35:19.150 --> 35:23.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, Miles, the Board of
Scientific Counselors,
what is that?

35:23.621 --> 35:25.323 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What do they do?

35:25.356 --> 35:31.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Jeff, a formerly
obscure board
at the EPA made up of 18
scientists, most

35:31.496 --> 35:37.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of them academics, a few of them
from industry,
their goal is to get really deep
in the weeds

35:37.068 --> 35:43.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with EPA staff researchers and
give them some
sound advice on research
priorities and equipment

35:43.741 --> 35:47.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and techniques that allow them
to do their
work.

35:47.211 --> 35:49.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They do not get involved in
policy, however.

35:49.280 --> 35:51.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What exactly
happened last
week?

35:51.516 --> 35:56.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, nine of
them whose term
had come up, their first term
came up, were

35:57.021 --> 36:02.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
told they were not being
automatically renewed,
which has been the practice in
the past.

36:02.093 --> 36:04.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is an unusual move.

36:04.095 --> 36:09.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were told they could
reapply for their
jobs, but it is something that
has taken that

36:09.934 --> 36:12.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
board aback, for sure.

36:12.203 --> 36:17.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke with the chairperson of
the Board
of Scientific Counselors,
Deborah Swackhamer.

36:17.542 --> 36:20.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's a professor emerita at the
University
of Minnesota.

36:20.878 --> 36:22.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She was quite shocked.

36:22.713 --> 36:24.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBORAH SWACKHAMER, Chair, Board
of Scientific
Counselors: It is highly unusual
for someone

36:24.148 --> 36:25.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to not be reappointed.

36:25.850 --> 36:31.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is not a political board in
any way,
shape or form, and we don't
advocate for any

36:31.856 --> 36:34.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kind of regulation or lack of
regulation.

36:34.525 --> 36:36.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're not political.

36:36.260 --> 36:41.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So to say that we are somehow --
we would
behave differently because we
were appointed

36:41.165 --> 36:45.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
under President Obama is --
actually, it's
a little insulting.

36:45.369 --> 36:46.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We are scientists.

36:46.804 --> 36:50.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are not going to be swayed by
who's president
or who is administrator.

36:50.308 --> 36:56.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have served under three
presidents and four
administrators of EPA in my time
on various

36:56.681 --> 37:00.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
boards, and it never has
influenced how I
think about the science that I'm
reviewing.

37:00.918 --> 37:06.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So, the board
stands by its
autonomy and its objectivity,
and yet this

37:06.791 --> 37:08.693 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
happens, Jeff.

37:08.726 --> 37:10.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so what was
the reason
-- the reasoning given by the
Trump administration?

37:10.595 --> 37:16.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, a
spokesperson for the
EPA says this: "We should have
people who

37:16.467 --> 37:21.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
understand the impact of
regulations on the
regulating community."

37:21.172 --> 37:26.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The administrator of the EPA,
Scott Pruitt,
last month was in Pennsylvania
talking to

37:26.077 --> 37:31.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some coal miners, and he was
talking about
the broader issue of industry
input on EPA

37:31.882 --> 37:32.850 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
regulations.

37:32.883 --> 37:34.819 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Listen to this.

37:34.852 --> 37:36.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT PRUITT, Environmental
Protection Agency
Administrator: As we spend time
with the industry

37:36.787 --> 37:39.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
across this country recognizing
that we have
such opportunity with respect to
energy independence,

37:39.557 --> 37:43.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that just by spending time, some
on those
on the environmental left think
that we're

37:43.694 --> 37:46.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
somehow compromising outcomes
with respect
to our environment.

37:46.864 --> 37:52.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so, Miles,
a new administration,
as you say, often get to appoint
a lot of

37:52.236 --> 37:53.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their own new people.

37:53.871 --> 37:56.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What kind of responses were you
hearing about
this action?

37:56.841 --> 38:01.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, it's a
definite shift.

38:01.045 --> 38:04.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is something at work
here that's
been going on for quite some
time.

38:04.882 --> 38:10.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke to a former assistant
administrator
for the EPA during the George W.
Bush administration,

38:10.688 --> 38:11.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Holmstead.

38:11.722 --> 38:14.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's now an attorney in private
practice.

38:14.258 --> 38:19.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is his contention -- and
this is widely
held in conservative circles --
that simply

38:19.964 --> 38:24.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stating a conflict of interests
is enough
to eliminate it.

38:24.268 --> 38:26.304 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is what he has to say.

38:26.337 --> 38:28.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY HOLMSTEAD, Former EPA
Assistant Administrator:
See, I don't understand why
there's a conflict.

38:28.072 --> 38:32.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As long as they are disclosed,
the fact that
someone has done some consulting
work for

38:32.543 --> 38:37.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
industry shouldn't disqualify
them from offering
their scientific views on
things.

38:37.915 --> 38:43.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those -- anyone who's
engaged in that
debate can take those views into
account.

38:43.454 --> 38:47.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, of course,
on the other
hand, many in the science
committee fear a

38:48.025 --> 38:53.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
broader move towards greater
influence for
the industry, those who are
being regulated.

38:53.531 --> 38:55.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes.

38:55.232 --> 39:00.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The concern here, Jeff, is that
if you stack
these boards with people who are
industry

39:00.371 --> 39:05.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
researchers, who are weighing in
on subject
matters that affect the
corporations that

39:05.242 --> 39:09.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pay their salaries, that that is
going to
put the thumb on the scale or in
some way

39:09.914 --> 39:14.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
block regulation that would be
scientifically
justified.

39:14.251 --> 39:18.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a reasonable concern, and
we're kind
of in the middle of this debate
between traditional

39:18.856 --> 39:22.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
academics and industry
researchers to try
to sort this out.

39:22.960 --> 39:25.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, what is to
come?

39:25.529 --> 39:26.564 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What is next?

39:26.597 --> 39:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, this is
what's interesting.

39:28.399 --> 39:32.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are 21 separate boards of
all manner
that are advising the
Environmental Protection

39:32.803 --> 39:34.071 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Agency.

39:34.105 --> 39:37.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The granddaddy of them all is
the Scientific
Advisory Board.

39:37.541 --> 39:40.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Changing its constituency
requires a vote
of Congress.

39:40.344 --> 39:43.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so far, the House has done
just that.

39:43.114 --> 39:49.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In March, it passed legislation
which would
allow the EPA to change the
rules to allow

39:49.854 --> 39:53.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more industry input on that
Scientific Advisory
Board.

39:53.824 --> 39:58.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Couple that with the so-called
secret science
legislation which makes it very
difficult

39:58.496 --> 40:05.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for researchers on these boards
to use certain
types of data related to human
studies in

40:05.102 --> 40:09.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weighing their decisions, and
scientists are
very concerned that there are
other shoes

40:09.840 --> 40:11.108 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that are going to drop here.

40:11.142 --> 40:13.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Let's listen to Deborah
Swackhamer one more
time.

40:13.544 --> 40:19.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBORAH SWACKHAMER: It almost
feels like this
is the first of a wave of
potential actions

40:19.316 --> 40:26.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are going to further
marginalize science
advice, and, therefore,
marginalize the science

40:26.791 --> 40:32.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being done at EPA, marginalize
the science
being done in other government
agencies, and

40:32.263 --> 40:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then ultimately just there is
going to be
this very slow-motion, snowball
effect.

40:36.534 --> 40:43.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And just to add
to the optics
here, the EPA has taken down its
Web site

40:43.974 --> 40:46.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on climate change.

40:46.110 --> 40:51.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The spokesperson is telling us
they're changing
it to reflect the priorities of
the new administration

40:51.682 --> 40:53.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the new administrator, Mr.
Pruitt.

40:53.717 --> 40:58.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, Mr. Pruitt, you will
recall, when he
was the attorney general of
Oklahoma, he sued

40:58.189 --> 41:04.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the EPA more than a dozen times
and more recently,
as the newly appointed EPA
administrator,

41:04.395 --> 41:07.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said, carbon dioxide is not even
a greenhouse
gas.

41:07.698 --> 41:12.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Miles
O'Brien, thanks,
as always.

41:12.369 --> 41:17.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: You're welcome,
Jeff.

41:17.107 --> 41:25.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: how an
unsolved murder
in the nation's capital turned
into a conspiracy

41:25.816 --> 41:30.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
theory, and then became a case
study of how
false news spreads.

41:30.788 --> 41:35.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It underscores, once again, the
problem of
polarized politics and divided
sources of

41:35.726 --> 41:36.794 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
information.

41:36.827 --> 41:38.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang reports.

41:38.662 --> 41:43.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN HANNITY, Host, "Hannity":
To the extent
of my ability, I am not going to
stop trying

41:43.534 --> 41:45.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to find the truth.

41:45.302 --> 41:50.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The story of Seth
Rich's death
is a story of how fake news
spreads from Web

41:50.474 --> 41:54.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sites and online forums like
Reddit to prime-time
cable TV.

41:54.945 --> 42:00.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN HANNITY: Another massive
breaking news
story, explosive developments in
the mysterious

42:00.084 --> 42:02.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
murder of former DNC staffer
Seth Rich.

42:02.586 --> 42:09.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Early one morning
last July, 27-year-old
Rich was found fatally shot near
his Washington,

42:09.293 --> 42:11.028 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
D.C., home.

42:11.061 --> 42:14.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Politics had drawn the Omaha
native to the
city, and he was working at the
Democratic

42:14.565 --> 42:16.901 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
National Committee when he died.

42:16.934 --> 42:18.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The case is still unsolved.

42:18.969 --> 42:25.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
D.C. police theorize it was a
botched robbery,
the latest in a string of
attacks in the neighborhood.

42:25.075 --> 42:31.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Rich's family and friends
mourned, he became
the subject of a baseless
conspiracy theory.

42:31.515 --> 42:37.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The claim was that he was the
source of the
DNC e-mails about the Hillary
Clinton campaign

42:37.288 --> 42:39.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that WikiLeaks released later
that month.

42:39.890 --> 42:44.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: A private investigator says
there is
evidence to show Rich was
communicating with

42:44.428 --> 42:46.230 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WikiLeaks.

42:46.263 --> 42:50.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Last week, FOX's
Washington station
broadcast an interview with FOX
News legal

42:50.067 --> 42:52.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
commentator Rod Wheeler.

42:52.136 --> 42:58.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: Do you have sources in
the FBI saying
that there is information
that...

42:58.776 --> 42:59.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROD WHEELER, FOX News: For sure.

42:59.944 --> 43:00.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: .. that could link
Seth Rich to
WikiLeaks?

43:00.778 --> 43:01.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROD WHEELER: Absolutely.

43:01.779 --> 43:02.813 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

43:02.846 --> 43:04.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's confirmed.

43:04.782 --> 43:08.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Two days later,
Wheeler backtracked,
saying his statements were a
miscommunication,

43:08.519 --> 43:14.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but not before Trump ally Sean
Hannity devoted
a portion of his FOX show to the
story, giving

43:14.391 --> 43:18.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wheeler a much bigger platform
for his unsubstantiated
claims.

43:18.562 --> 43:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROD WHEELER: With the totality
of everything
else that I found in this case,
it's very

43:23.233 --> 43:29.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
consistent for a person with my
experience
to begin to think, well, perhaps
there were

43:29.039 --> 43:32.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some e-mail communications
between Seth and
WikiLeaks.

43:32.276 --> 43:36.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: For some conservative
commentators,
retractions and fact-checks have
appeared

43:36.880 --> 43:38.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to make little difference.

43:38.983 --> 43:43.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Supporters of President Trump
are trying to
use the story to discredit the
investigation

43:43.554 --> 43:49.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into Russian meddling in the
election and
possible collusion with the
Trump campaign.

43:49.159 --> 43:51.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Newt Gingrich on "FOX &amp; Friends"
this past
Sunday:

43:51.562 --> 43:54.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEWT GINGRICH (R), Former
Speaker of the House:
We have this very strange story
now of this

43:54.765 --> 43:59.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
young man who worked for the
Democratic National
Committee who apparently was
assassinated

43:59.069 --> 44:05.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at 4:00 in the morning, having
given WikiLeaks
something like 23,000 -- I'm
sorry -- 53,000

44:05.976 --> 44:08.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
e-mails and 17,000 attachments.

44:08.846 --> 44:10.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Nobody is investigating that.

44:10.481 --> 44:13.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: There is no evidence
for those
claims.

44:13.684 --> 44:18.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, the FOX News Web site
retracted
a story it had published on
Rich's death,

44:18.522 --> 44:24.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying, "It wasn't initially
subjected to
the high degree of editorial
scrutiny we require,

44:24.528 --> 44:26.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and has since been removed."

44:26.463 --> 44:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On his radio show yesterday,
Hannity initially
doubled down.

44:29.833 --> 44:33.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEAN HANNITY: I am not FOX.com
or FOXNews.com.

44:33.437 --> 44:35.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I retracted nothing.

44:35.739 --> 44:38.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Alexios Mantzarlis is at the
Poynter Institute,
a journalism school.

44:38.909 --> 44:41.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXIOS MANTZARLIS, Poynter
Institute: Basic
journalistic principles weren't
met.

44:41.979 --> 44:43.747 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

44:43.781 --> 44:48.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The story was run without the
source being
properly vetted and without the
D.C. police

44:48.819 --> 44:51.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or the Rich family being
consulted.

44:51.055 --> 44:56.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, Rich's parents
wrote in
The Washington Post: "The amount
of pain and

44:56.160 --> 44:59.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anguish this has caused us is
unbearable.

44:59.096 --> 45:04.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With every conspiratorial
flare-up, we are
forced to relive Seth's murder
and a small

45:04.868 --> 45:09.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
piece of us dies as more of
Seth's memory
is torn away from us."

45:09.039 --> 45:13.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXIOS MANTZARLIS: We have two
grieving parents
who would like to find out the
truth about

45:13.677 --> 45:19.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their murdered son, and what
they're getting
instead is avalanche of
conspiracy theories

45:19.616 --> 45:21.552 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and politically motivated spin.

45:21.585 --> 45:26.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: On his FOX show last
night, Hannity
said he'd had heartfelt talks
with the Rich

45:26.223 --> 45:27.958 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
family.

45:27.991 --> 45:33.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN HANNITY: Out of respect for
the family's
wishes, for now, I am not
discussing this

45:33.497 --> 45:34.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
matter at this time.

45:34.898 --> 45:37.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But then he spoke to
his fans.

45:37.134 --> 45:42.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN HANNITY: Please do not
interpret what
I'm saying tonight to mean
anything.

45:42.372 --> 45:43.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Don't read into this.

45:43.674 --> 45:49.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I promise you I am not doing --
going to stop
doing my job.

45:49.580 --> 45:53.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Analysts say it
underscores the
fragmented media world we live
in.

45:53.650 --> 46:01.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXIOS MANTZARLIS: The lesson
here is that
it is easy to find online and in
this enormous

46:02.025 --> 46:07.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wealth of information that there
is around
us all kinds of stuff, all kinds
of conspiracies,

46:07.531 --> 46:09.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all kinds of hoaxes.

46:09.399 --> 46:15.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you are predisposed to think
that something
sketchy happened with the DNC
and the leaks,

46:15.372 --> 46:20.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then you are more likely to
believe stories
that aren't necessarily true,
and as this

46:20.944 --> 46:21.912 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
one.

46:21.945 --> 46:23.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It has been roundly debunked.

46:23.781 --> 46:29.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But still a story
that shows no
signs of going away, at least in
some circles.

46:29.486 --> 46:34.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

46:34.525 --> 46:46.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The idea, how
technology, music
and science can inspire one
another, and to

46:46.870 --> 46:49.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the creation of distinct new
sounds.

46:49.907 --> 46:54.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown is back to take us
to an unusual
gathering held just a few days
ago in Durham,

46:54.745 --> 46:56.613 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
North Carolina.

46:56.647 --> 47:02.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Start with a
circuit board,
add knobs and dials, solder
everything together,

47:02.052 --> 47:08.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, eventually, if you know
what you're doing,
you have an instrument that can
do this.

47:08.859 --> 47:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Moogfest, named after inventor
Robert Moog,
is a celebration of the art,
engineering and

47:15.899 --> 47:20.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
technology of synthesizers,
machines that
create sounds electronically.

47:20.370 --> 47:27.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By night, it's a festival of
different genres
of music, centered on, as they
call them here,

47:27.711 --> 47:29.479 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
synths.

47:29.513 --> 47:39.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By day, talks, workshops, a
pop-up factory,
and plenty of hands-on
tinkering, twisting,

47:39.756 --> 47:41.525 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and tapping.

47:41.558 --> 47:45.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Creative director Emmy Parker
says the big
idea behind the festival is in
the name of

47:45.796 --> 47:47.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the instrument, to synthesize.

47:47.564 --> 47:51.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMY PARKER, Moogfest: We try to
create a
space where people have the
opportunity, even

47:51.768 --> 47:55.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
though they're surrounded by
thousands of
people here, where they have the
opportunity

47:55.239 --> 47:57.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to get lost inside their own
minds.

47:57.341 --> 48:02.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the tools that they're
engaging with,
in this case synthesizers, help
them, assist

48:02.713 --> 48:06.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them to kind of open new doors
to new creative
ideas.

48:06.516 --> 48:13.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: All these
gadgets, they may
look like fun toys to unlock
your inner geek.

48:13.323 --> 48:19.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's really part of a revolution
in sound
that's all around us, whether we
know it or

48:19.429 --> 48:20.664 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
not.

48:20.697 --> 48:24.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just one example: a sound you
have heard a
million times.

48:24.167 --> 48:29.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Suzanne Ciani used a synth to
create the famous
pop and pour sound of Coke while
working in

48:29.172 --> 48:30.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the ad industry in the '70s.

48:30.540 --> 48:33.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUZANNE CIANI, Composer: They're
electronic
bubbles.

48:33.710 --> 48:39.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're like the platonic
idea of a Coke
bottle opening.

48:39.249 --> 48:40.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's some perfection there.

48:40.484 --> 48:42.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I never heard
that.

48:42.352 --> 48:43.320 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:43.353 --> 48:44.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUZANNE CIANI: Right.

48:44.354 --> 48:48.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The platonic idea
of Coke.

48:48.091 --> 48:53.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A classically trained pianist,
in the 1960s,
she started down the road that
would make

48:53.563 --> 48:59.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her a rock star in here at
Moogfest, as a
pioneering musician and composer
of electronic

48:59.603 --> 49:00.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
music and sounds.

49:01.004 --> 49:04.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This year, she was given the
festival's innovation
award.

49:04.942 --> 49:09.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUZANNE CIANI: My job was to
just work intuitively
with the knobs and the dials.

49:09.980 --> 49:13.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it was a very friendly --
it's not scary.

49:13.650 --> 49:18.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just getting to know the
machine as if
it were a friend.

49:18.121 --> 49:20.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So you are having
a conversation
with the machine?

49:20.691 --> 49:22.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUZANNE CIANI: Yes.

49:22.492 --> 49:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's something to be said
about all music
being some translation of our
languaging,

49:29.599 --> 49:30.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our way of communicating.

49:30.767 --> 49:33.103 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's a language.

49:33.136 --> 49:34.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is a new language.

49:35.005 --> 49:40.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Ciani worked with
Don Buchla,
one of electronic music's
greatest inventors.

49:40.777 --> 49:44.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over the years, a wide variety
of musicians
have seen the potential for new
sounds and

49:44.881 --> 49:48.185 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
effects through synthesizers.

49:48.218 --> 49:55.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Moogfest featured a range of
current performers,
indie rock band Animal
Collective, dance music

49:55.759 --> 50:04.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
by 808 State, and the
experimental soundscapes
of Moor Mother.

50:04.167 --> 50:09.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also appearing, the synth band
Survive, which
created the soundtrack for the
hit Netflix

50:09.072 --> 50:22.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
drama "Stranger Things,"
futuristic sounds
matching the eerie tales of the
show.

50:22.085 --> 50:24.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Band members Michael Stein and
Kyle Dixon:

50:24.287 --> 50:28.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KYLE DIXON, Survive: One thing
about the show
that's great is that we don't
have to describe

50:28.592 --> 50:29.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what our music sounds like
anymore.

50:29.793 --> 50:31.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL STEIN, Survive: As the
band, yes.

50:31.061 --> 50:33.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KYLE DIXON: Or we only have to
use a couple
of words and...

50:33.263 --> 50:35.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Those words are?

50:35.132 --> 50:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KYLE DIXON: "Stranger Things."

50:36.566 --> 50:38.068 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

50:38.101 --> 50:39.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Stranger
Things," and everybody
kind of gets the sense of...

50:39.603 --> 50:40.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KYLE DIXON: Yes, you're like,
OK, OK.

50:40.704 --> 50:41.671 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I get it.

50:41.705 --> 50:43.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

50:43.507 --> 50:45.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the meantime, scientists and
engineers
keep coming up with new things
for musicians

50:45.876 --> 50:47.411 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to try.

50:47.444 --> 50:50.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dave Rossum designed some of the
modules,
or components, on this
synthesizer.

50:50.714 --> 50:54.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVE ROSSUM, Rossum
Electro-Music: These modules,
we call them universal control
voltage generators.

50:54.451 --> 50:59.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a very big batch of
words, but, basically,
it just means that they're
creating interesting

50:59.289 --> 51:02.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
electronic signals, so that we
can make interesting
notes.

51:02.926 --> 51:13.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: At Moogfest, you
could build
your own synthesizer, at least a
simple model.

51:13.336 --> 51:18.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Comedian Hannibal Buress, who
performed at
the festival, decided he
couldn't miss this

51:18.075 --> 51:19.176 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
class.

51:19.209 --> 51:20.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HANNIBAL BURESS, Comedian: Got
to try to do
that.

51:20.577 --> 51:24.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the most extreme thing
you could do.

51:24.181 --> 51:28.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For some of us, I
think that's
right.

51:28.118 --> 51:29.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, how's it going?

51:29.986 --> 51:33.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HANNIBAL BURESS: It was a little
tough getting
some of the components in
initially, but we

51:33.390 --> 51:36.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
figured it out, and now we're
midway through.

51:36.660 --> 51:39.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're in the soldering phase,
which is something
I have never done.

51:39.463 --> 51:40.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm not a crafty dude.

51:40.897 --> 51:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't work with my hands like
that.

51:43.166 --> 51:44.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I can't build a shelf.

51:44.668 --> 51:47.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or I haven't done anything like
it before,
so I'm enjoying the experience.

51:48.004 --> 51:53.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A view of the
future was also
on display here, including a
demonstration

51:53.910 --> 51:58.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of so-called machine learning to
create new
music.

51:58.448 --> 52:02.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Google's Adam Roberts and Jesse
Engel showed
us A.I.

52:02.052 --> 52:10.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jam session, an artificial
intelligence program
that responds to the notes you
play with something

52:10.093 --> 52:18.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of its own creation, based on
input and analysis
of tens of thousands of existing
melodies.

52:18.602 --> 52:21.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is it now composing this music?

52:21.605 --> 52:22.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADAM ROBERTS, Google: yes.

52:22.639 --> 52:23.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: yes?

52:23.640 --> 52:24.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADAM ROBERTS: Yes, and so...

52:24.908 --> 52:26.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Based on all the
information
you have fed it?

52:26.943 --> 52:31.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM ROBERTS: There still was a
human incredibly
involved in creating that
system, deciding

52:31.581 --> 52:33.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what data to train it on.

52:33.383 --> 52:36.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Another
experiment, called
NSynth, is developed through a
huge database

52:36.686 --> 52:42.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of sounds of instruments and
more, including
animals, that form a so-called
neural net.

52:42.959 --> 52:51.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It allows merging two sounds to
create a new
one, even a trombone and a dog.

52:51.568 --> 52:57.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSE ENGEL, Google: We're just
creating the
ability to explore and express
ourselves in

52:57.507 --> 52:59.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
new ways using technology.

52:59.176 --> 53:00.343 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're not just creating tools.

53:00.377 --> 53:03.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're creating ways to make new
tools as well.

53:03.580 --> 53:07.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Technology at the
service of
music and art.

53:07.484 --> 53:19.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jeffrey Brown
at Moogfest in Durham, North
Carolina.

53:19.262 --> 53:26.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Before we go
tonight, we want
take this moment to remember a
pioneer of

53:26.770 --> 53:30.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
public broadcasting and a
beloved member of
the "NewsHour" family.

53:31.007 --> 53:35.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Al Vecchione was the first
executive producer
of "The MacNeil/Lehrer Report."

53:35.912 --> 53:38.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He died today at the age of 86.

53:38.148 --> 53:44.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Al began his broadcasting career
at NBC, covering
stories around the world.

53:44.087 --> 53:50.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition to helping to launch
our original
program in 1975, Al became the
executive in

53:50.293 --> 53:57.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
charge of expanding from 30
minutes to creating
the nation's first hour-long
evening broadcast.

53:57.467 --> 54:01.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are so grateful for his
decades of work
and friendship.

54:01.238 --> 54:05.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We will miss you, Al.

54:05.108 --> 54:06.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

54:06.643 --> 54:07.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:07.811 --> 54:10.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening.

54:10.213 --> 54:20.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and we will see you soon.

54:20.257 --> 54:26.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and we will see you soon.
