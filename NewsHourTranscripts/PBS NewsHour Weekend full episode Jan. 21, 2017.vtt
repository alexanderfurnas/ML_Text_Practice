08:32.612 --> 08:33.813 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"WE HAVE TO BE TOGETHER AND

08:33.813 --> 08:34.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'LL BE UNIFIED."

08:34.948 --> 08:36.816 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE CENTRAL ARGUMENTS OF HIS

08:36.816 --> 08:38.752 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAMPAIGN-- THAT THE BIG SHOTS IN

08:38.752 --> 08:41.020 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WASHINGTON HAVE BETRAYED YOU,

08:41.020 --> 08:42.455 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE GOTTEN RICH AND POWERFUL AT

08:42.455 --> 08:44.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOUR EXPENSE, AND ALL THOSE

08:44.357 --> 08:45.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRIES OVERSEAS HAVE

08:45.558 --> 08:48.027 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROSPERED AT YOUR EXPENSE-- WAS

08:48.027 --> 08:50.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRONT AND CENTER IN THE SPEECH.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I DID NOT EXPECT THE

08:51.698 --> 08:53.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPEECH... ACTUALLY, I WAS

08:53.500 --> 08:55.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WONDERING BEFORE, WOULD HE BE AS

08:55.802 --> 08:58.204 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORCEFUL AND BLUNT AND TOUGH

08:58.204 --> 08:59.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THAT AS HE WAS IN THE

08:59.606 --> 09:00.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAMPAIGN?

09:00.140 --> 09:01.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE ANSWER WAS YES.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: WELL, FROM THAT

09:02.342 --> 09:03.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPEECH, WHAT SHOULD WE BE

09:03.109 --> 09:05.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOKING FOR IN TERMS OF POLICY?

09:05.945 --> 09:07.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IF I

09:07.447 --> 09:09.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE A REPUBLICAN LEADER IN

09:09.015 --> 09:10.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONGRESS WOULD GIVE ME A LITTLE

09:10.850 --> 09:13.853 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIT OF AGITA IS THAT WHEN HE

09:13.853 --> 09:16.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAYS THE ESTABLISHMENT HAS

09:16.089 --> 09:17.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETRAYED MIDDLE-CLASS AND

09:17.557 --> 09:18.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORKING CLASS PEOPLE, HE'S

09:18.625 --> 09:20.360 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TALKING ABOUT BOTH PARTIES.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S ANOTHER REMINDER THAT IN

09:21.528 --> 09:23.029 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EFFECT HE IS A THIRD-PARTY

09:23.029 --> 09:25.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CANDIDATE WHO HAPPENED TO GET

09:25.131 --> 09:26.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTROL OF ONE OF THE TWO MAJOR

09:26.266 --> 09:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTIES.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO ON ISSUES LIKE A BIG

09:29.369 --> 09:31.671 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM, FOR

09:31.671 --> 09:33.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSTANCE, WHICH IS NOT PART OF

09:33.072 --> 09:33.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REPUBLICAN PLAYBOOK...

09:33.873 --> 09:34.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: THEY'RE NOT GOING

09:34.641 --> 09:35.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE SO HAPPY ABOUT SPENDING

09:35.575 --> 09:36.843 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MONEY ON INFRASTRUCTURE.

09:36.843 --> 09:37.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S PART OF IT.

09:37.710 --> 09:38.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FREE TRADE HAS BEEN PART AND

09:38.778 --> 09:39.712 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARCEL OF THE REPUBLICAN

09:39.712 --> 09:43.016 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLAYBOOK FOR 60 YEARS OR MORE.

09:43.016 --> 09:45.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE IS CLEARLY NOT A FREE TRADER.

09:45.151 --> 09:47.020 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN WHEN HE SAYS, "WE'RE

09:47.020 --> 09:47.854 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO HAVE INSURANCE FOR

09:47.854 --> 09:49.589 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERYBODY" WHICH IS AT LEAST

09:49.589 --> 09:50.790 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING HE SAID IN ONE OF HIS

09:50.790 --> 09:52.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERVIEWS, WELL, HOW DOES THAT

09:52.358 --> 09:53.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SQUARE WITH THE REPUBLICAN

09:53.426 --> 09:54.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONGRESSIONAL AGENDA WHICH NO

09:54.861 --> 09:57.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATTER WHAT PLAN YOU LOOK AT,

09:57.130 --> 10:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOKS TO BE A LOT MORE COST-

10:00.700 --> 10:02.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EFFECTIVE IS ONE WAY PUT IT, OR

10:02.335 --> 10:04.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PENURIOUS, IN TERMS OF COVERAGE.

10:04.604 --> 10:05.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THERE ARE SOME SIGNALS THERE

10:05.872 --> 10:09.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM THE INAUGURAL, TO THE SHOCK

10:09.008 --> 10:10.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF SOME PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON,

10:10.109 --> 10:11.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HE APPARENTLY MEANS TO TRY

10:11.444 --> 10:12.479 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO DO WHAT HE SAID HE WAS GOING

10:12.479 --> 10:13.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO TRY TO DO.

10:13.746 --> 10:14.547 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: JEFF, LET'S TALK

10:14.547 --> 10:16.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT TODAY'S EVENTS, THE HUGE

10:16.182 --> 10:17.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTESTS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN

10:17.484 --> 10:18.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAJOR CITIES AND IN SMALLER

10:18.751 --> 10:20.620 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITIES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S THE WOMEN'S MARCH IN

10:21.855 --> 10:22.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WASHINGTON.

10:22.489 --> 10:25.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IF YOU GO TO THEIR WEB SITE,

10:23.823 --> 10:34.534 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS THEIR STATED PURPOSE:

10:34.534 --> 10:37.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GIVEN THE SIZE OF THESE MARCHES

10:37.504 --> 10:39.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE... AND HOW FAR SPREAD

10:39.506 --> 10:40.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE AROUND THE GLOBE, IT

10:40.874 --> 10:43.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEMS LIKE IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

10:43.176 --> 10:44.711 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK IT IS REALLY ALMOST A

10:44.711 --> 10:49.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRIMAL EXPRESSION OF FEAR,

10:49.516 --> 10:52.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANGER, DETERMINATION TO PUSH

10:52.886 --> 10:54.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BACK ON DONALD TRUMP.

10:54.554 --> 10:56.122 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHETHER IT'S WHAT HE'S HAD TO

10:56.122 --> 10:58.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY ABOUT WOMEN, THE ACTIONS

10:58.191 --> 10:59.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HE'S BOASTED OF, HIS

10:59.893 --> 11:01.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POSITIONS ON THINGS LIKE

11:01.194 --> 11:03.630 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABORTION AND PLANNED PARENTHOOD.

11:03.630 --> 11:05.031 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE A

11:05.031 --> 11:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MISTAKE TO LOOK AT THIS MARCH AS

11:06.266 --> 11:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A SINGULAR MARCH.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.069 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DEFINITION THAT YOU GAVE US,

11:10.069 --> 11:12.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S PRETTY BROAD.

11:12.171 --> 11:13.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT CAN MEAN EVERYTHING FROM

11:13.206 --> 11:15.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE TO PAY

11:15.408 --> 11:19.078 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EQUITY TO, YOU KNOW, ABORTION TO

11:19.078 --> 11:19.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GAY RIGHTS...

11:19.012 --> 11:20.046 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: CLIMATE.

11:20.046 --> 11:20.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YEAH.

11:20.713 --> 11:22.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK IT'S DIFFERENT FROM,

11:22.448 --> 11:24.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR INSTANCE, THE MARCHS ABOUT

11:24.017 --> 11:25.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIETNAM OR THE RIGHT-TO-LIFE

11:25.518 --> 11:26.853 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCH THAT WILL HAPPEN IN A FEW

11:26.853 --> 11:27.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEEKS.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE KNOW WHAT THOSE MARCHES ARE

11:28.321 --> 11:29.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT AND YOU CAN BE VERY

11:29.422 --> 11:30.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPECIFIC.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.658 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I JUST THINK IN THIS CASE IT'S

11:31.658 --> 11:34.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUCH MORE OF A VERY WIDE

11:34.894 --> 11:36.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COALITION OF PEOPLE WHO JUST

11:36.396 --> 11:37.830 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STILL ARE IN A STATE OF ALMOST

11:37.830 --> 11:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOCK THAT DONALD TRUMP IS THE

11:40.133 --> 11:41.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

11:41.401 --> 11:42.602 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THANKS SO MUCH.

11:43.736 --> 11:46.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

VISITED THE C.I.A. TODAY, AND HE

18:51.564 --> 18:53.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS VERY COMPLIMENTARY, BUT AS

18:53.299 --> 18:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE KNOW, THROUGH MOST OF THE

18:54.400 --> 18:55.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRANSITION, HE'S BASICALLY

18:55.267 --> 18:57.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DERIDED THE AGENCY.

18:57.003 --> 18:59.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO HOW DOES THAT RELATIONSHIP

MOVE FORWARD, AND WHAT SHOULD WE

19:00.973 --> 19:02.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE LOOKING FOR... LOOKING AT AS

19:02.875 --> 19:04.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

19:08.347 --> 19:10.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TODAY, HE'S GOING TO HAVE HIS

OWN DIRECTOR COMING IN.

19:13.419 --> 19:15.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS NOMINEE IS MIKE POMPEO, WHO

19:15.388 --> 19:16.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS A REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, DEMOCRATS ARE PUTTING UP A

19:18.391 --> 19:19.692 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LITTLE MORE OF A FIGHT THAN HAD

19:19.692 --> 19:20.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN EXPECTED A COUPLE OF DAYS

19:20.693 --> 19:21.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGO.

19:21.394 --> 19:22.962 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S NOT GUARANTEED THAT POMPEO

19:22.962 --> 19:23.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS GOING TO GO THROUGH.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT I THINK THE TRUMP TEAM'S

19:25.297 --> 19:28.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIEW IS THAT THE HEADS OF THE

19:28.134 --> 19:29.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AT THE

19:29.368 --> 19:31.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOP LEVELS WERE OBAMA

19:31.871 --> 19:34.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APPOINTEES, AND AT THE C.I.A.,

19:34.707 --> 19:36.742 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU HAVE JOHN BRENNAN, WHO HAS

19:36.742 --> 19:38.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALREADY RESIGNED, AND ALSO,

19:38.210 --> 19:39.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKEWISE, THE DIRECTOR OF

19:39.478 --> 19:40.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, JIM

19:40.880 --> 19:42.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLAPPER, HAS ALSO RESIGNED.

19:42.648 --> 19:44.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK THERE WAS, YOU KNOW,

19:44.283 --> 19:45.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT A GOOD RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

19:45.451 --> 19:46.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP AND EITHER OF THOSE MEN.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO HE'S GOING TO HAVE POMPEO

19:48.387 --> 19:50.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMING IN AT THE C.I.A., AND

19:50.456 --> 19:52.425 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBABLY FORMER REPUBLICAN

19:52.425 --> 19:54.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SENATOR DAN COATES COMING IN AS

19:54.527 --> 19:55.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL

19:55.127 --> 19:55.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTELLIGENCE, AND I THINK THE

19:55.961 --> 19:57.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOPE ON HIS TEAM IS THAT THAT

19:57.296 --> 19:58.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL BE A FRESH START.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU WON'T HAVE, YOU KNOW, KIND

20:00.966 --> 20:03.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF MISTRUSTS, YOU KNOW,

20:03.436 --> 20:05.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POISONED... A POISONED WELL THAT

20:05.504 --> 20:06.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD WITH THOSE

20:06.338 --> 20:07.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TWO GUYS WHO WERE ON THEIR WAY

20:07.139 --> 20:07.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT.

20:07.573 --> 20:08.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE LAST THING I'LL SAY

20:08.307 --> 20:09.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THAT IS I DON'T THINK THAT

20:09.875 --> 20:10.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOLVES THE PROBLEM.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMONG THE RANK AND FILE I THINK

20:12.945 --> 20:14.280 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS A LOT OF CONFUSION,

20:14.280 --> 20:15.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISTRUST, AND EVEN ANGER AT THE

20:15.748 --> 20:18.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAY TRUMP HAS TALKED ABOUT THE

20:18.084 --> 20:18.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY THE LAST

20:18.984 --> 20:19.652 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEVERAL WEEKS.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO JUST CHANGING THE LEADERSHIP

20:21.587 --> 20:22.588 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISN'T GOING TO SOLVE THE

20:22.588 --> 20:23.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBLEM.

20:23.189 --> 20:25.124 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW HE FIXES

20:25.124 --> 20:26.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT.

20:26.459 --> 20:28.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S REALLY GOING TO DEPEND ON I

20:28.427 --> 20:29.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK WHETHER HE TAKES THEIR

20:29.528 --> 20:31.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADVICE, SEEMS TO TAKE THEM

REORIENT OUR FOREIGN POLICY IN A

21:13.873 --> 21:15.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A

TOWARDS OUR GLOBAL ALLIANCES,

21:18.377 --> 21:19.645 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCLUDING THE NATO ALLIANCE, FOR

INSTANCE.

21:20.579 --> 21:21.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HAS LEFT OUR ALLIES VERY

UNSETTLED.

21:22.781 --> 21:24.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK WHEN YOU KIND OF GET

21:30.723 --> 21:31.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE SEEMS TO THINK THAT THERE'S

21:31.991 --> 21:33.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALMOST NOTHING THAT'S WORTH

21:33.392 --> 21:35.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

21:35.227 --> 21:40.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

AL QAEDA.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT HE HAS NOT REALLY SPELLED

21:47.239 --> 21:48.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT IN POLICY TERMS HOW THAT

21:48.874 --> 21:50.643 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD WORK, WHAT HE WOULD DO

21:50.643 --> 21:52.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S SO DIFFERENT FROM THE

21:52.912 --> 21:53.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE LAST THING VERY QUICKLY,

21:53.946 --> 21:55.281 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF COURSE, HE'S MADE CLEAR THAT

21:55.281 --> 21:56.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WANTS TO HAVE A NEW
