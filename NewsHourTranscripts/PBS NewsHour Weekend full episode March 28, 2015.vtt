00:23.523 --> 00:25.459
DOCTORS AND PATIENTS GETTING

00:26.560 --> 00:28.729
END-OF-LIFE DECISIONS.

00:30.530 --> 00:31.999
MATTER WHAT, AS LONG AS MEDICINE

00:31.999 --> 00:34.301
CAN DO THAT," TO "I JUST WANT TO

00:34.301 --> 00:36.036
BE HOME WITH MY FAMILY, WITH

00:36.036 --> 00:37.004
HOSPICE."

00:47.881 --> 00:50.250
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.151
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING.

00:51.151 --> 00:51.952
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:51.952 --> 00:53.220
WHILE DEFINITIVE ANSWERS REMAIN

00:53.220 --> 00:54.087
ELUSIVE, NEW INFORMATION EMERGED

00:54.087 --> 00:56.790
TODAY ABOUT THE YOUNG CO-PILOT

00:56.790 --> 00:57.424
WHO AUTHORITIES BELIEVE

00:57.424 --> 00:58.258
DELIBERATELY FLEW A GERMANWINGS

00:58.258 --> 00:59.493
AIRBUS INTO THE SIDE OF A

00:59.493 --> 01:01.295
MOUNTAIN IN THE ALPS.

01:01.295 --> 01:01.962
ALL 150 PEOPLE ON BOARD WERE

01:01.962 --> 01:02.963
KILLED.

01:02.963 --> 01:03.997
FOR THE LATEST, WE ARE JOINED BY

01:03.997 --> 01:04.698
JACK EWING OF THE NEW YORK

01:04.698 --> 01:05.632
TIMES.

01:05.632 --> 01:06.700
HE JOINS US TONIGHT VIA SKYPE

01:06.700 --> 01:08.068
FROM MONTABAUR GERMANY WHERE THE

01:08.068 --> 01:10.804
COPILOT WAS FROM.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.472
SO WHAT DO WE KNOW TODAY?

01:12.472 --> 01:13.307
>> GOOD AFTERNOON.

01:13.307 --> 01:17.144
THE LATEST, AS MY COLLEAGUE IN

01:17.144 --> 01:19.446
PARIS HAS DETERMINED, HE HAD

01:19.446 --> 01:21.982
SOUGHT TREATMENT FOR VISION

01:21.982 --> 01:23.450
PROBLEMS SOME TIME BEFORE THE

01:23.450 --> 01:23.884
CRASH.

01:23.884 --> 01:27.688
SO THAT SUGGEST THAT'S PERHAPS

01:27.688 --> 01:28.789
HIS ABILITY TO FLY WAS IN

01:28.789 --> 01:30.390
QUESTION, AND PERHAPS GIVES US

01:30.390 --> 01:31.892
SOME IDEA WHAT HIS MOTIVATION

01:31.892 --> 01:32.592
MIGHT HAVE BEEN.

01:32.592 --> 01:34.628
AND HE HAD CONCEALED THIS FROM

01:34.628 --> 01:36.163
HIS EMPLOYER.

01:36.163 --> 01:37.331
>> Sreenivasan: AND WE'VE GOT

01:37.331 --> 01:38.865
THESE REPORTS THAT PERHAPS HIS

01:38.865 --> 01:41.034
LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP ENDED

01:41.034 --> 01:43.537
JUST THE DAY BEFORE THIS CRASH?

01:43.537 --> 01:44.805
>> I'VE SEEN THAT SPECULATION.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.373
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM

01:46.373 --> 01:47.107
IT MYSELF.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.343
WE KNOW HE HAD A GIRLFRIEND.

01:49.343 --> 01:51.878
WHAT THE STATUS OF THE

01:51.878 --> 01:53.981
RELATIONSHIP WAS, WHETHER THERE

01:53.981 --> 01:55.215
WAS ANY PROBLEMS, I HAVEN'T BEEN

01:55.215 --> 01:57.184
ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT WITH

01:57.184 --> 01:58.552
CERTAINTY.

01:58.552 --> 01:59.586
>> Sreenivasan: SO THE

01:59.586 --> 02:00.454
DOCTORS' NOTES THAT HE HAD, DID

02:00.454 --> 02:02.923
THAT INCLUDE THE DAY OF THIS

02:02.923 --> 02:04.124
CRASH?

02:04.124 --> 02:05.258
I MEAN, WAS HE BASICALLY

02:05.258 --> 02:06.660
SUPPOSED TO STAY HOME OR HAD AN

02:06.660 --> 02:07.828
EXCUSE TO STAY HOME FROM THE

02:07.828 --> 02:09.796
DOCTOR FOR WHATEVER THE MEDICAL

02:09.796 --> 02:10.864
REASON WAS?

02:10.864 --> 02:11.565
>> YEAH, THAT'S MY

02:11.565 --> 02:12.566
UNDERSTANDING, AND, IN GERMANY,

02:12.566 --> 02:13.633
THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS IS,

02:13.633 --> 02:14.668
IF YOUR DOCTOR GIVES YOU ONE

02:14.668 --> 02:16.169
OF THESE CERTIFICATES, YOU'RE

02:16.169 --> 02:19.606
SUPPOSED TO STAY HOME.

02:19.606 --> 02:20.474
YOU'RE OBLIGATED TO STAY HOME

02:20.474 --> 02:22.275
AND YOU SHOULD INFORM YOUR

02:22.275 --> 02:23.543
EMPLOYER ABOUT THAT AND IT SEEMS

02:23.543 --> 02:24.678
HE DID NOT DO THAT.

02:24.678 --> 02:25.512
>> Sreenivasan: THERE WAS ALSO

02:25.512 --> 02:26.980
A REPORT TODAY THAT THE

02:26.980 --> 02:29.216
GIRLFRIEND HAD SAID HE AT SOME

02:29.216 --> 02:30.684
POINTS WOKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF

02:30.684 --> 02:32.085
THE NIGHT AND SAID, "ONE DAY

02:32.085 --> 02:33.053
I'LL DO SOMETHING.

02:33.053 --> 02:36.089
MY NAME WILL BE KNOWN FOREVER."

02:36.089 --> 02:37.591
>> THIS IS COMING FROM WHAT IS

02:37.591 --> 02:40.527
CALLED THE BILD SITE, A GERMAN

02:40.527 --> 02:41.361
TABLOID NEWSPAPER.

02:41.361 --> 02:43.230
I WOULD TAKE THAT WITH A GRAIN

02:43.230 --> 02:43.997
OF SALT.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.499
THEY DON'T SAY WHO THIS PERSON

02:45.499 --> 02:47.467
IS AND WE HAVE NO WAY OF REALLY

02:47.467 --> 02:49.002
KNOWING HOW CREDIBLE THAT

02:49.002 --> 02:49.403
ACCOUNT IS.

02:49.403 --> 02:50.704
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT'S THE

02:50.704 --> 02:51.471
STATE OF THE INVESTIGATION NOW?

02:51.471 --> 02:54.341
>> WELL, I THINK THE-- BOTH THE

02:54.341 --> 02:55.308
FRENCH AND THE GERMAN

02:55.308 --> 02:58.145
AUTHORITIES ARE GOING THROUGH

02:58.145 --> 03:00.280
MATERIAL THAT THEY'VE SEIZED

03:00.280 --> 03:01.548
FROM HIS APARTMENT IN

03:01.548 --> 03:02.416
DUSSELDORF, AND, APPARENTLY,

03:02.416 --> 03:06.053
ALSO FROM HIS PARENTS' HOUSE

03:06.053 --> 03:09.289
HERE IN MONTABAUR, AND THEY'RE

03:09.289 --> 03:11.758
TRYING TO DETERMINE WHAT HIS

03:11.758 --> 03:13.360
MOTIVATION MIGHT HAVE BEEN,

03:13.360 --> 03:14.995
WHAT-- WHEN HE KNEW ABOUT THESE

03:14.995 --> 03:16.063
CONDITIONS THAT HE HAD, AND HOW

03:16.063 --> 03:18.765
MUCH HE HAD TOLD THE GERMANWINGS

03:18.765 --> 03:21.401
AND LUFTHANSA, HIS EMPLOYERS.

03:21.401 --> 03:22.335
SO THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO

03:22.335 --> 03:24.004
DETERMINE THE WHOLE SEQUENCE OF

03:24.004 --> 03:25.405
THINGS AND FIND OUT HOW MUCH AS

03:25.405 --> 03:26.740
THEY CAN ABOUT WHY HE MIGHT HAVE

03:26.740 --> 03:27.874
DONE THIS TERRIBLE THING.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.076
>> Sreenivasan: JACK, YOU'VE

03:29.076 --> 03:30.177
BEEN LOOKING INTO THE LIFE OF

03:30.177 --> 03:30.844
THIS COPILOT.

03:30.844 --> 03:31.845
WHAT MORE YOU HAVE LEARNED?

03:31.845 --> 03:33.447
>> WELL, THE ONE THING THAT YOU

03:33.447 --> 03:34.815
GET OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHEN YOU

03:34.815 --> 03:37.284
TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT HIM IS THEY

03:37.284 --> 03:38.885
SAY HE SEEMED VERY NORMAL.

03:38.885 --> 03:39.686
HE WAS FRIENDLY.

03:39.686 --> 03:41.021
HE FIT IN PRETTY WELL.

03:41.021 --> 03:43.023
HE WASN'T A LONER.

03:43.023 --> 03:46.560
AT THE SAME TIME, HE WAS PRETTY

03:46.560 --> 03:47.627
RESERVED.

03:47.627 --> 03:48.795
HE WASN'T SOMEBODY THAT STOOD

03:48.795 --> 03:49.763
OUT.

03:49.763 --> 03:50.864
AND YOU KEEP HEARING THAT OVER

03:50.864 --> 03:52.432
AND OVER AGAIN, THAT HE WAS VERY

03:52.432 --> 03:53.066
NORMAL.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.334
THE ONE THING THAT STOOD OUT WAS

03:54.334 --> 03:55.902
THAT HE EXTREMELY PASSIONATE

03:55.902 --> 03:56.670
ABOUT FLYING.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.438
THAT WAS REALLY HIS BIG THING.

03:58.438 --> 04:01.408
AND HE STARTED WHEN HE WAS 14

04:01.408 --> 04:03.043
HERE, LEARNING HOW TO FLY A

04:03.043 --> 04:04.644
GLIDER.

04:04.644 --> 04:06.279
I TALKED TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE

04:06.279 --> 04:08.048
GLIDER CLUB TODAY AND ALL THEY

04:08.048 --> 04:09.182
REMEMBERED WAS HE WAS VERY

04:09.182 --> 04:11.985
MOTIVATED TO FLY AND THEY HAD NO

04:11.985 --> 04:13.286
INKLING THAT ANYTHING LIKE

04:13.286 --> 04:15.122
THIS WOULD EVER HAPPEN.

04:15.122 --> 04:16.256
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

04:16.256 --> 04:17.357
JACK EWING OF THE "NEW YORK

04:17.357 --> 04:18.558
TIMES" JOINING US VIA SKYPE

04:18.558 --> 04:20.160
FROM MONTABAUR, GERMANY, WHERE

04:20.160 --> 04:21.461
THE CO-PILOT WAS FROM, THANKS

04:21.461 --> 04:22.395
SO MUCH.

04:22.395 --> 04:23.296
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

04:24.231 --> 04:25.132
>> Sreenivasan: LEADERS OF 21

04:25.132 --> 04:26.500
NATIONS FROM THE ARAB LEAGUE

04:26.500 --> 04:27.767
GATHERED TODAY IN AN EGYPTIAN

04:27.767 --> 04:29.503
RESORT TOWN TO CONSIDER WHETHER

04:29.503 --> 04:31.738
TO CREATE A JOINT ARAB MILITARY

04:31.738 --> 04:34.207
FORCE TO COUNTER PRO-IRANIAN

04:34.207 --> 04:35.342
REBELS IN YEMEN.

04:35.342 --> 04:36.543
SAUDI ARABIA CONTINUED AIR

04:36.543 --> 04:37.611
STRIKES ON THE REBELS FOR A

04:37.611 --> 04:38.945
THIRD CONSECUTIVE DAY.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.580
DOZENS OF CIVILIANS REPORTEDLY

04:40.580 --> 04:41.615
HAVE BEEN KILLED.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.383
THE FIGHTING IN YEMEN IS SEEN AS

04:43.383 --> 04:45.318
A PROXY WAR BETWEEN SUNNI MUSLIM

04:45.318 --> 04:46.987
NATIONS, LIKE SAUDI ARABIA, AND

04:46.987 --> 04:49.456
SHIITE MUSLIM NATIONS LIKE IRAN.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.857
AMERICAN OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THE

04:50.857 --> 04:52.626
CONFLICT IN YEMEN UNDERMINES

04:52.626 --> 04:54.127
THEIR EFFORTS TO CONTAIN AL

QAEDA.

04:54.828 --> 04:55.996
ITS MEMBERS THERE TOOK

04:55.996 --> 04:57.397

04:59.599 --> 05:01.234
IN SOMALIA, OFFICIALS SAID TODAY

05:01.234 --> 05:02.969
THEY HAVE REGAINED FULL CONTROL

05:04.671 --> 05:06.039
OF MOGADISHU THAT HAD BEEN

05:06.039 --> 05:08.475
ATTACKED BY ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.010
AT LEAST 20 PEOPLE WERE KILLED,

05:10.010 --> 05:11.878
INCLUDING A SOMALI DIPLOMAT TO

05:11.878 --> 05:12.879

05:12.879 --> 05:14.314
THE MILITANT GROUP, AL-SHABAB,

05:14.314 --> 05:15.715
CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE

05:20.620 --> 05:22.222
SIX GUNMEN WERE AMONG THOSE

05:22.222 --> 05:22.989
KILLED.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.291
THE AL-SHABAB EXTREMISTS, WHO

05:24.291 --> 05:25.692
ARE LINKED TO AL-QAEDA, HAVE

05:25.692 --> 05:27.194
BEEN WAGING SIMILAR ATTACKS

05:27.194 --> 05:28.862
AGAINST CIVILIAN TARGETS AND THE

05:28.862 --> 05:31.698
SOMALI GOVERNMENT SINCE 2006.

05:38.138 --> 05:40.240
MISSION, THE LONGEST EVER BY AN

05:40.240 --> 05:41.374
AMERICAN ASTRONAUT.

05:41.374 --> 05:42.676
KELLY AND THE OTHERS WILL

05:42.676 --> 05:44.411
UNDERGO EXTENSIVE MEDICAL TESTS

05:44.411 --> 05:46.146
TO SEE HOW THEY REACT TO SUCH A

05:46.146 --> 05:47.013
LONG TRIP.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.281
KELLY'S TWIN BROTHER, RETIRED

05:51.251 --> 05:53.353
WHILE ON EARTH SO NASA CAN

05:53.353 --> 05:55.789
COMPARE HOW TWO IDENTICAL HUMANS

05:55.789 --> 05:57.924
RESPOND TO DIFFERENT CONDITIONS.

05:57.924 --> 05:58.992
THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF

06:05.665 --> 06:07.734
LIFESTYLE VIOLATE THE OWNER'S

06:07.734 --> 06:09.135
RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.

06:09.135 --> 06:10.303
FOR INSTANCE, A BAKERY NOT

06:10.303 --> 06:11.605
HAVING TO MAKE A CAKE FOR A

06:11.605 --> 06:12.772
SAME-SEX WEDDING.

06:12.772 --> 06:13.673
PROPONENTS SAY THE MEASURE

06:13.673 --> 06:15.342
UPHOLDS RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.

06:15.342 --> 06:16.509
OPPONENTS SAY IT FOSTERS

06:16.509 --> 06:18.178
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST

06:18.178 --> 06:19.112
HOMOSEXUALS.

06:19.112 --> 06:20.914
INDIANA PASSED A SIMILAR LAW

06:20.914 --> 06:22.048
EARLIER THIS WEEK.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.316
SEVERAL CORPORATE LEADERS HAVE

06:23.316 --> 06:24.951
CRITICIZED THE LEGISLATION, NOW

06:24.951 --> 06:27.420

VICTIMS HAD SUED FOUR AMMO

06:58.852 --> 07:00.020
A NEW STUDY SUGGESTS THAT

07:00.020 --> 07:02.489
AEROBIC EXERCISE COULD CHANGE

07:02.489 --> 07:04.724
THE BIOLOGY OF MALIGNANT TUMORS

07:04.724 --> 07:06.359
AND MAKE CHEMOTHERAPY MORE

07:06.359 --> 07:07.260
EFFECTIVE.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.528
THE IDEA IS THAT EXERCISE

07:08.528 --> 07:10.397
CREATES OXYGEN-RICH BLOOD

07:10.397 --> 07:12.032
VESSELS THAT CAN WRAP AROUND

07:12.032 --> 07:13.933
BLOOD VESSELS FEEDING THE TUMOR,

07:44.998 --> 07:47.067
TALK ABOUT DEATH, LONG BEFORE IT

07:47.067 --> 07:49.069
HAPPENS, BUT IT'S NOT AS DARK AS

07:49.069 --> 07:50.570
IT SOUNDS, ITS ALSO CREATING AN

07:50.570 --> 07:52.238
OPPORTUNITY FOR FAMILIES TO TALK

07:52.238 --> 07:53.506
ABOUT LIFE, AND HOW PEOPLE WISH

ENDORSED BY THE AMERICAN MEDICAL

A DECISION COULD COME BY THE END

PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS INTO THE

10:33.199 --> 10:35.702
PART OF POPULAR CONVERSATION.

10:35.702 --> 10:37.704
FOR MORE THAN 35 YEARS, SHE

10:37.704 --> 10:39.239
CHRONICLED AMERICAN SOCIAL

10:40.573 --> 10:42.375
COLUMNS FOR THE "BOSTON GLOBE."

10:42.375 --> 10:43.843
SHE WROTE ABOUT THE VALUES

10:43.843 --> 10:45.712
INSTILLED IN HER AS A CHILD BY

10:45.712 --> 10:47.547
HER FATHER, WHO HELPED RUN JOHN

CAMPAIGN, AND HER HOMEMAKER

10:50.683 --> 10:53.419
MOTHER, EDITH.

10:53.419 --> 10:55.154
BUT GOODMAN ONLY REALIZED THE

10:55.154 --> 10:56.823
CONSEQUENCES OF LEAVING CERTAIN

10:56.823 --> 10:58.424
THINGS UNSAID ABOUT A DOZEN

10:58.424 --> 10:59.692
YEARS AGO, WHEN HER MOTHER'S

10:59.692 --> 11:01.895
HEALTH STARTED TO FAIL.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.363

11:06.599 --> 11:08.501
KNOW?

11:08.501 --> 11:10.370
BUT, IN FACT, THE REALITY IS

11:10.370 --> 11:12.438
THAT MANY OF US WILL FACE A LONG

11:12.438 --> 11:13.506
PERIOD OF BEING FRAIL AND

11:13.506 --> 11:15.642
DECLINING.

11:15.642 --> 11:17.777
AND I WOULD SAY THAT MY MOTHER

11:17.777 --> 11:19.212
BEGAN TO DECLINE SOMEWHERE IN

11:19.212 --> 11:22.815
HER 80s, REALLY.

11:22.815 --> 11:24.384
>> Reporter: AFTER HER MOTHER

11:24.384 --> 11:25.818
MOVED TO A LONG-TERM CARE

11:25.818 --> 11:27.520
FACILITY A FEW MILES AWAY,

11:27.520 --> 11:28.988
GOODMAN FOUND HERSELF MAKING

11:28.988 --> 11:30.523
MEDICAL DECISIONS SHE HADN'T

11:30.523 --> 11:32.525
DREAMED OF, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE

11:32.525 --> 11:33.726
EDITH BEGAN TO SUFFER FROM

11:33.726 --> 11:35.929
DEMENTIA.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.196
>> MY MOTHER COULD REALLY NO

11:37.196 --> 11:38.498
LONGER DECIDE WHAT SHE WANTED

11:38.498 --> 11:40.400
FOR LUNCH, LET ALONE WHAT SHE

11:40.400 --> 11:41.401
WANTED FOR HEALTH CARE

11:41.401 --> 11:43.636
DECISIONS.

11:43.636 --> 11:45.538
SO, I WAS FACED WITH A KIND OF

11:45.538 --> 11:47.073
CASCADING NUMBER OF DECISIONS

11:47.073 --> 11:49.609
FOR WHICH I WAS UNPREPARED.

11:49.609 --> 11:51.911
IN FACT, BLINDSIDED.

11:51.911 --> 11:54.347
>> AND I REMEMBER PARTICULARLY

11:54.347 --> 11:56.182
ONE DAY WHEN I GOT A CALL ON THE

11:56.182 --> 11:59.652
PHONE AND I WAS ON DEADLINE.

11:59.652 --> 12:01.087
AND THE DOCTOR SAID TO ME, "YOUR

12:01.087 --> 12:02.522
MOTHER HAS ANOTHER BOUT OF

12:02.522 --> 12:04.424
PNEUMONIA.

DO YOU WANT HER TO HAVE

12:05.658 --> 12:07.427
ANTIBIOTICS?"

12:07.427 --> 12:08.895
AND I REMEMBER MY HANDS BEING

12:08.895 --> 12:11.230
POISED OVER THE KEYBOARD,

12:11.230 --> 12:12.799
SAYING, "WHAT IS HE ASKING ME?

12:12.799 --> 12:13.900
IS HE ASKING ME DO I WANT HER TO

12:13.900 --> 12:15.468
LIVE OR DIE?

12:15.468 --> 12:17.170
YOU KNOW, CAN I CALL YOU BACK?

12:17.170 --> 12:21.341
COULD I HAVE A MINUTE?"

12:21.341 --> 12:23.309
AND SO, IT WAS QUITE SHOCKING TO

12:23.309 --> 12:24.177
ME THAT THOSE DECISIONS FELL TO

12:24.177 --> 12:25.011
ME.

12:25.011 --> 12:25.845
I'D JUST NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT

BEFORE.

12:27.780 --> 12:28.881
>> Reporter: WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

12:28.881 --> 12:29.649
IS, YOU NEVER TALKED TO HER

12:29.649 --> 12:30.617
ABOUT THESE THINGS AHEAD OF

12:30.617 --> 12:31.184
TIME?

12:31.184 --> 12:32.218
>> WELL, WE DIDN'T TALK IN A WAY

12:32.218 --> 12:34.320
THAT WAS USEFUL.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.788
FROM TIME TO TIME, IF WE WERE

12:35.788 --> 12:37.290
TOGETHER, MY MOTHER WOULD SAY,

12:37.290 --> 12:38.591
"I NEVER WANT TO BE LIKE THAT.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.026
PULL THE PLUG."

12:40.026 --> 12:40.793
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY

12:40.793 --> 12:41.494
THAT.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.463
WELL, THERE'S GENERALLY NO PLUG

22:23.409 --> 22:24.577
"VIEWERS LIKE YOU," YOUR

22:24.577 --> 22:25.911
COMMENTS ABOUT SOME OF OUR

22:25.911 --> 22:27.046
RECENT WORK.

22:27.046 --> 22:28.047
WE HEARD FROM MANY OF YOU ABOUT

22:28.047 --> 22:29.281
LAST SUNDAY'S SIGNATURE PIECE

22:29.281 --> 22:30.449
EXPLORING WHETHER GAMBLING ON

22:30.449 --> 22:31.116
SPORTS EVENTS SHOULD BE

22:31.116 --> 22:33.152
LEGALIZED.

22:33.152 --> 22:34.253
MANY OF YOU TOLD US YOU THINK

22:34.253 --> 22:36.655
IT'S A BAD IDEA.

22:36.655 --> 22:38.090
DONNA WILLIAMS-TERRY WROTE US:

22:38.090 --> 22:39.458
"IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY ADDICTIVE

22:39.458 --> 22:41.060
FOR TOO MANY PEOPLE.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.195
MORE SO THAN REGULAR CASINO

22:43.195 --> 22:44.396
GAMBLING BECAUSE SPORTS IN

22:44.396 --> 22:45.798
ITSELF IS ADDICTIVE."

22:45.798 --> 22:47.566
DIANE ROMAN SAID:

22:47.566 --> 22:48.367
"MAKING IT LEGAL DOESN'T CURE

22:48.367 --> 22:50.836
THE DISEASE."

22:50.836 --> 22:52.404
AND LARRY SCHELLER TOLD US HE'S

22:52.404 --> 22:55.174
SEEN THE HARM GAMBLING CAUSES.

22:55.174 --> 22:56.375
"I KNOW TWO PEOPLE THAT HAVE

22:56.375 --> 22:57.843
MORTGAGED THEIR HOMES AND LOST

22:57.843 --> 22:59.078
THEM DUE TO THEIR GAMBLING

22:59.078 --> 23:01.180
ADDICTION."

23:01.180 --> 23:02.181
NORMANIUM ELDRED SAID:

23:02.181 --> 23:03.215
"GAMBLING IS BASICALLY A TAX ON

23:03.215 --> 23:05.251
THE POOR AND DESPERATE."

23:05.251 --> 23:06.852
KURT REX COOPER WORRIED THERE'D

23:06.852 --> 23:07.686
BE "TOO MUCH OPPORTUNITY FOR

23:07.686 --> 23:10.422
CORRUPTION."

23:10.422 --> 23:11.457
AND WILLIAM GIEGRICH CALLED THE

23:11.457 --> 23:12.558
IDEA "DISGUSTING.

23:12.558 --> 23:14.827
TOTALLY CORRUPTING."

23:14.827 --> 23:16.862
BUT MORE OF YOU THOUGHT STATES

23:16.862 --> 23:18.397
SHOULD TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

23:18.397 --> 23:19.932
AN ACTIVITY MANY PEOPLE ARE

23:19.932 --> 23:21.367
ENGAGED IN ANYWAY.

23:21.367 --> 23:22.635
ERIK SOMOROFF SAID:

23:22.635 --> 23:24.670
"MAKE IT LEGAL... NOT MY PLACE

23:24.670 --> 23:26.438
TO JUDGE AND I'D RATHER SEE SOME

23:26.438 --> 23:28.173
REVENUE FOR THE STATES COME

23:28.173 --> 23:28.941
IN... AND BE PROPERLY MANAGED OF

23:28.941 --> 23:30.876
COURSE."

23:30.876 --> 23:32.511
JASON MICHAEL O'ROURKE WROTE:

23:32.511 --> 23:34.980
"TAX AND REGULATE.

23:34.980 --> 23:36.615
THOSE THAT WILL GAMBLE WHAT THEY

23:36.615 --> 23:38.250
DON'T HAVE TO LOSE WILL DO IT

23:38.250 --> 23:39.118
ANYWAY.

23:39.118 --> 23:40.586
THE LAW SHOULD NEVER BE DESIGNED

23:40.586 --> 23:45.224
TO PROTECT ONE FROM ONESELF."

23:45.224 --> 23:45.991
ANDREW JONES SAID:

23:45.991 --> 23:46.759
"IT'S LEGAL IN OTHER COUNTRIES

23:46.759 --> 23:47.526
THAT SEEM TO DO OK.

23:47.526 --> 23:48.861
LIKE THE DRUG WAR DRIVING IT

23:48.861 --> 23:50.663
UNDERGROUND JUST MAKES IT HARDER

23:50.663 --> 23:52.398
TO CONTROL IN A REASONABLE

23:52.398 --> 23:53.232
MANNER."

23:53.232 --> 23:54.600
AND FINALLY THIS FROM NATHAN

23:54.600 --> 23:55.434
ENGLE:

23:55.434 --> 23:56.669
"SINCE WE APPARENTLY CAN'T EVEN

23:56.669 --> 23:57.803
INDICT THE WALL STREET GAMBLERS

23:57.803 --> 23:59.672
WHO CRASHED THE GLOBAL ECONOMY

23:59.672 --> 24:01.106
I'M NOT SURE I SEE THE POINT IN

24:01.106 --> 24:02.441
PERSECUTING SPORTS FANS FOR

24:02.441 --> 24:03.742
PUTTING THEIR MONEY WHERE THEIR

24:03.742 --> 24:05.511
MOUTHS ARE."

REFERRAL WEB SITE, SAYS IT IS

24:28.367 --> 24:29.868
DROPPING PLANS TO EXPAND ITS

24:29.868 --> 24:31.804

24:31.804 --> 24:33.772
IT JOINS YELP, salesforce.com

24:33.772 --> 24:35.074
AND OTHERS IN PROTEST OF

24:35.074 --> 24:36.208
INDIANA'S PASSAGE OF WHAT'S

24:36.208 --> 24:37.810
KNOWN AS THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM

24:37.810 --> 24:38.510
ACT.

24:38.510 --> 24:39.945
CRITICS SAY THE NEW LAW WILL

24:39.945 --> 24:41.780
PROMOTE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST

24:41.780 --> 24:42.948
GAYS.

24:42.948 --> 24:43.816
AND WHAT'S KNOWN AS "EARTH

24:43.816 --> 24:46.418

24:46.418 --> 24:47.953
