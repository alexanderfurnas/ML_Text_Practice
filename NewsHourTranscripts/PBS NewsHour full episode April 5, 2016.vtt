On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Wisconsin voters
head to the polls in a tight
primary race

00:13.113 --> 00:15.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with both front-runners
trailing.

00:15.983 --> 00:21.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead: From meal choices to
grades, schools
are collecting substantial
amounts of data

00:21.455 --> 00:24.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on their students. But are they
protecting
their privacy?

00:24.725 --> 00:30.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUZETTE LOPEZ, Mother: My son's
Social Security
was stolen. So, he was stolen,
and it took

00:30.063 --> 00:34.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
three years to clear up and
three years to
keep on telling the IRS that my
son was my

00:34.935 --> 00:36.703 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
son.

00:36.737 --> 00:42.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And Villanova wins
the NCAA men's
title in a buzzer beater, as all
eyes turn

00:42.342 --> 00:46.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to a potentially historic
women's title final.

00:46.280 --> 00:53.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:53.487 --> 00:56.223 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:56.256 --> 01:05.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's been another
big day on the
presidential calendar, and for
the candidates,

01:05.766 --> 01:08.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's another tense night of
watching returns.

01:08.902 --> 01:14.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The people of Wisconsin had
their say today
in the race for the two parties'
nominations.

01:14.207 --> 01:20.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats are awarding 96
delegates, Republicans
42. We will hear from John Yang,
reporting

01:20.147 --> 01:23.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from Milwaukee, after the news
summary.

01:23.450 --> 01:29.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The so-
called Panama
Papers leak claimed its first
major casualty.

01:29.656 --> 01:36.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Iceland's prime minister
resigned after revelations
that he sheltered huge sums
offshore during

01:36.363 --> 01:42.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an economic crisis. Thousands of
Icelanders
protested yesterday after the
news came out

01:42.035 --> 01:48.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in millions of leaked documents.
They detail
tax avoidance schemes by world
leaders and

01:48.041 --> 01:49.743 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
others.

01:49.776 --> 01:54.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Washington, President Obama
pointed to
the Panama Papers revelations as
he touted

01:54.881 --> 02:00.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new rules that target tax
inversions. That's
when U.S. companies shift
ownership of their

02:00.454 --> 02:05.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interests overseas, on paper at
least, to
take advantage of lower tax
rates.

02:05.859 --> 02:10.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the White House today, Mr.
Obama called
inversions one of the most
insidious corporate

02:10.864 --> 02:12.632 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
practices.

02:12.666 --> 02:15.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
When companies exploit loopholes
like this,

02:15.602 --> 02:19.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it makes it harder to invest in
the things
that are going to keep America's
economy going

02:19.906 --> 02:26.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strong for future generations.
It sticks the
rest of us with the tab. And it
makes hardworking

02:26.446 --> 02:29.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Americans feel like the deck is
stacked against
them.

02:29.750 --> 02:34.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The president
acknowledged the
loophole is legal, but he said
that's exactly

02:34.354 --> 02:38.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the problem, and he urged
Congress to close
it for good.

02:38.692 --> 02:43.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In South Africa, Parliament
voted down an
attempt today to impeach
President Jacob Zuma.

02:44.031 --> 02:49.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His African National Congress
and the main
opposition engaged in fierce
debate, but,

02:49.636 --> 02:58.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the end, the impeachment
motion was defeated
233 to 143. Zuma got into
trouble for using

02:58.111 --> 03:04.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
$16 million in state funds to
renovate his
home. Last week, South Africa's
top court

03:04.084 --> 03:08.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ruled he'd ignored a court order
to repay
part of the money.

03:08.722 --> 03:14.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government of Greece has
temporarily halted
deportations of migrants to
Turkey after just

03:14.127 --> 03:22.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one day. The European Union plan
hit a snag
when 4,000 potential deportees
applied for

03:22.702 --> 03:28.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
asylum. Meanwhile, migrants
protested at a
holding center on the Greek
island of Lesbos.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They and others condemned the
return.

03:30.744 --> 03:36.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I
don't want to
go back to Turkey. We prefer to
die. I don't

03:36.249 --> 03:40.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to go to Turkey. There are
problems there.
What should we do, die in
Pakistan? It's better

03:41.021 --> 03:44.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we die here, so that Greece
understands
what's going on.

03:44.091 --> 03:50.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also today, Greece
announced that
Pope Francis and Ecumenical
Patriarch Bartholomew,

03:50.397 --> 03:54.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leader of the world's orthodox
Christians,
will visit Lesbos next week.

03:54.701 --> 03:58.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, the
governor of Mississippi
signed a bill that lets
businesses refuse

03:58.972 --> 04:04.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to serve gays and lesbians on
religious grounds.
Similar bills have been vetoed
in Georgia

04:04.978 --> 04:09.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and South Dakota. And, in North
Carolina,
a new law that limits bathroom
options for

04:09.883 --> 04:16.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
transgender people prompted
PayPal today to
cancel expansion plans in the
state.

04:16.523 --> 04:20.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Wall Street had a bad day
after the head
of the International Monetary
Fund warned

04:20.927 --> 04:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the global recovery is still too
slow. The
Dow Jones industrial average
lost 133 points,

04:26.833 --> 04:36.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to close at 17603. The Nasdaq
fell nearly
48 points, and the S&amp;P 500
dropped 21.

04:36.343 --> 04:41.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what's at
stake in today's Wisconsin
primary; Republican

04:41.915 --> 04:47.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
senators break ranks to meet
with the Supreme
Court nominee; protecting
student privacy

04:47.154 --> 04:58.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the age of big data, and much
more.

04:58.865 --> 05:07.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight: Wisconsin is the center
of the political
universe, with presidential
primaries that

05:07.774 --> 05:11.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
further define this 2016 race.

05:11.511 --> 05:16.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican front-runner Donald
Trump, who
has been trailing in recent
statewide polls,

05:16.082 --> 05:20.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lashed out again today at his
closest rival,
Texas Senator Ted Cruz.

05:20.720 --> 05:23.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Well, Ted Cruz can't win.
There's no way he

05:23.690 --> 05:28.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can get the delegates. And
everybody has said
that. All of your friends and
everybody that

05:28.128 --> 05:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have watched has said that
it's impossible,
almost impossible, for Ted Cruz
to win.

05:33.433 --> 05:37.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he would have to get it at
the convention,
which I think would be highly
unlikely. So,

05:38.004 --> 05:42.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he can't win. We can win fairly
easily. If
we won Wisconsin, that would be
a big help.

05:42.609 --> 05:48.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Both Cruz and Ohio
Governor John
Kasich spent the day off the
campaign trail.

05:48.381 --> 05:52.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats face a tight race in
the Badger
State as well, with Bernie
Sanders favored

05:52.652 --> 05:58.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to win. He began his day with an
impromptu
stop at a restaurant in
Milwaukee.

05:58.124 --> 06:02.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton spent the day in
New York,
which holds its primary in two
weeks. She

06:02.529 --> 06:06.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talked about her drawn-out
battle with Sanders
on "The View."

06:06.066 --> 06:10.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
You have to look at the broader
perspective.

06:10.737 --> 06:14.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have won some. He's won some.
But I have
2.5 million more votes than he
does.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

06:16.743 --> 06:20.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: And
there is -- I
have a very significant lead in
delegates,

06:20.947 --> 06:23.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is what eventually decides
who the nominee
is.

06:23.850 --> 06:28.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Sanders is scheduled
to rally
supporters in Wyoming later
tonight.

06:28.188 --> 06:33.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on primary day in
Wisconsin, John
Yang joins us now from a
Milwaukee polling

06:33.927 --> 06:35.195 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
site.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hi, John. So, what's Election
Day look like
in Milwaukee?

06:37.564 --> 06:43.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, Gwen, it looks
a lot like
this in Milwaukee and all across
the state.

06:43.536 --> 06:46.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the municipal building
in downtown
Milwaukee.

06:46.606 --> 06:52.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State election officials all
across the state
reporting heavy turnout, long
lines, nothing

06:52.379 --> 06:58.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- no problems, they say. But
they're projecting
a turnout of 40 percent, which
would be the

06:58.118 --> 07:03.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
highest since 1980, and they
already say that
projection may be too low.

07:03.657 --> 07:10.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even before the day began, they
had a lot
of votes; 209,000 absentee and
early in-person

07:11.031 --> 07:18.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
votes, that's more than twice
the number of
the 2012. So it's big turnout
today. There's,

07:18.538 --> 07:24.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officials say, no problems with
the new voter
I.D. law. Anecdotal evidence on
social I.D.

07:24.244 --> 07:29.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suggests that only -- social
media suggests
that only a handful of people
have been turned

07:29.316 --> 07:31.084 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
away.

07:31.117 --> 07:34.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The biggest problem people are
talking about
on social media, finding parking
near their

07:34.321 --> 07:36.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
polling place, Gwen.

07:36.189 --> 07:40.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, if the voter
I.D. laws,
the voter identification laws
have not depressed

07:40.894 --> 07:43.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
turnout, what explains this
incredible turnout?

07:43.897 --> 07:48.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, you have got a
lot of interest
in the presidential race. But,
also, there

07:48.735 --> 07:54.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a hot Supreme Court race,
state Supreme
Court race statewide. That's
driving a lot

07:54.040 --> 07:55.809 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the turnout.

07:55.842 --> 08:01.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think the presidential
race is the big
draw here. But, also, in
Wisconsin, they have

08:01.648 --> 08:07.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prided themselves for many years
about voter
participation and voter turnout.
And also,

08:07.320 --> 08:14.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
since 2010, when a party
fracture kept a lot
of Democrats home and they got
Scott -- Governor

08:14.361 --> 08:20.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scott Walker was elected, the
Republicans
took over the state legislature,
the Republicans

08:20.900 --> 08:26.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
took the Senate seat as well,
since then,
you have had the recall votes of
2011, 2012.

08:26.973 --> 08:32.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that voter turnout and
voter participation
is something that's become the
norm here in

08:32.812 --> 08:34.614 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Wisconsin.

08:34.647 --> 08:37.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, you have had
those recalls,
those efforts to recall Scott
Walker along

08:37.450 --> 08:41.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the way, which also ginned up a
lot of turnout.

08:41.254 --> 08:48.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have seen, as you well
know, the latest
polls show Ted Cruz and Bernie
Sanders doing

08:48.528 --> 08:54.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
-- leading, not the
front-runners in everyplace
else, but these two leading in
this, in the

08:54.234 --> 08:59.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
final polls going into tonight.
Does that
match with what you're seeing as
well?

08:59.172 --> 09:01.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: That is.

09:01.474 --> 09:09.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what the latest -- the
last pre-election
polls were showing. And very
unscientific,

09:09.616 --> 09:12.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talking to folks, we seem to be
hearing a
lot about that.

09:12.285 --> 09:17.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, what that does, if those
things hold
up, what will that do to the
race? The way

09:17.223 --> 09:23.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the delegates are allotted here
in this race,
even if Donald Trump does lose
statewide,

09:23.897 --> 09:30.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are -- the Republican
delegates are
allocated some statewide to the
statewide

09:30.069 --> 09:33.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
winner, some winner-take-all in
congressional
districts.

09:33.640 --> 09:38.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And given his support in the
northern part
of the state, it's possible that
Donald Trump

09:38.144 --> 09:42.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could walk away tonight with a
handful of
delegates, not a lot, but when
he has that

09:42.682 --> 09:45.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
much lead, every little bit
helps.

09:45.518 --> 09:51.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Democratic side, the
delegates are
apportioned proportionally. So,
if the race

09:52.025 --> 09:57.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is as close as the pre-election
polls indicate,
even if she loses, Hillary
Clinton's going

09:57.330 --> 10:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to walk away with a good share
of the delegates
tonight.

10:00.266 --> 10:04.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And all of these
candidates have
already decamped to the next
battleground,

10:04.337 --> 10:05.972 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
haven't they?

10:06.005 --> 10:10.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, actually,
Sanders was make
some last-minute stops here this
morning,

10:10.944 --> 10:12.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump as well.

10:12.712 --> 10:18.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only candidate who is going
to be here
tonight is Ted Cruz, which gives
you perhaps

10:18.117 --> 10:21.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an indication of how he thinks
he's going
to do today.

10:21.488 --> 10:24.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: John Yang for us
tonight in Milwaukee,
thank you so much.

10:24.491 --> 10:26.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Thanks.

10:26.426 --> 10:30.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You will be able to
find continuing,
constantly updated political
coverage, including

10:30.330 --> 10:38.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tonight's Wisconsin primary
results, online.
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

10:38.104 --> 10:51.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. Supreme Court nominee
Merrick Garland
made the rounds on Capitol Hill
again today.

10:51.951 --> 10:57.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell remains
determined not to hold
confirmation hearings.

10:57.357 --> 11:01.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Some Senate Republicans,
including Judiciary
Committee Chairman Charles
Grassley, have

11:01.528 --> 11:05.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
announced a willingness to meet
the nominee,
although he and the Senate
majority leader

11:05.365 --> 11:09.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say they will not schedule
hearings or a vote.

11:09.035 --> 11:13.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Judge Garland did meet
two Republicans,
Senator John Boozman of Arkansas
and Senator

11:13.806 --> 11:15.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Susan Collins of Maine.

11:15.742 --> 11:17.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She joins us now from Capitol
Hill.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Collins, tell us about
your meeting
with the judge.

11:19.913 --> 11:25.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R), Maine:
It was an excellent
meeting. We talked for over an
hour about

11:25.385 --> 11:33.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a range of issues that included
his judicial
philosophy, Second Amendment
cases, the separation

11:33.960 --> 11:40.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of powers, the executive
overreach. We were
able to touch on a great many
issues.

11:40.266 --> 11:47.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Did you conclude
that he is qualified
for at least a hearing, if not
confirmation?

11:47.307 --> 11:53.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. SUSAN COLLINS: I certainly
believe that
he is qualified for a hearing.

11:53.913 --> 12:02.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has been a distinguished
jurist for 13
years on the D.C. Circuit Court,
and I found

12:02.255 --> 12:09.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his answers to demonstrate that
he's thought
deeply about the issues, that
he's highly

12:09.095 --> 12:15.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intelligent, and that he's a
careful, meticulous
judge.

12:15.201 --> 12:22.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Having said that, I would, of
course, not
make a final decision on his
nomination until

12:22.342 --> 12:28.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there were public hearings,
because it's that
kind of in-depth vetting that
gives you the

12:28.181 --> 12:30.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
information that you need.

12:30.116 --> 12:36.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: As you know, your
colleague Senator
Mark Kirk of Illinois last week
also met with

12:36.389 --> 12:40.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judge Garland and came away and
said that
he felt that his colleagues who
wouldn't do

12:40.693 --> 12:42.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that are closed-minded.

12:43.029 --> 12:44.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do you agree with him?

12:44.964 --> 12:49.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. SUSAN COLLINS: No, I
wouldn't say that,
although I would hope that more
and more senators

12:49.769 --> 12:56.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
would find time in their
schedules to sit
down with Judge Garland. I
believe that they

12:56.342 --> 13:02.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would benefit from hearing from
him firsthand.
And I know that I did.

13:02.949 --> 13:09.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You have said in
other interviews
that you are perplexed that
Senator McConnell,

13:09.188 --> 13:15.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Majority Leader McConnell
is drawing
such a firm line on this. Tell
me what you

13:15.428 --> 13:17.030 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mean by that.

13:17.063 --> 13:21.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. SUSAN COLLINS: Well, Gwen,
this is a
very unpredictable political
year.

13:21.634 --> 13:28.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have no idea who the next
president
is going to be. But if the next
president

13:28.708 --> 13:35.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a Democrat, it's certainly
conceivable
that she or he might choose a
nominee who

13:35.448 --> 13:38.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is far to Judge Garland's left.

13:38.851 --> 13:45.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the next president is Donald
Trump, he's
a very unpredictable person. Who
knows who

13:45.892 --> 13:54.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his nominee would be? In this
case, we have
a nominee with 19 years of
experience. And

13:54.100 --> 13:59.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I believe that we should take
the process
a step at a time.

13:59.439 --> 14:03.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And doing the meeting today was
the first
step, and I think the next step
should be

14:03.643 --> 14:05.411 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
hearings.

14:05.445 --> 14:08.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Did the White House
reach out
to you directly to ask you to
meet with him?

14:08.081 --> 14:09.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SEN. SUSAN COLLINS: Yes.

14:09.148 --> 14:10.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And what did you say
to them?

14:10.917 --> 14:14.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. SUSAN COLLINS: I said I
would be happy
to meet with them.

14:14.587 --> 14:22.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would note that that is
standard procedure
with every Supreme Court nominee
on whom I

14:22.195 --> 14:28.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have ever voted, regardless of
what administration
it was. The White House asks you
to sit down

14:28.835 --> 14:34.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the nominee. And I have
always found
that those one-on-one
conversations give me

14:34.240 --> 14:41.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a great insight into the
nominee's views,
integrity, intellect, fidelity
to the Constitution,

14:41.180 --> 14:43.149 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and respect for the rule of law.

14:43.182 --> 14:49.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In your opinion,
Senator Collins,
is the opposition to Judge
Garland rooted

14:49.956 --> 14:53.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in principle, in policy, or in
politics?

14:53.493 --> 15:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. SUSAN COLLINS: I believe
that the Senate
Republican leader, Mitch
McConnell, sincerely

15:00.399 --> 15:07.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
believes that the next president
should choose
the next justice on the Supreme
Court.

15:07.406 --> 15:14.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't happen to agree with
him. As I look
at the Constitution, the
president has the

15:14.380 --> 15:21.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right, indeed the obligation, to
appoint judicial
nominees, to nominate people for
the courts,

15:21.854 --> 15:24.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
including the highest court in
the land.

15:24.390 --> 15:31.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, after all, President Obama
is our president
right now, and will be until
January of next

15:32.031 --> 15:38.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year. So, we just have an honest
disagreement
about this issue. But I
certainly respect

15:38.905 --> 15:41.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and understand the contrary
point of view.

15:41.774 --> 15:46.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Part of what Senator
McConnell,
the point he has made is, why
drag Judge Garland

15:46.512 --> 15:51.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through what he called an
unnecessary political
routine if he's not going to be
considered

15:51.484 --> 15:53.219 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or confirmed?

15:53.252 --> 15:56.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. SUSAN COLLINS: Well, I
don't think Judge
Garland views it that way, or he
wouldn't

15:56.823 --> 16:01.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have agreed to be nominated for
this important
post.

16:01.727 --> 16:08.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he did agree to be
nominated. He is making
the rounds on Capitol Hill. And
one encouraging

16:08.768 --> 16:15.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
sign to me is before the
congressional recent
recess, there were only two of
us on the Republican

16:15.975 --> 16:21.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
side that were willing to sit
down with Judge
Garland one-on-one to meet with
him, and now

16:21.614 --> 16:25.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there are more than a dozen
Republican senators.

16:25.418 --> 16:31.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I believe that's a positive step
forward,
and it is the way the normal
process would

16:31.357 --> 16:38.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work. I would also note that it
is not unusual
for Supreme Court nominees to be
contentious.

16:38.965 --> 16:45.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There have been Democrats who
have blocked
Republican nominees, including
when President

16:45.538 --> 16:53.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Obama participated in a
filibuster to try
to block Justice Alito from
being named to

16:53.212 --> 16:54.981 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the court.

16:55.014 --> 17:00.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there have been political
shenanigans
on both sides of the aisle when
it comes to

17:00.152 --> 17:04.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Supreme Court. I think it
would be better
if we depoliticized the process.

17:04.590 --> 17:07.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Shenanigans is such
a good word.

17:07.126 --> 17:11.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Senator Susan Collins,
Republican of Maine,
thank you for joining us.

17:11.664 --> 17:20.373 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEN. SUSAN COLLINS: Thank you.

17:20.406 --> 17:24.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

17:24.977 --> 17:30.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
racial bias in
medical care; archaeologists
return to a region

17:30.650 --> 17:36.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Iraq threatened by ISIS; the
women Huskies
of the University of Connecticut
on track

17:36.722 --> 17:42.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make basketball history; and
the harsh
cycle of poverty told through
the story of

17:42.561 --> 17:44.463 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
evictions.

17:44.497 --> 17:50.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, school districts
across the country
are going high-tech,
incorporating educational

17:50.403 --> 17:53.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
apps and digital programs into
the classroom.

17:53.205 --> 17:58.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But fears about the privacy and
security of
students' personal information
are on the

17:58.077 --> 17:59.946 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rise.

17:59.979 --> 18:04.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent John
Tulenko of Education
Week reports as a part of our
Tuesday night

18:04.984 --> 18:06.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
series, Making the Grade.

18:06.719 --> 18:12.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Miami, Florida, is
taking on
one of public education's oldest
problems:

18:12.858 --> 18:19.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With so many students, how do
you personalize
instruction? One answer is with
computers.

18:19.365 --> 18:24.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At Miami's iPrep Academy,
one-size-fits-all
lessons are a thing of the past.

18:24.603 --> 18:29.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLE RASMUSON, iPrep Academy:
We all started
at the very beginning, and then
some just

18:29.342 --> 18:30.810 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
took off.

18:30.843 --> 18:34.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Nicole Rasmuson
teaches math,
using innovative software.

18:34.513 --> 18:40.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLE RASMUSON: It's about 70
percent online.
And it's a smart program, and so
it checks,

18:40.252 --> 18:47.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are they understanding, are they
answering
questions correctly right away?
Are they struggling?

18:47.360 --> 18:50.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it taking them a long time to
answer questions?
Do they keep making mistakes?

18:50.930 --> 18:55.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: All the while, the
computer
is crunching and storing data
about the students

18:55.968 --> 18:58.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and sending back customized
lessons.

18:58.471 --> 19:04.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLE RASMUSON: It'll ask them,
what are
your interests? And so, in the
word problems,

19:04.377 --> 19:09.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it'll -- if one kid's really
interested in
food, it'll talk about cookies
and that kind

19:09.348 --> 19:14.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of stuff. It'll even ask them,
what are your
friends' names? And then it'll
put their friends'

19:14.220 --> 19:16.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
names in the problems, too.

19:16.222 --> 19:22.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: All that gets
uploaded, along
with student schedules, grades,
discipline

19:22.128 --> 19:28.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
records, homework and even
e-mails, the makings
of what some have called a
digital profile,

19:28.434 --> 19:34.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that privacy expert Joel
Reidenberg fears
could someday be used in
unauthorized ways.

19:34.040 --> 19:36.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Joel REIDENBERG, Fordham
University: We're
going to have a lot of data
floating around,

19:36.275 --> 19:40.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with a lot of very detailed
information that
can be quite surprising.

19:40.746 --> 19:46.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One example: What a child eats
in the school
cafeteria is collected, using a
student I.D.

19:47.019 --> 19:51.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
card. We can envision a day, for
example,
that a health insurance company
wants to see

19:51.857 --> 19:55.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what they ate when they were
third-graders
to decide how they were going to
underwrite

19:55.594 --> 19:59.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
insurance. Is it farfetched?
Could be. We
don't know.

19:59.665 --> 20:04.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Already, students'
data has
been misused. Google was
recently sued for

20:04.670 --> 20:10.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scanning students' e-mail
accounts in order
to build advertising profiles.
The tech giant

20:10.376 --> 20:16.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has since stopped and pledged,
along with
214 other companies, not to use
student data

20:16.248 --> 20:17.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for commercial purposes.

20:17.483 --> 20:20.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there are a whole lot more
companies out
there.

20:20.119 --> 20:23.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUZETTE LOPEZ, Mother: I'm
trying to protect
my kids, and there's so much
data collection

20:23.989 --> 20:27.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's going on right now that
we we're not
even aware of.

20:27.326 --> 20:32.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Suzette Lopez is a
graphic designer
who sends her children to Miami
public schools.

20:32.364 --> 20:37.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUZETTE LOPEZ: It's these
third-party vendors
that are what we're partnering
with, that

20:37.937 --> 20:42.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're bringing them in. But
then, how much
oversight really is there with
these partners?

20:42.675 --> 20:45.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Who's keeping an eye on that
data?

20:45.344 --> 20:48.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALBERTO CARVALHO, Miami Public
Schools Superintendent:
I think that's absolutely a
legitimate concern.

20:48.647 --> 20:53.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think responsible school
systems that
have the appropriate policies
and safeguards,

20:53.119 --> 20:54.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quite frankly, reduce that
threat.

20:54.987 --> 21:00.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN TULENKO: To protect
personal data, Miami
Superintendent Alberto Carvalho
requires that

21:00.659 --> 21:06.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
teachers and students use a web
portal. All
the apps and software inside
have been vetted,

21:06.699 --> 21:11.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the companies must sign
contracts that
prohibit any unauthorized or
commercial use

21:11.270 --> 21:14.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of students' information. These
rules are
strictly enforced.

21:14.540 --> 21:18.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALBERTO CARVALHO: I can tell
you, the penalties
that we apply in Miami when
private companies

21:18.644 --> 21:24.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
default on their contractual
obligation, which
is we bar them from future
business with the

21:24.183 --> 21:25.951 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
school system.

21:25.985 --> 21:30.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: So far, the
district says, the
tech companies have stuck to the
rules. But

21:30.189 --> 21:36.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at iPrep, teachers say they go
outside the
portal to use unregulated apps
everyday. And

21:36.428 --> 21:38.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they're not the only ones.

21:38.264 --> 21:44.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would love to go around this
little group
and ask you to name some apps
that you have

21:44.036 --> 21:48.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
downloaded on your school
computer that are
not part of the portal.

21:49.008 --> 21:57.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: I have downloaded
ooVoo, Skype, Spotify,
Octagon, so just the basic
stuff.

21:57.883 --> 22:02.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: Yes, I found, like,
several very
easy reach-arounds to the school
Wi-Fi and

22:02.855 --> 22:06.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the different barriers they put
up. They're
pretty easy to go around. It's
not the most

22:06.058 --> 22:07.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
comprehensive barriers in the
world.

22:07.927 --> 22:13.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALBERTO CARVALHO: Isn't that the
definition
of true human ingenuity? And
there is no gadget,

22:13.499 --> 22:18.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no amount of technology that
stands up to
the ingenuity of a kid.

22:18.771 --> 22:24.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that's where the social and
behavior teaching
come in. That is the most
important thing

22:24.243 --> 22:29.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we can do, is actually teach
students responsible
use, liabilities, but also the
benefits of

22:29.815 --> 22:31.951 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
using this new technology in
this new environment.

22:31.984 --> 22:37.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Even if students
took those
lessons to heart, their personal
data, including

22:37.223 --> 22:42.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
names, addresses, and Social
Security numbers
can still be compromised. It
happened in the

22:42.261 --> 22:44.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
case of Pamela Rhim-Grant.

22:44.129 --> 22:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANK MADERAL, U.S. Assistant
United States
Attorney: Pamela Rhim-Grant was
a food services

22:46.999 --> 22:52.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
manager at the Horace Mann
Middle School here
in Miami, and she was found to
have been stealing

22:52.705 --> 22:56.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
student identities from the
Miami-Dade public
school computer system.

22:56.842 --> 23:03.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: In 2014, Assistant
U.S. Attorney
Frank Maderal prosecuted
Rhim-Grant for stealing

23:03.048 --> 23:09.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Social Security numbers from 400
students
and using them to file
fraudulent tax returns.

23:09.688 --> 23:14.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Exactly what did she have to do
in order to
walk away with a child's Social
Security number?

23:14.260 --> 23:17.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANK MADERAL: Login, access the
information,
print it out.

23:17.796 --> 23:22.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUZETTE LOPEZ: My son's social
security was
stolen. So, he was stolen and it
took three

23:22.668 --> 23:27.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years to clear up and three
years to keep
on telling the IRS that my son
was my son.

23:27.840 --> 23:34.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Lopez's family was
victimized
in 2008, well before the
Rhim-Grant case,

23:34.179 --> 23:35.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but the effect was the same.

23:35.981 --> 23:39.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUZETTE LOPEZ: I went to go file
my taxes,
and I couldn't. I'm extremely
protective and

23:39.218 --> 23:45.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm very careful about stuff,
and for his
number, which is not readily
used, was shocking.

23:45.157 --> 23:50.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Miami school
officials say hackers
on the outside have never
successfully broken

23:50.229 --> 23:56.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in and stolen student data. But
the growing
amount of sensitive information
stored electronically

23:56.368 --> 24:01.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has driven lawmakers in at least
15 states
to restrict what companies can
collect and

24:01.907 --> 24:04.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
mandate steps to protect it.

24:04.276 --> 24:08.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That heightened security could
put a damper
on digital tools that
personalize learning.

24:08.647 --> 24:18.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Miami, Florida, I'm John
Tulenko of Education
Week reporting for the "PBS
NewsHour."

24:18.457 --> 24:31.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A new study finds
African-American
patients are often treated
differently when

24:31.203 --> 24:37.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it comes to medicine and care.
The survey
of more than 500 people, 400 of
them medical

24:37.776 --> 24:42.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
students, found implicit bias
exists that
may help explain why black
people are sometimes

24:42.614 --> 24:44.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
undertreated for pain.

24:44.783 --> 24:49.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among its findings: Medical
students believed
that African-Americans felt less
pain than

24:49.088 --> 24:52.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
white patients, and even thought
their skin
was thicker.

24:52.458 --> 24:57.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on this perplexing
discovery, we
turn to Dr. David Satin of the
University

24:57.129 --> 25:01.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Minnesota Medical Center, and
Dorothy Roberts
of the university of
Pennsylvania.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you both for joining us.

25:03.736 --> 25:08.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dr. Satin, try to describe this
disparity
for me. Why does this exist? And
is it new?

25:08.474 --> 25:10.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. DAVID SATIN, University of
Minnesota Medical
Center: So, Gwen, we have known
that this

25:10.843 --> 25:15.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has been an issue for at least a
couple decades.

25:15.581 --> 25:21.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And every now and then, a study
comes out
that underscores the need for
the field of

25:21.286 --> 25:25.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
medicine, and in particular
medical education,
to do some work and get it
right.

25:25.991 --> 25:31.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is a problem, and it's
been a problem,
and hopefully this study will
spur on more

25:31.163 --> 25:32.798 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
activity.

25:32.831 --> 25:35.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Dorothy Roberts, is
this a medical
problem or a sociological
problem?

25:35.501 --> 25:37.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOROTHY ROBERTS, University of
Pennsylvania:
It's both.

25:37.302 --> 25:41.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what's really important
and fascinating
about the study is that it, for
the first

25:41.540 --> 25:48.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time, links what we have long
known as undertreatment
of pain for black patients with
doctors, or

25:48.814 --> 25:55.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at least medical students' false
beliefs about
biological differences based on
race.

25:55.187 --> 26:00.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those beliefs, as the study
has shown,
are widely held by laypeople as
well. They're

26:00.592 --> 26:08.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deeply embedded, longstanding
myths about
racial difference, especially
biological differences

26:08.767 --> 26:15.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between races, which goes back
to the very
concept that race is a
biological difference

26:15.941 --> 26:20.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is widespread in U.S.
society. So it's
sociological, as well as
medical.

26:20.679 --> 26:24.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Dr. Satin, I have to
say the thing
that surprised me the most was
that medical

26:24.750 --> 26:27.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
students would think this way,
as well as
laypeople.

26:27.786 --> 26:32.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, are they being taught this?
Is this something
they just bring with them?

26:32.591 --> 26:35.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. DAVID SATIN: Unfortunately,
it's both.

26:35.794 --> 26:40.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, medical students, doctors
are people,
too. We live in society, and
we're exposed

26:40.232 --> 26:47.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the same decade-after-decade
experiences
that determine our beliefs.
However, one of

26:47.306 --> 26:51.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the things one of the medical
student pointed
out to me this morning is that
some of these

26:51.143 --> 26:56.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
false beliefs seem to peak in
second year
-- the second year of medical
school, as students

26:56.148 --> 27:02.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prepare for the boards and have
been memorizing
these associations to answer on
the board

27:02.788 --> 27:04.623 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
exams.

27:04.656 --> 27:09.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: This is a taught
behavior or action.
This is a conscious stereotype,
as well as

27:09.428 --> 27:10.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a subconscious one.

27:10.963 --> 27:12.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOROTHY ROBERTS: Absolutely.

27:12.698 --> 27:18.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's deeply rooted and
fundamental to the
way medical education works in
the United

27:18.136 --> 27:24.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States. Students are taught to
notice the
race of their patients, to treat
their patients

27:25.010 --> 27:31.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
differently because of race, and
they're taught
that that's because of
fundamental biological

27:31.817 --> 27:33.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
differences between people of
different races.

27:33.952 --> 27:41.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, while this is in part based
on myths and
stereotypes that are widely held
in U.S. society,

27:41.960 --> 27:49.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's also based on the way
students are taught
to treat patients in medical
schools. It requires

27:49.701 --> 27:57.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a radical change in medical
education to address
this, not only addressing
implicit bias, but

27:57.676 --> 28:04.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also changing the way in which
human beings
are treated and differences are
considered

28:04.917 --> 28:06.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in medical education.

28:06.885 --> 28:13.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: David Satin, there
are actually,
to be fair, race, not specific,
exactly, conditions,

28:13.926 --> 28:18.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but medicines and conditions
which are more
likely to affect one race or the
other.

28:18.530 --> 28:23.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. DAVID SATIN: Those are
controversial.
We know that race is actually a
socially constructed

28:23.502 --> 28:29.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concept. It's not biological,
nor is it genetic,
as we learned from the Human
Genome Project.

28:29.808 --> 28:34.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so while there are some
associations,
those are largely due to social
effects, how

28:34.813 --> 28:40.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're raised. Often, ethnicity
plays a factor.
But they are not biological
effects.

28:40.419 --> 28:42.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But environmental
effects, perhaps?

28:42.621 --> 28:47.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOROTHY ROBERTS: Well, I think
that's really
important for medical students
to understand

28:47.459 --> 28:53.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and for their teachers to teach
them is the
difference between health
outcomes, disparate

28:53.332 --> 28:59.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health outcomes, and the idea
that they're
caused by innate biological
difference, which

28:59.805 --> 29:08.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is false, vs. how racism does
affect health
based on social inequality, not
because of

29:08.981 --> 29:13.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
innate biological or genetic
differences between
the races.

29:13.185 --> 29:19.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this study points out how
dangerous it
is to continue to teach medical
students that

29:19.091 --> 29:25.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
race is a biological category
that produces
these differences in health or
experience

29:25.530 --> 29:30.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of pain based on biological
differences between
the races.

29:30.302 --> 29:33.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, let me ask you
both, this
wasn't a huge study.

29:33.438 --> 29:38.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is 400, 500 people, but
what is your
thinking -- I will start with
you, David Satin

29:38.243 --> 29:42.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- on what the consequences are
of these beliefs
and what should be done about
it?

29:42.414 --> 29:47.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DR. DAVID SATIN: So, the
consequences of the
beliefs, we saw in the study, is
part of what

29:47.419 --> 29:51.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
results in unequal treatment.
It's part of
what results in health
disparities.

29:51.556 --> 29:57.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's certainly enough blame
to go around
for how those result, but it's a
component.

29:57.696 --> 30:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what it teaches us is that
we need to
be proactive. I teach the
medical students,

30:02.134 --> 30:07.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look, it's not your -- it's not
your fault
that you have these implicit
biases. You grew

30:07.739 --> 30:09.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up in society. We all have
these.

30:09.741 --> 30:14.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now that you know, it's your
responsibility.
And we have some interventions
to try to reverse

30:14.312 --> 30:16.248 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

30:16.281 --> 30:21.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOROTHY ROBERTS: But it also
requires a fundamental
change in the way in which
medical education

30:21.253 --> 30:28.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
works, moving away from teaching
students
that the races are different
because of some

30:28.093 --> 30:35.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of innate biological
difference that
then causes health disparities,
and instead

30:35.500 --> 30:42.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
showing how racism and other
structural inequities
cause health disparities, and
explore with

30:42.908 --> 30:46.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
students how medical practice
can address
those.

30:46.211 --> 30:50.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Dorothy Roberts of
the University
of Pennsylvania, and Dr. David
Satin of the

30:50.849 --> 30:52.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
University of Minnesota Medical
Center, thank
you very much.

30:52.884 --> 30:53.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOROTHY ROBERTS: Thanks, Gwen.

30:53.919 --> 31:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. DAVID SATIN: Thank you for
having me.

31:08.567 --> 31:13.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: When ISIS captured
the ancient
city of Palmyra in Syria last
year, they destroyed

31:13.805 --> 31:17.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and looted priceless pieces of
Middle Eastern
history.

31:17.676 --> 31:22.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The city was retaken last week
by Syria's
army, and as the extremists lose
more ground

31:22.514 --> 31:28.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Iraq, archaeologists are
returning to endangered
sites to resecure the past.

31:28.787 --> 31:32.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Jane
Ferguson reports
from Northern Iraq.

31:32.657 --> 31:39.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Badly damaged,
but still standing.
Surveying the harm done to
Palmyra, a drone

31:39.998 --> 31:43.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
flies above the ancient Roman
city.

31:43.335 --> 31:49.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Below, land mines and booby
traps slow the
work of Syrian experts, anxious
to walk amongst

31:50.008 --> 31:56.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these precious ruins again. When
ISIS stormed
into Palmyra nearly a year ago,
many feared

31:56.214 --> 32:03.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the UNESCO World Heritage Site
was lost forever.
The group used it for grisly
execution videos

32:03.255 --> 32:05.857 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and blew up two of its temples.

32:05.891 --> 32:11.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But much it is still intact, to
the relief
of Syria's antiquities chief,
Maamoun Abdulkarim.

32:11.696 --> 32:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maamoun Abdulkarim, Syrian
Antiquities Chief
(through translator): We
expected the worst

32:15.267 --> 32:19.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because of the liberation
fighting, but I
think the nightmare is over. The
panoramic

32:19.404 --> 32:21.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
picture of Palmyra is fine.

32:21.473 --> 32:27.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: When they took
the town, Islamic
State fighters also executed
archaeologist

32:27.412 --> 32:33.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Khaled Asaad, one of the
country's top historical
scholars, who had dedicated most
of his life

32:33.451 --> 32:35.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to preserving Palmyra.

32:35.821 --> 32:40.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The presence of ISIS and other
warring groups
across the Middle East and North
Africa has

32:40.425 --> 32:46.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
seen international
archaeologists abandon
beloved historical sites, from
Libya to Syria

32:46.731 --> 32:50.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Iraq, fearful for their
security.

32:50.735 --> 32:56.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, with ISIS losing some
territory, there
is hope they may return to a
region that had

32:56.942 --> 33:03.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
become so risky. In Northern
Iraq, a team
from Cambridge University is
back to work,

33:03.248 --> 33:07.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
searching for signs of
Neanderthal life in
Shanidar Cave.

33:07.552 --> 33:13.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISIS never took over this area,
but came deep
enough into Northern Iraq to
cause them to

33:13.558 --> 33:16.228 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
delay their dig.

33:16.261 --> 33:20.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Professor Graeme Barker says the
fighting
across the region has upended
much work in

33:20.565 --> 33:22.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the field.

33:22.434 --> 33:24.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRAEME BARKER, University of
Cambridge: It
has affected a lot of teams
because they can't

33:24.903 --> 33:31.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get back to places. And I have
worked before
in Libya, and in an area where
now it's impossible

33:31.409 --> 33:38.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to go to. So it's had a huge
impact in terms
of access by foreign teams.

33:38.049 --> 33:42.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: He and his team
were not surprised
to hear that ISIS was destroying
historical

33:42.621 --> 33:45.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
artifacts on their rampage
across the region.

33:45.257 --> 33:48.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRAEME BARKER: Invading armies
have always,
liked, anything to do with
heritage, because

33:48.927 --> 33:53.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heritage is who we are. We very
much -- we
may not think about it
explicitly, but we

33:53.865 --> 33:56.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are very much rooted in our
past.

33:56.034 --> 34:03.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And archaeology is a highly
political subject,
which therefore comes back to
why it's really

34:03.642 --> 34:06.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
important that these kind of
projects continue.

34:06.578 --> 34:12.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: This dig was
originally meant
to take place in 2014. But it
had to be delayed

34:12.417 --> 34:18.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because ISIS came in and took
over Mosul city,
which is about 150 miles away
from here. That

34:18.657 --> 34:23.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
year, say these archaeologists,
was a write-off
for that sort of work here.

34:23.194 --> 34:27.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But since then, they have come
back twice,
saying that the security is
sufficient for

34:27.732 --> 34:33.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them to continue their work. But
for archaeologists
across the Middle East, security
is now a

34:33.271 --> 34:41.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
major concern, with the rise of
ISIS and other
armed groups targeting
historical sites.

34:41.112 --> 34:46.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mosul was taken over by the
Islamic State
in 2014. The city and its
surrounding areas

34:46.318 --> 34:52.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are rich in antiquities and
historical sites.
In nearby Irbil, ancient pieces
from Mosul

34:52.357 --> 34:56.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rest in the museum, beyond the
reach of the
Islamic State.

34:56.227 --> 35:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dr. Abdullah Khorsheed, who
leads the Iraqi
Institute for the Conservation
of Antiquities

35:01.366 --> 35:06.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Heritage, is all too aware
of the damage
that has already been done.

35:06.171 --> 35:08.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. ABDULLAH KHORSHEED, Iraqi
Institute for
the Conservation of Antiquities
and Heritage

35:08.940 --> 35:12.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
(through translator): We have
very strong
evidence of the damage because
we are still

35:12.477 --> 35:16.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in communication with the
officials who have
been working there in Mosul and
because of

35:17.015 --> 35:19.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the images and the videos being
published
throughout social media.

35:19.951 --> 35:25.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are sure that most of these
archaeological
sites have been destroyed by
ISIS. On a daily

35:25.890 --> 35:29.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
basis, we hear that ISIS is
trying to destroy
many such areas.

35:29.694 --> 35:34.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JANE FERGUSON: For
archaeologists like him,
they have mixed feelings about
an imminent

35:35.000 --> 35:41.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
military campaign to retake
Mosul. Getting
ISIS out of its historical sites
may mean

35:41.072 --> 35:42.807 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
damaging them in the process.

35:42.841 --> 35:47.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. ABDULLAH KHORSHEED (through
translator):
When we talk about a war, it
means entire

35:47.879 --> 35:53.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cities will be devastated and
destroyed. This
is what wars usually bring. And,
certainly,

35:53.651 --> 35:59.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when we try to push ISIS from
Mosul and use
aerial attacks, those sites will
be damaged

35:59.257 --> 36:01.026 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
again.

36:01.059 --> 36:06.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: One ancient gem
the Islamic
State did not manage to capture
sits in the

36:06.131 --> 36:12.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
heart of Northern Iraq's
Kurdistan. It remains
one of the very few postcard
images of the

36:12.037 --> 36:13.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Middle East still open to
historians.

36:13.838 --> 36:22.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Citadel in Irbil is the only
UNESCO World
Heritage Site in all of Syria
and Iraq not

36:22.280 --> 36:29.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the danger list, and yet,
when ISIS pushed
into Iraq in 2014, they came
within 30 miles

36:29.421 --> 36:36.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of it, threatening one of the
very last cultural
treasures in the country.

36:36.061 --> 36:39.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Archaeologists from around the
world have
flocked to the Middle East for
centuries to

36:39.330 --> 36:46.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
study and preserve evidence of
humanity's
past. Now, after watching so
much destruction,

36:46.871 --> 36:50.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they will be needed to help
piece it back
together again.

36:50.508 --> 36:57.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Jane
Ferguson
in Northern Iraq.

36:57.715 --> 37:11.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now to an instant
sports classic,
and college basketball history,
possibly on

37:11.863 --> 37:13.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
two straight nights.

37:13.665 --> 37:18.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
William Brangham is here with
the latest on
the NCAA championships, starting
with last

37:18.336 --> 37:20.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
night's amazing men's title
game.

37:20.839 --> 37:24.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This had been
a close game
throughout the night. The North
Carolina Tar

37:24.742 --> 37:29.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Heels, in white, were trailing
Villanova by
just three points with just
seconds left when

37:29.180 --> 37:30.982 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the ball ends up in Marcus
Paige's hands.

37:31.015 --> 37:32.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNOUNCER: They're going to have
to do something
from the outside now. It's Paige
off-balance.

37:32.717 --> 37:47.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Impossible! How did he do that?
Ties the game
with 4.7 seconds to go.

37:47.298 --> 37:50.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: With just a
little more
than four seconds to go,
everyone thought

37:50.068 --> 37:52.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it was headed for overtime, but
then this:

37:52.036 --> 37:53.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNOUNCER: Three seconds at
midcourt. Gives
it to Jenkins for the
championship.

37:53.138 --> 37:54.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

37:54.939 --> 38:03.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANNOUNCER: Villanova,
phenomenal, the national
champions, with Jenkins hitting
the winner

38:03.348 --> 38:07.118 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at the buzzer!

38:07.152 --> 38:12.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It was the
first time a
team hit a three-pointer at the
buzzer to

38:12.657 --> 38:15.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
win the men's title. And more
history could
be made tonight.

38:16.027 --> 38:20.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The University of Connecticut
women's team
is going for its 11th title, and
its fourth

38:20.431 --> 38:22.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in a row when they play
Syracuse.

38:22.167 --> 38:25.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To help us catch our breath and
appreciate
all of this, we turn to
sportswriters John

38:25.937 --> 38:30.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Feinstein of The Washington Post
and numerous
books. He joins us from Augusta,
Georgia,

38:30.275 --> 38:35.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where he's covering The Masters
for The Golf
Channel. And Mechelle Voepel of
ESPNW.

38:35.046 --> 38:38.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, John Feinstein, I would like
to start
with you.

38:38.316 --> 38:44.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, it's tough to beat a
game like
that for excitement and
adrenaline. Is that

38:44.122 --> 38:45.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the best NCAA Final you have
ever seen?

38:45.957 --> 38:50.295 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
JOHN FEINSTEIN,
Sportswriter/Author: I have
seen 38 of them, William, and
none like that

38:50.328 --> 38:54.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one, because no one did anything
wrong in
that climactic final minute.

38:54.866 --> 38:59.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Villanova made all four of their
three-throws.
Carolina made an extraordinary
three-pointer

38:59.370 --> 39:04.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by Marcus Paige to tie the game
and climax
their 10-point comeback. And
then Villanova,

39:04.509 --> 39:09.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at a moment when you would have
thought they
might panic, not only got a
winning shot off,

39:09.113 --> 39:14.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but their point guard, Ryan
Arcidiacono, had
the wherewith to realize he had
time, even

39:14.686 --> 39:19.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with under two seconds on the
clock, to pass
the ball to his best shooter,
Kris Jenkins,

39:19.324 --> 39:21.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who nails the three-pointer at
the buzzer.

39:21.392 --> 39:25.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Have never seen anything quite
like it. I'm
not sure we will ever see
anything quite like

39:25.163 --> 39:26.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it again. It was extraordinary.

39:26.598 --> 39:29.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, this goes
down as instant
classic in your mind?

39:29.200 --> 39:33.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINSTEIN: Oh, at the very
least. Instant
classic might be an
understatement.

39:33.304 --> 39:37.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I tend to people overstate
things, because
we all think the last thing we
saw was the

39:37.775 --> 39:43.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
best thing we saw. But this one
was extraordinary.
These were clearly the two best
teams. They

39:43.781 --> 39:47.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had rolled over all their
opponents to get
to the final, including Saturday
night in

39:47.285 --> 39:53.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the semis, when Villanova beat
Oklahoma by
44 and North Carolina beat
Syracuse by 17.

39:53.091 --> 39:58.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And neither could dominate the
other. It ended
the way it should, with one team
making a

39:58.363 --> 40:02.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shot at the buzzer after another
team had
made a remarkable play just to
tie the game.

40:02.600 --> 40:07.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I'm curious.
When you saw
Marcus Paige hit that incredible
three-pointer,

40:07.105 --> 40:08.906 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
did you think that was going to
overtime?

40:08.940 --> 40:13.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN FEINSTEIN: I did. I
honestly did. And
the reason I thought it was
because Villanova

40:13.811 --> 40:18.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had to be deflated at that
moment. They'd
lost a 10-point lead. They
hadn't done anything

40:18.416 --> 40:22.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wrong, and yet the game was
tied. They defended
very well on that play where
Paige hit that

40:22.854 --> 40:24.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shot that you're referring to.

40:24.889 --> 40:30.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's to Jay Wright's credit
and the credit
of a very experienced team that,
in that huddle,

40:30.361 --> 40:34.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they were able to get their act
together and
run a play. It's called Nova
that they run

40:34.732 --> 40:39.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in practice every day at the end
of practice,
and they acted as if they were
in an empty

40:39.237 --> 40:44.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gym, rather than in a football
stadium with
75,000 people there and millions
watching

40:44.075 --> 40:46.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on TV. Incredible calm under
pressure.

40:46.811 --> 40:50.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Mechelle Voepel,
let's turn to tonight.

40:50.581 --> 40:54.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, incredible game last
night, and
another potential piece of
history happening

40:54.919 --> 40:58.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tonight. Of course, no one
thinks that tonight's
game is going to go down to the
buzzer. I

40:58.089 --> 41:03.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mean, we have got University of
Connecticut
just on an unbelievable roll,
such a long

41:03.661 --> 41:07.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
winning streak. They're hoping
to really rack
up an incredible number of
titles if they

41:07.298 --> 41:08.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
win tonight.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
How do you explain their
dominance in the
women's game?

41:10.868 --> 41:15.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MECHELLE VOEPEL, ESPNW: They
have got an incredible
coach in Geno Auriemma, somebody
who has really

41:15.039 --> 41:18.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been ahead of the game for so
many years now.

41:18.209 --> 41:22.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's got great continuity in
staff. His
top assistant, Chris Dailey, has
been with

41:22.547 --> 41:26.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him ever since they have been --
when they
took over the program at
Connecticut back

41:26.951 --> 41:28.619 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 1985.

41:28.653 --> 41:32.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are able to get not all
the best
players in the country, but the
best players

41:32.457 --> 41:36.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they want, and players who
want to be
coached, players who are good
when they come

41:37.028 --> 41:40.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there, but know that they can be
great when
they leave. And that's been a
big recipe for

41:40.398 --> 41:42.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
success for them.

41:42.233 --> 41:45.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Everyone does
talk about,
just as you did, the influence
of their coach.

41:45.837 --> 41:47.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is he doing? What's the
special sauce
there?

41:47.939 --> 41:52.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MECHELLE VOEPEL: Well,
obviously, he is a
great X's and O's basketball
genius. There's

41:52.276 --> 41:54.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
no doubt in my mind about that.

41:54.078 --> 41:58.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And if you talk to the
professional players
who went to UConn or even the
professional

41:58.416 --> 42:02.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
players who played for him on
the U.S. national
team -- he will be coaching in
the Olympics

42:02.720 --> 42:07.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the second time later this
year -- they
talk about how he really was
ahead of the

42:07.525 --> 42:13.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
game even 10, 20 years ago in
understanding
how to teach read-and-react
offense, how to

42:13.731 --> 42:18.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get his players to play at a
pace that put
other teams on their heels from
the very beginning

42:18.870 --> 42:20.605 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the game.

42:20.638 --> 42:25.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He really is a basketball
genius. And what
he's done with the media has
been incredible,

42:25.309 --> 42:30.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
too. He's given an enormous
amount of time
to the media, and he's a funny
guy. Sometimes,

42:30.848 --> 42:36.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's a very outspoken guy,
sometimes a controversial
guy, but he's been a terrific
spokesman for

42:36.521 --> 42:39.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
women's sports and women's
basketball specifically.

42:39.123 --> 42:42.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: University of
Connecticut's
dominance, has it been a good
thing for women's

42:43.027 --> 42:46.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
basketball or a bad thing? I
mean, I have
heard it argued both ways. What
is your take

42:46.397 --> 42:47.598 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on that?

42:47.632 --> 42:51.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MECHELLE VOEPEL: I never see how
excellence
is a bad thing.

42:51.068 --> 42:56.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the comparison that a lot of
us have made
for years is what UCLA did and
John Wooden

42:56.474 --> 43:02.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did for men's basketball, at one
point winning
seven titles in a row. UConn
women tonight

43:02.947 --> 43:05.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are going to be going for four
titles in a
row.

43:05.483 --> 43:09.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have raised the bar. And I
think in every
single sport, you have had
individuals or

43:09.420 --> 43:14.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
teams that have raised the bar
that everybody
else has to try on match to beat
them. And

43:14.859 --> 43:18.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I understand that some people
look at some
of their games and say it's
boring because

43:18.629 --> 43:20.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they beat the other team by so
much.

43:20.865 --> 43:25.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when you watch -- actually
watch them
play, what isn't boring is just
how well they

43:25.636 --> 43:29.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
play basketball, and I think
then that's something
for everybody who is trying to
chase them

43:29.407 --> 43:30.675 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to aspire to.

43:30.708 --> 43:32.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: John
Feinstein, what do
you make of that?

43:32.543 --> 43:36.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINSTEIN: Well, I think
dynasties are
good for any sport, because they
bring people

43:36.581 --> 43:40.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to that sport who might not
normally be paying
attention.

43:40.151 --> 43:44.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can't not notice what the
UConn women
have attained. You couldn't not
notice what

43:44.489 --> 43:50.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tiger Woods did in golf when he
was dominating
the sport. You can't not notice
what UCLA,

43:50.628 --> 43:54.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as Mechelle said, back when they
won 10 titles
in 12 years.

43:54.265 --> 43:59.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's good for sports
when you have
a dynasty, because it does raise
the level

43:59.804 --> 44:04.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of interest in the sport. The
other thing
that UConn has going for it is,
unlike in

44:04.242 --> 44:08.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the men's game, the women stay
for four years.
So, you're more likely -- you
have a better

44:08.846 --> 44:13.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
possibility to have a dynasty,
because the
stars stay. They don't turn pro
after a year

44:13.818 --> 44:15.152 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or two.

44:15.186 --> 44:16.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
well, we will
be watching tonight.

44:16.687 --> 44:19.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Feinstein, Mechelle Voepel,
thank you
both very much for being here.

44:19.390 --> 44:21.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINSTEIN: My pleasure.

44:21.993 --> 44:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MECHELLE VOEPEL: Thank you.

44:28.299 --> 44:36.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now a look at the
cascading effect
of poverty on housing in
America.

44:36.107 --> 44:40.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has that in this
latest addition
to the "NewsHour" Bookshelf.

44:40.211 --> 44:44.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Every year in
this country,
families are evicted from their
homes, not

44:44.248 --> 44:48.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the tens of thousands or by
the hundreds
of thousands, but by the
millions, that from

44:48.920 --> 44:53.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a new book that explores a huge,
but little
discussed phenomenon in America
today.

44:53.858 --> 44:58.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Evicted: Poverty and Profit in
the American
City" follows the lives of eight
Milwaukee

44:58.963 --> 45:04.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
families, black and white.
Author Matthew
Desmond lived among them in 2008
to 2009.

45:04.802 --> 45:09.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a sociologist, a professor
at Harvard
and a winner of a MacArthur
Fellowship last

45:09.840 --> 45:10.341 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

45:10.374 --> 45:12.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome to you.

45:12.176 --> 45:13.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MATTHEW DESMOND, Author,
"Evicted: Poverty
and Profit in the American
City": Thank you.

45:14.011 --> 45:16.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Eviction is far
more prevalent
than most people think and far
less part of

45:16.414 --> 45:20.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the discussion around poverty in
this country.
Why do you think that's the
case?

45:20.551 --> 45:24.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW DESMOND: I think we
focus a lot on
jobs. We focus a lot on mass
incarceration

45:24.622 --> 45:26.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and welfare reform.

45:26.424 --> 45:30.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But housing has been left out of
the debate
a little bit. We have focused on
public housing,

45:30.494 --> 45:35.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and we have focused on
neighborhoods, but
the private rental market, where
a vast majority

45:35.232 --> 45:38.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of low-income families are
living, has been
largely overlooked.

45:38.469 --> 45:42.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But here is this market that's
taking most
of what low-income families are
making. There's

45:42.940 --> 45:43.307 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a...

45:43.341 --> 45:45.142 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

45:45.176 --> 45:46.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: An incredible
amount, percentage
of income. I mean, that's really
striking.

45:46.644 --> 45:47.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATTHEW DESMOND: Yes. Yes.

45:47.511 --> 45:49.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Seventy, 80, 90
percent.

45:49.347 --> 45:51.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW DESMOND: Yes, that's
what I saw when
I was living with families in
Milwaukee. And

45:52.016 --> 45:55.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we reached a point today that we
know that
the majority of low-income
renters are paying

45:55.820 --> 45:59.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most of what they have just on
rent and to
keep the lights on.

45:59.190 --> 46:04.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I said you
followed eight families.
Pick one person to explain sort
of how people

46:04.528 --> 46:06.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fall into this and how hard it
is to get out
of it.

46:06.831 --> 46:08.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATTHEW DESMOND: Yes, yes.

46:08.599 --> 46:11.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm thinking of Arlene. You
know, Arlene was
a single mom. She had two young
boys. And

46:11.335 --> 46:15.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when I met her, she was living
in a pretty
run-down apartment in a
low-income neighborhood

46:15.473 --> 46:21.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and giving 88 percent of her
income on rent.
And she was facing terrible
choices. You know,

46:21.512 --> 46:25.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should I buy food or pay the
rent? Should
I contribute some money to the
funeral or

46:25.349 --> 46:27.184 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pay the rent?

46:27.218 --> 46:31.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And someone like Arlene,
eviction isn't necessarily
the result of irresponsibility.
It's more

46:32.023 --> 46:33.991 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
inevitable.

46:34.025 --> 46:36.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: They're making
some bad choices,
but you're showing how it's a
kind of -- almost

46:37.028 --> 46:40.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a vicious cycle, right, of the
eviction playing
into those choices.

46:40.331 --> 46:44.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW DESMOND: If you're
someone like Arlene
that's paying almost everything
you have to

46:44.101 --> 46:48.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the landlord, a very small
divergence can
invite an eviction.

46:48.272 --> 46:52.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The book opens with her
14-year-old hitting
a car with a snowball, you know,
and the man

46:52.743 --> 46:56.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
jumping out, kicking in the
door, and that
causing the landlord to evict
the family.

46:56.514 --> 47:01.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Was that a bad choice? Eviction
isn't just
a condition of poverty. It's
also a cause

47:01.652 --> 47:03.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of it. It's making things worse.

47:03.421 --> 47:07.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You show the
rawness of what
an eviction -- I mean, you
capture what it

47:07.358 --> 47:07.992 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
looks like.

47:08.025 --> 47:09.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATTHEW DESMOND: Yes.

47:09.760 --> 47:12.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Describe that. I
mean, take
an example of what perhaps
struck you even

47:12.863 --> 47:17.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the first time you actually saw
what that's
like, when you see everything
thrown out of

47:17.268 --> 47:19.070 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the house.

47:19.103 --> 47:21.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW DESMOND: I remember
seeing Arlene
get evicted in early January. It
was the coldest

47:21.972 --> 47:23.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
day on record in Milwaukee.

47:23.774 --> 47:29.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, the weathermen said it
would be
40 degrees below with the
windchill. And seeing,

47:29.947 --> 47:36.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, a family's things
piled on a curb,
seeing children forced from
their homes, seeing

47:36.287 --> 47:37.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the things taken....

47:37.988 --> 47:41.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We apologize that we

And a quick update before we go.

49:00.037 --> 49:06.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Late today, San Francisco's
Board of Supervisors
voted to make that city the
first in the nation

49:06.110 --> 49:10.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to require businesses to provide
full paid
leave for new parents. They will
be granted

49:10.948 --> 49:12.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
six weeks beginning in 2017.

49:12.716 --> 49:15.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With growing concern over
concussions and
related injuries, a start-up in
Upstate New

49:16.020 --> 49:20.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
York is using wearable
technology to help
keep athletes safer. It's a
device that sends

49:20.191 --> 49:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
head injury alerts as soon as
they happen
on the field and in the ring,
and also measures

49:28.999 --> 49:30.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the cumulative effect of
multiple hits.

49:30.801 --> 49:34.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From member station WXXI and
public media's
Innovation Trail, Sasha-Ann
Simons reports.

49:34.338 --> 49:39.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: We start off with a
10-minute run.
After the run, we do what's
called a set.

49:39.510 --> 49:46.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We do jumping jacks, pushups,
squats, like
all that kind of stuff. And we
wrap our hands.

49:46.517 --> 49:51.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SASHA-ANN SIMONS: It's a daily
ritual for
Michael Robertson. The
16-year-old is on the

49:51.488 --> 49:58.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
high school boxing team at
Aquinas Institute.
Six days a week, he gears up to
get in the

49:58.162 --> 50:00.030 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ring.

50:00.064 --> 50:03.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His head gear is high-tech.
Before every match,
he slips a small sensor inside
his headband

50:03.701 --> 50:09.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then puts a helmet on. Jab
after jab,
the sensor, this one called the
Linx Impact

50:09.974 --> 50:15.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Assessment System, IAS, sends
real-time data
to his coach and parents through
an app. Not

50:15.813 --> 50:21.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only does the sensor help spot
signs of a
concussion. It also can uncover
other, more

50:21.051 --> 50:22.853 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
common types of brain injuries.

50:22.887 --> 50:28.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: One of the things that I
look at with
the device is not only how hard
they're getting

50:28.225 --> 50:31.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hit, but if they're getting hit,
getting hit
how often with blows that
register.

50:31.762 --> 50:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SASHA-ANN SIMONS: Aquinas has
been field testing
the concussion sensor for about
two years.

50:35.499 --> 50:38.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Inside the helmet, the sensor
registers the
amount of force from a blow and
will trigger

50:38.936 --> 50:44.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a green, yellow, or red light,
with red being
the indicator that the hit was
too hard to

50:44.808 --> 50:50.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ignore. The data's available in
real time
and can be stored for review
after the match.

50:50.047 --> 50:54.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: We will check with the
system, and we
will also check with the
student, how did

50:54.451 --> 50:56.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their blow feel? And they're a
pretty good
system.

50:56.487 --> 50:58.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SASHA-ANN SIMONS: The blow is
also given an
impact assessment score.

50:58.656 --> 51:02.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BORKHOLDER, BlackBox
Biometrics: That
gives a number from one to 100,
and so you

51:02.960 --> 51:07.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can -- the individual can gauge
the severity
of each of those impacts on that
scale. But

51:07.965 --> 51:11.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we also capture all the detailed
data, which
is really critical for research.

51:11.101 --> 51:14.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SASHA-ANN SIMONS: David
Borkholder is in charge
of the technology at BlackBox
Biometrics,

51:14.705 --> 51:23.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which created LINX IAS. His team
is brainstorming
ways to push the technology
forward.

51:23.247 --> 51:37.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BORKHOLDER: Another
emerging area that
I think is actually going to be
even more

51:37.761 --> 51:39.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
important are repetitive
subconcussive hits.

51:39.596 --> 51:43.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SASHA-ANN SIMONS: Recent
research has shown
that many brain injuries are
from subconcussive

51:43.067 --> 51:45.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hits, which don't display the
symptoms of
a concussion.

51:45.970 --> 51:51.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And according to Dr. Jeff
Bazarian of the
University of Rochester Medical
center, it's

51:51.308 --> 51:56.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
important for wearable sensors
to be able
to pick up on those, too.

51:56.280 --> 52:01.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JEFF BAZARIAN, University of
Rochester
Medical Center: There are
football players

52:01.452 --> 52:06.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that get hit all the time, day
in and day
out, never have a concussion. We
look at their

52:06.590 --> 52:09.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brains, it looks like they have
some mild
brain injury.

52:09.626 --> 52:14.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SASHA-ANN SIMONS: Over the
years, more companies
have introduced impact sensors
and more doctors

52:15.032 --> 52:16.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have diagnosed concussions.

52:16.300 --> 52:19.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bazarian says that wasn't always
the case.

52:19.336 --> 52:25.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JEFF BAZARIAN: People would
say, these
problems that you're having are
not rooted

52:25.843 --> 52:30.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in anything real. They're just a
psychiatric
response to being hit.

52:30.781 --> 52:39.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now that we can see it,
people are saying,
oh, wow, this is kind of like a
stroke or

52:39.790 --> 52:41.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a ministroke. There's actually
injury here.

52:41.825 --> 52:46.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SASHA-ANN SIMONS: There's an
adage in boxing
that the best defense is to not
get hit.

52:46.663 --> 52:51.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Areole (ph) is a firm believer
technology
can't take the place of his
experience and

52:51.702 --> 52:55.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
good training, but says he
thinks devices
like LINX IAS are useful.

52:55.506 --> 53:01.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I can see if they need to
keep their
hands up, but it gives me
something to show

53:01.545 --> 53:06.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them, physically show them, look
how often
you're getting hit. What's the
story here?

53:06.083 --> 53:10.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
