GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill.

00:05.739 --> 00:07.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

00:07.641 --> 00:11.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: President
Obama's efforts to close tax
loopholes raise

00:12.012 --> 00:13.881 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hackles with U.S. corporations.

00:13.914 --> 00:20.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Thursday: how
one town's embrace of refugees
is revitalizing

00:20.387 --> 00:22.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the local economy.

00:22.222 --> 00:26.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IBRAHIM ROSIC, Bosnian War
Refugee: I am not
a burden on the community. I am
not a burden

00:26.293 --> 00:33.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on social services. Yes,
community helped
me to get this, but now it's my
time to pay

00:33.967 --> 00:35.769 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
back.

00:35.802 --> 00:39.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And we talk to Anita
Hill, whose
testimony a quarter-century ago
against Justice

00:39.940 --> 00:43.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clarence Thomas rocked the world
and inspired
a new film.

00:43.577 --> 00:49.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus, the second
in our series
on Indian workers. We go to a
dusty desert

00:49.816 --> 00:54.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where mining conditions are
causing a deadly
lung disease.

00:54.154 --> 01:01.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:01.194 --> 01:03.964 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:03.997 --> 01:13.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The tone and
tensions grew
sharper today on the Democratic
side of the

01:13.674 --> 01:19.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
presidential contest. It
happened as critical
new primaries loom in New York,
Pennsylvania

01:19.813 --> 01:22.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and other Northeastern states.

01:22.716 --> 01:27.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders walked to the mic
this morning
in Philadelphia, and picked up
where he had

01:27.387 --> 01:29.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
left off last night on Hillary
Clinton.

01:29.690 --> 01:32.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
Are you qualified to be
president of the United

01:32.893 --> 01:39.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States when you're raising
millions of dollars
from Wall Street, an entity
who's greed, recklessness

01:39.099 --> 01:42.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and illegal behavior helped
destroy our economy?

01:42.035 --> 01:47.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: During TV
interviews yesterday,
Clinton never actually called
Sanders unqualified,

01:47.674 --> 01:49.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but she did say this:

01:49.576 --> 01:52.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Well, I think he hasn't done his
homework,

01:52.079 --> 01:58.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and he'd been talking for more
than a year
about doing things that he
obviously hadn't

01:58.218 --> 01:59.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
really studied or understood.

01:59.987 --> 02:05.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That was a shot
at Sanders'
stumble in an interview on how
he'd break

02:05.625 --> 02:07.194 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up big banks.

02:07.227 --> 02:12.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the Vermont senator
argued he had no
choice but to respond in kind.

02:12.132 --> 02:15.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: They're
going to question
my qualifications, I think I
have a right

02:15.035 --> 02:16.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to question theirs.

02:16.803 --> 02:20.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But this morning,
in New York
City, Clinton dismissed Sanders'
criticism,

02:21.008 --> 02:23.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and shifted back to the
Republicans.

02:23.643 --> 02:28.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Look, I
didn't -- I
don't know why he's saying that,
but I would

02:28.281 --> 02:34.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take Bernie Sanders over Donald
Trump or Ted
Cruz any time. So let's keep our
eye on what's

02:34.755 --> 02:36.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
really at stake in this
election.

02:36.723 --> 02:42.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Republicans, too,
descended
on the EMPIRE STATE today. Texas
Senator Ted

02:42.162 --> 02:48.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cruz was upstate, and focused on
the GOP front-runner
during a stop outside
Schenectady.

02:48.235 --> 02:52.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
Donald Trump has been supporting
liberal Democratic

02:52.706 --> 02:55.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
politicians for 40 years.

02:55.542 --> 03:00.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When it comes to religious
liberty, when it
comes to the Supreme Court, he
said, Ted,

03:00.414 --> 03:06.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you got to learn to compromise.
You got to
learn to cut deals with the
Democrats and

03:06.753 --> 03:08.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
go along to get along.

03:08.588 --> 03:13.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Donald Trump was
off the trail
today, as his campaign announced
it's beefing

03:13.560 --> 03:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up its delegate hunt. But, last
night, the
New York billionaire reached
back to a Cruz

03:19.466 --> 03:24.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
jibe in January that Trump
symbolizes the
state's liberal politics.

03:24.738 --> 03:28.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Do you remember during the
debate when he

03:28.175 --> 03:34.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
started lecturing me on New York
values like
we're no good, like we're no
good?

03:34.514 --> 03:36.283 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BOOING)

03:36.316 --> 03:41.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And I started
talking to him
about the World Trade Center,
the bravery,

03:41.488 --> 03:44.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the incredible bravery of
everybody.

03:45.025 --> 03:48.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ohio Governor
John Kasich,
polling second to Trump in New
York, joined

03:49.029 --> 03:52.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in today with a new ad that rips
Cruz.

03:52.199 --> 03:54.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate:
They're not Iowa values and
they're not New

03:55.001 --> 03:57.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hampshire values. Everyone knows
what New
York values are.

03:57.804 --> 04:02.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Ted Cruz divides to
get a vote.
John Kasich unites to get things
done.

04:02.709 --> 04:09.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Former New York
City Mayor
Rudy Giuliani also criticized
Cruz today,

04:09.382 --> 04:11.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as he endorsed Trump.

04:11.284 --> 04:17.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the day's other
news: Russian
President Vladimir Putin is
denying he's tied

04:17.524 --> 04:23.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to offshore accounts, as
detailed in the Panama
Papers leak. In St. Petersburg
today, Putin

04:23.263 --> 04:28.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dismissed reports that a close
friend channeled
$2 billion to his supporters. He
said it's

04:28.835 --> 04:32.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
part of a U.S.-led plot to
discredit Russia.

04:32.205 --> 04:36.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through
translator): More than anything,
our opponents

04:36.376 --> 04:40.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are concerned with the unity and
consolidation
of the Russian nation, of the
multinational

04:40.580 --> 04:45.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian people. Because of that,
attempts
are made to destabilize the
situation from

04:45.519 --> 04:48.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
within, to make us more
agreeable and to shape
us the way they want.

04:48.922 --> 04:52.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Putin himself is not
directly
named in any of the leaked
documents.

04:52.759 --> 04:58.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Syria, Islamic
State militants
abducted more than 300 workers
and contractors

04:58.665 --> 05:04.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today. State TV reported it
happened at a
cement plant about 28 miles from
Damascus.

05:04.638 --> 05:10.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And in Iraq, elite
government
forces entered the center of a
key town held

05:10.110 --> 05:16.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by ISIS. They have been fighting
since last
month to retake Hit. It sits on
a major ISIS

05:16.183 --> 05:17.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
supply route from Syria.

05:18.018 --> 05:22.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Iran's President
Hassan Rouhani
delivered a jab to his country's
hard-liners

05:22.989 --> 05:27.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today. In a televised speech, he
said that
his government favors -- quote
-- "a policy

05:27.827 --> 05:34.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of moderation" and he said Iran
must engage
with the world now to take
advantage of last

05:34.067 --> 05:35.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
year's nuclear agreement.

05:35.835 --> 05:40.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HASSAN ROUHANI, Iranian
President (through
translator): The opportunity the
nuclear deal

05:40.440 --> 05:46.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has created for us is not
permanent and eternal.
Opportunities pass like passing
clouds. If,

05:46.146 --> 05:51.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
God forbid, a small group
succeed at not letting
us take advantage of this
opportunity, the

05:51.084 --> 05:52.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
opportunity will not return.

05:52.986 --> 05:58.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Rouhani's remarks
are a challenge
to Iran's supreme leader,
Ayatollah Khamenei,

05:58.558 --> 06:00.293 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and his hard-line allies.

06:00.327 --> 06:05.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Prosecutors in
Belgium have issued
a new appeal for help, finding a
ref -- a

06:06.032 --> 06:11.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fugitive, that is, from the
Brussels attacks.
They released new security
camera video today

06:11.304 --> 06:16.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
showing the so-called man in the
hat as he
left the airport, walked away
and finally

06:16.309 --> 06:22.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disappeared. In all, 32 people
died in the
Brussels attacks. The Islamic
State claimed

06:22.482 --> 06:24.184 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
responsibility.

06:24.217 --> 06:27.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
went back today
to where he once taught to press
his case

06:27.988 --> 06:33.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Supreme Court nominee
Merrick Garland.
At the University of Chicago's
law school,

06:33.393 --> 06:39.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he argued the U.S. Senate has to
vote on Garland's
nomination, or risk sabotaging
the system.

06:39.933 --> 06:45.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
We are going to see the kinds of
sharp partisan

06:45.338 --> 06:52.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
polarization that have come to
characterize
our electoral politics seeping
entirely into

06:52.712 --> 06:56.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the judicial system. And the
courts will just
be an extension of our
legislatures.

06:56.683 --> 07:01.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Republicans
insist that they
will wait for the next president
to name a

07:01.121 --> 07:06.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nominee. And the chair of the
Senate Judiciary
Committee, Chuck Grassley, said
today they're

07:06.393 --> 07:08.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
committed to that stance.

07:08.061 --> 07:13.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. CHARLES GRASSLEY (R), Iowa:
Our side
knows and our side believes that
what we're

07:13.133 --> 07:21.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doing is right. And when that's
the case,
it's not hard to withstand the
outrage and

07:21.341 --> 07:24.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the pressure they have
manufactured.

07:24.477 --> 07:30.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Garland met with
more Democratic
senators today. He's also met
with a handful

07:30.150 --> 07:31.918 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Republicans.

07:31.951 --> 07:35.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Wall Street had a
tough day, as
sluggish growth hurt bank
stocks. The Dow

07:35.488 --> 07:44.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jones industrial average lost
174 points to
close below 17542. The Nasdaq
fell 72 points,

07:44.464 --> 07:46.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and the S&amp;P 500 slid 24.

07:46.933 --> 07:52.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a rare first
edition of
William Shakespeare's collected
plays has

07:52.172 --> 07:58.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
turned up in Scotland. The
"First Folio" was
found at Mount Stuart, a vast
estate on the

07:58.144 --> 08:06.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scottish Isle of Bute. It was
printed in 1623,
and is one of only 234 known
copies in the

08:06.853 --> 08:12.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world. Britain is this year
marking the 400th
anniversary of Shakespeare's
death in April

08:12.859 --> 08:14.594 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
1616.

08:14.627 --> 08:21.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a crackdown
on companies seeking tax havens
overseas;

08:21.334 --> 08:27.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
refugees' economic impact on a
city in Upstate
New York; the U.S. role in
Yemen's civil war;

08:27.874 --> 08:32.245 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and much more.

08:32.278 --> 08:44.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: The Obama
administration took
steps this week to rein in big
businesses

08:44.858 --> 08:46.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when it comes to taxes and
mergers.

08:46.760 --> 08:51.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, the Treasury Department
issued tough
new rules that make it harder
for one company

08:51.231 --> 08:56.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
merging with another to lower
its taxes by
taking a foreign address. The
president spoke

08:56.736 --> 09:01.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out against the so-called
inversions, saying
they lead to one of the most
insidious tax

09:01.908 --> 09:03.710 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
loopholes.

09:03.743 --> 09:09.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A day later, the drug companies
Pfizer and
Allergan called off a $160
billion deal. Plus,

09:09.449 --> 09:14.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Obama Justice Department is
trying to
block oil services giant
Halliburton from

09:14.587 --> 09:19.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
merging with its rival Baker
Hughes. Other
proposed mergers may also be in
trouble.

09:19.993 --> 09:22.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jim Tankersley writes about this
for The Washington
Post.

09:22.495 --> 09:23.730 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome, Jim.

09:23.763 --> 09:25.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIM TANKERSLEY, The Washington
Post: Thanks
for having me.

09:25.765 --> 09:28.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, give me a sense
of whether
this is a conscious strategic
use by the administration

09:28.902 --> 09:31.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on tax policy to crack down on
business.

09:31.771 --> 09:35.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM TANKERSLEY: Well, in this
particular case,
it's absolutely the
administration saying,

09:35.508 --> 09:39.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is a practice in the
corporate world
that we don't like, and we're
going to use

09:39.312 --> 09:44.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tax policy to stop it. It looks
very tailored
in particular to mergers like
the Pfizer one,

09:44.317 --> 09:48.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which, I mean, it's very rare
that you see
a rule get announced on one day
and a merger

09:48.788 --> 09:51.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get called off the next, but
that's what they
have pulled off here.

09:51.157 --> 09:56.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, one of the
things that they
-- when we talk about this,
though, for instance,

09:56.396 --> 10:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the administration decided they
wanted to
make financial advisers more
accountable to

10:00.366 --> 10:00.867 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
clients.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JIM TANKERSLEY: Yes.

10:02.335 --> 10:03.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Is that part of that
same strategy,
or is that different?

10:03.703 --> 10:06.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIM TANKERSLEY: I think what
we're seeing
are two things.

10:06.306 --> 10:11.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over time, we have seen the
president sort
of shed his inhibitions about
taking positions

10:11.478 --> 10:16.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that might be opposed by the
business community.
He doesn't seem to really care
too much anymore

10:16.483 --> 10:21.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
if he's being called
anti-business. So, we
see like sort of string of
decisions this

10:21.554 --> 10:24.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
week that we have mentioned that
are all in
that vein.

10:24.390 --> 10:29.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the business community has
howled, and
he hasn't really let that bother
him. Shorter

10:29.696 --> 10:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
term, what we're seeing, though,
is the president,
I think, is thinking about his
legacy, and

10:33.967 --> 10:37.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he knows right now we're in a
time, a very
populist time, anti-corporate
time in the

10:38.004 --> 10:39.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
America in the campaign.

10:39.806 --> 10:44.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so by personally getting out
and announcing
details of the inversions rule,
making the

10:44.277 --> 10:49.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
case for it, for example, this
week, he's
trying to cement that rule in
the public's

10:49.616 --> 10:52.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mind, so that the next president
doesn't change
it or walk it back.

10:52.819 --> 10:58.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It does seem like
we're in a different
time when it comes to taking
shots at big

10:58.424 --> 11:03.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
business, and that on both the
Republican
and the Democratic side of this
2016 campaign,

11:03.596 --> 11:04.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that seems to be more
acceptable.

11:04.964 --> 11:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JIM TANKERSLEY: Absolutely.

11:06.766 --> 11:10.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're used to it, I think, to a
degree in
Democratic primaries for
president. The business

11:10.336 --> 11:15.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community tends to take a lot of
flak, and
then oftentimes candidates tack
a little more

11:15.074 --> 11:17.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
toward a pro-business approach
in a general
election.

11:17.744 --> 11:22.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's not entirely been true
this time. Both
Hillary Clinton and Bernie
Sanders especially

11:22.482 --> 11:26.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been very populist. They
both talked
about corporate behavior, bad
behavior that

11:26.386 --> 11:30.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they want to see changed as
president. But
the big change is the Republican
side.

11:30.323 --> 11:34.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump is talking about
things that
he doesn't -- companies being
unpatriotic

11:34.294 --> 11:36.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in moving jobs overseas. He's
talking down...

11:36.629 --> 11:38.298 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

11:38.331 --> 11:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Hedge funds. He has
talked about
tax evasion for hedge fund
managers.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JIM TANKERSLEY: Yes.

11:42.669 --> 11:46.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's this moment of anger.
It's the sense
for a lot of voters on both
sides of the aisle

11:47.006 --> 11:52.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, hey, corporate America is
lining its
pockets, but I'm not getting
ahead. And whether

11:52.145 --> 11:55.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the policies that the candidates
are talking
about would actually, you know,
speak to that

11:55.415 --> 12:01.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
problem or not, they are
definitely channeling
this moment of the politics, and
I think the

12:01.287 --> 12:03.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
president is kind of
piggybacking on that
a little bit.

12:03.156 --> 12:06.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Bernie Sanders, who
has probably
gone farther than any of the
candidates right

12:06.793 --> 12:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now in the race to hammering
away at this,
was scolded today by the
president of GE for

12:13.466 --> 12:17.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying they were examples of --
I'm paraphrasing
here -- corporate greed.

12:17.870 --> 12:19.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is the pushback coming from
the corporate
world?

12:19.906 --> 12:23.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM TANKERSLEY: Well, the
pushback, and part
of it is to say, hey, wait a
second, we create

12:23.543 --> 12:26.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a lot of jobs. We do a lot of
economic activity.

12:26.379 --> 12:33.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The GE op-ed which ran in my
newspaper basically
said, look, we have a big plant
in Vermont.

12:33.553 --> 12:37.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We'd love it if you visit, by
the way. You
have never done that. And we
create a lot

12:37.557 --> 12:42.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of good-paying jobs for people
of the type
you say you want to have happen.
So, don't

12:42.261 --> 12:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
denigrate us just because we
have to try to
play by the rules like everybody
else with

12:47.233 --> 12:49.068 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
taxes.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, the response to that, that
Bernie Sanders
and others have made is, these
are companies

12:51.437 --> 12:57.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that do a lot of things to try
to avoid paying
federal corporate income taxes
in particular,

12:57.176 --> 13:02.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they don't -- or they move
production
overseas to find lower-cost
labor. And that

13:02.382 --> 13:04.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
upset people who say, oh, you
should put America
first.

13:04.517 --> 13:07.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Is the president or
the Justice
Department or the Obama
administration putting

13:07.720 --> 13:12.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their political -- their thumb
on the political
scale in this? There are some
who say, oh,

13:12.158 --> 13:15.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of course, they're on their way
out, so they're
destroying everything at it.

13:15.361 --> 13:19.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM TANKERSLEY: Well, I think
with the Justice
Department in particular, it's
hard to call

13:19.432 --> 13:21.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this political.

13:21.234 --> 13:25.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This would be -- when you talk
to neutral
observers of antitrust law, this
is an example

13:25.038 --> 13:30.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of -- this is a couple of very
big players
in an already consolidated
market that would,

13:30.610 --> 13:34.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, the Justice Department
believes,
push up prices for consumers if
they were

13:34.047 --> 13:36.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
allowed to get a bunch of market
share together.

13:36.616 --> 13:41.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that's something that
Democrats and Republicans
have done. That's a power they
have exercised

13:41.054 --> 13:44.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as president. I'm not sure that
we can call
this a political move by Obama.

13:44.891 --> 13:50.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, Jim, is it
balanced out by
early administration moves to
bail out the

13:50.430 --> 13:56.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
auto companies in Detroit, to
bail out -- "bail
out" Wall Street -- we use air
quotes.

13:56.402 --> 13:59.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JIM TANKERSLEY: Well, he
certainly -- yes,
the president certainly had his
moments of

13:59.305 --> 14:01.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
working with business, and he
still does.

14:01.240 --> 14:04.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's pushing the Trans-Pacific
Partnership
trade deal right now hand in
hand with the

14:04.777 --> 14:10.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chamber and other groups of
business lobbyists.
So this is a president who in
the beginning

14:11.017 --> 14:15.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spent a lot of time trying to,
you know, help
the business community dig out
from the recession,

14:15.588 --> 14:21.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then has said a lot of things
about them being
fat cats or talking down Wall
Street bonuses

14:21.461 --> 14:23.196 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as bad.

14:23.229 --> 14:25.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then took a lot of flak from
them, and
now has reached this moment
where he meets

14:25.765 --> 14:29.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them on a few things, he fights
them on some
others, and the political wind
is sort of

14:29.302 --> 14:31.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more with him maybe than with
them at the
moment.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Well, it's
interesting to see.
The wind is definitely blowing
against them

14:33.573 --> 14:35.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the moment, but we will see
what happens
next.

14:35.975 --> 14:42.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jim Tankersley of The Washington
Post, thank
you very much.

14:42.615 --> 14:49.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JIM TANKERSLEY: Thanks for
having me.

14:49.055 --> 14:55.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's turn to a
different story
at the intersection of jobs,
business and

14:55.428 --> 15:01.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
politics, this on the question
of settling
and integrating refugees into
American communities.

15:01.200 --> 15:06.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Polls have shown concerns about
doing so among
a large percentage of voters.

15:07.006 --> 15:11.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Economics correspondent Paul
Solman has the
story of one city in New York
state that continues

15:11.811 --> 15:15.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to offer a welcome mat, and sees
it as good
business.

15:15.581 --> 15:19.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of his weekly series,
Making Sense,
which airs Thursdays.

15:19.318 --> 15:27.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Post-industrial
Utica, New York,
Upstate, downtrodden, and, in
the heart of

15:27.226 --> 15:33.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
downtown, where the United
Methodist Church
used to be, a thriving mosque.

15:33.432 --> 15:43.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the world beyond Utica, the
tide of refugees
rises, the fear of foreigners
swells. Muslim

15:43.075 --> 15:49.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terrorists, real and imagined,
haunt us. Ted
Cruz calls for increased
policing of Muslim

15:49.182 --> 15:50.950 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
neighborhoods.

15:50.983 --> 15:51.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
Focus on communities where
radicalization

15:51.751 --> 15:52.985 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is a risk.

15:53.019 --> 15:55.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Donald Trump's
first campaign
ad went further.

15:55.454 --> 15:59.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: The politicians can
pretend it's
something else, but Donald Trump
calls it

15:59.392 --> 16:04.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
radical Islamic terrorism.
That's why he's
calling for a temporary shutdown
of Muslims

16:04.630 --> 16:08.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
entering the United States until
we can figure
out what's going on.

16:08.100 --> 16:11.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But when we asked
Utica Mayor
Robert Palmieri if the city
would be willing

16:11.904 --> 16:14.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to resettle Syrian refugees?

16:14.073 --> 16:16.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT PALMIERI, Mayor of Utica,
New York:
I would say, absolutely, we
would be, because

16:16.475 --> 16:18.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Utica starts with you. It's as
simple as that.

16:18.511 --> 16:23.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: There's the
humanitarian aspect,
of course, America's historic
promise to extend

16:23.583 --> 16:29.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a hand to huddled masses
yearning to breathe
free. But Utica likes the
economics.

16:29.622 --> 16:32.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT PALMIERI: They're willing
to work and
they work extremely hard. It's
the rebound

16:32.491 --> 16:34.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for our great city.

16:34.427 --> 16:39.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Refugee
resettlement as an economic
development tool, a Rust Belt
revival strategy

16:39.432 --> 16:45.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Utica has pioneered. After
decades of decline
-- the city lost a third of its
population

16:45.838 --> 16:52.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when its factories closed --
Utica is growing
again, back up to 62,000 people,
thanks in

16:52.478 --> 16:58.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
part to its reputation as --

town that loves refugees," who
now make up

16:58.584 --> 17:01.020 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
one out of every four residents.

17:01.053 --> 17:06.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thousands are Muslims from
Bosnia, refugees
of the war there in the 1990s.

SAKIB DURACAK, Bosnian War
Refugee: We left
everything what we have at that
time and start

17:10.363 --> 17:12.064 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from zero again.

17:12.098 --> 17:17.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Sakib Duracak, who
trained in
Bosnia as a construction
engineer, started

17:17.236 --> 17:23.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a small business in Utica
rehabbing cheap,
often crumbling, houses for
refugees looking

17:23.042 --> 17:24.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to build a new life.

17:24.877 --> 17:29.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SAKIB DURACAK: A huge
opportunity, because,
at the time when we came in
Utica, it's a

17:29.081 --> 17:30.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relatively, very dead and poor
city.

17:30.850 --> 17:36.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Bosnians have
visibly spruced
up Utica's East Side and beyond.
But there's

17:36.055 --> 17:39.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an even more basic reason to
welcome refugees
to a town like Utica.

17:39.792 --> 17:42.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELLEN KRALY, Colgate University:
To have an
economy, you have to have
workers, and you

17:42.595 --> 17:44.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have to have consumers.

17:44.363 --> 17:48.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Professor Ellen
Kraly teaches
demography at nearby Colgate
University.

17:48.267 --> 17:55.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELLEN KRALY: The influx of
refugees to Utica
allowed us to retain some
smaller industries

17:55.474 --> 17:58.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that were looking for highly
motivated labor.

17:58.277 --> 18:03.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: And if past
suffering helps fuel
motivation, Tha Da Paw has
plenty to spare.

18:03.916 --> 18:08.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THA DA PAW, Karen Refugee: I
work very hard
because I want to live American
life.

18:08.354 --> 18:14.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: An ethnic Karen, a
persecuted
minority in Burma, she spent 23
years starting

18:14.660 --> 18:18.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at age 4 in refugee camps in
Thailand. When
she was 14:

18:18.965 --> 18:26.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THA DA PAW: Burmese army, they
just shoot
our refugee camp and make it
burn. My sister's

18:26.439 --> 18:28.274 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
best friend, she burn alive.

18:28.307 --> 18:32.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: A week later, her
17-year-old
sister committed suicide.

18:32.645 --> 18:39.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THA DA PAW: I think she tired of
life. Whole,
our life, we have to run, run,
run, run for

18:39.118 --> 18:41.020 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
safety.

18:41.053 --> 18:44.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Paw came to Utica
eight years
ago, worked as a nursing home
aide and housekeeper

18:44.724 --> 18:50.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
while studying English, then as
a medical
interpreter. Three years ago,
she joined the

18:50.363 --> 18:56.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
direct sales firm Mary Kay
Cosmetics. Within
months, she'd worked her way up
to the coveted

18:56.669 --> 18:58.437 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pink Cadillac.

18:58.471 --> 19:05.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THA DA PAW: I travel in Albany,
Buffalo. It's
really hard, but now I love to
live here.

19:06.012 --> 19:11.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: OK, so we get why
refugees for
Utica, but why Utica for
refugees?

19:11.083 --> 19:15.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IBRAHIM ROSIC, Bosnian War
Refugee: Utica
was close to Syracuse, and Tom
Cruise is from

19:15.855 --> 19:18.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syracuse, so I thought I was
going to see
Tom Cruise.

19:18.090 --> 19:25.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Sadly, for Bosnian
refugee Ibrahim
Rosic, no cruise, happily, the
Mohawk Valley

19:25.431 --> 19:27.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Resource Center.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHELLY CALLAHAN, Executive
Director, Mohawk
Valley Resource Center: We
receive $1,125

19:29.402 --> 19:33.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
federal to be spent on behalf of
each arriving
refugee.

19:33.239 --> 19:38.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: With those dollars,
says executive
director Shelly Callahan, the
refugee center

19:38.677 --> 19:45.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rents an apartment, furnishes
it, gets the
utilities turned on, and starts
teaching the

19:45.451 --> 19:47.186 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
basics.

19:47.219 --> 19:49.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHELLY CALLAHAN: So, it's how to
lock your
door, how to work the stove, the
thermostat,

19:50.022 --> 19:50.956 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the plumbing.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: There are also
English lessons.

19:52.992 --> 19:56.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Is somebody sitting to the
left of you?

19:56.495 --> 19:57.229 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Left?

19:57.263 --> 19:57.997 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Yes.

19:58.030 --> 19:58.764 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Right?

19:58.798 --> 19:59.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Left, right.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: You have got to shop
around.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Introductions to
strange new
foods.

20:03.102 --> 20:05.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Celery. We're going to
make celery
and kale.

20:05.704 --> 20:11.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And for those who
can drive,
the all-important class in
parking tickets,

20:11.177 --> 20:17.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a veritable auditorium of Babel.
But within
a few months, they're on their
own.

20:17.183 --> 20:22.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHELLY CALLAHAN: They actually
come here owing
their airfare back to the
federal government.

20:22.121 --> 20:25.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, they are expected to get a
job as soon
as possible.

20:25.658 --> 20:30.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Although there are
no hard statistics
on how many refugees do or don't
find jobs

20:30.529 --> 20:37.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after their aid ends, some
qualify for public
assistance. Ibrahim Rosic was
literally torn

20:37.503 --> 20:39.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
apart in the Bosnian conflict.

20:39.538 --> 20:51.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IBRAHIM ROSIC: In 1994 I stepped
on a land
mine. I lost my left leg, and my
right leg

20:51.150 --> 20:55.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was severely damaged. I have no
knee. I can't
bend it.

20:55.387 --> 21:00.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: He is officially
100 percent
disabled, but, says the former
engineer:

21:00.059 --> 21:05.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IBRAHIM ROSIC: I work two jobs.
I work full-time
as a director at Mohawk Valley
Community College,

21:05.364 --> 21:11.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I also work as an adjunct
instructor at
SUNY Poly. I am not a burden on
the community.

21:11.570 --> 21:19.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am not a burden on social
services. Yes,
community helped me to get this,
but now it's

21:19.111 --> 21:23.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my time to pay back. And I would
say most
refugees do the same.

21:23.649 --> 21:29.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, are refugees
the economic
boon that motivated immigrants
famously have

21:29.588 --> 21:30.823 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
been?

21:30.856 --> 21:34.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, says economist Jeffrey
Sachs, but there
are negatives.

21:34.126 --> 21:38.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY SACHS, Columbia
University: Some workers
face increased job competition
and their wages

21:38.197 --> 21:44.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
can be driven down. If
lower-skilled immigrants
come, then lower-skilled
American workers

21:45.004 --> 21:52.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
may see a decline in their
wages, whereas
business owners may see more
workers at lower

21:52.077 --> 21:53.779 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cost for them.

21:53.812 --> 21:59.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And what if, as
many Americans
fear, even just a few are
terrorists?

21:59.852 --> 22:02.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Shelly Callahan's response? This
isn't Europe.

22:02.821 --> 22:10.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHELLY CALLAHAN: Refugees are
the most intensively
screened immigrants really to
come to this

22:10.362 --> 22:17.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country, about two years of
intense scrutiny
by the Department of Homeland
Security, the

22:17.169 --> 22:23.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FBI, ICE, Department of State.
There's DNA
testing involved.

22:23.175 --> 22:27.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
YOUSIF AL SAAD, Iraq War
Refugee: For those
people who is proven as bad
people, we don't

22:27.613 --> 22:29.381 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
want them here.

22:29.415 --> 22:34.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The Al Saad family,
Palestinians
who for decades lived in
Baghdad, fled during

22:34.286 --> 22:38.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the troop surge of 2007, the
deadliest year
of the Iraq War.

22:38.691 --> 22:42.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YOUSIF AL SAAD: I got kidnapped
there by,
I don't know, some militia.

22:42.895 --> 22:44.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: One of my other brothers,
too.

22:44.763 --> 22:45.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
YOUSIF AL SAAD: My other
brother.

22:45.831 --> 22:47.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: They beat him up.

22:47.099 --> 22:49.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YOUSIF AL SAAD: He got beat up.
I lost many
friends of mine.

22:49.134 --> 22:53.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: They spent three
years in a camp
on the Syrian border, before
being cleared

22:53.706 --> 22:55.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for transit to the United
States.

22:56.008 --> 23:03.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yousif Al Saad went to work at
the Chobani
yogurt plant outside Utica,
whose CEO, Hamdi

23:03.249 --> 23:09.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ulukaya, has championed the
rights of refugees
and hired hundreds of them. We
were supposed

23:09.855 --> 23:15.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to tape there, but at the last
minute, Chobani
pulled out, citing security
concerns, fear

23:15.461 --> 23:18.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the safety of employees in
the current
political environment.

23:18.998 --> 23:24.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHELLY CALLAHAN: Well, I think
that is probably
reflective of the very sad
climate in this

23:24.803 --> 23:30.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country with regard to politics
at the moment
and rhetoric.

23:30.109 --> 23:33.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MEN AND WOMEN: With liberty and
justice for
all.

23:33.379 --> 23:36.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Let's have a round of
applause for our
new citizens.

23:36.382 --> 23:38.183 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

23:38.217 --> 23:44.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: A few weeks ago in
Utica, Yousif
Al Saad joined 29 others, from
15 different

23:44.690 --> 23:47.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
countries in becoming a U.S.
citizen.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Congratulations. Your new
flag.

23:49.561 --> 23:52.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Almost all were
refugees.

23:52.364 --> 23:56.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We leave the last word to Judge
David Peebles.

23:56.035 --> 23:59.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDGE DAVID PEEBLES, New York:
America is
now your country. I cannot
overemphasize the

24:00.005 --> 24:04.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need now, more than ever, for
you and your
fellow citizens to unite, answer
the call

24:04.810 --> 24:09.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and assist in bettering our
society and our

becoming a citizen

of the greatest nation on earth.
God bless

Anita Hill's sexual harassment
charges against

24:40.979 --> 24:47.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

But, first, the grinding war in
Yemen has
further broken an already
failing state. Now

24:58.564 --> 25:03.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are new questions about
the depth of
U.S. involvement there, aiding
what has become

25:03.936 --> 25:07.172 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a proxy war.

25:07.206 --> 25:13.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Saudi Arabia and its Sunni
allies launched
the air campaign 13 months ago,
aimed at Shiite

25:13.512 --> 25:19.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

Iran. But the
United Nations estimates the
airstrikes account

25:19.818 --> 25:28.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for 60 percent of the 3,200
civilians killed
in the conflict so far.

Just last month, an air raid on

RUPERT COLVILLE, Spokesman,
United Nations
High Commissioner for Human
Rights: Despite

25:34.466 --> 25:41.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
public promises to investigate
such incidents,
we have yet to see progress in
any such investigations.

25:41.206 --> 25:47.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now Human Rights

its investigators visited the

25:47.913 --> 25:54.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the strikes used U.S.-supplied
bombs. The
group said it illustrates --
quote -- "tragically,

25:54.553 --> 25:58.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why countries should stop
selling arms to
Saudi Arabia."

25:58.457 --> 26:04.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In response, the U.S. Central
Command said:
"Selection and final vetting of
targets in

26:04.630 --> 26:10.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the campaign are made by the
Saudi-led coalition,
not the United States."

26:10.369 --> 26:16.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of State John Kerry
said he didn't
have any -- quote -- "solid
information" about

26:16.041 --> 26:23.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what weapons were used. He spoke
during a
visit to Bahrain, a member of
the Saudi coalition.

26:23.282 --> 26:31.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. aids that coalition,
and in November
approved a nearly $1.3 billion
rearming program

26:31.323 --> 26:39.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the Saudis. "Foreign Policy"
magazine
reports that there have been
roughly 750 U.S.

26:39.731 --> 26:42.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
aerial refueling missions.

26:43.001 --> 26:49.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, a cease-fire is
scheduled to begin
Sunday, with new peace talks
scheduled for

26:49.808 --> 26:51.810 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
April 18.

26:51.844 --> 26:56.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on the conflict and the
U.S. role
in Yemen, I'm joined now by
retired Army Colonel

26:56.849 --> 27:02.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Derek Harvey. He was an
intelligence officer
and special adviser to the
commander of U.S.

27:02.654 --> 27:05.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
forces in Iraq, General David
Petraeus.

27:05.624 --> 27:08.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Colonel Harvey, thank you for
being with us
again.

27:08.927 --> 27:14.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This report by Human Rights
Watch is disturbing,
but hasn't it been known for
some time that

27:14.066 --> 27:18.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there have been large numbers of
civilian
casualties in this war?

27:18.036 --> 27:21.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COL. DEREK HARVEY (RET.), U.S.
Army: Yes,
it's been true that large
numbers of civilian

27:21.940 --> 27:23.709 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
casualties.

27:23.742 --> 27:29.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's inevitable,
given the skill
and lack of training and use of
the weapons

27:29.381 --> 27:33.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and technology that the Saudi
air forces employ
in Yemen today.

27:33.452 --> 27:38.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what do you
mean by that?
What do you mean by lack of
training and skill,

27:38.390 --> 27:40.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or lack of skill?

27:40.125 --> 27:43.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COL. DEREK HARVEY: Well, Judy, I
think we
are very accustomed in America
and elsewhere

27:43.795 --> 27:49.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the world to the high
professionalism and
great skill of the U.S. Air
Force and Western

27:49.268 --> 27:55.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
European countries, who have
rules of engagement,
training, and capabilities that
allow them

27:55.440 --> 27:59.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to reduce collateral damage and
civilian casualties.

27:59.378 --> 28:03.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Other countries around the
world, to include
the Saudi Arabian air force,
doesn't have

28:03.782 --> 28:09.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that same level of skill. They
fly higher.
They're not as good at employing
those weapons.

28:09.922 --> 28:15.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They, you know, are probably
trying to avoid
civilian casualties. Everything
we see seems

28:15.727 --> 28:20.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to suggest that. But it's
inevitable, given
the type of conflict and the
skill level of

28:20.933 --> 28:22.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those that are involved in this
conflict.

28:22.768 --> 28:28.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why did the U.S.,
why did this
administration decide to provide
this kind

28:28.140 --> 28:33.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of military support to the
Saudis and to this
coalition, intelligence,
refueling, and all

28:33.712 --> 28:35.480 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the rest?

28:35.514 --> 28:39.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COL. DEREK HARVEY: Well, part of
it is, we
have been attempting to bolster
the relationship

28:39.918 --> 28:46.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Saudi Arabia after some of
the fractious
disagreement about the Iran
nuclear deal,

28:46.925 --> 28:52.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and concerns in Saudi Arabia and
in the Gulf
about Iranian continued efforts
to encroach

28:52.864 --> 28:55.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on Sunni Arab areas.

28:55.534 --> 29:02.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with the successes of Iran
in Iraq and
in Syria and Lebanon, they saw
this as another

29:02.241 --> 29:07.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
threat from Iran supporting the
Shia-aligned
Houthis in Yemen that was going
to threaten

29:07.479 --> 29:13.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Saudi Arabia. The United States
simply decided
it was best to pollster and
repair that relationship

29:13.819 --> 29:17.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Riyadh and support them in
the way that
we have been doing it.

29:17.589 --> 29:21.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what -- I
mean, can you
spell out a little bit more
about what the

29:21.193 --> 29:22.995 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
support entails?

29:23.028 --> 29:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COL. DEREK HARVEY: Clearly, we
are providing
some advice and assistance with
limited what

29:28.734 --> 29:34.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would call coaching. But we're
not selecting
or directing the operations or
directing any

29:34.506 --> 29:36.341 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
targeting.

29:36.375 --> 29:40.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is intelligence that's
being provided
from a range of U.S.
intelligence capabilities,

29:40.045 --> 29:45.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to include drones that are
flying over Yemen
on a regular basis. The air
refueling that

29:45.517 --> 29:50.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was commented on in the intro
piece is -- has
been an important element.

29:50.555 --> 29:56.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, mostly, the Saudi Arabians
and the other
Gulf countries that are involved
in this conflict

29:56.461 --> 30:03.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
primarily use U.S. weapons and
munitions.
And, inevitably, it's going to
be American-sourced

30:03.301 --> 30:07.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
equipment, weapons and munitions
that will
be used in Yemen.

30:07.039 --> 30:11.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, how much
responsibility
does the United States bear for
these civilian

30:11.777 --> 30:13.545 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
casualties?

30:13.578 --> 30:19.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COL. DEREK HARVEY: Well, I don't
think we're
involved in selecting any of
those targets.

30:19.584 --> 30:21.386 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's indirect.

30:21.420 --> 30:27.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have been supporting an ally,
and, in that
sense, you know, there is some
responsibility.

30:27.826 --> 30:31.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The United States
administration, the Obama
administration, Secretary Kerry
and others,

30:31.797 --> 30:38.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have distanced themselves very
clearly from
that conflict and are
recognizing that it's

30:38.336 --> 30:41.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really about supporting Saudi
Arabia and repairing
the relationship.

30:41.940 --> 30:49.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they understand that they're
in a hard
place because of the blowback
and the concerns

30:49.915 --> 30:54.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the United States is being
tainted by
the support of the Saudi
Arabians in this

30:54.920 --> 30:56.722 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
conflict.

30:56.755 --> 30:59.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But do you -- is
it your sense
that the administration has
explained the

30:59.391 --> 31:01.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conflict here, the contradiction
here?

31:02.027 --> 31:04.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COL. DEREK HARVEY: No, not at
all.

31:04.396 --> 31:09.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is another war that is
forgotten. It's
on the back burner. It's, in
part, part of

31:09.534 --> 31:14.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our larger C.T. strategy that
imploded almost
a year ago in Yemen.

31:14.239 --> 31:15.407 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Counterterrorism.

31:15.440 --> 31:17.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COL. DEREK HARVEY: Yes, our
counterterrorism
strategy.

31:17.776 --> 31:22.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, unfortunately, since the
civil war expanded
and the Saudis became involved,
our ability

31:22.881 --> 31:29.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to go after al-Qaida and the
expanding Islamic
State elements in Yemen has been
hurt.

31:29.321 --> 31:34.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it sounds as
if the prospects
for working this out are --
remain very difficult.

31:34.926 --> 31:37.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a cease-fire and peace
talks, but
no assurances.

31:37.996 --> 31:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COL. DEREK HARVEY: I think we're
just at the
beginning of that journey. The
talks that

31:41.967 --> 31:46.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are coming up in Kuwait City
mid-month are
a good step.

31:46.138 --> 31:50.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There has been some exchanges of
prisoners.
There's talk on both sides. But
we're a long

31:50.876 --> 31:55.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ways away from exhaustion on
both sides or
one side being able to impose
its will on

31:55.380 --> 32:00.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the other. So I think this
conflict is going
to rage on. And there's really,
you know,

32:00.685 --> 32:01.920 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bleak prospects.

32:01.953 --> 32:05.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Colonel Derek
Harvey, we thank
you very much.

32:05.824 --> 32:14.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COL. DEREK HARVEY: Thank you,
Judy.

32:14.232 --> 32:25.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Twenty-five years
ago this October,
University of Oklahoma law
Professor Anita

32:25.911 --> 32:32.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hill changed Supreme Court
confirmation hearings
forever. Twenty million
households tuned in

32:32.584 --> 32:38.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to see her testify that her
former boss, nominee
Clarence Thomas, sexually
harassed her.

32:38.223 --> 32:43.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The hearings continued through
the weekend,
touching hot buttons of sex,
power and race.

32:43.829 --> 32:46.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thomas called it a high-tech
lynching.

32:46.631 --> 32:51.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HBO Films retells the story in
"Confirmation,"
starring Kerry Washington and
Wendell Pierce

32:52.003 --> 32:53.738 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as Thomas.

32:53.772 --> 32:59.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACTOR: If what you say this man
said to you
occurred, why in God's name,
when he left

32:59.678 --> 33:07.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his position of power or status
or authority
over you, why in God's name
would you ever

33:07.552 --> 33:10.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
speak to a man like that the
rest of your
life?

33:10.155 --> 33:17.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KERRY WASHINGTON, Actress:
That's a very good
question. And I am sure that I
cannot answer

33:17.429 --> 33:25.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it to your satisfaction. I have
suggested
that I was afraid of
retaliation. I was afraid

33:25.770 --> 33:29.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of damage to my professional
life.

33:29.040 --> 33:37.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I believed that -- you have to
understand
that this kind of response is
not atypical,

33:37.182 --> 33:46.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I can't explain it. It takes
an expert
in psychology to explain how
that can happen.

33:46.124 --> 33:51.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it can happen, because it
happened to
me.

33:51.963 --> 33:57.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Anita Hill, now a
professor of
law at Brandeis University,
joins me now.

33:57.402 --> 34:02.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You said you watched this film
about a week
ago. Did you hesitate at all to
relive that

34:02.941 --> 34:04.809 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
again?

34:04.843 --> 34:06.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANITA HILL, Professor of Law,
Brandeis University:
Well, I have relived it on other
occasions,

34:06.845 --> 34:09.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and so this wasn't the first
time.

34:09.214 --> 34:12.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a documentary a couple
of years
ago.

34:12.350 --> 34:13.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It was called
"Anita."

34:13.485 --> 34:15.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANITA HILL: It was called
"Anita."

34:15.353 --> 34:24.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's still hard, but I -- I
know it's
important, and it's something
that I was willing

34:24.129 --> 34:27.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do, because I really wanted
to know how
HBO of going to tell the story.

34:27.265 --> 34:34.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You know, you have
lived in this
your entire -- the past
quarter-of-a-century.

34:34.072 --> 34:39.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many people are just coming new
to the story
or remember it vaguely. Do you
look back on

34:39.978 --> 34:41.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it and think, I would do this
again?

34:41.613 --> 34:44.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANITA HILL: I would do it again.

34:44.916 --> 34:48.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many people do remember it
vaguely, but I
run into people all the time who
remember

34:48.987 --> 34:55.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it vividly. As a matter of fact,
when I was
on the flight here this morning
from Boston,

34:55.293 --> 34:58.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a woman -- I said, "Boy, you
really have a
good memory."

34:58.330 --> 35:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she says: "I remember it so
well. It was
like it just happened."

35:01.099 --> 35:06.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You accumulated
labels during
this process. You were either a
liar in some

35:06.471 --> 35:08.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people's eyes or a truth-teller.

35:08.573 --> 35:10.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you worry that you will never
be able to
shed those labels?

35:11.009 --> 35:14.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANITA HILL: I don't worry about
it. I just
keep living my life.

35:14.279 --> 35:17.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been 25 years. There are
just people
who don't know the story.

35:17.082 --> 35:18.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: People who weren't
born.

35:18.350 --> 35:21.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANITA HILL: People who weren't
born, don't
know the story.

35:21.553 --> 35:25.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think they're going to
find it really
interesting. In some ways, it is
going to

35:25.290 --> 35:29.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seem like ancient history to
them, but I think,
in many ways, it is going to
seem just like

35:29.160 --> 35:34.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today, because some of the
issues that were
raised, as you pointed out in
the introduction,

35:34.232 --> 35:36.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are so contemporary. They
haven't gone away.

35:36.234 --> 35:40.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I'm old enough to
have remembered
the hearings at the time. And I
was shocked

35:40.205 --> 35:47.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then. I am shocked now, reliving
it and watching
the things that were said, the
different characters

35:47.879 --> 35:50.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that different senators and
others took on.

35:50.248 --> 35:52.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I wonder if it is surreal
for you, too.

35:52.417 --> 35:57.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANITA HILL: It was surreal to
experience that.

35:57.055 --> 36:03.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, unfortunately, I hear from
women in particular,
but women and men, who come up
against this

36:03.928 --> 36:09.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of power and this kind of
resistance
all the time. And,
unfortunately, they're

36:09.601 --> 36:14.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
getting some of the same kinds
of inaccurate
statements, some of the
fallacies, some of

36:14.439 --> 36:19.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the myths that were behind what
the senators
were doing are being repeated
over and over

36:19.144 --> 36:20.545 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
again.

36:20.578 --> 36:23.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Have you talked to
Kerry Washington
about her playing you?

36:23.048 --> 36:29.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANITA HILL: She and I spoke when
she was preparing
to play me. And she works very
hard to understand

36:29.788 --> 36:31.523 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the person.

36:31.556 --> 36:36.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have a lot of respect for
that. I was
actually comforted by it and
thought, OK,

36:36.194 --> 36:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well, if hard work is what it
takes and skill,
she -- she's going to pull it
off very nicely.

36:41.299 --> 36:45.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And this movie
captures, you were
personally -- your character was
dragged through

36:45.770 --> 36:49.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the mud. I'm sure Clarence
Thomas would say
his was as well.

36:49.974 --> 36:53.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I wonder if you have spoken
with any of
the senators who were on that
committee since.

36:53.978 --> 36:55.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANITA HILL: I have not spoken
with them.

36:55.580 --> 36:57.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Have they reached
out to you?

36:57.115 --> 37:00.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANITA HILL: Arlen Specter did at
one point.

37:00.618 --> 37:06.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He suggested that we -- what he
said was,
"I was thinking we might be able
to work on

37:06.091 --> 37:07.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
something together."

37:07.892 --> 37:10.562 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I just couldn't see that as
a possibility.

37:10.595 --> 37:16.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: How do young women
react to you
now? You're on a college campus.
College campuses

37:16.768 --> 37:21.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are hotbeds of debate for things
-- among
other things, sexual assault
cases now.

37:21.439 --> 37:26.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANITA HILL: Sexual harassment
and sexual assault
really is something that is on
the minds of

37:26.644 --> 37:28.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
young women today.

37:28.513 --> 37:33.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do visit -- I'm on a college
campus. We're
grappling with those issues. I
visit colleges

37:33.918 --> 37:40.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
all over the country.
High-profile colleges
like Berkeley, U.C. Berkeley,
are grappling

37:40.058 --> 37:46.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with them, making decisions, in
some cases,
that are just wrongheaded
decisions about

37:46.297 --> 37:49.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how to proceed with sexual
harassment claims.

37:49.267 --> 37:55.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are two that are out there
now, one
involving an administrator, the
other involving

37:55.840 --> 38:03.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a high-profile faculty member.
And so these
issues are very present. And I
have to credit

38:03.681 --> 38:08.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some very, very brave young
women and men
for taking this on, on college
campuses.

38:08.386 --> 38:12.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: One of the things
that also crossed
my mind while I was watching
this is whether

38:12.757 --> 38:18.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you could have survived, whether
this, any
of this set of events could have
unfolded

38:18.363 --> 38:25.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in our current age in a time of
instantaneous
social media and Twitter and
instant judgment?

38:25.503 --> 38:31.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANITA HILL: I don't upon how any
of -- how
this would unfold today in this
environment.

38:31.876 --> 38:37.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I can tell you a funny
story. One of the
things that I tell to people is,
I have a

38:37.048 --> 38:44.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
collection of faxes that I got.
Well, we wouldn't
have faxes. We didn't even have
e-mail so

38:44.255 --> 38:51.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much. Western Union, I think,
fell under the
crunch of the telegrams that
were coming.

38:52.030 --> 38:58.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would be quite different
today. But I don't
-- I think that the issues are
such that it

38:58.937 --> 39:04.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wouldn't go away. It wouldn't be
instant.
I think it would be different.
The forums

39:04.375 --> 39:09.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for discussing it would be
different, but
the issue wouldn't disappear
just because

39:09.747 --> 39:11.549 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we live in an instant society.

39:11.583 --> 39:17.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: When -- at one point
in the film,
the character, and presumably
you, said, this

39:17.889 --> 39:23.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was a mistake. Do you still
think it was a
mistake? And, if not what,
changed your mind?

39:23.595 --> 39:29.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANITA HILL: I think the
character -- my words
aren't always exactly what the
characters

39:29.634 --> 39:30.802 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are saying.

39:30.835 --> 39:32.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, that's the thing about
fictional
adaptations.

39:32.203 --> 39:33.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Right.

39:33.171 --> 39:36.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANITA HILL: I don't think it was
a mistake.

39:36.708 --> 39:42.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it was something that
was meant to
happen, actually. I had
something to say.

39:42.447 --> 39:46.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had an experience to share
that went to
the fitness of an individual who
was going

39:46.751 --> 39:52.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be sitting on a Supreme Court
with a lifetime
appointment. It was important,
not only to

39:52.790 --> 39:59.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the integrity of this
individual, but also
to the integrity of the court
itself.

39:59.864 --> 40:06.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as a member of the bar, as a
citizen,
I had a right to come forward
and to testify.

40:06.371 --> 40:15.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think we -- that is ever
a mistake.
And I really wouldn't do it
differently today.

40:15.246 --> 40:19.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Anita Hill,
professor of law at
Brandeis University, thank you
very much.

40:19.450 --> 40:20.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANITA HILL: Thank you.

40:20.952 --> 40:33.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: HBO's "Confirmation"
premieres
Saturday, April 16, at 8:00 p.m.

40:33.431 --> 40:43.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yesterday,
special correspondent
Fred de Sam Lazaro brought us a
report on

40:43.775 --> 40:49.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how big city street vendors are
being left
behind in India's booming
economy.

40:49.380 --> 40:54.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, we travel to stone
quarries in the
rural northern part of the
country, where

40:54.319 --> 40:59.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a deadly disease has trapped
workers there
in poverty for generations.

40:59.157 --> 41:02.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This report is part of our
Agents for Change
series.

41:02.260 --> 41:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Across the
urban landscape
rise majestic sandstone palaces,
monuments

41:09.634 --> 41:17.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and temples, built in India's
timeless architectural
traditions.

41:17.208 --> 41:21.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what's also timeless is how
the stone
continues to be mined, far from
the cities

41:21.746 --> 41:27.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here in the Rajasthan Desert.
Early each morning,
you hear the sound of sandstone
being pounded

41:27.318 --> 41:33.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into a gravel that is used in
construction.
No one is spared the drudgery,
it seems, nursing

41:33.658 --> 41:37.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mother with infant, young
children.

41:37.128 --> 41:39.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION: How old are you?

41:39.597 --> 41:41.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHILD (through translator): Ten.

41:41.332 --> 41:44.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He should be
in school.
It's the law. But history
suggests he will

41:44.936 --> 41:53.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
soon graduate to a quarry, part
of a vicious
cycle of generational poverty
and disease.

41:54.011 --> 42:01.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The work is physically brutal
under a blazing
desert sun. Power drills are a
recent addition

42:01.986 --> 42:07.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that have made these quarries
more productive.
But behind their thick clouds of
dust, miners

42:07.291 --> 42:12.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wear nothing but flip-flops on
their feet-and
nothing at all on their faces.
They earn $2

42:12.964 --> 42:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to $4 a day, depending on the
task.

42:15.767 --> 42:20.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. PRAKASH TYAGI, Executive
Director, GRAVIS:
The law of the mines is that, no
work, no

42:20.671 --> 42:25.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wage. So, the days when they
can't turn to
work, because of an illness or
because of

42:25.777 --> 42:27.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some other problem, they can't
make any money.

42:28.012 --> 42:32.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And, Prakash
Tyagi says,
for an alarming number, perhaps
a third of

42:32.784 --> 42:40.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the 250,000 sandstone miners,
the work is
lethal, linked to silicosis, a
slow, irreversible

42:40.892 --> 42:42.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
loss of lung function.

42:42.994 --> 42:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. PRAKASH TYAGI: Silicosis is
a shame. Silicosis
is something that shouldn't
exist in the contemporary

42:48.466 --> 42:50.334 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
times.

42:50.368 --> 42:53.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Silicosis is
easily preventable
with face masks and by using
water to tamp

42:53.771 --> 42:59.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
down the dust that is
everywhere. And the
disease is now rarely seen in
developed countries.

42:59.444 --> 43:04.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet Tyagi, who is a medical
doctor, says
no one around here had ever
addressed until

43:04.081 --> 43:09.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about three decades ago, when
his late father
started a charity called GRAVIS,
dedicated

43:09.454 --> 43:13.191 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to improving life in this
impoverished region.

43:13.224 --> 43:19.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the early days, many patients
they saw
were assumed to have
tuberculosis, which is

43:19.931 --> 43:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
treatable with antibiotics.

43:21.699 --> 43:25.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. PRAKASH TYAGI: The treatment
was given.
Still, people were dying with
lung issues

43:25.837 --> 43:29.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very similar to T.B. But it
wasn't T.B.

43:29.106 --> 43:34.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Only after
sending 250
X-rays to a research center in
Delhi did GRAVIS

43:34.479 --> 43:40.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
learn it was dealing with
silicosis and designed
ways to help patient cope with
the slow, degenerative,

43:40.751 --> 43:43.020 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fatal condition.

43:43.054 --> 43:49.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, GRAVIS runs field clinics
near quarries,
offering diagnostic services and
a limited

43:49.427 --> 43:54.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amount of drugs, like cough
suppressants and
inhalers that can control,
though not cure,

43:54.632 --> 43:55.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
symptoms.

43:55.867 --> 43:57.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. PRAKASH TYAGI (through
translator): Do
you have T.B.?

43:57.735 --> 44:02.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Many, like
this 25-year-old
mother of two, hope that they
just have T.B.,

44:02.807 --> 44:04.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which is a common coinfection.

44:04.609 --> 44:10.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, the paper she carried,
but was unable
to read, indicated she had
silicosis.

44:10.214 --> 44:12.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She may live to be 40 years old?

44:12.750 --> 44:17.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. PRAKASH TYAGI: At the most.
So, she's
one of those accelerated
silicosis cases.

44:17.922 --> 44:22.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is saying that she has been
working in
mines for about eight to 10
years. She would

44:22.527 --> 44:24.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have started when she was 15 or
16.

44:24.462 --> 44:29.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Many start
even younger,
though it typically takes about
20 years of

44:29.300 --> 44:35.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dust exposure for silicosis to
develop, destroying
lung tissue, rendering sufferers
listless

44:35.840 --> 44:37.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and unable to do much physical
activity.

44:37.909 --> 44:43.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I have
been ill
for about seven years. For two
years I have

44:43.614 --> 44:45.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just haven't been able to work
at all.

44:45.483 --> 44:50.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Their
condition will worsen
inevitably, until, like Joga Ram
(ph), they

44:50.121 --> 44:52.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are literally unable to breathe.

44:52.423 --> 44:57.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. PRAKASH TYAGI: This is how,
typically,
silicosis patients die.

44:57.662 --> 45:00.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Is he
reasonably comfortable
or is he in pain?

45:00.731 --> 45:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. PRAKASH TYAGI: He's in a lot
of pain.

45:02.466 --> 45:07.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Ideally, he
would receive
oxygen and steroids and die in a
hospital

45:07.471 --> 45:12.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or hospice setting. None of that
is available
or affordable here.

45:12.443 --> 45:18.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The prolonged illness forces
many families
to incur debt, prolonging their
medieval poverty

45:18.583 --> 45:20.284 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into the next generation.

45:20.318 --> 45:26.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Modu Devi (ph) echoed the
sentiments of many
in this group of silicosis
widows.

45:26.424 --> 45:31.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): We
have to send
our children to work. We have no
choice. There

45:31.195 --> 45:33.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is no other way to put food in
our stomachs.

45:33.764 --> 45:39.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: It's not a
lot of food.
It was around 10:00 a.m. when we
visited this

45:39.203 --> 45:40.137 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
village.

45:40.171 --> 45:46.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"What have you eaten?" I asked.
They hadn't.

45:46.444 --> 45:52.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"The truck will come by around
midday and,
only when we load it up, will we
get the money

45:52.416 --> 45:53.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to buy food," she said.

45:53.985 --> 45:56.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION (through translator):
How much will
you get paid?

45:56.053 --> 45:57.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): One
hundred and
fifty.

45:57.822 --> 46:03.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: That's about
$2.50.

46:03.160 --> 46:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These magnificent sandstone from
which government
officials governs in New Delhi
may seem aloof

46:08.399 --> 46:14.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and far removed from the
suffering and labor
of miners in Rajasthan. But the
irony is that

46:14.171 --> 46:17.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
India actually passed laws
decades ago to
protect minors.

46:17.775 --> 46:23.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a wide gap between
what's on paper
and the ground reality. The
combination of

46:23.314 --> 46:30.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
official neglect, social
indifference and
poor education ensure laws are
rarely enforced.

46:30.154 --> 46:33.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This mine owner insisted that he
makes masks
and helmets available.

46:33.958 --> 46:38.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): They
just don't
wear them. They don't like to
wear them.

46:38.462 --> 46:40.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: "Why not
require them?"
I asked.

46:40.665 --> 46:44.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"They will just leave and go to
the next mine,"
he said.

46:44.635 --> 46:49.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For their part, workers said
they sometimes
used masks while drilling, but
in the blazing

46:49.173 --> 46:52.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hot weather, they said, they are
suffocating.

46:52.243 --> 46:56.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): It's
impossible
to breathe in them. We cannot
breathe when

46:56.814 --> 46:58.616 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we wear them.

46:58.649 --> 47:02.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: A few mines
now do provide
for wet drilling and require
workers to wear

47:02.119 --> 47:07.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
masks on certain jobs. This mine
is run by
Jeevraj Meghwal, who won a land
concession

47:07.825 --> 47:11.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
under affirmative action
policies to help
people from lower castes.

47:11.529 --> 47:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEEVRAJ MEGHWAL, Quarry Owner
(through translator):
I was once a laborer myself, so
I know about

47:15.833 --> 47:20.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the difficulties when you get
sick, when you
lose your income. In the
beginning, we didn't

47:20.171 --> 47:24.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know much about silicosis.
GRAVIS did help
us understand it.

47:24.308 --> 47:29.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: GRAVIS,
which is funded
by charitable donations from
abroad and some

47:29.380 --> 47:34.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Indian government grants, also
helps affected
miners navigate the daunting
government bureaucracy.

47:34.785 --> 47:39.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. PRAKASH TYAGI: There is a
lot of paperwork.
There is a lot of delay. But we
try to make

47:39.724 --> 47:44.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sure that these people who are
illiterate
and less capable go through
those hurdles.

47:45.029 --> 47:50.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The
compensation, about
1,700 U.S. dollars for living
victims, $3,000

47:50.868 --> 47:56.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for their survivors, provides
some debt relief,
more money to travel and perhaps
find new

47:56.507 --> 47:58.275 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
work.

47:58.309 --> 48:02.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Tyagi says his and a few
other groups
meet only a small fraction of
the need, while

48:02.246 --> 48:08.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he says thousands of silicosis
victims scattered
across this remote region suffer
and die each

48:08.686 --> 48:11.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
year without even a diagnosis.

48:11.288 --> 48:16.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Fred de Sam
Lazaro in Rajasthan, India.

48:16.594 --> 48:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fred's reporting
is a partnership
with the Under-Told Stories
Project at University

48:22.867 --> 48:25.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of St. Thomas in Minnesota.

48:25.136 --> 48:34.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can watch his previous story
about India's
urban workers on our Web site,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

48:34.645 --> 48:49.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Padma Lakshmi is
perhaps best
recognized as the host of
Bravo's "Top Chef."

48:49.059 --> 48:53.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, she speaks about using
her public
platform to shine light on
causes that matter.

48:53.998 --> 48:59.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lakshmi's memoir, "Love, Loss,
and What We
Ate," was released on
International Women's

48:59.937 --> 49:01.739 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Day.

49:01.772 --> 49:03.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PADMA LAKSHMI, Author, "Love,
Loss, and What
We Ate": Somebody approached me
at a bar one

49:03.607 --> 49:08.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night who was a friend of a
friend and thought
I could model. And, at the time,
you know,

49:08.445 --> 49:13.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with sort of youthful arrogance,
I said, oh,
I am not going to ruin my GPA in
the last

49:13.684 --> 49:20.090 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
semester.

49:20.124 --> 49:25.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have a very complicated and
layered relationship
with modeling. It has allowed me
to travel,

49:25.763 --> 49:30.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allowed me to see the world. I
did feel guilty
about it. You know, I made in
one day what

49:30.868 --> 49:35.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it took my mother, for example,
as a nurse
to make in a month.

49:35.573 --> 49:40.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know that my looks are really
the alchemy
of my parents' genetics and have
little to

49:40.477 --> 49:44.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do with me or any accomplishment
of my own.

49:44.582 --> 49:50.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Food and fashion are both much
closer than
people realize. You can tell a
lot about a

49:50.054 --> 49:55.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
culture by the way they eat and
by the way
they dress. People would say,
well, what does

49:55.826 --> 50:00.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a model know about food? But the
truth is,
models eat a lot. They're just
these freaks

50:00.931 --> 50:05.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of nature who are very young and
have great
metabolisms. And that is the
truth.

50:05.636 --> 50:12.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the biggest fringe
benefits of having
a measure of success and being
in the public

50:12.142 --> 50:17.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
eye is being able to do
something good for
other people.

50:17.481 --> 50:23.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the proudest moment for
my family,
who are all Indian, wasn't when
"Top Chef"

50:23.387 --> 50:30.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
won the Emmy or when I was on
the cover of
"Vogue." It was the day that I
spoke at MIT

50:30.361 --> 50:32.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and gave the keynote address.

50:32.296 --> 50:38.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My foundation, the Endometriosis
Foundation
of America, was launching the
first research

50:38.435 --> 50:45.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
center for gynepathology.
Endometriosis affects
a woman not only physically, but
emotionally

50:45.309 --> 50:47.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and mentally, because she's in
chronic pain.

50:47.878 --> 50:54.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's something that I have
suffered from all
my life, and it was a silent and
deadly shadow.

50:54.051 --> 50:58.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There's no cure for
endometriosis, but there
is certainly very good treatment
out there.

50:59.023 --> 51:04.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you find it early in a
young girl's
life, you can change her life
forever.

51:04.895 --> 51:13.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If I had had surgery at 21 or 25
or even 30,
rather than 36 or 37, when I
first had it,

51:13.804 --> 51:19.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
my life would have been
different. I would
have gotten 25 percent of my
life back, 25

51:19.543 --> 51:24.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
percent of my life to go to
football games,
help my mom in the kitchen,
study for midterms,

51:24.748 --> 51:28.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be a normal human being.

51:28.452 --> 51:32.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't want anyone else to
go through
that ever if they don't have to.

51:32.056 --> 51:39.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm Padma Lakshmi, and this is
my Brief But
Spectacular take on food,
travel, and celebrating

51:39.897 --> 51:41.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all things female.

51:41.732 --> 51:46.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You can find more
videos in our
Brief But Spectacular series on
our Facebook

51:48.505 --> 51:54.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a
clarification to a story
we reported at the top of
tonight's broadcast.

51:54.778 --> 51:59.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We said that former New York
City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani is endorsing Donald
Trump in the

51:59.817 --> 52:06.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New York primary. That is
incorrect. Mr. Giuliani
says he's voting for Mr. Trump,
but he's not

52:06.190 --> 52:07.958 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
endorsing him.

52:07.992 --> 52:12.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
online right
now: Meet Lupe and Jacqueline,
both born in

52:12.396 --> 52:18.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mexico and brought to the U.S.
as small children
without documents. They have a
lot in common,

52:18.268 --> 52:23.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but, today, these students face
very different
paths because of where they
live. Learn how

52:23.974 --> 52:28.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
educational opportunities differ
for undocumented
immigrants in different states.

52:28.879 --> 52:31.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:31.882 --> 52:37.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And tune in later
tonight on
"Charlie Rose" for an interview
with Democratic

52:37.354 --> 52:39.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
presidential candidate Bernie
Sanders.

52:39.323 --> 52:41.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A note before we go.

52:41.625 --> 52:46.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm going to be off the air for
a few weeks.
But my friend and partner, Judy
Woodruff,

52:46.730 --> 52:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here will be holding down the
fort until I
return.

52:49.566 --> 52:50.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'll see you then.

52:50.934 --> 52:52.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we already
can't wait for
you to come back.

52:52.636 --> 52:53.771 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Thank you, Judy.

52:53.804 --> 52:56.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's the
"NewsHour" for
tonight.

52:56.240 --> 53:00.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Friday, we will look at
Alabama's efforts
to reduce its prison population.

53:00.911 --> 53:01.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:01.678 --> 53:03.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

53:03.547 --> 53:08.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening.
For all of us here at the "PBS
NewsHour,"

53:08.552 --> 53:23.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.

53:23.300 --> 53:30.307 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
