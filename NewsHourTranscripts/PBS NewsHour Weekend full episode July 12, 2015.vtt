00:14.000 --> 00:16.733
ANNOUNCING A LANDMARK DEAL ON

00:16.733 --> 00:18.467
IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM?

00:18.467 --> 00:20.333
GREECE'S FINANCIAL FUTURE STILL

00:20.333 --> 00:21.933
IN DOUBT.

00:21.933 --> 00:23.367
AND THE FIGHT TO KEEP SOMALIA'S

00:23.367 --> 00:24.733
YOUTH FROM FLEEING THE

00:24.733 --> 00:26.567
COUNTRY...

00:26.567 --> 00:27.767
>> Reporter: "DON'T LEAVE.

00:27.767 --> 00:28.933
STAY HERE," HE TELLS THEM.

00:28.933 --> 00:31.033
IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS, ALMOST

00:31.033 --> 00:34.467
900 KIDS FROM THIS SCHOOL ALONE

00:34.467 --> 00:36.100
HAVE FLED FOR EUROPE.

00:36.100 --> 00:37.267

00:39.467 --> 00:42.100

00:42.100 --> 00:43.467
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:43.467 --> 00:44.200
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING,

00:44.200 --> 00:45.133
AND THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:45.133 --> 00:46.167
WE START WHERE WE HAVE FOR WHAT

00:46.167 --> 00:48.467
SEEMS THE PAST TWO WEEKS NOW,

00:48.467 --> 00:50.300
CLOSER AND CLOSER TO A HISTORIC

00:50.300 --> 00:51.567
DEAL BETWEEN IRAN AND SEVERAL

00:51.567 --> 00:52.933
NATIONS ABOUT LIMITING THEIR

00:52.933 --> 00:55.467
NUCLEAR PROGRAM IN EXCHANGE FOR

00:55.467 --> 00:56.767
A LIFTING OF ECONOMIC SANCTIONS-

00:56.767 --> 00:57.933
- AT ONE POINT TODAY, WORD THAT

00:57.933 --> 00:58.733
A DEAL COULD BE ON THE TABLE AS

00:58.733 --> 01:02.000
EARLY AS TOMORROW.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.300
HERE WAS AN OPTIMISTIC SECRETARY

01:04.300 --> 01:05.467
OF STATE KERRY THIS MORNING.

01:05.467 --> 01:06.900
>> A VERY GOOD MEETING.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.000
VERY POSITIVE.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.500
I THINK WE ARE GETTING TO SOME

01:11.500 --> 01:14.200
REAL DECISIONS.

01:14.200 --> 01:17.800
SO, I WILL SAY, BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:17.800 --> 01:20.400
A FEW TOUGH THINGS TO DO, I

01:20.400 --> 01:21.767
REMAIN HOPEFUL.

01:21.767 --> 01:23.100
>> Sreenivasan: BUT LATER IN THE

01:23.100 --> 01:24.667
DAY, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER

01:24.667 --> 01:26.367
JAVAD ZARIF STOOD ON HIS BALCONY

01:26.367 --> 01:28.033
AND TOLD PRESS THERE WAS MORE

01:28.033 --> 01:29.467
WORK TO BE DONE TOMORROW, AND

01:29.467 --> 01:31.367
THAT A DEAL WOULD NOT BE

01:31.367 --> 01:33.067
FINISHED TODAY.

01:33.067 --> 01:34.233
THE AGREEMENT WOULD BE A

01:34.233 --> 01:37.033
CULMINATION OF MORE THAN A

01:37.033 --> 01:38.133
DECADE OF TALKS TO ALLOW U.N.

01:38.133 --> 01:39.667
WEAPONS INSPECTIONS.

01:39.667 --> 01:40.567
EVEN IF A DEAL IS REACHED, THE

01:40.567 --> 01:42.800
GOVERNMENTS OF BRITAIN, FRANCE,

01:42.800 --> 01:44.133
GERMANY, RUSSIA AND CHINA AND

01:44.133 --> 01:45.867
THE U.S. HAVE TO APPROVE.

01:45.867 --> 01:47.267
THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM

01:47.267 --> 01:48.967
ACCORDING TO SENATE MAJORITY

01:48.967 --> 01:51.200
LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.667
>> WE ALREADY KNOW THAT IT'S

01:53.667 --> 01:54.900
GOING TO LEAVE IRAN AS A

01:54.900 --> 01:55.567
THRESHOLD NUCLEAR STATE.

01:55.567 --> 01:58.167
WE KNOW THAT.

01:58.167 --> 01:59.767
IT APPEARS AS IF THE

01:59.767 --> 02:01.267
ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH TO

02:01.267 --> 02:03.233
THIS WAS TO REACH WHATEVER

02:03.233 --> 02:05.167
AGREEMENT THE IRANIANS WERE

02:05.167 --> 02:06.667
WILLING TO ENTER INTO.

02:06.667 --> 02:07.633
SO, I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A

02:07.633 --> 02:15.333
VERY HARD SELL, IF IT'S

02:15.333 --> 02:16.233
COMPLETED, IN CONGRESS.

02:16.233 --> 02:17.067
>> Sreenivasan: ISRAELI PRIME

02:17.067 --> 02:18.300
MINISTER NETANYAHU IS GOING A

02:18.300 --> 02:19.533
STEP FURTHER, DENOUNCING ANY

02:19.533 --> 02:23.167
DEAL WITH IRAN.

02:23.167 --> 02:24.533
>> (translated): THIS

02:24.533 --> 02:25.267
AGREEMENT IS PUTTING AT RISK THE

02:25.267 --> 02:26.233
PEACE OF THE WORLD.

02:26.233 --> 02:27.133
IRAN DOESN'T HIDE ITS INTENTION

02:27.133 --> 02:28.000
TO CONTINUE ITS MURDEROUS

02:28.000 --> 02:28.800
AGGRESSION, EVEN AGAINST THOSE

02:28.800 --> 02:29.567
WHO THEY ARE IN NEGOTIATIONS

02:29.567 --> 02:30.267
WITH.

02:30.267 --> 02:31.867
MAYBE THERE IS SOMEONE AMONG THE

02:31.867 --> 02:33.400
POWERS WHO IS WILLING TO GIVE

02:33.400 --> 02:34.667
WAY TO THE REALITY DICTATED BY

02:34.667 --> 02:35.467
IRAN, WHICH INCLUDES THE

02:35.467 --> 02:36.367
RELENTLESS CALLS FOR THE

02:36.367 --> 02:37.667
DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL.

02:37.667 --> 02:39.533
WE WILL NOT ACCEPT IT.

02:39.533 --> 02:40.700
>> Sreenivasan: BLOOMBERG NEWS

02:40.700 --> 02:42.233
REPORTER INDIRA LAKSHMANAN JOINS

02:42.233 --> 02:43.567
US NOW FROM VIENNA WHERE SHE'S

02:43.567 --> 02:44.533
BEEN COVERING THE TALKS FOR

02:44.533 --> 02:46.633
WEEKS.

02:46.633 --> 02:47.533
WE'VE GOT TO STOP MEETING LIKE

02:47.533 --> 02:48.433
THIS.

02:48.433 --> 02:49.600
ASK YOU ALMOST THE SAME

02:49.600 --> 02:50.733
QUESTION.

02:50.733 --> 02:53.100
HOW CLOSE ARE WE TO A DEAL AND

02:53.100 --> 02:53.833
WHAT'S HAPPENING TONIGHT?

02:53.833 --> 02:58.267
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, OHARI, IT HAS

02:58.267 --> 03:02.233
BEEN 16 DAYS OF TOP LEVEL TALKS,

03:02.233 --> 03:04.267
IT'S A RECORD.

03:04.267 --> 03:07.067
THESE TALKS HAVE GONE ON, NOT

03:07.067 --> 03:09.500
EVEN THIS LONG AT CAMP DAVID.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.367
A DEAL IS AROUND THE CORNER,

03:11.367 --> 03:13.400
WE'RE ALMOST THERE, ALMOST

03:13.400 --> 03:15.133
THERE, AND AT THIS POINT I THEY

03:15.133 --> 03:17.767
WE MAY REALLY ALMOST BE THERE.

03:17.767 --> 03:19.700
THEY'VE MISSED THREE DEADLINES

03:19.700 --> 03:21.567
ALREADY, THE NEXT DEADLINE IS

03:21.567 --> 03:22.267
LOOMING.

03:22.267 --> 03:24.367
THEY'VE GIVEN THEMSELVES UNTIL

03:24.367 --> 03:25.667
MONDAY TO FINALIZE THE TEXT OF A

03:25.667 --> 03:27.933
DEAL WHICH WE'RE BEING TOLD IS

03:27.933 --> 03:30.300
NOW NEAR 100 PAGES BETWEEN THE

03:30.300 --> 03:33.800
TEXT AND FIVE ANNEXES AND WHAT

03:33.800 --> 03:36.333
WE ARE BEING TOLD IS THAT THE

03:36.333 --> 03:37.333
MAJOR POLITICAL DECISIONS HAVE

03:37.333 --> 03:38.533
BEEN MADE BUT THE WRITING THE

03:38.533 --> 03:40.367
LEGAL WORK THE TECHNICALITIES

03:40.367 --> 03:42.000
STILL HAVE TO BE WRAPPED UP AND

03:42.000 --> 03:44.367
OF COURSE CAPITALS HAVE TO SIGN

03:44.367 --> 03:46.267
OFF ON THAT SO WE THINK THAT'S

03:46.267 --> 03:47.433
GOING TO BE HAPPENING OVERNIGHT

03:47.433 --> 03:48.967
WITH A POSSIBLE ANNOUNCEMENT

03:48.967 --> 03:51.067
TOMORROW IF ALL THE Ts GET

03:51.067 --> 03:56.167
CROSSED AND THE Is GET DOTTED.

03:56.167 --> 03:58.433
>> THE ARMS EMBARGO WHAT

03:58.433 --> 03:59.067
HAPPENED TO THAT?

03:59.067 --> 04:01.067
>> I WAS TOLD THAT THIS ISSUE

04:01.067 --> 04:03.000
HAS BEEN RESOLVED.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.733
THAT HAS BEEN A MAJOR ISSUE FOR

04:04.733 --> 04:06.600
IS IRANIANS THE RUSSIANS AND THE

04:06.600 --> 04:07.600
AMERICANS.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.800
THE IRANIANS AND THE RUSSIANS

04:09.800 --> 04:12.167
WANTED THE ARMS EMBARGO LIFTED

04:12.167 --> 04:14.633
BECAUSE RUSSIA IS READY TO SELL

04:14.633 --> 04:16.433
WEAPON SYSTEMS INCLUDING

04:16.433 --> 04:17.567
DEFENSIVE WEAPON SYSTEMS LIKE

04:17.567 --> 04:19.833
THE S-300 TO IRAN AND THE U.S.

04:19.833 --> 04:22.700
OF COURSE FOR THEM THIS IS A

04:22.700 --> 04:23.533
EXPLOSIVE ISSUE PARTICULARLY IN

04:23.533 --> 04:24.900
THE U.S. CONGRESS IS GOING TO

04:24.900 --> 04:26.433
MAKE IT HARD TO SELL THE DEAL.

04:26.433 --> 04:29.267
BUT WHAT I'M TOLD THE EMBARGO A

04:29.267 --> 04:31.167
COMPROMISE HAS BEEN COME UP WITH

04:31.167 --> 04:32.567
AND THERE IS AN AGREEMENT THAT

04:32.567 --> 04:34.600
THE U.N. ARMS EMBARGO NOT THE

04:34.600 --> 04:36.967
UNITED STATES ONE, WILL BE

04:36.967 --> 04:37.833
LIFTED NOT IMMEDIATELY BUT OVER

04:37.833 --> 04:38.733
TIME.

04:38.733 --> 04:41.033
>> YOU MENTIONED APPROVALS

04:41.033 --> 04:44.667
AROUND THE COUNTRY, MICHIGAN

04:44.667 --> 04:48.333
McCONNELL SAYS IT'S A -- MITCH

04:48.333 --> 04:50.000
McCONNELL SAYS IT WILL BE A

04:50.000 --> 04:50.600
TOUGH SELL.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.567
>> THIS HAS BEEN A TALKING POUND

04:53.567 --> 04:54.433
ALL ALONG.

04:54.433 --> 04:56.967
DIDN'T WANT ANY DEAL THAT WOULD

04:56.967 --> 04:59.100
ALLOWS IRAN WITH ENRICHMENT

04:59.100 --> 05:00.233
CAPABILITY.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.467
I THINK HAD A TALKING POINT GETS

05:02.467 --> 05:04.900
STRONGER TO AN OFFICIAL DEAL

05:04.900 --> 05:05.933
BEING DONE.

05:05.933 --> 05:06.767
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

05:06.767 --> 05:08.300
IT'S GOING TO BE A TOUGH SELL

05:08.300 --> 05:10.233
AND UPHILL BATTLE IN CONGRESS.

05:10.233 --> 05:12.833
WE ALSO HEARD TED CRUZ

05:12.833 --> 05:14.600
SPECIFICALLY PICKING ON THE ARMS

05:14.600 --> 05:16.133
EMBARGO AND SAYING IF THAT WAS

05:16.133 --> 05:17.833
LIFTED THERE'S GOING TO BE A

05:17.833 --> 05:21.733
MAJOR FIGHT ON CAPITOL HILL.

05:21.733 --> 05:22.900
THE ADMINISTRATION WILL HAVE TO

05:22.900 --> 05:24.533
COME BACK WITH WHAT THEY THINK

05:24.533 --> 05:26.400
IS THE STRONGEST DEEM POSSIBLE

05:26.400 --> 05:28.700
AND SELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND

05:28.700 --> 05:30.300
THE CONGRESS WHY THEY THINK

05:30.300 --> 05:32.933
THERE STOPS IRAN ON ALL OF ITS

05:32.933 --> 05:34.767
PATHS OF GETTING A NUCLEAR

05:34.767 --> 05:36.200
WEAPON AND A GOOD DEAL FOR

05:36.200 --> 05:37.133
SECURITY.

05:37.133 --> 05:38.933
>> THERE'S ALSO MIXED MESSAGES

05:38.933 --> 05:40.200
COMING OUT OF IRAN.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.233
ON THE ONE HAND WE SEE

05:42.233 --> 05:44.567
PREPARATIONS FOR A DEAL AND ON

05:44.567 --> 05:45.967
THE OTHER HAND TOUGH TALK FROM

05:45.967 --> 05:46.900
THE LEADERSHIP ABOUT UNITED

05:46.900 --> 05:48.067
STATES AND ARROGANCE AND

05:48.067 --> 05:51.667
CONTINUE TO FIGHT.

05:51.667 --> 05:53.267
YEAH, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

05:53.267 --> 05:57.667
LAST NIGHT THE SUPREME LEADER

05:57.667 --> 05:59.100
AYATOLLAH KHAMENEI REFERRED TO

05:59.100 --> 06:02.133
THE U.S. AND ARROGANCE.

06:02.133 --> 06:03.933
IF THEY DIDN'T GET A DEAL THERE

06:03.933 --> 06:07.833
WOULDN'T BE RAPPROCHEMENT FOR

06:07.833 --> 06:09.633
THE UNITED STATES, THIS TALKING

06:09.633 --> 06:11.900
POINT MATCHES IN SOME LEVEL WHAT

06:11.900 --> 06:14.333
THE ITS HAS SAID IN A MUCH --

06:14.333 --> 06:17.533
THE UNITED STATES HAS SAID IN A

06:17.533 --> 06:20.833
MUCH MORE DIPLOMATIC WAY.

06:20.833 --> 06:32.800
WE ALSO SAW HASAN ROUHANI

06:32.800 --> 06:34.967
SAYING, THERE WILL BE A DIEHL,

06:34.967 --> 06:37.367
IF THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GET A

06:37.367 --> 06:39.167
DEAL, WE ARE ON THE END OF THE

06:39.167 --> 06:41.000
WORST SHAGGY DOG STORY IN

06:41.000 --> 06:42.533
HISTORY SINCE THIS HAS BEEN

06:42.533 --> 06:45.733
GOING ON FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

06:51.700 --> 06:52.867
BE MAKING PROGRESS OVER GREECE'S

06:52.867 --> 06:55.167
GROWING ECONOMIC CRISIS.

06:55.167 --> 06:56.867
THE E.U. CANCELLED ITS 28-NATION

06:56.867 --> 06:58.200

06:58.200 --> 07:00.900
FOCUS ON GREECE.

07:00.900 --> 07:01.833
THE GREEK PARLIAMENT BACKED A

BAILOUT WORTH TENS OF BILLIONS

07:05.133 --> 07:05.733
OF EUROS.

07:05.733 --> 07:06.600

07:06.600 --> 07:07.700
WANT MORE ASSURANCES FROM GREECE

07:07.700 --> 07:09.200
AS THEY PRESENT THE LATEST

07:09.200 --> 07:11.433
OPTIONS TO EUROZONE LEADERS.

07:11.433 --> 07:12.700
>> (translated): THE DECISIVE

07:12.700 --> 07:14.133
POINT IS THAT GREECE, STARTING

07:14.133 --> 07:15.600
TOMORROW, MUST SHOW US THEY

07:15.600 --> 07:16.767
AGREE WITH THE STATEMENT, THAT

07:16.767 --> 07:18.333
THE PARLIAMENT AGREES, AND

07:18.333 --> 07:19.433
FOLLOWING THAT THE MEASURES

07:19.433 --> 07:20.433
SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED THROUGH

07:22.033 --> 07:23.567
AND WHEN ALL THESE CONDITIONS

START TALKS ON AN ADDITIONAL

19:05.300 --> 19:07.400
THEY DECLARED A ISLAMIC

19:07.400 --> 19:09.100
CALIPHATE LAST YEAR.

19:09.100 --> 19:11.133
BUT SINCE THEY DO THIS THEY

19:11.133 --> 19:13.267
CARRIED OUT SOME OF THEIR MOST

19:13.267 --> 19:15.800
BRUTAL ACTS DURING RAMADAN.

19:15.800 --> 19:20.133
AT LEAST SHOWING THEM KILLING 16

19:20.133 --> 19:22.333
PEOPLE THEY ACCUSED OF BEING

19:22.333 --> 19:25.000
SPY, BASICALLY THEY PUT THEM

19:25.000 --> 19:27.267
INTO A CAGE AND LOWERED THEM

19:27.267 --> 19:29.967
INTO A POOL UNTIL THEY DROWN.

19:29.967 --> 19:31.367
THEY SENT EXPLOSIVES AROUND THE

19:31.367 --> 19:34.167
NECK OF SOME PEOPLE ALLEGING

19:34.167 --> 19:36.067
THEY ARE SPICE AND THEY BLEW

19:36.067 --> 19:36.833
THEIR HEADS OFF.

19:36.833 --> 19:37.800
THEY ARE DOING THIS.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.333
THEY TRY TO SCARE THE PEOPLE AND

19:39.333 --> 19:41.167
ALSO THEY TRY TO TELL THEM LIKE

19:41.167 --> 19:42.900
WE ARE YOUR PROTECTORS, WE

19:42.900 --> 19:46.100
PROTECT YOU FROM THE IRAQI AND

19:46.100 --> 19:47.433
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT FORCES.

19:47.433 --> 19:48.400
WE PROTECT YOU FROM OTHER

19:48.400 --> 19:49.300
MILITANTS.

19:49.300 --> 19:51.167
THIS HAS BEEN THE CASE.

19:51.167 --> 19:53.833
>> SO IN THIS TIME THERE'S ALSO

19:53.833 --> 19:55.667
THE PRACTICE OF FASTING.

19:55.667 --> 19:57.300
AND YOU'RE REPORTING THAT THEY

19:57.300 --> 19:58.900
ARE EVEN ENFORCING THAT PEOPLE

19:58.900 --> 19:59.833
OBSERVE THE FAST.

19:59.833 --> 20:01.200
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

20:01.200 --> 20:06.633
I MEAN, DURING RAMADAN,

20:06.633 --> 20:09.400
OBSERVANCE, MUSLIMS ABSTAIN FROM

20:09.400 --> 20:11.633
FOOD AND WATER FROM SUNRISE

20:11.633 --> 20:12.533
UNTIL SUNSET.

20:12.533 --> 20:17.133
BUT IF SOMEONE IS CAUGHT UNDER

20:17.133 --> 20:19.233
THE ISLAMIC STATE AREA EATING

20:19.233 --> 20:22.133
DURING DAY YOU COULD BE PUNISHED

20:22.133 --> 20:24.233
FROM SOMETHING LIKE BEING PUT IN

20:24.233 --> 20:28.267
A CAGE FOR A PUBLIC PLACE LIKE A

20:28.267 --> 20:29.667
MARKET FOR A DAY OR EVEN MORE

20:29.667 --> 20:30.767
THAN A DAY.

20:30.767 --> 20:33.533
ALL WHO ARE SICK CANNOT FAST IF

20:33.533 --> 20:34.200
THEY WANT.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.367
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I.S.I.S,

20:36.367 --> 20:38.333
WHAT THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP IS

20:38.333 --> 20:39.067
DOING.

20:39.067 --> 20:41.867
THEY'RE PUNISHING ANYONE, EVEN

20:41.867 --> 20:44.600
OLDER PEOPLE SICK PEOPLE, THEY

20:44.600 --> 20:46.400
DISTAIN ANYONE WHO REFUSES TO

20:46.400 --> 20:47.767
STOP EATING.

20:47.767 --> 20:50.533
>> RAMADAN IS USUALLY A FAIRLY

20:50.533 --> 20:52.933
FESTIVE TIME, PEOPLE BREAK THEIR

20:52.933 --> 20:54.800
FAST BY JOINING WITH OTHER

20:54.800 --> 20:56.533
FAMILIES AND FRIENDS IN THE

20:56.533 --> 20:57.667
EVENING.

20:57.667 --> 21:00.267
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

21:00.267 --> 21:03.067
BEFORE THE ISLAMIC STATE TOOK

21:03.067 --> 21:06.700
OVER WIDE PORTIONS OF THESE

21:06.700 --> 21:10.267
COUNTRIES, PEOPLE HAVE A MEAL BE

21:10.267 --> 21:12.600
IN THE EVENING.

21:12.600 --> 21:16.633
THEY GO OUT AND SMOKE WATER

21:16.633 --> 21:18.667
PIPES, DRINK COFFEE, SMOKING IS

21:18.667 --> 21:20.400
TOTALLY PROHIBITED AND ALSO,

21:20.400 --> 21:22.767
IT'S SURPRISING IF YOU GO TO ANY

21:22.767 --> 21:23.933
MUSLIM COUNTRY IN THE MIDDLE

21:23.933 --> 21:24.967
EAST AND RESIDENTS ARE STILL

21:24.967 --> 21:27.067
WITH PEOPLE, FAMILIES, CHILDREN,

21:27.067 --> 21:29.900
BREAKING THEIR MEAL, THIS IS

21:29.900 --> 21:30.367
PROHIBITED.

21:30.367 --> 21:33.533
SO THE ATMOSPHERE IS IN A WAY

21:33.533 --> 21:34.867
DEPRESSING AND MISERABLE.

21:34.867 --> 21:37.600
>> SO IS ALL OF THIS AN ATTEMPT

21:37.600 --> 21:39.367
TO SHOW THE PEOPLE INSIDE THIS

21:39.367 --> 21:40.567
REGION THAT THEY HAVE THE

21:40.567 --> 21:41.767
ABILITY TO CONTROL OR GOVERN?

21:41.767 --> 21:45.533
>> THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO

21:45.533 --> 21:49.367
SAY AND THEY'RE TRYING TO SHOW

21:49.367 --> 21:52.100
THEY IMPLEMENT A VERY SICK

21:52.100 --> 21:53.433
INTERPRETATION.

21:53.433 --> 21:54.967
THEY CLAIM THIS IS THE ONLY

21:54.967 --> 21:56.933
RIGHT INTERPRETATION, ONLY LIKE

21:56.933 --> 21:58.533
TASK AND WHAT THE OTHERS DOING

21:58.533 --> 22:00.300
IS WRONG.

22:00.300 --> 22:04.800
AGAIN, THEY SIMPLY KILL WHOEVER

22:04.800 --> 22:06.333
SAYS, ANY TIME OF CRITICISM OR

22:06.333 --> 22:07.500
OPPOSITION.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.100
FOR THEM THEY ARE RIGHT AND ALL

22:09.100 --> 22:10.833
THE OTHERS ARE WRONG.

22:10.833 --> 22:14.067
ALL RIGHT, ASSOCIATED PRESS

22:14.067 --> 22:18.533
REPORTER BASSEM MROUE, JOINS US,
