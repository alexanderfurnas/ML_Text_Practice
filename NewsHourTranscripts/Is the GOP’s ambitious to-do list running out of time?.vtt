JUDY WOODRUFF: Members
of Congress returned to
Washington today for what
could be a make-or-break

00:04.733 --> 00:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
few weeks for Republicans'
packed agenda, that as the
Russia investigations and the

00:11.666 --> 00:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
upcoming testimony of former
FBI Director James Comey
continue to add complications

00:16.433 --> 00:17.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for the party.

00:17.700 --> 00:19.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Lisa Desjardins reports.

00:19.366 --> 00:21.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: The Senate
will come to order.

00:21.533 --> 00:22.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: From
the Senate floor...

00:22.666 --> 00:23.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Good morning.

00:23.666 --> 00:25.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This hearing will come to order.

00:25.666 --> 00:29.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: ... to
committee rooms, to Capitol Hill
hallways, congress is back from

00:30.833 --> 00:33.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
recess, and facing big
issues with little time.

00:33.766 --> 00:37.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senate Republicans are at
a pivotal point, trying to
write their health care bill.

00:37.700 --> 00:39.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:39.733 --> 00:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: We had another of
our ongoing discussions about

00:41.766 --> 00:43.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the way forward on health care.

00:43.800 --> 00:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're getting closer to having
a proposal that we will be
bringing up in the near future.

00:50.566 --> 00:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: They would
like a vote this month, but
Democrats point out Republican

00:53.366 --> 00:56.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
senators don't yet have a plan
with enough votes on their own.

00:56.966 --> 00:59.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:59.033 --> 01:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: I have a message for
our Republican colleagues.

01:01.633 --> 01:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's very simple: Abandon
repeal, stop sabotaging
our health care system,
and you will find

01:06.766 --> 01:11.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Democrats waiting to
work with you to improve
the health care system.

01:11.200 --> 01:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The White
House, meanwhile, stressed the
will on health care, but not

01:15.533 --> 01:17.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the way.

01:17.533 --> 01:19.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House
Press Secretary: By and large,
every elected Republican in

01:19.200 --> 01:21.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the House and the Senate
campaigned on this for
the last seven years.

01:21.666 --> 01:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But with health
care still unfinished, that
means a backed-up GOP agenda,

01:28.600 --> 01:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with infrastructure, tax reform,
spending bills, not to mention
raising the debt ceiling,

01:33.233 --> 01:35.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all needing attention
soon in order to pass.

01:35.300 --> 01:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: What a great team
this is, what an unbelievable

01:37.933 --> 01:40.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
team.

01:40.033 --> 01:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: All of that
brought the GOP's key leaders,
House and Senate, to the White

01:42.400 --> 01:44.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
House to meet with
President Trump today.

01:44.466 --> 01:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: So we're working
very hard on massive tax
cuts, and we're working very,

01:48.833 --> 01:52.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
very hard on the health care.

01:52.033 --> 01:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think we're going
to have some very pleasant
surprises for a lot of people.

01:54.866 --> 01:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But even this
meeting had a nod to fired
FBI Director James Comey's

01:59.400 --> 02:00.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
big hearing this week.

02:00.700 --> 02:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I wish him luck.

02:01.666 --> 02:03.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you, everybody.

02:03.733 --> 02:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And the cloud
that continues to hang over
the president's own agenda.

02:06.633 --> 02:09.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
Lisa joins me now.

02:09.133 --> 02:11.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She is joined by
our own John Yang.

02:11.433 --> 02:12.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Great to have both of you here.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, John, I'm going
the start with you.

02:14.666 --> 02:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You just heard Lisa's
reporting about what
they're doing on the hill.

02:17.033 --> 02:19.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What is the White House
trying to do right now?

02:19.133 --> 02:23.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, right now,
they're pushing infrastructure
this week, yesterday, airways,

02:25.766 --> 02:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tomorrow, waterways, Thursday,
highways and streets,
Friday, permitting process.

02:28.833 --> 02:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, you might think that
means they have got an
infrastructure bill ready to go.

02:32.400 --> 02:34.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

02:34.100 --> 02:36.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This is concepts,
it's proposals, it's
broad policy ideas.

02:36.833 --> 02:40.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They really don't have
a timeline yet of when
they think they will
have an infrastructure

02:40.600 --> 02:43.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bill ready to
introduce in Congress.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't even know yet
whether it will be one bill or a
series of legislative packages.

02:47.866 --> 02:49.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're still on
the drawing board.

02:49.166 --> 02:50.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sounds
like it's still early.

02:50.633 --> 02:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Lisa, talk specifically
about the time crunch.

02:53.566 --> 02:55.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What is Congress
dealing with here?

02:55.633 --> 02:58.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think
Congress is looking at
essentially a 60-yard
field goal to try

02:58.866 --> 03:00.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and get everything
done that it has to.

03:00.766 --> 03:02.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It has to be perfect.

03:02.800 --> 03:06.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look at the calendar, what
Congress and Republicans
hoped to do this year.

03:06.166 --> 03:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is what they wanted to
happen, have health care passed
in February and March and then

03:10.233 --> 03:11.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tax reform.

03:11.433 --> 03:13.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We should be talking
about a bill right now.

03:13.366 --> 03:14.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what they wanted.

03:14.800 --> 03:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's look at what's
actually happened instead.

03:17.400 --> 03:20.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The calendar now instead
has health care now.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Obviously, that wasn't
passed until May.

03:22.300 --> 03:24.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And then Senate is
dealing with it now.

03:24.166 --> 03:26.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So what's happened
to tax reform?

03:26.200 --> 03:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, that's been kicked back
because we see the debt ceiling
and the spending bill coming

03:30.033 --> 03:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up this summer, further jamming
the calendar, meaning tax
reform might be pushed back to

03:34.766 --> 03:36.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the fall, Judy.

03:36.800 --> 03:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as John said, this is
one reason there's not a
timeline for infrastructure.

03:40.266 --> 03:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It simply doesn't fit, and
it's not clear that all
these things fit either.

03:44.233 --> 03:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're never seen Congress
be able to get this much
done in that amount of time.

03:48.366 --> 03:51.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, John, as Lisa
is suggesting, in addition to
infrastructure, there is more

03:51.966 --> 03:53.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that the White House
wants to get through.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: That's right.

03:55.566 --> 03:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They want -- they have got two
things on their wish list, one
thing on their must-do list.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the wish list, they want
to get a health care vote
before the August recess.

04:01.666 --> 04:05.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They of course had hoped
to have that done by now.

04:05.266 --> 04:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, as Lisa has pointed
out, they want the tax bill
introduced after Labor Day.

04:11.433 --> 04:14.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They were hoping to have
that passed by August.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The must-do list, they
have got to raise the
debt ceiling, big debate
inside the administration,

04:18.300 --> 04:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do you do that clean with
nothing attached to it, or do
you have spending cuts and other

04:25.266 --> 04:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spending reforms in order
to get conservatives, fiscal
conservatives to vote for it?

04:28.666 --> 04:33.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So,
Lisa, again, back to the
Hill, when Republican
leaders hear all this,

04:33.466 --> 04:35.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how do they think they can get
it done, or do they really?

04:35.866 --> 04:39.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes,
reality is a tricky concept
right now on Capitol Hill.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But this is what I have gotten
from sources that I trust.

04:41.400 --> 04:45.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They believe there will
be a Senate vote on
health care before August.

04:45.333 --> 04:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, there's big questions over
whether the House and Senate
will come together on a health

04:49.333 --> 04:50.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
care package after that.

04:50.766 --> 04:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's very much in question.

04:53.200 --> 04:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tax reform, people are openly
talking now that they're not
sure that they can actually

04:57.433 --> 04:58.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
get that done.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm hearing voices in the
Republican Party saying...

05:00.166 --> 05:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This year or...

05:02.200 --> 05:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This year,
and maybe not in the next
cycle, because there's so much

05:05.300 --> 05:07.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
heavy lifting.

05:07.433 --> 05:11.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're now even starting to
say maybe that becomes a tax
cut, instead of sweeping tax

05:11.066 --> 05:13.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
reform.

05:13.100 --> 05:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, meantime,
John, at the White House,
the president is saying some

05:16.300 --> 05:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things, his aides and
spokespeople are sometimes
- - in fact, often saying
something different.

05:23.266 --> 05:26.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Well, on the
legislative process,
he keeps talking as if
health care is ready

05:26.133 --> 05:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for a vote in the Senate.

05:28.200 --> 05:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He talks about it as if the
tax reform, the tax cut bill is
ready for a vote in the Senate,

05:32.233 --> 05:33.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and everything is
just two weeks.

05:33.700 --> 05:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In two weeks, we're going
to have a great plan.

05:36.033 --> 05:38.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But this is put off
well into the future.

05:38.333 --> 05:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, in fact,
Lisa, we were talking about
this earlier, what the president

05:42.800 --> 05:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is saying, John is reporting
in some of these expectations
that he's putting out there and

05:49.766 --> 05:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tweeting about, including
about other subjects, that then
members of Congress, leadership

05:54.900 --> 05:57.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have to react to, all of that is
having an effect on the agenda.

05:57.266 --> 05:59.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

05:59.300 --> 06:01.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, until now, many
Republicans have been able to
shrug it off, as much as they

06:01.466 --> 06:03.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
themselves were
frustrated by it.

06:03.566 --> 06:08.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But today, Judy, Senator Bob
Corker, generally a Trump ally,
was literally speechless when

06:09.900 --> 06:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he was told about the
president's tweet about Qatar.

06:12.033 --> 06:16.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, I also have to say,
though, even though I
think these distractions
are actually affecting

06:16.533 --> 06:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the agenda now, something
bigger than that still is
that Republicans can't agree.

06:21.033 --> 06:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's still the basic problem.

06:23.100 --> 06:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans in the House and
Senate and in the White House
have not come up with plans

06:26.533 --> 06:27.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on these items.

06:27.766 --> 06:29.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's still the
