JUDY WOODRUFF: As we reported
earlier, President Trump took
steps to roll back some parts of

00:04.666 --> 00:09.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Obama administration's
opening to Cuba, which began
two-and-a-half years ago.

00:11.100 --> 00:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Yang reports now on what's
out and what stays in effect.

00:17.600 --> 00:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: President Trump
made the announcement
in Miami's Little Havana
before an enthusiastic

00:21.700 --> 00:23.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
crowd in a packed auditorium.

00:23.666 --> 00:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of
the United States: Effective
immediately, I am canceling the

00:27.433 --> 00:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
last administration's completely
one-sided deal with Cuba.

00:33.966 --> 00:35.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

00:35.966 --> 00:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: While the president's
action falls short of canceling,
he said it fulfills a

00:39.133 --> 00:43.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
campaign promise to
undo President Obama's
re-engagement with Cuba.

00:43.766 --> 00:46.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, Former President
of the United States: Today,
the United States of America

00:46.366 --> 00:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is changing its relationship
with the people of Cuba.

00:49.266 --> 00:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In December 2014, Mr.
Obama restored diplomatic ties
with the island nation, after

00:55.166 --> 00:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more than 50 years of hostility.

00:58.433 --> 01:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In March 2016, he became the
first U.S. president to visit
Cuba in nearly a century.

01:05.366 --> 01:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump says his
focus is halting the flow of
U.S. dollars to the communist

01:09.233 --> 01:11.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government.

01:11.300 --> 01:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Our policy will
seek a much better deal for
the Cuban people and for the

01:16.100 --> 01:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
United States of America.

01:18.200 --> 01:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We do not want U.S. dollars to
prop up a military monopoly that
exploits and abuses the citizens

01:24.233 --> 01:26.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of Cuba.

01:26.300 --> 01:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The new policy bans
transactions with enterprises,
including hotels and other

01:29.933 --> 01:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tourist-related businesses,
ultimately owned by
the Cuban military.

01:34.300 --> 01:39.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump is also reinstating
a rule that restricts
individual travel, and requires

01:41.300 --> 01:44.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most visits to Cuba to be
in group tours organized
by American companies.

01:46.500 --> 01:49.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the policy continues
direct commercial flights
between the two countries.

01:51.833 --> 01:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The administration will also
maintain the U.S. Embassy
in Havana, but still with no

01:55.366 --> 01:56.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ambassador.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
In Havana today, Cubans reacted.

01:58.866 --> 02:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
Trump's words simply
seem a bit ambiguous.

02:02.800 --> 02:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the governments want the
best for both the Cuban and
American people, they have to

02:06.866 --> 02:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
look out for the common things
that exist between the two.

02:09.933 --> 02:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): If
definitely feels like a huge
setback in the relationship

02:14.733 --> 02:16.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
between Cuba and
the United States.

02:16.800 --> 02:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will see what happens, but,
right now, I think it's like
going back to the Cold War.

02:20.966 --> 02:25.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: None of the
changes will take effect
until the U.S. Treasury
and Commerce Departments

02:27.133 --> 02:30.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
issue new regulations,
which could take months.

02:30.833 --> 02:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more on the revised policy,
and how it's being understood
in Cuba, we turn to Alan

02:35.300 --> 02:38.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Gomez of USA Today, who
joins us from Havana.

02:38.900 --> 02:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Alan, thanks for being with us.

02:41.400 --> 02:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We heard in the tape
piece a little smattering
of some reaction from
the streets of Havana,

02:46.666 --> 02:48.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but I know you have been
out reporting today.

02:48.666 --> 02:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are you hearing
from average Cubans in
Havana about this change?

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ, USA Today: I mean,
it's been a level of confusion,
of sadness, of disgust,

02:57.800 --> 02:58.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of anger.

02:58.800 --> 03:00.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You know, just imagine.

03:00.933 --> 03:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These people have lived here for
decades without any interaction
with the United States, with

03:04.600 --> 03:07.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the U.S. just treating
them as an enemy and
closing off to them.

03:07.766 --> 03:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, two-and-a-half years
ago, they get this opening, and
they talk about this period,

03:12.033 --> 03:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
already in the past tense, as
this glorious period where they
were able to have more Americans

03:16.866 --> 03:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
down here, interact with them
more, and visit the U.S. more.

03:19.866 --> 03:24.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now Trump has taken it
not all away, but has really
cut that back significantly.

03:24.566 --> 03:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, yes, there's a lot of anger
here right now and a lot of
confusion over why it's being

03:30.033 --> 03:32.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
done.

03:32.033 --> 03:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: How have they
talked about how their lives
have changed, what difference

03:34.900 --> 03:36.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this past two years
has been to them?

03:36.966 --> 03:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ: Well, understand,
Cuba, the state-run economy, you
only get a certain salary from

03:41.766 --> 03:43.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the government.

03:43.133 --> 03:44.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You only get certain
benefits from the government.

03:44.933 --> 03:48.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So what they rely on so heavily
across the board is tourism.

03:48.866 --> 03:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what it's done is infused a
whole lot of Americans down here
over these past two-and-a-half

03:54.366 --> 03:56.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

03:56.366 --> 03:59.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So you think about everybody
from private restaurant owners,
to private taxies, to tour

03:59.666 --> 04:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
guides, all these people that
interact with Americans, they're
all the ones that are getting

04:03.500 --> 04:05.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that benefit directly.

04:05.500 --> 04:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump talked a lot
today about how all of the money
that's been going down over

04:09.433 --> 04:13.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
these last couple of
years is going straight
to the Cuban government.

04:13.733 --> 04:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I can tell you, from being
down here quite a bit over the
last couple of years and talking

04:16.833 --> 04:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to folks today, that
they are saying that,
no, they get a lot of it.

04:20.433 --> 04:24.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, of course some of it goes
to the government, but they're
upset that, to punish the Cuban

04:24.866 --> 04:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government, they're the ones
that are getting hurt as well.

04:27.233 --> 04:28.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: How
will they get hurt?

04:28.700 --> 04:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How will life change for them
under these changed rules?

04:32.733 --> 04:35.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALAN GOMEZ: Well, it's
a combination of things.

04:35.533 --> 04:38.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's, quite simply, fewer
American tourists are going to
be able to make the trip because

04:38.900 --> 04:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the way that the Trump
administration is going
to change the visa system.

04:43.100 --> 04:46.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is going to be a lot
harder for American tourists
now to get to the U.S.

04:46.866 --> 04:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, if you're an
American and want to come down
to Cuba, hop online, you can

04:51.533 --> 04:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
figure out your trip, and you
can pretty much get your visa
at the airport counter on your

04:55.066 --> 04:57.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
way down here.

04:57.133 --> 04:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now they are going to go back
to the old way, where you have
to apply beforehand to the

04:59.900 --> 05:02.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
federal government, get
approval to go down.

05:02.366 --> 05:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the people down
here in Cuba are just
expecting that that torrent
of American visitors

05:08.266 --> 05:09.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is going to dry up.

05:09.533 --> 05:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And then there's another aspect.

05:11.533 --> 05:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are just all these
private business owners that
have had a lot of interaction

05:13.566 --> 05:17.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the last few years, going
to the United States, working
with U.S. businesspeople,

05:17.466 --> 05:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
getting training in the
United States and bringing
those lessons back to Cuba.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so they're worried that that
is going to be limited as well.

05:23.133 --> 05:26.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Alan, in the
less than a minute we
have left, I want to ask
you about a development

05:26.300 --> 05:28.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on your regular beat,
which is immigration.

05:28.933 --> 05:33.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Trump administration
announced last night
that they were going to
keep the program that

05:33.833 --> 05:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
protects from deportation
undocumented immigrants
who came as children.

05:40.766 --> 05:44.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president during the
campaign said he was going do
away with that, he was going

05:44.200 --> 05:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to change that Obama policy.

05:46.933 --> 05:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you make of this,
deciding to keep this?

05:49.500 --> 05:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ: What the
president did was pretty
much eliminate a program
that would have protected

05:53.133 --> 05:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their parents from deportation.

05:55.300 --> 05:59.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That program, there's
no immediate effect of
that, because all --
that program had been

05:59.466 --> 06:01.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on hold in the courts
for some time now.

06:01.766 --> 06:06.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But what it does is, it
means that those parents
are never going to get
any sort of legal status

06:06.466 --> 06:08.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
under this president.

06:08.533 --> 06:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, more than that, it means
that those children that have
been protected from deportation

06:11.633 --> 06:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
under the Deferred Action for
Childhood Arrivals program, now
they are worried that they are

06:15.366 --> 06:17.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to have that
taken away from them.

06:17.900 --> 06:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Although, in the
president's announcement,
or the administration
announcement last night,

06:20.233 --> 06:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they specifically said that
that program would remain,
would remain in place.

06:26.766 --> 06:28.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Alan Gomez of USA Today
from Havana, Cuba,
thanks for joining us.

06:28.833 --> 06:29.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALAN GOMEZ: Thank you.
