JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.440 --> 00:11.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Lacking votes,
House Republicans delay
Thursday's planned

00:11.478 --> 00:14.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vote to repeal and replace
Obamacare.

00:14.748 --> 00:20.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: calls for an independent
investigation
after the Republican chairman of
the House

00:20.454 --> 00:25.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Intelligence Committee goes
directly to the
White House with a report of
surveillance

00:25.692 --> 00:27.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on President Trump.

00:27.995 --> 00:33.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Making Sense and making
money, online
betting's fascination with
President Donald

00:33.867 --> 00:35.502 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

00:35.535 --> 00:38.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PADDY POWER, Paddy Power:
There's 100 open
bets on Trump, different markets
on Trump

00:38.238 --> 00:41.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the moment. The politics
trader literally
can't handle the volume, so
we're hiring a

00:41.808 --> 00:43.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump betting expert at the
moment.

00:43.677 --> 00:51.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:51.184 --> 00:53.954 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:53.987 --> 01:03.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In a setback for
President
Trump and congressional
Republicans, the plan

01:03.630 --> 01:08.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to hold a vote in the House of
Representatives
this evening on a replacement
for the Affordable

01:08.368 --> 01:12.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Care Act, also known as
Obamacare, has been
delayed.

01:12.372 --> 01:17.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have reporters at both the
White House
and Capitol Hill on today's
frenzied efforts

01:17.444 --> 01:19.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to win over GOP holdouts.

01:19.980 --> 01:22.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's start with Lisa Desjardins
at the Capitol.

01:22.582 --> 01:29.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: At the U.S.
Capitol, the
day began with empty space, the
room where

01:29.056 --> 01:34.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans had hoped to hold a
meeting of
all their members, and an empty
podium, where

01:34.428 --> 01:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Speaker Paul Ryan's usual
lunchtime news conference
was delayed.

01:39.299 --> 01:46.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rules Committee Chairman Pete
Sessions explained
in an unusually blunt update
about the GOP

01:46.173 --> 01:47.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
leaders' health care bill.

01:47.975 --> 01:53.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PETE SESSIONS (R), Texas:
We think we
have to make changes, but today
we are here

01:53.780 --> 01:57.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right now to say I don't have
all those answers.

01:57.117 --> 02:02.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And Republicans
also didn't
have the votes. And so, yet
again, members

02:02.122 --> 02:06.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the conservative House
Freedom Caucus went
to the White House to negotiate
with President

02:06.560 --> 02:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump. They had already won
concessions over
the weekend. The bill would cut
Medicaid spending

02:12.799 --> 02:19.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by at least $880 billion over
the next decade,
and now gives states the option
of cutting

02:19.639 --> 02:23.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Medicaid further, by possibly
adding work
requirements.

02:23.410 --> 02:29.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It also gives a lump tax credit
to recipients,
based largely on age. and it
would also end

02:29.516 --> 02:35.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the taxes in the Affordable Care
Act immediately.
But conservatives pressed for
additional changes

02:35.489 --> 02:40.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today. Specifically, they want
the bill to
cut the so-called essential
health benefits

02:40.560 --> 02:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
guaranteed by Obamacare. That
would mean insurers
would no longer have to provide
coverage in

02:46.833 --> 02:51.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
areas like mental health,
maternity and prescription
drugs.

02:51.605 --> 02:56.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when the Freedom Caucus
returned from
the Capitol, swarmed by media...

02:56.443 --> 02:58.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION: Are you a yes yet?

02:58.078 --> 03:00.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: No, I'm not going to
address that.

03:00.247 --> 03:04.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: There was no
deal yet and
the first indications that there
wouldn't

03:04.584 --> 03:06.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be a vote either.

03:06.053 --> 03:07.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Michigan's Justin Amash:

03:07.821 --> 03:11.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. JUSTIN AMASH (R), Michigan:
We always
try to get to yes, but I think
it would be

03:11.058 --> 03:12.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
mistake to move forward today.

03:12.059 --> 03:13.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUESTION: Not today?

03:13.226 --> 03:14.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Freedom Caucus
Chairman Mark
Meadows:

03:15.028 --> 03:16.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. MARK MEADOWS (R), North
Carolina: I am
still a no at this time. I am
desperately

03:16.897 --> 03:21.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to get to yes. And I
think the president
knows that. I told him that
personally.

03:21.034 --> 03:25.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But the White
House was also
negotiating with moderate
Republicans, who

03:25.705 --> 03:30.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
openly oppose some of the
changes for conservatives
and the bill itself.

03:30.777 --> 03:35.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
As Republicans faced two
internal fronts,
Democrats stayed on the attack.

03:35.982 --> 03:40.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), House
Minority Leader:
Donald Trump may be a great
negotiator. Rookie's

03:40.253 --> 03:43.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
error for bringing this up on a
day you clearly
were not ready.

03:43.490 --> 03:48.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: House Minority
Leader Nancy
Pelosi made Republicans a kind
of offer.

03:48.128 --> 03:56.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. NANCY PELOSI: If this bill
were to fail
today, rookie day, I would I --
I stand ready

03:56.136 --> 04:03.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to negotiate with them on how we
can go forward,
incorporating some of their
ideas. This is

04:03.743 --> 04:08.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a bad day for them. It's bad if
they win and
it's bad if they lose.

04:08.548 --> 04:13.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The view from
the White House
podium could not have been more
different.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president's spokesman, Sean
Spicer:

04:15.122 --> 04:18.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
We have been very clear about
this is a priority

04:18.225 --> 04:22.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of ours and we worked with them.
But, again,
I go back to at the end of the
day we can't

04:22.963 --> 04:24.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
make people vote.

04:24.764 --> 04:28.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And at the end
of the day,
neither could Republican
leadership, pushing

04:28.335 --> 04:30.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
off the vote until at least
tomorrow.

04:30.637 --> 04:35.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Lisa is with
us now live
from the Capitol. And she's
joined by John

04:35.775 --> 04:37.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Yang, who is at the White House.

04:37.878 --> 04:40.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Lisa, how certain are they
that this vote
will be tomorrow?

04:41.014 --> 04:43.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: They're not
certain.

04:43.049 --> 04:47.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, the House, the man in
charge of scheduling,
House Majority Leader Kevin
McCarthy, is only

04:47.154 --> 04:51.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying that he hopes this vote
will happen
tomorrow. Tonight, the full
House Republican

04:51.958 --> 04:56.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Conference will meet, Judy. We
will have an
idea after that roughly of where
things stand.

04:56.530 --> 05:01.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, John, what
are they saying
at the White House? This
afternoon, the press

05:01.201 --> 05:05.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
secretary, Sean Spicer, was
sounding confident
this vote was coming, that they
had the votes.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That didn't work out.

05:07.774 --> 05:10.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, Judy, they
still say they
are confident when the vote
takes place, what

05:10.777 --> 05:15.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whenever that may be, they will
have the votes.
But it's clear behind the scenes
that they

05:15.182 --> 05:19.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't. They aren't there yet.
The president
is working the phones, we're
told. He was

05:19.319 --> 05:22.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
working the phones until
midnight last night.

05:22.522 --> 05:28.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had meetings today, as Lisa
reported, with
both conservatives and
moderates. They are

05:28.228 --> 05:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still working to get the votes
to get it through
the House. And, of course, after
they do that,

05:33.433 --> 05:35.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then they have got to work to
get it through
the Senate.

05:35.635 --> 05:40.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Lisa, pick
up on that.
I mean, talk about this, really
a dilemma

05:40.473 --> 05:46.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Republican leadership is
faced with. They
are trying to appeal both to
moderates and

05:46.046 --> 05:49.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to conservatives at the same
time, and each
side wants something different.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

05:51.818 --> 05:55.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Initially, House leaders thought
they could
offer something to conservatives
that wouldn't

05:55.622 --> 05:59.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be a problem for moderates. But
they have
gone past that point. Now, for
everything

05:59.659 --> 06:03.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they offer conservatives, every
essential
health benefit, for example,
that may come

06:04.030 --> 06:09.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of this bill in some form,
that is something
that moderates see as a loss for
their constituents.

06:09.669 --> 06:12.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Moderates are worried about
coverage. Everyone
is worried about coverage. Let's
say this.

06:12.872 --> 06:16.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as a matter of priorities,
moderates
are worried about coverage and
people covered.

06:16.610 --> 06:20.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The conservatives are worried
about how much
government is involved, how much
government

06:20.180 --> 06:21.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is spending here.

06:21.982 --> 06:26.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so every dime that you take
off the table,
moderates see that as a coverage
loss. And

06:26.686 --> 06:28.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's a real dilemma for
Republicans.

06:28.521 --> 06:32.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, if it is a
dilemma for
Republicans on the Hill, John,
it's certainly

06:32.158 --> 06:39.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a problem for the White House.
How are they
approaching this divided set of
needs or demands

06:39.366 --> 06:41.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
coming from Republican members?

06:41.268 --> 06:45.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, you know, the
president is
not an ideological president.
He's less worried

06:45.372 --> 06:50.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the ideological issues
here. He's worried
about getting to yes, getting to
the votes

06:50.210 --> 06:52.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they need to get this through
Congress.

06:52.912 --> 06:57.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The message that you are hearing
from the
White House is that the House
Republicans,

06:57.651 --> 07:02.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recalcitrant House Republicans ,
is, this
is something you campaigned on,
this is something

07:02.289 --> 07:05.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you promised your voters, now is
the time.

07:05.325 --> 07:10.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sean Spicer today had some
pretty tough words,
reminding House Republicans of
all the -- quote

07:10.263 --> 07:17.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- "free votes" they took to
repeal Obamacare,
knowing that President Obama
would veto those

07:17.504 --> 07:22.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bills. But now he said it's a
live ball. In
other words -- and this is my
interpretation

07:22.709 --> 07:25.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Sean's words -- it's time to
put up or
shut up.

07:25.779 --> 07:30.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now, Lisa, in
the middle
of all of this, late this
afternoon, the Congressional

07:30.450 --> 07:37.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Budget Office has come out with
another calculation,
if you will, of the fiscal
impact of this

07:37.424 --> 07:42.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bill as it was being modified,
tweaked.

07:42.162 --> 07:47.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's interesting. The
numbers have just
as many people losing coverage,
and yet a

07:47.300 --> 07:49.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
smaller decrease in the size of
the deficit.

07:50.003 --> 07:53.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.
Essentially,
the CBO is saying that
Republicans with their

07:53.506 --> 07:58.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
changes are spending more money.
They still
ultimately would shave a little
off the deficit,

07:58.778 --> 08:03.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about $150 billion, but that's
less than they
would have saved in their
initial version.

08:03.516 --> 08:07.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The CBO is saying, even though
the price tag
has gone up on this bill, there
are not more

08:07.554 --> 08:11.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people covered. Now, one reason
for that,
Judy -- this gets a little wonky
-- is the

08:11.091 --> 08:16.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way that the House did this,
they offered
a new tax deduction, but really
that money

08:16.096 --> 08:19.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is meant for the Senate to spend
later to
add coverage.

08:19.733 --> 08:23.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it may not -- it may be a
bit of a false
read. Either way, we know that
many millions

08:24.003 --> 08:27.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wouldn't be covered under this
Republican
health care bill.

08:27.107 --> 08:31.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to pick up on something that
John was
saying, I talked to one
Republican here. This

08:31.144 --> 08:35.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a test for the White House.
But Tom Cole
of Oklahoma, a deputy whip, told
me, this

08:35.715 --> 08:39.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is a test over whether
Republicans can move
from being an opposition party
to being a

08:39.953 --> 08:43.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
governing party. He said, we
still have to
pass that test.

08:43.323 --> 08:46.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally,
John, what do
they say at the White House?
What is your

08:46.993 --> 08:48.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
read on what is at stake for
them?

08:48.862 --> 08:51.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, there's a lot
at stake. Not
only is this the first
legislative initiative

08:52.031 --> 08:57.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the president's part. Not
only does he
say this would clear the way for
tax -- the

08:57.203 --> 09:02.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tax cut legislation and the
infrastructure
legislation to come that he
promises this

09:02.041 --> 09:08.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
year, but also this is a
president whose whole
image is based on success and
deal-making.

09:08.615 --> 09:13.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if he fails on his first
time out, the
question is whether that image
is tarnished.

09:13.420 --> 09:18.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, all eyes
are on the places
where the two of you are
tonight. John Yang

09:18.858 --> 09:23.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
at the White House, Lisa
Desjardins at the
Capitol, thank you both.

09:23.530 --> 09:29.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the day's other news:
British police
identified the man who drove a
car into pedestrians

09:29.469 --> 09:34.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
near Parliament yesterday, and
fatally stabbed
a police officer, before being
shot to death

09:34.941 --> 09:38.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
himself. Officials called it a
lone wolf attack.

09:38.378 --> 09:41.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paul Davies of Independent
Television News
reports from London.

09:41.815 --> 09:48.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL DAVIES: We know what he
did. We now know
his name. The man on the
stretcher, the man

09:48.154 --> 09:53.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who launched his own attack on
democracy yesterday
was Khalid Masood. He had been
living in the

09:53.960 --> 10:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
West Midlands, where he hired
the car he used
as a lethal weapon. He was born
in Kent. The

10:00.200 --> 10:04.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so-called Islamic State say he
had become
one of their soldiers.

10:04.337 --> 10:10.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, because of his actions,
flags were
flying at half-mast over
Parliament, while

10:10.043 --> 10:16.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
side-by-side a painstaking
investigation into
an act of terror was being
conducted, as the

10:16.182 --> 10:21.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
workings of the democracy he had
come to hate
were continuing. The prime
minister left Downing

10:21.821 --> 10:25.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Street heading for the Commons
in a show of
business as usual.

10:25.625 --> 10:31.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THERESA MAY, British Prime
Minister: We are
not afraid. And our resolve will
never waiver

10:31.297 --> 10:33.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the face of terrorism.

10:33.132 --> 10:38.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL DAVIES: There has been a
huge and deliberate
effort to reflect life as normal
here, an

10:38.538 --> 10:43.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
impression that's been supported
by the reopening
of the bridge that was the scene
of carnage

10:43.643 --> 10:45.512 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
yesterday.

10:45.545 --> 10:51.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Aysha Frade, a 43-year-old who
worked at a
school in London, and Kirk
Cochran, a 54-year-old

10:51.518 --> 10:57.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American tourist, had been named
as the two
pedestrians knocked down and
killed yesterday.

10:57.657 --> 11:02.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Seven others who were injured by
the terrorist
car as it crossed Westminster
Bridge are still

11:03.029 --> 11:06.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
said to be in critical
condition.

11:06.499 --> 11:11.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They include a Romanian woman
seen in this
footage falling into the Thames
as she tried

11:11.771 --> 11:18.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to avoid the vehicle. Last
night, police raided
properties in London, Wales and
here in Birmingham,

11:18.311 --> 11:21.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an operation that has continued
through today.

11:21.881 --> 11:27.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This evening,
another victim
of the attack died of her
injuries.

11:27.387 --> 11:33.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Israel, police arrested a
Jewish teenager
today, and said he's the main
suspect in dozens

11:33.192 --> 11:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of bomb threats against Jewish
community centers
in the U.S. The man also holds
U.S. citizenship.

11:39.699 --> 11:44.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He covered his face with a
sweatshirt at a
court hearing near Tel Aviv. His
lawyer said

11:44.871 --> 11:46.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he has behavioral problems.

11:46.739 --> 11:51.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GALIT BASH, Attorney: This is a
young person,
that because of his very, very
serious medical

11:51.344 --> 11:58.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
condition, didn't serve in the
army, didn't
go to high school, and didn't go
to elementary

11:58.117 --> 12:04.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
school. So, that is why the
medical condition
can actually affect the
investigation.

12:04.991 --> 12:09.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's unclear what
the suspect's
motive might have been. His
identity is being

12:09.829 --> 12:12.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
withheld by order of the court.

12:12.532 --> 12:16.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The chairman of the Intelligence
Committee
in the House of Representatives
apologized

12:16.669 --> 12:22.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
today, after publicly
disclosing, and sharing
with the president, intelligence
intercepts

12:22.275 --> 12:27.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Trump transition team.
Devin Nunes
announced yesterday that these
occurred during

12:27.380 --> 12:30.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
legal surveillance of foreign
nationals.

12:30.550 --> 12:35.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This and his briefing of the
president came
without first telling committee
Democrats.

12:35.455 --> 12:38.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, Nunes said it was a
judgment call.

12:38.391 --> 12:42.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a Democrat on the committee,
California's
Jackie Speier, said that's not
enough.

12:42.528 --> 12:46.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REP. JACKIE SPEIER (D),
California: He just
apologized. He didn't specify
what his apology

12:46.933 --> 12:56.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was about. He knows full well
that there is
grave question about his
objectivity. And

12:56.876 --> 13:02.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think over next few days,
we're going to
assess whether or not we feel
confident that

13:02.582 --> 13:04.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he can continue in that role.

13:04.517 --> 13:09.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Democrats accused
Nunes of
trying to give Mr. Trump cover
for unsubstantiated

13:09.856 --> 13:15.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
claims that President Obama
wiretapped Trump
Tower. We will look into the
partisan fighting

13:15.695 --> 13:19.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over this, and what happens
next, after the
news summary.

13:19.966 --> 13:24.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson
has told
U.S. embassies to begin extreme
vetting of

13:24.570 --> 13:30.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
foreigners applying for visas.
Reuters quotes
diplomatic cables that ask U.S.
officials

13:30.443 --> 13:34.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to identify -- quote --
"populations warranting
increased scrutiny."

13:34.614 --> 13:40.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The report says Tillerson also
wants mandatory
social media checks for any
applicant who's

13:40.553 --> 13:44.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ever been in a territory
controlled by the
Islamic State group.

13:44.590 --> 13:50.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N. Refugee Agency is
warning that the
worst is yet to come for Iraqis
in Western

13:50.697 --> 13:57.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mosul. An estimated 400,000
civilians are
trapped in areas still
controlled by ISIS

13:57.970 --> 14:03.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fighters, as government troops
fight to recapture
the city. U.N. officials say
they're in desperate

14:03.509 --> 14:12.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need of food, medical aid and
basic supplies.
As many as 12,000 have been
fleeing each day.

14:12.251 --> 14:17.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats in the U.S. Senate
served notice
today that they will try to
block confirmation

14:17.123 --> 14:22.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the
Supreme Court.
Minority Leader Chuck Schumer
went to the

14:22.128 --> 14:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senate floor to announce his
opposition. He
also made clear that a
filibuster is coming.

14:27.366 --> 14:30.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY),
Minority Leader:
After careful deliberation, I
have concluded

14:30.670 --> 14:39.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that I cannot support Judge Neil
Gorsuch's
nomination to the Supreme Court.
His nomination

14:39.245 --> 14:47.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will have a cloture vote. He
will have to
earn 60 votes for confirmation.
My vote will

14:47.053 --> 14:51.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be no. And I urge my colleagues
to do the
same.

14:51.591 --> 14:56.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Under the current
rule, majority
Republicans would need to peel
off at least

14:56.062 --> 15:01.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eight Democrats to get to 60
votes. Or they
can scrap that rule, allowing
Gorsuch to be

15:01.534 --> 15:04.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
confirmed by a simple majority.

15:04.036 --> 15:08.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, the judge's
confirmation hearings
wrapped up today, with lawyers,
advocacy groups

15:08.941 --> 15:13.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and others getting their say
about Gorsuch,
for and against.

15:13.813 --> 15:18.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street, the delay of
the health
care vote in the House wiped out
an early

15:18.551 --> 15:25.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rally. The Dow Jones industrial
average lost
four points to close at 20656.
The Nasdaq

15:25.691 --> 15:29.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fell about four, and the S&amp;P 500
slipped two.

15:29.729 --> 15:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
calls for
an independent investigation
after the chair

15:34.033 --> 15:39.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the House Intelligence
Committee apologizes
for going straight to the White
House; more

15:39.472 --> 15:48.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. troops on the ground in
Syria; the potential
impact of the Republican health
care plan;

15:48.614 --> 15:57.957 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and much more.

15:57.990 --> 16:02.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We return now to the controversy
created by
allegations that were made by
the chairman

16:02.728 --> 16:08.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the House Intelligence
Committee having
to do with surveillance of the
Trump transition.

16:08.668 --> 16:10.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has the story.

16:10.503 --> 16:13.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And for more
on all of this,
we turn to Matthew Rosenberg,
who has been

16:13.806 --> 16:15.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
following this for The New York
Times.

16:15.641 --> 16:20.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Matthew, the Intelligence
Committees both
on the House and the Senate side
have been

16:20.179 --> 16:25.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of these last bastions of
bipartisanship
and cooperation. What has been
happening in

16:25.151 --> 16:26.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the last 24 hours?

16:26.953 --> 16:30.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW ROSENBERG, The New York
Times: Well,
first, we had Devin Nunes going
public with

16:30.456 --> 16:37.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
information that people close to
Trump, he
had gleaned their names from
intercepts that

16:37.663 --> 16:41.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were passed around the previous
administration.
It was really unclear what
exactly he was

16:41.701 --> 16:43.436 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
saying.

16:43.469 --> 16:45.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then he went to the public. Then
he ran to
the White House to brief the
president before

16:45.771 --> 16:50.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he even told his own committee
members. And
for -- basically, for all the
Democrats on

16:50.576 --> 16:54.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the committee in the House, this
prompted
them to say, look, this
investigation is not

16:54.447 --> 16:59.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be independent. Mr.
Nunes is either
going to be a White House
surrogate or he's

16:59.051 --> 17:00.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to run an independent
investigation.

17:00.887 --> 17:05.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it really put into question
whether the
House could run an independent
investigation.

17:05.191 --> 17:09.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It also completely muddied the
waters. It
wasn't really clear what he was
talking about.

17:09.729 --> 17:16.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, when intelligence is
gathered, if the
U.S., the NSA or CIA are
listening to a foreign

17:16.068 --> 17:21.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
official, if an American is on
that, say,
calls them or an American is
discussed by

17:21.073 --> 17:25.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that official, that is called
incidental collection.
The American has been
incidentally swept up

17:25.611 --> 17:27.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into the intelligence gathering.

17:27.446 --> 17:31.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when that intelligence is
then spread
to other parts of the
government, their name

17:31.617 --> 17:35.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and identity is supposed to be
obscured. It
is called masked or minimized.

17:35.688 --> 17:40.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Nunes sort of suggested they
might have
been unmasked inappropriately.
But it's not

17:40.393 --> 17:44.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really clear. It is just -- it
is incredibly
confusing. That is part of the
problem here.

17:44.463 --> 17:48.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Nunes went and apologized
to his committee
members, but the damage was
really done here.

17:48.668 --> 17:52.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Most of the
work of these
committees happens behind closed
doors, not

17:52.338 --> 17:56.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in front of cameras and
microphones. When
a piece of information comes to
the committee,

17:56.909 --> 17:59.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how does it usually work its way
through,
and what happened this time?

17:59.345 --> 18:02.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW ROSENBERG: Well, what
tends to happen
is, the first thing they do is,
they brief

18:02.815 --> 18:04.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the rest of the committee on it.

18:04.817 --> 18:08.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And depending on what kind of
information
it is, it remains private. In
this case, this

18:08.554 --> 18:13.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is classified information. The
existence of
these intercepts is classified.
The contents

18:14.026 --> 18:15.828 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are obviously classified.

18:15.861 --> 18:19.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Nunes did two things here.
First, he didn't
even brief his fellow committee
members. He

18:19.966 --> 18:23.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just went out to the public and
then went
to the White House, which is, of
course, the

18:23.336 --> 18:25.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
subject of this investigation.

18:25.204 --> 18:28.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, at the same time, he
discussed classified
information publicly. And this
is a man who

18:28.274 --> 18:33.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has complained about leakers
extensively and
grilled the FBI director about
prosecuting

18:33.779 --> 18:35.581 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
leakers.

18:35.614 --> 18:38.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There are
three different
types of alternatives that are
being proposed.

18:38.317 --> 18:42.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some people ask for a special
prosecutor.
I think Senator Jack Reed was
calling for

18:42.388 --> 18:46.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that today. And then there are
folks that
say we need a 9/11-style special
commission.

18:46.492 --> 18:49.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then there's also people who
say, well,
let's take a select committee
approach that

18:50.029 --> 18:51.964 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
may be similar to what happened
with Benghazi.

18:51.998 --> 18:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is the likelihood of any of
those three?

18:54.033 --> 18:58.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW ROSENBERG: You know, at
this point,
everything I predict around here
doesn't go

18:58.270 --> 19:03.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right. So, I am hesitant to make
-- to kind
of put the odds on this one.

19:03.476 --> 19:07.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, you know, you are going
to have a
lot more Democrats pressing for
a truly independent

19:07.146 --> 19:11.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investigation, especially
because the FBI
is pursuing -- they're pursuing
their own

19:11.350 --> 19:14.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
counterintelligence
investigation, but there
is a criminal element to that.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think there are a lot of
people on the
Hill who would like to have an
investigation

19:17.857 --> 19:19.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that could bring charges if
necessary.

19:19.692 --> 19:23.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What this done
to the tension
that exists between the two
leaders of the

19:23.729 --> 19:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
committee? They have gone out of
their way
to make sure as this
investigation progressed

19:27.733 --> 19:31.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that this would be somewhat
cordial and that
they would be respectful of each
other trying

19:31.137 --> 19:32.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to get to the same end goal.

19:32.938 --> 19:35.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW ROSENBERG: And that is
what was sort
of amazing about what happened
yesterday,

19:35.941 --> 19:41.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that you are right. Mr.
Schiff -- Mr. Nunes
and his Democratic counterpart,
Adam Schiff,

19:41.680 --> 19:43.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had made this real show of
working together.

19:43.816 --> 19:48.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even at Monday's hearing,
the body language
between the two of them was
incredibly positive.

19:48.821 --> 19:53.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, yesterday, it seemed
to just blow
up. And it is not really clear
exactly what

19:53.392 --> 19:57.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happened there or why. But it
does seem that
there is a real lasting damage
there.

19:57.096 --> 20:01.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There was
calls from Senator
McCain on the Republican side,
and I think

20:01.667 --> 20:06.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joe Biden even tweeted where he
wrote, "Checks
and balances? Chair of committee
investigating

20:06.605 --> 20:11.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House can't share info
with White House.
McCain is right. Need select
committee."

20:11.510 --> 20:13.446 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that gaining any momentum?

20:13.479 --> 20:20.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW ROSENBERG: It's hard to
say right
now. The House has been deep
into the health

20:20.753 --> 20:25.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
care bill over the last
day-and-a-half. The
Senate is obviously dealing with
the Gorsuch

20:26.025 --> 20:27.760 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nomination.

20:27.793 --> 20:31.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think we're going to see
in the next
few days where this goes, as
those issues

20:31.397 --> 20:35.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fade and this issue comes back.
And there
are supposed to be more hearings
next week

20:35.101 --> 20:36.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by the House Intelligence
Committee.

20:36.869 --> 20:39.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Matthew Rosenberg
of The New York Times, thanks so
much.

20:39.672 --> 20:45.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATTHEW ROSENBERG: Thank you.

20:45.211 --> 20:56.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

20:56.188 --> 21:02.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
betting on the
Trump presidency; exploring how
memories can

21:02.061 --> 21:09.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shape our present lives; and a
Brief But Spectacular
take on slam poetry.

21:09.602 --> 21:15.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: how the Republican
bill could change
insurance coverage and costs, if
its core

21:15.107 --> 21:16.976 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ideas become law.

21:17.009 --> 21:21.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our team has traveled across the
country to
capture the stories and the
voices of those

21:21.714 --> 21:23.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who could be most impacted.

21:23.716 --> 21:26.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have two of those profiles
tonight.

21:26.085 --> 21:31.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We start with the perspective of
a small business
owner and her employees in
Zanesville, Ohio.

21:32.024 --> 21:37.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She say she hopes that a new law
would offer
cheaper insurance options with
fewer required

21:37.696 --> 21:42.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
benefits. That's been the source
of much debate
today, and is a possible element
in health

21:42.468 --> 21:44.136 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
care's next act.

21:44.170 --> 21:47.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLY MOORE, Vice President, GKM
Auto Parts:
My name is Kelly Moore. And I am
the vice

21:47.473 --> 21:52.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president of GKM Auto Parts. We
operate as
a NAPA Auto Parts store.

21:52.645 --> 22:00.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before the ACA, we offered full
insurance,
as far as meaning that we paid
at that point

22:00.853 --> 22:06.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
80 percent of the premium. The
employees paid
20 percent of the premium. It
covered not

22:06.225 --> 22:12.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only their office cares and
their medical
and hospital, but also
prescription drug plan.

22:12.565 --> 22:17.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARIN LAWLER, Manager: My name
is Darin Lawler.
I'm 51. I have been with the
company for around

22:17.636 --> 22:19.471 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
seven years.

22:19.505 --> 22:25.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I first got here, I had
insurance for
my family and I through the
company, you know,

22:26.011 --> 22:31.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
relatively good insurance. We
had health care,
and we had dental. And it was
affordable.

22:31.650 --> 22:38.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLY MOORE: When the exchanges
opened, and
the Affordable Care Act came
into play, every

22:38.324 --> 22:45.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year, with the exception of one,
my insurance
went up double digits for the
first time ever.

22:45.631 --> 22:52.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We had mandates imposed on
everyone. And those
mandates made us cover things
that we wouldn't

22:52.304 --> 22:59.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
normally be necessarily involved
in. Suddenly,
we are having to cover things
like pregnancy

22:59.645 --> 23:06.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and other conditions that my
folks may not
need the coverage on.

23:06.385 --> 23:11.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so because we're having to
share that
mandate with everyone, our
coverage had to

23:12.024 --> 23:18.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go up. We had to scale back our
premium portion
from 80 percent to 70 percent
and then to

23:18.497 --> 23:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
60 percent in order to afford
it.

23:21.533 --> 23:27.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It got to the point for us as a
company that
it was no longer a benefit for
the employees.

23:27.206 --> 23:35.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARIN LAWLER: We were forced to
go on our
own, and it's -- affordable care
isn't very

23:35.114 --> 23:40.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
affordable. At this point right
now, my family
and I do not have insurance
because of the

23:40.719 --> 23:42.488 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
act.

23:42.521 --> 23:44.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're actively searching,
but we just
have not come up with anything
that we can

23:44.857 --> 23:46.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
afford at this point.

23:46.659 --> 23:50.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KELLY MOORE: It was
gut-wrenching to make
that decision, to pull that
trigger. I lost

23:50.262 --> 23:56.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sleep. I did everything I could.
I spent most
of my time at my desk, not doing
the other

23:56.802 --> 24:01.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
duties of my job, but rather
trying to crunch
numbers to find a way to offer
that insurance

24:01.874 --> 24:03.676 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
benefit.

24:03.709 --> 24:09.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARIN LAWLER: You could see it
in her eyes.
And she just -- just kind of the
way she talked.

24:09.915 --> 24:15.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just, it was upsetting to her.
And, you know,
it would be, because they have
always -- you

24:15.321 --> 24:21.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, that was one of the
things. We had decent
benefits here. And that was one
of the things

24:21.060 --> 24:24.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they can't do for us
anymore, and, you
know, it was hard on her.

24:24.763 --> 24:33.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLY MOORE: I hope that the
government steps
back a little more from the
business of offering

24:33.539 --> 24:41.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health care. I would like to see
health care
traded across state lines, the
way we do auto

24:41.146 --> 24:46.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
insurance, the way we can get
our business
insurance. I would like to see
fewer mandates

24:46.852 --> 24:48.220 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the program.

24:48.253 --> 24:52.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would love to offer insurance
again, when
it becomes affordable.

24:52.157 --> 24:57.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Affordability is
clearly a
big issue in the debate over the
health care

24:57.196 --> 24:58.964 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
replacement.

24:58.997 --> 25:03.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But so is the question of who's
covered. The
Republican bill would end the
expansion of

25:03.302 --> 25:08.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Medicaid over time, and would
phase out government
coverage for millions of people.

25:08.774 --> 25:14.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We visited a current Medicaid
recipient in
Shreveport, Louisiana, who got
coverage because

25:14.380 --> 25:18.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the Affordable Care Act and
is now worried
about what may happen.

25:18.050 --> 25:22.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA RAYE, Medicaid Expansion
Patient: My
name is Julia Raye. I'm 50 years
old, and

25:22.187 --> 25:24.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I live in Shreveport, Louisiana.

25:24.323 --> 25:31.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been unemployed for about
a year now,
and I will be starting a new job
in April

25:31.230 --> 25:41.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at a nonprofit. And while I was
unemployed,
I have relied solely on Medicaid
expansions,

25:41.940 --> 25:48.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and for my health conditions
with diabetes
and seizures.

25:48.113 --> 25:55.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am a chemist by degree, and I
have worked
for the CDC. I have worked for
EPA. I have

25:55.421 --> 26:02.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worked for FDA. And I never
planned to not
work, but then there have been
situations

26:02.561 --> 26:11.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in my life where the contractor,
the job ended,
and I needed insurance.

26:11.703 --> 26:16.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a time when I didn't
have any health
care coverage. I use two types
of insulin,

26:16.742 --> 26:22.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I would take the needles. I
would rinse
them out with alcohol, and then
I would reuse

26:22.147 --> 26:27.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the needles. And I remember
thinking, am I
getting the right dosage?

26:27.920 --> 26:39.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obamacare allowed me to get
medicine for whatever
illness it was I had. And,
without it, I wouldn't

26:39.765 --> 26:46.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be healthy enough to even have a
job.

26:46.438 --> 26:51.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Medicaid has been frustrating at
times. The
issues are, in some cases, there
might not

26:51.477 --> 26:58.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be a doctor that takes Medicaid
or that situation.
But make no mistake. It is -- it
is a blessing

26:58.283 --> 27:07.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to have Medicaid, and to be
medically assisted
by Medicaid.

27:07.326 --> 27:17.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As I hear the news about the
changes in Medicaid
for the future, I am very
excited about my

27:17.269 --> 27:26.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new job. But the job is, in all
essence, a
contract position. At some point
in time,

27:26.678 --> 27:36.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it may be that I -- this job
closes down,
and I find myself needing
insurance.

27:36.955 --> 27:43.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am worried that, what happens
if I have
no income, and that puts me at a
point where

27:43.929 --> 27:54.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I need Medicaid again? I mean,
at this point,
do I take the medicine that I
get now or that

27:54.506 --> 28:02.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I get in the future, and do I,
instead of
taking all my medicine, do I
take two of the

28:02.114 --> 28:07.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
three pills I'm supposed to
take, and start
stockpiling it, so that -- you
know, for a

28:07.119 --> 28:08.887 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
rainy day?

28:08.921 --> 28:13.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, people have stockpiles
of food for
possible war. Do I stockpile my
medicine in

28:13.492 --> 28:16.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
case I don't have it?

28:16.762 --> 28:23.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I went to the hospital three
times in one
year with sugars above 600,
because they were

28:23.735 --> 28:32.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not -- I wasn't taking the right
medication.
If you don't think that Medicaid
is important,

28:32.711 --> 28:37.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then you're signing my death
sentence. If
you're comfortable with that,
then go right

28:37.549 --> 28:39.384 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ahead.

28:39.418 --> 28:43.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We are going to
have more of
these profiles of how people
could be impacted

28:43.155 --> 28:45.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the new health care plan in
the days to
come.

28:45.924 --> 28:55.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can watch all of them on our
Web site
right now at PBS.org/NewsHour.

28:55.968 --> 29:05.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can watch all of them on our
Web site
right now at PBS.org/NewsHour.

29:06.011 --> 29:11.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
United States military
involvement in Syria
has deepened since President
Trump took office.

29:11.416 --> 29:17.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Pentagon has authorized the
deployment
of 400 more troops, some of whom
are already

29:17.356 --> 29:22.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there. Five hundred special
operations forces
sent by the Obama administration
are also

29:22.894 --> 29:29.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the ground. War planners
reportedly are
seeking to send an additional
1,000 American

29:29.101 --> 29:30.902 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
troops to Syria.

29:30.936 --> 29:37.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, in Tabqa, Syria,
American forces
aided Syrian rebel and Kurdish
forces in the

29:37.109 --> 29:43.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taking a strategic dam and road
from ISIS.
All this comes on a complex
battlefield and

29:43.949 --> 29:47.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
under the wary eye of Syria's
northern neighbor
Turkey.

29:47.719 --> 29:53.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on what's happening now
and what
may come, I'm joined by Andrew
Exum. He served

29:53.892 --> 29:59.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Obama administration
until this January
as deputy assistant secretary of
defense for

29:59.498 --> 30:05.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Middle East policy. He's also a
former Army
Ranger and a contributing editor
at "The Atlantic."

30:05.671 --> 30:11.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Bulent Aliriza, he's the
director of the
Turkey Project at the Center for
Strategic

30:11.209 --> 30:14.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and International Studies. It's
a Washington
think tank.

30:14.579 --> 30:17.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you back
to the program.

30:17.082 --> 30:18.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Andrew Exum, to you first.

30:18.750 --> 30:22.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much of a change is what we
are seeing
right now in Syria from what was
going on

30:22.421 --> 30:24.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the Obama administration?

30:24.222 --> 30:25.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW EXUM, Former U.S. Deputy
Assistant
Secretary of Defense: So,
significant in one

30:25.891 --> 30:27.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way. Significant in terms of the
numbers.
It is clear that the Trump
administration

30:28.026 --> 30:31.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doesn't have the same reticence
that the Obama
administration did in terms of
putting more

30:31.863 --> 30:36.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
boots on the ground, especially
conventional
troops, as opposed to special
operations troops.

30:36.968 --> 30:41.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where it is similar is that what
we are trying
to do, it seems, is replicate
the success

30:41.139 --> 30:45.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have had in Iraq working, by,
with and
through local forces, so no
direct combat

30:45.944 --> 30:50.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
themselves, but really enabling
local forces
to try to win the fight.

30:50.215 --> 30:53.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seems what the U.S. military
is trying
to do is put the same
infrastructure on the

30:53.919 --> 30:59.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ground that has proved
successful in helping
the Iraqi army in Mosul in Syria
to help the

30:59.424 --> 31:02.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Syrians successfully take Raqqa.

31:02.327 --> 31:07.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, if the Trump
administration
seems to be headed toward 2,000,
assuming

31:07.566 --> 31:11.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this next 1,000 contingent gets
there, is
that where the Obama
administration would

31:12.003 --> 31:14.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have eventually gotten, or is
that not even
clear?

31:14.206 --> 31:15.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANDREW EXUM: So, it's a really
good question.

31:15.974 --> 31:20.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over the past 18 months, we have
steadily
ramped up our commitment in
terms of resources

31:20.912 --> 31:26.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to both Iraq and Syria, and
certainly, as
the fight developed in Iraq, we
continued

31:26.184 --> 31:30.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to put more troop there, for
example, building
up the Qayyarah West Airfield in
presentation

31:30.555 --> 31:32.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the fight against Mosul.

31:32.390 --> 31:35.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you could say the Obama
administration
might have eventually done
something similar

31:35.494 --> 31:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to this. We really don't know.
In some ways,
this is typical of the ramping
up of the strategy

31:41.500 --> 31:43.268 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
so far.

31:43.301 --> 31:47.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Bulent Aliriza,
do you see
in as a continuation or as
something tangibly

31:47.038 --> 31:49.107 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
different?

31:49.141 --> 31:50.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BULENT ALIRIZA, Center for
Strategic and International
Studies: It is a combination,
exactly as Andrew

31:50.675 --> 31:52.477 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
says.

31:52.511 --> 31:55.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is a continuation in the
sense that the
Obama administration was relying
on the Syrian

31:55.714 --> 32:03.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kurds, the YPG, which causes
terribly tremendous
heartburn in the context of the
Syrian Democratic

32:03.355 --> 32:11.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forces. The difference is that,
in Iraq, the
U.S. is relying on the Iraqi
army, supplemented

32:12.030 --> 32:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with Peshmerga Kurdish forces.

32:14.766 --> 32:18.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this case, the primary
reliance on the
Syrian Kurds, with lots and lots
and complications.

32:18.837 --> 32:23.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, expand a
little bit,
Bulent Aliriza, on why the
Turkish government

32:23.975 --> 32:25.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is so concerned about -- or
growing concerned?

32:25.911 --> 32:30.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BULENT ALIRIZA: The Turkish
government regards
the YPG, the fighting arm of the
Syrian Kurdish

32:30.182 --> 32:36.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
party the PYD, as an extension
of the PKK,
which has been fighting Turkey
for over three

32:36.822 --> 32:38.623 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
decades.

32:38.657 --> 32:41.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With the Obama administration
and subsequently
with the Trump administration,
Turkey tried

32:42.027 --> 32:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to persuade the U.S. not to rely
on the Syrian
Kurds for this reason, and to
actually look

32:47.599 --> 32:52.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to opposition groups backed by
Turkey who
have actually moved into
Northern Syria with

32:52.337 --> 32:56.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Turkish backing recently, and
maybe even the
Turkish army to take Raqqa.

32:56.675 --> 33:01.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it seems that the Obama
administration's
recommendation, which was
reviewed by the

33:01.446 --> 33:06.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pentagon, has led the Trump
administration
to continue with the Syrian
Kurdish option.

33:06.318 --> 33:11.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, as far as you
know, Andrew
Exum, how does the -- you know
how the Obama

33:11.690 --> 33:14.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration viewed Turkey's
concerns. What
does it look like the Trump
administration,

33:14.125 --> 33:16.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how do they see these concerns
by Turkey?

33:16.261 --> 33:18.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW EXUM: Yes.

33:18.063 --> 33:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No, my colleague sketched out
exactly right.
We actually started meeting with
the Turks

33:20.899 --> 33:25.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the summer of 2015 to try to
see if there
was any way to make use of these
opposition

33:26.004 --> 33:28.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
forces that Turkey had
identified.

33:28.139 --> 33:31.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bottom line is that there
are too few
of them and they weren't
combat-ready in the

33:31.576 --> 33:36.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
same way that our other partners
were ready.
And the Turkish military was
never on the

33:36.081 --> 33:41.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
table during the Obama
administration, although,
of course, Turkey committed its
own forces

33:41.286 --> 33:45.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into Northern Syria late in the
day in the
administration.

33:45.156 --> 33:48.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unclear how this administration
looks at it.
I think they had been trying to
see if there

33:49.027 --> 33:53.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was some way they could do this
without angering
a NATO partner in Turkey. And
this may be

33:53.632 --> 33:57.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why they're putting more U.S.
forces on the
ground, so that they don't have
to provide

33:57.335 --> 34:03.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the same type of equipment to
the YPG they
might have to -- had to have
otherwise done

34:03.275 --> 34:05.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if they had been trying to do
this with fewer
U.S. forces.

34:05.543 --> 34:09.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Bulent
Aliriza, as you
look, as you step back and look
at this, does

34:09.648 --> 34:14.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
it look like the Trump
administration is making
a smart move here in the way
they are handling

34:14.486 --> 34:16.388 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this?

34:16.421 --> 34:19.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BULENT ALIRIZA: I think their
primary motivation
here is to try and live up to
the commitment

34:19.257 --> 34:24.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Trump made during the
campaign, to actually
deal with ISIS as quickly as
possible.

34:24.195 --> 34:31.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in this case, the Syrian
Kurds offered
the best option in order to get
this done

34:31.102 --> 34:35.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as soon as possible. Beyond
that, I think
there are going to be lots and
lots of complications,

34:35.407 --> 34:41.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but, frankly, this is where we
are. And nobody
is really thinking beyond the
takeover of

34:41.246 --> 34:42.280 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Raqqa from ISIL.

34:42.314 --> 34:44.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You assess it the
same way?

34:44.249 --> 34:46.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW EXUM: I do.

34:46.117 --> 34:49.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the problems really
begin in some
ways after you take Raqqa,
because it is clear

34:49.054 --> 34:54.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the Islamic State is going
to retreat
to Deir el-Zour. The regime has
a strong toehold

34:54.159 --> 34:59.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Deir el-Zour. So I think the
key questions
going forward is, do you follow
Da'esh to

34:59.297 --> 35:03.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Deir el-Zour? Do you try to work
with the
regime in Russia?

35:03.034 --> 35:06.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the geography only gets
more complicated
the farther south you go.

35:06.738 --> 35:11.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what about --
Bulent Aliriza,
what about -- to both of you,
what about once

35:11.343 --> 35:16.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISIS is cleared out? Is there a
plan for what
to do with those spaces that are
vacated,

35:16.548 --> 35:18.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that are emptied out?

35:18.283 --> 35:22.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BULENT ALIRIZA: Well, the Syrian
government
under Bashar Assad seems to have
survived.

35:22.854 --> 35:26.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Initially, the Obama
administration, like
Turkey and many other countries,
was committed

35:26.358 --> 35:30.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to his ouster. With Russian
backing, with
Iranian backing, they have
survived.

35:30.362 --> 35:37.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in this process, ISIL
emerged and began
to be the problem within Syria
and beyond

35:38.003 --> 35:42.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that it has. Now, even if you
take Raqqa,
even if you take Mosul across
the border in

35:42.273 --> 35:47.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraq, unfortunately, the problem
posed by
radical jihadists is going to
continue.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which spells --
go ahead.

35:49.414 --> 35:51.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANDREW EXUM: I think that is
right.

35:51.249 --> 35:54.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that, unfortunately, I
think that
we have already put our U.S.
special operators

35:54.386 --> 35:58.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a very difficult position in
Northern Syria
already. You can see them
refereeing between

35:58.790 --> 36:01.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Turkish-aligned forces and
U.S.-backed
forces.

36:01.960 --> 36:07.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have real concerns about their
ability to
enable local forces to not just
seize Raqqa,

36:07.699 --> 36:12.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but then to hold Raqqa. And what
is unclear
to me is, what is the endgame?
How do we eventually

36:12.604 --> 36:17.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exfiltrate U.S. forces out of a
very complicated
situation in Northern Syria,
once we have

36:17.442 --> 36:19.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
defeated the Islamic State?

36:19.277 --> 36:21.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, for folks who
are watching
this, Bulent Aliriza, and they
are wondering,

36:21.646 --> 36:26.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OK, what are the risks that the
Trump administration
is taking, how would you
describe them?

36:26.518 --> 36:32.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BULENT ALIRIZA: Well, the risks
in Syria to
the U.S., to the Trump
administration are

36:32.257 --> 36:40.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
minimal. It is the risks beyond
Syria posed
by ISIL and other organizations
like that.

36:40.932 --> 36:46.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so dealing with them in
Syria, as I said,
is relatively easy. But it might
actually

36:46.571 --> 36:52.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make the difficulties posed by
the radical
jihadists beyond Syria's borders
even more

36:52.710 --> 36:54.012 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
intractable.

36:54.045 --> 36:55.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in just a few
words, you
see it the same way?

36:55.814 --> 36:58.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW EXUM: Well, I think what
the United
States is going to try to do
after this is,

36:58.083 --> 37:01.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have figured out a way to
squeeze Da'esh
from multiple directions in Iraq
and Syria.

37:01.719 --> 37:05.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know our military planners are
now thinking
through, what does that mean on
a global scale?

37:05.990 --> 37:09.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you avoid exactly the
situation that
my colleague is describing?

37:09.627 --> 37:14.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Making it much
worse elsewhere,
once you get rid of them, so to
speak.

37:14.466 --> 37:15.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW EXUM: Exactly.

37:15.467 --> 37:17.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: If that happens
in Syria.

37:17.769 --> 37:22.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Andrew Exum, Bulent Aliriza, we
thank you
both.

37:22.107 --> 37:31.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BULENT ALIRIZA: Thank you.

37:31.616 --> 37:40.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
is not only
dominating the news here in the
United States.

37:40.258 --> 37:45.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His agenda, and his style of
governing, is
even the subject of betting
markets, of all

37:45.230 --> 37:47.098 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
things.

37:47.132 --> 37:50.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman,
recently traveled to Dublin to
meet with Ireland's

37:50.802 --> 37:54.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
most visible bookie about all
things Trump.

37:54.305 --> 37:56.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of our weekly series
Making Sense.

37:56.374 --> 38:00.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So how is the Trump
action?

38:00.411 --> 38:04.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PADDY POWER, Paddy Power: Pretty
nonstop.
I mean, he is literally top
story in the news

38:04.249 --> 38:06.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
every single night, still.

38:06.084 --> 38:09.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The political
prediction markets,
where you can bet real money on
an almost

38:09.320 --> 38:15.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
endless variety of political
outcomes. Well,
the betting is heavier than ever
these days

38:15.160 --> 38:16.761 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
On Donald Trump.

38:16.794 --> 38:17.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Even here in Ireland?

38:17.795 --> 38:19.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PADDY POWER: Even here in
Ireland.

38:19.664 --> 38:24.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: That's Paddy Power
of the eponymous
Irish online betting site Paddy
Power, a legal

38:24.869 --> 38:30.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bookmaker which took a very
visible million-dollar
loss this fall when it paid off
on bets for

38:30.942 --> 38:37.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, an 85 percent
favorite, to
win the presidency, 20 days
before Donald

38:37.515 --> 38:39.450 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trump won.

38:39.484 --> 38:42.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PADDY POWER: We decided to pay
out on Clinton
early, and we got that
completely wrong, obviously.

38:42.887 --> 38:44.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, got Brexit completely wrong.

38:44.722 --> 38:49.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Now we have been
covering various
political prediction markets as
a successful

38:49.194 --> 38:56.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
example of applied economics
since the 2004
Bush-Kerry presidential
campaign, when we

38:56.100 --> 39:02.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
featured New Yorker economics
columnist James
Surowiecki on the sidewalks of
New York crowdsourcing

39:02.807 --> 39:06.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a guesstimate of the number of
jelly beans
in this jar.

39:06.411 --> 39:07.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Five hundred.

39:07.412 --> 39:08.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: How many did you say?

39:08.913 --> 39:09.881 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Ten thousand.

39:09.914 --> 39:10.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Ten thousand.

39:10.915 --> 39:12.750 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Ten thousand.

39:12.784 --> 39:19.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As wildly divergent as the
guesses were, their
average was eerily close to the
real number,

39:19.057 --> 39:20.858 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
1,350.

39:20.892 --> 39:26.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Surowiecki was touting the
so-called wisdom
of crowds, the theoretical
advantage of markets

39:26.965 --> 39:33.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and their supposed collective
best guesses,
which we cover here with the
usual stock footage.

39:33.438 --> 39:39.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he cited the historical
accuracy of the
Iowa Electronic Markets, which
have allowed

39:39.410 --> 39:43.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
political betting, for research
purposes,
since 1988.

39:43.281 --> 39:48.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES SUROWIECKI, "The New
Yorker": Historically,
the election eve forecast in
this market has

39:48.253 --> 39:51.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only been off by 1.4 percent,
which is better
than any poll.

39:51.756 --> 39:56.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Better than any
poll. That's
been the track record of all the
prediction

39:56.961 --> 40:03.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
markets pretty much forever.
Study them, said
market expert David Rothschild
during last

40:03.268 --> 40:05.169 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
year's campaign:

40:05.203 --> 40:07.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ROTHSCHILD, PredictWise:
And you see
something that is more accurate
than any collection

40:07.372 --> 40:11.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of pundits or statistical
polling averages,
and extremely well-calibrated.

40:11.442 --> 40:16.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: But what's
remarkable is that,
even though prediction markets
failed so spectacularly

40:16.881 --> 40:22.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Trump, bettors are flocking
to them as
never before. That's why I asked
Paddy Power

40:23.021 --> 40:25.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for a quick chat in downtown
Dublin.

40:25.290 --> 40:29.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PADDY POWER: We have actually
launched a new
betting hub, purely dedicated to
Trump.

40:29.594 --> 40:31.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: A betting hub?

40:31.296 --> 40:33.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PADDY POWER: Yes, literally a
micro-site,
a Trump micro-site.

40:33.831 --> 40:37.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: A Trump micro-site?
And so how
many bets can you make on Trump?

40:37.035 --> 40:40.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PADDY POWER: There's 100 open
bets on Trump,
different markets on Trump at
the moment.

40:40.571 --> 40:44.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The politics trader literally
can't handle
the volume, so we're hiring a
Trump betting

40:44.676 --> 40:46.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
expert at the moment.

40:46.611 --> 40:49.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: That's because,
when it offers
a bet like next member of the
Trump administration

40:49.547 --> 40:55.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to resign or get sacked -- it's
Jeff Sessions
at 2- 1 -- Paddy Power needs an
expert to

40:55.453 --> 41:01.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
set the opening odds. If they're
too far away
from what bettors are likely to
think, Paddy

41:01.225 --> 41:03.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
could lose its shirt.

41:03.094 --> 41:07.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PADDY POWER: We're advertising
for some kid
out of college, hopefully, a
political graduate

41:07.699 --> 41:10.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or whatever, to become an expert
on Trump,
all things Trump. They're going
to manage

41:10.968 --> 41:13.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our Trump betting, because it's
literally
millions of dollars.

41:13.371 --> 41:20.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: What are the odds
of him being
impeached, not convicted, but
impeached before

41:20.912 --> 41:23.614 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
four years? Is that the bet?

41:23.648 --> 41:25.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PADDY POWER: Yes. That's the
bet. That's the
main bet, the most popular one.
At the moment,

41:25.983 --> 41:29.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's 6-4, and that means he's
about 40 percent
likely. The odds would suggest
it's 40 percent

41:29.954 --> 41:31.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
likely he's impeached in his
first term, yes.

41:31.789 --> 41:36.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So what's an
odds-on favorite
at this point with regard to
Trump, that is

41:37.028 --> 41:41.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than 50 percent likely,
according to
the prediction markets, to
happen?

41:41.566 --> 41:44.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PADDY POWER: Well, it's more
than 50 percent
likely that he won't see a
second term, right?

41:44.202 --> 41:47.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's more than 50 percent that
he's going
to see his first term out,
though, that he

41:47.839 --> 41:49.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will get there in the end.

41:49.540 --> 41:53.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Power showed me the
latest odds
on some of the other Trump bets
as well.

41:53.311 --> 41:56.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two-thirds chance that he will
start building
the wall.

41:56.147 --> 41:57.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PADDY POWER: In 2017.

41:57.148 --> 41:58.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: In 2017.

41:58.149 --> 41:59.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PADDY POWER: Yes.

41:59.851 --> 42:02.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But you need to
consult the Web
site itself for the very latest
odds.

42:02.320 --> 42:07.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Mexico, funding the wall.
When will Sean
Spicer leave or get sacked as
White House

42:07.558 --> 42:13.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
press secretary? U.S. Congress
inquiry to
officially declare that Obama
ordered a wiretap

42:13.297 --> 42:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of phones in Trump Tower.

42:15.767 --> 42:20.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the Irish, like those
walking past us
on Grafton Street, making real
money Trump

42:21.005 --> 42:24.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bets and presumably taking the
odds seriously.

42:24.208 --> 42:30.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's no reason at this
point, is there,
for me or anybody in the
audience to believe

42:30.748 --> 42:31.983 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these odds?

42:32.016 --> 42:34.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PADDY POWER: No, absolutely not.
We have been
wrong, so wrong.

42:34.318 --> 42:39.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, why have
prediction markets
failed as abysmally as they
have?

42:39.924 --> 42:43.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PADDY POWER: I think -- I have
been thinking
about this a lot, because it is
-- it is a

42:43.394 --> 42:44.362 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
head-scratcher.

42:44.395 --> 42:46.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But Mr. Power does
have a theory.

42:46.297 --> 42:50.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PADDY POWER: We're just behind.
The world
is slowly going bonkers, all
around the world,

42:50.401 --> 42:53.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because you can see the way the
political
structure is just changing
everywhere.

42:53.504 --> 42:56.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's just taking us a
bit of time
to catch up with that, because
we still look

42:57.008 --> 43:00.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at -- like, we look at form.
Like, in sports
betting, you look at form and
what's happened

43:00.111 --> 43:01.212 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
before.

43:01.245 --> 43:02.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Is this a horse
that generally
wins?

43:03.014 --> 43:05.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PADDY POWER: Yes, exactly, or if
this team
always wins at home or whatever
it might be.

43:05.616 --> 43:08.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you look at the form,
like that's
literally ripped up and thrown
out the window

43:08.920 --> 43:10.688 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on this occasion, you know?

43:10.721 --> 43:15.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Or, with Donald
Trump, and so
many other political phenomena
these days,

43:15.760 --> 43:21.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if you will forgive the rather
obvious cliche,
all bets are off.

43:51.095 --> 43:52.964 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
family.

43:52.997 --> 43:59.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For years,
Elizabeth Farnsworth
traveled the world as a foreign
correspondent

43:59.537 --> 44:04.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the "NewsHour" to hot spots
such as Vietnam,
Iran, Iraq, and Latin America.

44:04.842 --> 44:07.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH FARNSWORTH, Author, "A
Train Through
Time: A Life, Real and
Imagined": I very much

44:07.745 --> 44:12.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wanted to be reporting where a
lot was on
the line. I think -- you may
share this -- I

44:12.817 --> 44:19.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think that that's what reporters
like to do
and want to do, and where it's
really important

44:19.690 --> 44:22.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that you get the story that's
the truth.

44:22.426 --> 44:26.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: She's written
about this in
a new book, "A Train Through
Time."

44:26.330 --> 44:30.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH FARNSWORTH: I'm
somewhat obsessed
with the disappeared. I had
worked in Chile,

44:30.067 --> 44:32.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and I know people that were
disappeared.

44:32.670 --> 44:38.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the book is partly about
people who you
don't know what happened to
them. And I think

44:38.142 --> 44:43.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want people to pay attention
when other
people are suffering. When
people die, I think

44:43.147 --> 44:45.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I really care that people pay
attention to
that.

44:45.983 --> 44:50.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was so lucky to get to work in
a way that
I could call attention. When I
first reported

44:50.821 --> 44:56.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Chile or reported from
Guatemala, a lot
of people didn't realize what
was happening.

44:56.127 --> 44:59.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I was so lucky to be able to
say, pay
attention to this.

44:59.797 --> 45:04.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But this is more
than a story
of her reporting. It's also
about her childhood

45:04.435 --> 45:09.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Kansas, and dealing with the
loss of her
mother when Elizabeth was age 9.

45:09.373 --> 45:14.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Soon after her mother's death,
she took a
train ride with her father on
the Union Pacific's

45:14.245 --> 45:19.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Portland Rose from Topeka to San
Francisco,
which becomes the spine of her
new book.

45:19.884 --> 45:24.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH FARNSWORTH: Her death
was a mystery.
I didn't know that she really
was dead. They

45:24.188 --> 45:29.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
didn't use the word: She died.
She's gone.
We don't have her anymore.

45:29.994 --> 45:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She'd been sick. But, in those
days, I have
what I call very good bad luck,
in that I

45:36.534 --> 45:42.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
had a wonderful father,
wonderful aunts, grandparents,
but they didn't think to ever
tell me that

45:42.540 --> 45:45.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
my mother was dying of cancer.

45:45.142 --> 45:51.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the fact that they didn't
tell me that
made me believe that she
disappeared. And

45:51.716 --> 45:57.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so I looked for her from that
train, and I
think that that's part of
solving the mystery.

45:57.154 --> 46:01.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why did I look for her? Why is
that memory
so vivid?

46:01.092 --> 46:05.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You know, we have
been friends
a long time, but I realized in
this that I

46:05.730 --> 46:11.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't know how much you tend to
look back
at your young self. And I
wondered, when you

46:11.302 --> 46:16.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did, what did you see? Who was
that person?
Does it feel like the same you,
or...

46:16.407 --> 46:20.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH FARNSWORTH: Yes, it
does very much.
It's interesting you should ask
that, Jeff.

46:20.444 --> 46:22.346 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
It does.

46:22.380 --> 46:26.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it has partly to do, I
think, with losing
a parent. I think it -- I think,
in my experience,

46:26.550 --> 46:32.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it made you both empathetic with
people who
are losing something. But I also
think it

46:32.556 --> 46:38.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
makes you tremendously
appreciative of life,
because the person most
important to you,

46:38.329 --> 46:40.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her life was so fragile.

46:40.631 --> 46:47.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I see a person who had
some sadness,
but who also wanted to live life
to the fullest,

46:47.238 --> 46:49.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and that pretty much is who I am
now too.

46:49.373 --> 46:53.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One of the other
themes here,
of course, is the passage of
time, right?

46:53.944 --> 46:57.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you even refer to you as a
young girl
on the train, when you're
saying, does it

46:57.982 --> 47:03.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change depending on how fast
we're going,
that metaphor of the train
again, right? The

47:03.954 --> 47:04.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
train's going so fast.

47:04.955 --> 47:05.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH FARNSWORTH: Yes.

47:05.956 --> 47:07.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What time will it
be?

47:07.091 --> 47:08.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZABETH FARNSWORTH: Yes. Will
we get ahead
of time?

47:08.926 --> 47:14.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm sort of fascinated by time
in general.
And I think listeners will share
this. I think

47:14.699 --> 47:19.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we all have moments when we're
living in about
four times at once, when
something reminds

47:19.270 --> 47:24.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us of something or when we
realize we're reacting
to something because it comes
from that past

47:24.608 --> 47:26.410 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

47:26.444 --> 47:28.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The train ride
amidst great
loss is the touchstone for one
of her biggest

47:28.979 --> 47:35.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concerns as a reporter, the role
of fixers,
the local producers who help us
do our work,

47:35.152 --> 47:37.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sometimes at great risk to
themselves.

47:37.922 --> 47:43.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One man in particular, Fakher
Haider, worked
with Elizabeth in Iraq. He was
later killed

47:43.360 --> 47:45.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
while working with another news
organization.

47:45.362 --> 47:49.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH FARNSWORTH: I realized
in about
-- it started really in about
2000, before

47:49.967 --> 47:55.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
9/11, but really after 9/11,
when I spent
quite a lot of time in the
Middle East, that

47:55.973 --> 48:01.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the shoots that we were on were
far more dangerous
for the cameraman, the soundman
and the fixer

48:01.045 --> 48:03.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
than for me and for the
producer.

48:03.614 --> 48:08.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are reasons for that.
It has to
do partly with having a camera,
which means

48:08.285 --> 48:12.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that it looks like a gun
sometimes. We had
people point guns at us because
they thought

48:12.823 --> 48:15.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that we had a gun.

48:15.092 --> 48:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then fixers are local people
who interpret
and do a lot more for us too.
And we all are

48:21.999 --> 48:25.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
probably going to get helped in
going back
home if something bad happens.

48:25.436 --> 48:26.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: You have
somewhere to go to.

48:26.837 --> 48:28.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELIZABETH FARNSWORTH: Yes. And
the fixer doesn't.

48:28.739 --> 48:34.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I won't take the time here,
but I could
tell you stories of ways in
which correspondents

48:34.445 --> 48:38.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hurt fixers by not being
sensitive to them.

48:38.048 --> 48:41.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is not what happened
with Fakher.
People were quite sensitive to
him. But he

48:41.619 --> 48:46.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was such a good reporter and
doing such great
work, did great work for us. He
did great

48:46.824 --> 48:48.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
work for The New York Times.

48:48.559 --> 48:52.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as I say in the book, he
joined the ghosts
that wake me up at night
sometimes.

48:52.863 --> 48:57.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There is an
interesting blend
of fact -- that's all we're
talking about

48:57.668 --> 49:04.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here -- and fiction, of deeply
reported events
and your imagination.

49:04.275 --> 49:06.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I wonder how you thought
about that line.

49:06.644 --> 49:10.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH FARNSWORTH: It's
funny. I asked
Jim Lehrer about it. Can I do
this?

49:10.181 --> 49:12.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he said, as long as you tell
people what
the fiction is.

49:12.783 --> 49:14.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what I do in the
afterward.

49:14.518 --> 49:16.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

49:16.320 --> 49:19.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH FARNSWORTH: I think,
any time you
remember something, one can
write a memoir

49:19.690 --> 49:23.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- and I know people that have
done this -- that
everything is researched. You
don't say anything

49:23.961 --> 49:25.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just from memory.

49:25.763 --> 49:30.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I didn't want to do that,
because part
of what I was trying to do was
recover the

49:30.534 --> 49:37.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
imagination that created who I
am now. I was
very imaginative as a child, and
I wanted

49:37.808 --> 49:42.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to see what it was that I
thought about my
mother's death, not what the
facts were.

49:42.413 --> 49:48.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I could've gone to try to find
the medical
records. But I wanted to be in
her mind. And

49:48.919 --> 49:55.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I understand that you take
chances when you
start. I started imaging this on
the train

49:55.226 --> 49:59.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a certain way, which we won't
reveal, and
certain things happened on the
train which

49:59.129 --> 50:00.831 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are a mystery.

50:00.865 --> 50:05.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I just went with it. And I
do explain
that that part isn't true. And I
think that

50:05.369 --> 50:08.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's a reason why I did go
with it and
the role it plays in the book.
And we will

50:08.873 --> 50:10.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
let other people decide what
they think.

50:10.674 --> 50:14.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, as you say,
memory and
imagination are closely linked.
You just decided

50:14.278 --> 50:15.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to allow the linkage to happen.

50:15.980 --> 50:19.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH FARNSWORTH: I think of
imagination
as really a way of seeing things
that you

50:19.717 --> 50:21.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cannot see any other way.

50:21.652 --> 50:24.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, the
book is "A Train
Through Time."

50:24.655 --> 50:26.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Elizabeth Farnsworth, thank you
very much.

50:26.357 --> 50:27.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELIZABETH FARNSWORTH: Thanks,
Jeff.

50:27.825 --> 50:31.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we are so
proud of our
former colleague Elizabeth.

50:31.195 --> 50:42.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can watch Matthew Moyer's
tribute to Fakher
Haider. That's online at
PBS.org/NewsHour.

50:42.740 --> 50:54.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Finally, another in our Brief
But Spectacular
series, where we ask interesting
people to

50:54.184 --> 50:55.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
describe their passions.

50:55.953 --> 51:01.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from artist
Jive Poetic.
The New York-based poet will be
coaching the

51:01.225 --> 51:04.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Brooklyn Poetry Slam finals next
month.

51:04.328 --> 51:11.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIVE POETIC, Artist: Rule number
one: Always
know it is time to go home.
Summer camp was

51:11.135 --> 51:15.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
free lunch in a park, then back
home, trip
to Manhattan, then back home.

51:15.706 --> 51:19.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No matter where you were, if
those street
lights came on, and you was not
home, there

51:20.010 --> 51:24.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was a problem. If mama had to
look for you,
if community got involved a
problem, a problem.

51:24.848 --> 51:26.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And solutions never came easy.

51:26.617 --> 51:30.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We still have not solved what
happened to
little Tasha (ph). And mama used
to say, be

51:30.587 --> 51:36.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aware of emergency vehicles,
police cars,
sirens, screams, cries, tears.
All emergency

51:36.961 --> 51:42.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vehicles, be aware of how far
away they are,
how fast and far close, closer,
how close

51:42.132 --> 51:44.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that close far was too late.
They're tardy.

51:44.601 --> 51:49.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Always made us the most almost
riots. Always
made them the most almost
panicked. Always

51:50.007 --> 51:55.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enter their Cavalier with middle
finger and
curse words spoken and thrown by
the dialect.

51:55.412 --> 52:00.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Always raged into flames, as if
our bodies
were built from the kiss of
match and gas

52:00.250 --> 52:02.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can, because we have not
forgotten.

52:02.052 --> 52:06.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have not forgotten. We have
not forgotten
Carmela Stevenson (ph) was alive
when them

52:06.457 --> 52:11.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
sirens came, dead when
negligence dropped
her from gurney to sidewalk. And
mama used

52:11.261 --> 52:14.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to say, distraction will get you
killed.

52:14.798 --> 52:18.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Pay attention to your
environment. Pay attention
to your environment. You too
have instincts

52:18.902 --> 52:22.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a reason. Use them. Use them
like childhood
street lights. They will always
tell you when

52:22.873 --> 52:25.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it is time to go home.

52:25.275 --> 52:37.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you think you know how your
poem is going
to end, then you're not going to
have a poem,

52:37.955 --> 52:40.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because the poem is going to
want to do something
else. And you're going to be
stuck going one

52:40.491 --> 52:42.226 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

52:42.259 --> 52:44.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't carry any notebooks.
What I will do
is, I will throw a line down. I
will type

52:44.094 --> 52:48.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it up. And I will walk. I will
walk through
whole of Brooklyn. I will walk
from Bed-Stuy

52:48.599 --> 52:51.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Flatbush. I walk back to the
bridge.

52:51.368 --> 52:54.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's the thing with living
in New York
City, where I can say these
poems out loud

52:54.705 --> 52:59.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by myself at night, and nobody
thinks you're
crazy. The things that I say in
my poems are

52:59.176 --> 53:01.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things that I have absolutely
have to say.

53:01.745 --> 53:07.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know that there are kids who
grew up like
I grew up, from where I'm from,
and they aren't

53:07.418 --> 53:11.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
always aware that their voice
matters. I think
it matters. It matters to me.
And hopefully

53:11.188 --> 53:12.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it will matter to somebody else.

53:12.990 --> 53:17.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's a lot of systems
designed to try
and silence me anyway. There's
no point of

53:17.694 --> 53:23.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me surrendering my voice. That's
-- why would
I want to do that? Surrender
your voice? You

53:23.033 --> 53:24.568 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fought too hard to have one.

53:24.601 --> 53:31.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

On the "NewsHour" online right

of classical composers have
turned to nature

53:46.090 --> 53:51.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for inspiration, but we meet a
composer who's
been inspired by the national
parks in the

53:51.361 --> 53:58.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. like Yosemite and Mesa
Verde. That's
