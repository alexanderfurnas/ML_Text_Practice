02:59.600 --> 03:00.667
LUCKY SITUATION.

03:13.667 --> 03:14.800
THOSE SERVICEMEN, SO I GUESS

03:14.800 --> 03:15.933
THEY SHOULD KNOW.

03:15.933 --> 03:17.267
>> WHERE DOES THAT LEAD

03:17.267 --> 03:18.533
INVESTIGATORS TO THINK ABOUT

03:18.533 --> 03:19.433
THIS GUNMAN?

03:19.433 --> 03:20.533
WHERE WAS HE FROM?

03:20.533 --> 03:24.900
>> HE SPENT HIS LIFE IN A VERY

03:24.900 --> 03:28.733
POOR DRUG CRIME RIDDEN

03:28.733 --> 03:31.200
UNEMPLOYMENT TYPE OF SUBURB OF

03:31.200 --> 03:33.133
-- SO WE KNOW THAT ABOUT HIM.

03:33.133 --> 03:34.333
A LOCAL COMMUNITY LEADER SAID HE

03:34.333 --> 03:36.633
WAS A PRETTY ORDINARY YOUNG MAN

03:36.633 --> 03:37.633
WHO PLAYED FOOTBALL, WENT

03:37.633 --> 03:38.533
FISHING.

03:38.533 --> 03:39.600
>> Larson: ARE THERE ANY

03:39.600 --> 03:41.433
ACTUAL TIES BEING SHOWN YET TO

03:41.433 --> 03:42.200
ANY TERRORIST GROUP?

03:42.200 --> 03:43.833
>> NOT AS OF YET.

03:43.833 --> 03:47.300
HE WAS -- SO HE WAS ON A LIST OF

03:47.300 --> 03:49.300
SUSPECTED ISLAMIST MILITANTS.

03:49.300 --> 03:55.367
HE BASICALLY HAD BEEN TIES TO

03:55.367 --> 03:55.867
SOME GOODS.

03:55.867 --> 03:57.767
THE BOLDEST ASSERTION WE HAVE

03:57.767 --> 04:00.167
SEEN IS IN A BELGIAN NEWSPAPER

04:00.167 --> 04:01.967
WHICH SAYS HE WAS LINKED TO THE

04:01.967 --> 04:04.967
GROUP WHICH WAS INVOLVED IN A

04:04.967 --> 04:07.033
SHOOTING IN BRUSSELS JUST A FEW

04:07.033 --> 04:08.433
WEEKS, A FEW DAYS AFTER THE ONE

04:08.433 --> 04:09.433
IN PARIS IN JANUARY.

04:09.433 --> 04:10.633

04:10.633 --> 04:12.300
THIS F LIST IN FRANCE, WHERE

04:12.300 --> 04:13.833
THEY ARE TRACKING, YOU KNOW,

04:13.833 --> 04:15.200
PEOPLE THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

04:15.200 --> 04:16.400
-- HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ON THESE

04:16.400 --> 04:17.067
TYPES OF LISTS?

04:17.067 --> 04:19.800
>> THE PRIME MINISTER EARLIER

04:19.800 --> 04:22.767
THIS YEAR SAID THERE WERE 3,000

04:22.767 --> 04:24.767
ON THAT F LIST WHO WERE

04:24.767 --> 04:26.533
CONSIDERED TO BE ISLAMIST

04:26.533 --> 04:29.000
MILITANTS AND OF COURSE THE

04:29.000 --> 04:31.133
PROBLEM IS, UNTIL THEY ACTUALLY

04:31.133 --> 04:33.233
DO SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN BE

04:33.233 --> 04:35.400
ARRESTED FOR, THERE IS NOT VERY

04:35.400 --> 04:37.067
MUCH ANYONE CAN DO TO ACTUALLY

04:37.067 --> 04:39.367
STOP THEM FROM MOVING AROUND.

04:39.367 --> 04:42.667
THE COUNTRIES THAT TRAIN AND

04:42.667 --> 04:44.467
STRUGGLING THROUGH, PEOPLE

04:44.467 --> 04:45.233
TRAVEL ACROSS THE BORDERS

04:45.233 --> 04:46.467
WITHOUT PASSPORTS, WITHOUT

04:46.467 --> 04:48.533
SECURITY CHECKS AND SO ON, SO

04:48.533 --> 04:50.667
THESE PEOPLE CAN TRAVEL AROUND.

04:50.667 --> 04:51.867
>> Larson: EVER SINCE FIRST

04:51.867 --> 04:53.733
NEWS OF THIS ARRIVED HERE IN THE

04:53.733 --> 04:55.133
UNITED STATES, THERE HAVE BEEN

04:55.133 --> 04:55.833
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

04:55.833 --> 04:57.167
HE ACTUALLY, THE GUNMAN ACTUALLY

04:57.167 --> 04:58.367
WENT TO SYRIA.

04:58.367 --> 05:00.533
ANY NEWS ON THAT?

05:00.533 --> 05:02.533
>> THE SOURCES HAVE BEEN SPANISH

05:02.533 --> 05:03.533
SECURITY SERVICES ARE SAYING HE

05:03.533 --> 05:06.933
DID GO TO SYRIA, FROM FRANCE,

05:06.933 --> 05:10.233
NOT NECESSARILY DIRECTLY.

05:10.233 --> 05:11.167
FRENCH SECURITY SERVICES SAY

05:11.167 --> 05:14.633
THAT THEY KNOW HE TRAVELED FROM

05:14.633 --> 05:18.300
BERLIN TO ISTANBUL AND ON THE

05:18.300 --> 05:19.533
TENTH OF THIS YEAR, AT LEAST HE

05:19.533 --> 05:22.333
WAS IN BERLIN AIRPORT ON HIS WAY

05:22.333 --> 05:24.400
TO ISTANBUL.

05:24.400 --> 05:27.200
NOW, ISTANBUL IN TURKEY, THAT IS

05:27.200 --> 05:31.700
A DESTINATION FOR A LOT OF WOULD

05:31.700 --> 05:33.800
BE EUROPEAN JIHADISTS, WANTING

05:33.800 --> 05:35.133
TO GO AND JOIN THE FIGHT IN

05:35.133 --> 05:35.833
SYRIA.

05:35.833 --> 05:37.367
>> Larson: FINALLY, ANY IDEA

05:37.367 --> 05:38.300
OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE GOING

05:38.300 --> 05:39.967
TO HAVE TO CHANGE OR RAMP UP

05:39.967 --> 05:41.867
SECURITY MEASURES ON THE TRAIN?

05:41.867 --> 05:43.367
>> THEY ARE CERTAINLY TALKING

05:43.367 --> 05:44.000
ABOUT IT.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.500
IT HAS BEEN A FEW YEARS NOW THAT

05:45.500 --> 05:47.900
PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT THESE HIGH

05:47.900 --> 05:50.867
SPEED TRAINS BETWEEN THE

05:50.867 --> 05:53.067
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE

05:53.067 --> 05:54.867
POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE TO AN

05:54.867 --> 05:57.233
ATTACK, AND HERE WE HAVE ONE.

05:57.233 --> 05:58.833
THAT IS CERTAINLY GOING TO BE A

05:58.833 --> 06:00.267
DEBATE OVER THE COMING WEEKS.

06:00.267 --> 06:01.800
>> Larson: ANDREW CALLUS FROM

THE MELTDOWN AT THE CHERNOBYL

08:32.300 --> 08:34.133
PLANT IN UKRAINE, IN 1986, WAS

08:34.133 --> 08:35.367
THE WORST NUCLEAR POWER ACCIDENT

08:35.367 --> 08:36.800
IN HISTORY.

08:36.800 --> 08:38.567
THE RESULTING PLUME OF

08:38.567 --> 08:40.100
RADIOACTIVE DUST SPREAD ACROSS

NORTHERN EUROPE AND TURNED THE

08:41.633 --> 08:43.467
AREA SURROUNDING THE PLANT INTO

08:43.467 --> 08:45.633
AN UNINHABITABLE GHOST TOWN.

08:45.633 --> 08:47.200
THREE DECADES LATER, HOWEVER,

08:47.200 --> 08:49.000
THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT AND

08:49.000 --> 08:50.467
WILDLIFE AROUND CHERNOBYL ARE

08:50.467 --> 08:52.067
SHOWING SIGNS OF RECOVERY.

08:52.067 --> 08:53.167
ITN'S SCIENCE EDITOR TOM CLARKE

08:53.167 --> 08:59.300
REPORTS.

08:59.300 --> 09:02.833
>> EVERY RIDE IS A GHOST TRAIN.

09:02.833 --> 09:05.867
NOW, THE LOUDEST VOICES HERE ARE

09:05.867 --> 09:09.000
THE CUCKOOS AND THE PHYSICS

09:09.000 --> 09:11.633
CLASSROOM TIME IS OUT OF THE

09:11.633 --> 09:12.067
EQUATION.

09:12.067 --> 09:14.600
THIS WAS A SHOWCASE NUCLEAR CITY

09:14.600 --> 09:16.667
FOR ELITE SCIENTISTS AND

09:16.667 --> 09:17.567
ENGINEERS.

09:17.567 --> 09:19.067
NOW ALL THAT IS LEFT IS A VISION

09:19.067 --> 09:20.267
OF WHAT THE WORLD MIGHT LOOK

09:20.267 --> 09:24.767
LIKE IF ALL THE PEOPLE SUDDENLY

09:24.767 --> 09:27.233
DISAPPEARED.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.967
>> IT IS JUST TWO MILES FROM THE

09:29.967 --> 09:33.767
CHERNOBYL REACTOR COMPLEX.

09:33.767 --> 09:35.900
>>

09:35.900 --> 09:38.767
>> AUGUST 26, 1918 IT BLEW UP

09:38.767 --> 09:39.867
AND CAUGHT FIRE.

09:39.867 --> 09:41.567
THE UNLUCKY FEW WHO DEALT WITH

09:41.567 --> 09:43.633
THE WORST OF THE CLEANUP DIED

09:43.633 --> 09:45.333
FROM RADIATION SICKNESS.

09:45.333 --> 09:46.600
EVERYONE ELSE IN THE VICINITY

09:46.600 --> 09:49.133
WAS EVACUATED TO ESCAPE THE

09:49.133 --> 09:51.267
WORSE OF THE FALLOUT.

09:51.267 --> 09:54.500
>> THE REMAINS A YOUNG THOUSAND

SQUARE MILE EXCLUSION ZONE ALL

09:56.833 --> 09:57.867

09:59.500 --> 10:01.833
OF THE LONELIEST PLACES ON

10:01.833 --> 10:05.300
EARTH, IT IS FAR FROM EMPTY.

10:05.300 --> 10:09.200
THERE CAN'T BE A MORE POWERFUL

10:09.200 --> 10:10.833
DISPLAY OF THE RISK OF

10:10.833 --> 10:12.033
RADIATION, 30,000 PEOPLE USED TO

10:12.033 --> 10:14.000
LIVE HERE BUT COME BACK 30 YEARS

10:14.000 --> 10:16.200
AFTER THEY ARE ALL EVACUATED,

10:16.200 --> 10:17.867
WHAT STRIKES YOU IS THAT IT IS

10:17.867 --> 10:20.767
AN EQUALLY POWERFUL SYMBOL OF

10:20.767 --> 10:22.900
OUR INFLUENCE OVER NATURE.

10:22.900 --> 10:25.667
IF YOU TAKE HUMANS OUT OF THE

10:25.667 --> 10:27.900
EQUATION, THE WILDLIFE SURGE IS

10:27.900 --> 10:31.700
BACK, DESPITE THE CONTAMINATION.

10:31.700 --> 10:33.833
>> WE ARE HERE TO GO ON A

10:33.833 --> 10:34.933
FALLOUT FIELD TRIP INTO ONE OF

10:34.933 --> 10:38.233
THE MOST RADIOACTIVE AREAS OF

10:38.233 --> 10:38.967
THE ZONE.

10:38.967 --> 10:40.833
>> 30 YEARS ON THERE IS NO NEED

10:40.833 --> 10:44.067
FOR GLOVES OR MASKS, BUT THE

10:44.067 --> 10:46.200
SUITS PREVENT US FROM CARRYING

10:46.200 --> 10:48.500
CONTAMINATED SOIL AND DUST HOME.

10:48.500 --> 10:49.433
ECOLOGIST MIKE WOOD LEADS THE

10:49.433 --> 10:50.467
PROJECT.

10:50.467 --> 10:55.267
>> THIS IS THE RIDGE OF THE...

10:55.267 --> 10:59.033
AND IT IS A VILLAGE THAT SITS ON

10:59.033 --> 11:00.167
THE WESTERN TRACE.

11:00.167 --> 11:01.533
>> AND THE WESTERN TRACE IS PART

11:01.533 --> 11:02.267
OF A PLUME --

11:02.267 --> 11:03.967
>> OF THE FALLOUT THAT CAME FROM

11:03.967 --> 11:05.033
THE INITIAL EXPLOSION OF THE

11:05.033 --> 11:05.933
PLANT.

11:05.933 --> 11:06.867
>> YES.

11:06.867 --> 11:07.800
THE NARROW PLUME EXTENDS OFF TO

11:07.800 --> 11:11.967
THE WEST, AND AT THIS PARTICULAR

11:11.967 --> 11:13.300
LOCATION THE LEVELS OF

11:13.300 --> 11:14.767
CONTAMINATION WAS SUCH THAT SOME

11:14.767 --> 11:16.533
OF THE BUILDINGS WERE

11:16.533 --> 11:19.267
DELIBERATELY DEMOLISHED AND, TO

11:19.267 --> 11:21.433
CLEAN UP THE ACTIVITY.

11:21.433 --> 11:24.267
>> THE GUIDE IS A UKRAINIAN

11:24.267 --> 11:25.267
SCIENTIST WHO KNOWS MORE ABOUT

11:25.267 --> 11:27.067
THE WILDLIFE HERE THAN PERHAPS

11:27.067 --> 11:27.733
ANYONE ELSE.

11:27.733 --> 11:29.167
HE PIONEERED THE USE OF CAMERA

11:29.167 --> 11:31.700
TRAPS TO STUDY ECOLOGY IN THIS

11:31.700 --> 11:33.533
FORBIDDEN ZONE.

11:33.533 --> 11:36.033
BUT BEFORE THEY SWITCH ON THE

11:36.033 --> 11:37.567
EQUIPMENT, THREE DECADES WORTH

11:37.567 --> 11:38.733
OF READING TO GET ON WITH.

11:38.733 --> 11:40.033
THERE IS A POPULAR CONCEPTION

11:40.033 --> 11:41.733
THAT RADIATED FALLOUT FROM

11:41.733 --> 11:43.233
CHERNOBYL SOMEHOW DEVASTATED THE

11:43.233 --> 11:44.000
NATURAL ENVIRONMENT HERE BUT

11:44.000 --> 11:45.900
WHEN YOU COME TO THE ZONE YOU

11:45.900 --> 11:47.300
REALIZE THAT IS ANYTHING BUT.

11:47.300 --> 11:48.533
THE CASE ON WHAT THESE

11:48.533 --> 11:49.467
SCIENTISTS ARE TRYING TO FIGURE

11:49.467 --> 11:52.667
OUT IS JUST HOW WILDLIFE MANAGES

11:52.667 --> 11:54.033
WITH THAT RADIOACTIVITY.

11:54.033 --> 11:56.133
>> ALSO TO STUDY ITS RETURN TO

11:56.133 --> 11:58.833
WHAT USED TO BE A HUMAN

11:58.833 --> 11:59.867
ENVIRONMENT.

11:59.867 --> 12:01.300
>> AND TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THEY

12:01.300 --> 12:02.300
FOUND.

12:02.300 --> 12:04.533
OVER THE LAST YEAR, THEY, THE

12:04.533 --> 12:06.233
CAMERA TRAPS HAVE CAUGHT THE

12:06.233 --> 12:08.100
RETURN OF EUROPEAN BISON AS

12:08.100 --> 12:10.267
HEAVY AS A CAR AND ABSENT FOR

12:10.267 --> 12:11.533
CENTURIES, WOLVES, NEVER SEEN

12:11.533 --> 12:14.533
HERE BEFORE THE ACCIDENT, SLOWLY

12:14.533 --> 12:17.533
MIGRATED IN FROM NEIGHBORING

12:17.533 --> 12:18.000
BELARUS.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.033
HORSES ARE THRIVING, ALONG WITH

12:20.033 --> 12:23.767
WILD BOAR, EUROPE'S LARGEST CAT,

12:23.767 --> 12:26.833
THE LYNX AND LAST WINTER A

12:26.833 --> 12:27.767
INCREDIBLE DISCOVERY, A BROWN

12:27.767 --> 12:30.200
BEAR, THE FIRST EVER RECORDED IN

12:30.200 --> 12:30.867
EASTERN UKRAINE.

12:30.867 --> 12:34.100
>> DO YOU SAY THIS LOOKS LIKE A

12:34.100 --> 12:35.200
HEALTHIER ECOSYSTEM THAN AREAS

12:35.200 --> 12:36.733
OUTSIDE THE ZONE IN THE UKRAINE?

12:36.733 --> 12:38.200
>> ABSOLUTELY.

12:38.200 --> 12:42.700
ABSOLUTELY MUCH MORE HEALTHY.

12:42.700 --> 12:44.800
BECAUSE SINCE FOR WILDLIFE, MORE

12:44.800 --> 12:46.000
IMPORTANT, ABSENCE OF PEOPLE,

12:46.000 --> 12:49.200
ABSENCE OF THEIR ACTIVITY.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.733
>> BUT HE WILL NEED MORE

12:50.733 --> 12:52.467
EVIDENCE AND PUTTING CAMERA

12:52.467 --> 12:54.000
TRAPS IN AREAS OF THE ZONE THAT

12:54.000 --> 12:55.667
HAVE VARYING LEVELS OF FALLOUT,

12:55.667 --> 12:57.167
THEY ARE NOT JUST LOOKING BUT

12:57.167 --> 12:58.200
LISTENING.

12:58.200 --> 13:01.333
WHAT WE HAVE GOT HERE IS A

13:01.333 --> 13:02.667
WILDLIFE RECORDER, SO THIS IS

13:02.667 --> 13:05.000
GOING TO CAPTURE THE SOUNDSCAPE

13:05.000 --> 13:06.067
OF THE AREA THAT WE ARE IN.

13:06.067 --> 13:07.867
IT IS GOING TO CAPTURE THE NOISE

13:07.867 --> 13:10.333
FROM THE INVERT BRATS FLIES

13:10.333 --> 13:11.367
BUZZING AROUND AND CAPTURE

13:11.367 --> 13:12.800
SOUNDS OF THE BIRDS SINGING, IT

13:12.800 --> 13:14.833
WILL CAPTURE NOISES OF LARGE

13:14.833 --> 13:15.767
IMAGINE MALLS COMING THROUGH

13:15.767 --> 13:16.600
THIS AREA.

13:16.600 --> 13:17.200
>> NICE.

13:17.200 --> 13:21.767
>> IT WILL GIVE US A PICTURE,

13:21.767 --> 13:24.067
SOUND PICTURE OF THE WILDLIFE

13:24.067 --> 13:27.200
PRESENT IN THE AREA.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.167
>> THERE IS MUCH NEEDED

13:29.167 --> 13:31.533
RESEARCH, SOME PREVIOUS STUDIES

13:31.533 --> 13:32.900
HAVE CLAIMED TO FIND SERIOUS

13:32.900 --> 13:34.333
IMPACTS OF RADIOACTIVITY BUT SO

13:34.333 --> 13:37.200
FAR THIS TEAM'S WORK FOUND

13:37.200 --> 13:38.233
LITTLE EFFECT OUTSIDE OF THE

13:38.233 --> 13:39.000
MOST CONTAMINATED AREAS.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.367
>> THE STUDIES ARE QUITE

13:41.367 --> 13:43.467
CONFUSED AS TO WHETHER OR NOT

13:43.467 --> 13:46.867
THAT IS THE CASE, SO ACTUALLY

13:46.867 --> 13:48.100
HERE IN CHERNOBYL IT IS MORE TO

13:48.100 --> 13:50.633
LEARN ABOUT HOW THE ANIMALS IN

13:50.633 --> 13:52.200
CHERNOBYL ARE FAIRING FAIRING.

13:52.200 --> 13:54.200
THEY ARE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE

13:54.200 --> 13:56.367
AT THE POPULATION LEVEL THEN WE

13:56.367 --> 13:58.067
START NEED TO RETHINK OUR

13:58.067 --> 14:00.000
ASSESSMENT OF EXAMINING WHAT

14:00.000 --> 14:01.300
LEVEL CAN BE DESCRIBED AS SAFE.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.533
>> AND EVEN IN HIGHLY

14:03.533 --> 14:05.600
CONTAMINATED ANIMALS, THE

14:05.600 --> 14:06.800
SCIENTIFIC DEBATE ABOUT WHAT

14:06.800 --> 14:08.067
HARMFUL EFFECTS OF RADIATION

14:08.067 --> 14:10.533
REALLY ARE, AND STANDING NOW

14:10.533 --> 14:12.167
ABOVE THE COOLING PONDS OF THE

14:12.167 --> 14:14.533
REACTORS, TAKE A LOOK AT THESE

14:14.533 --> 14:15.100
FISH.

14:15.100 --> 14:17.033
>> THESE WILDCAT FISH HAVE GROWN

14:17.033 --> 14:18.933
UP TO EIGHT FEET LONG, THEY HAVE

14:18.933 --> 14:21.367
BEEN DESCRIBED AS RADIOACTIVE

14:21.367 --> 14:22.900
MUTANTS, AND IT IS TRUE.

14:22.900 --> 14:24.333
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN DAMAGE TO

14:24.333 --> 14:26.367
THEIR DNA FROM RADIOACTIVE MUD

14:26.367 --> 14:29.867
IN WHICH THEY FEED, BUT BY EVERY

14:29.867 --> 14:30.967
OTHER MEASURE THEY ARE HEALTHY

14:30.967 --> 14:32.067
AND NUMEROUS.

14:32.067 --> 14:34.600
THE TRUTH IS, THEY ARE BIG

14:34.600 --> 14:36.367
BECAUSE THEY LIKE BLOOD FROM

14:36.367 --> 14:37.533
VISITORS BUT NO ONE IS ALLOWED

14:37.533 --> 14:39.433
TO CATCH THEM.

14:39.433 --> 14:41.833
IT MAKES IT HARD NOW TO IMAGINE

14:41.833 --> 14:45.033
THE DISASTER IN THIS REACTOR

14:45.033 --> 14:47.533
RELEASED 400 TIMES INTO

14:47.533 --> 14:50.233
RADIOACTIVITY, FROM THE

14:50.233 --> 14:51.667
HIROSHIMA BOMB.

14:51.667 --> 14:54.700
>> THIS EXCLUSION ZONE IS NOT

14:54.700 --> 14:55.967
RADIOACTIVE ANYMORE BUT BECAUSE

14:55.967 --> 14:57.500
OF THE WAY THE FALLOUT FELL

14:57.500 --> 14:58.533
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE EXPLOSION

14:58.533 --> 15:00.300
SOME AREAS ARE STILL VERY

15:00.300 --> 15:01.333
RADIOACTIVE.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.933
THIS IS ABOUT 5000 TIMES NORMAL

15:03.933 --> 15:06.833
BACKGROUND RADIATION.

15:06.833 --> 15:09.133
IT IS HARMFUL IN SMALL DOSES BUT

15:09.133 --> 15:10.733
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO SPEND TOO

15:10.733 --> 15:11.900
LONG HERE AT ALL.

15:11.900 --> 15:14.033
BUT IT IS ALL RELATIVE.

15:14.033 --> 15:15.400
THE RADIATION DOSE WE RECEIVED

15:15.400 --> 15:16.767
DURING OUR ENTIRE TRIP TO THE

15:16.767 --> 15:18.100
ZONE WAS SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU

15:18.100 --> 15:20.400
WOULD GET FROM A SINGLE

15:20.400 --> 15:24.200
TRANSATLANTIC FLIGHT.

15:24.200 --> 15:26.533
>> SHE HAS AS MUCH RESPECT FOR

15:26.533 --> 15:28.367
RADIATION AS SHE DOES FOR

15:28.367 --> 15:29.300
AUTHORITY.

15:29.300 --> 15:31.533
>> SHE TELLS US HOW SHE SENT

15:31.533 --> 15:34.400
THEM PACKING MORE THAN ONCE.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.100
ORDERED TO LEAVE IN 1986, SHE

15:36.100 --> 15:38.200
CAME BACK A YEAR LATER TO LIVE

15:38.200 --> 15:39.900
IN THE HOUSE IN WHICH SHE WAS

15:39.900 --> 15:40.800
BORN.

15:40.800 --> 15:46.767
SHE IS 87.

15:46.767 --> 16:04.900
>>

16:04.900 --> 16:06.700
>> LEVELS THEY FOUND WEREN'T

16:06.700 --> 16:08.800
HIGH AND THIS IS THE GARDEN SHE

16:08.800 --> 16:11.667
FED HERSELF FROM EVERY DAY.

16:11.667 --> 16:12.800
HER ONLY REAL COMPLAINT IS THE

16:12.800 --> 16:15.367
LACK OF RAIN AND THE POTATO

16:15.367 --> 16:16.833
BEATLES EATING AWAY THROUGH HER

16:16.833 --> 16:17.533
SPUDS.

16:17.533 --> 16:18.733
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, IT WAS
