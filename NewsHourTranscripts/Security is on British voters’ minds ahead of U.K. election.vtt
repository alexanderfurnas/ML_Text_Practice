JUDY WOODRUFF: Campaigning has
ended in the fiercely contested
British general election.

00:07.433 --> 00:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Prime Minister Theresa May of
the Conservative Party called
the vote in order to boost her

00:10.100 --> 00:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
authority as Britain
negotiates its withdrawal
from the European Union.

00:14.733 --> 00:18.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Her main challenge
comes from Labor Party
leader, Jeremy Corbyn.

00:18.933 --> 00:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the campaign has
been overshadowed by two
recent terrorist attacks.

00:23.566 --> 00:27.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant reports from London.

00:27.166 --> 00:32.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Along with
many young Britons, Steve and
Keeley Whitton dream of raising

00:33.333 --> 00:36.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their children in a
home of their own.

00:36.666 --> 00:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
London's expensive real estate
is beyond their reach, and so
they live with Steve's parents.

00:41.466 --> 00:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But affordable housing isn't
top of their election agenda.

00:44.700 --> 00:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Saturday's terrorist attack, two
miles from where they live, is.

00:47.833 --> 00:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEELEY WHITTON, Voter: A couple
of times, actually, whenever
we have gone out, really,

00:50.533 --> 00:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have had the conversation,
what are we going to do
if something happens?

00:54.566 --> 00:57.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEVE WHITTON, Voter:
If something did happen,
just having a plan,
basically having -- so

00:57.133 --> 00:59.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I will grab one kid,
she will grab the other.

00:59.233 --> 01:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the past couple of weeks,
after the terrorist attacks in
Manchester and London, security

01:05.666 --> 01:10.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
has gone up in my own
agenda, as far as who
I'm going to vote for.

01:12.366 --> 01:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think a lot of people are
now looking, all right, who's
best going to deliver security?

01:15.066 --> 01:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Vigilance,
tolerance and remembrance
unite these people.

01:19.900 --> 01:24.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They're from Borough
Market, where the three
Islamist terrorists
lashed out with knives

01:24.733 --> 01:26.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
before being shot dead.

01:26.700 --> 01:30.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The traders have been kept away
from their businesses, while
forensics experts gathered

01:30.766 --> 01:31.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
evidence.

01:31.766 --> 01:33.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
VERY REV.

01:33.733 --> 01:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW NUNN, Dean of
Southwark: So, we're going
to keep a moment of silence.

01:35.800 --> 01:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're keeping it at the
other end of the bridge
in St. Paul's cathedral.

01:38.233 --> 01:39.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They know we're here.

01:39.733 --> 01:41.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We know they're there.

01:41.700 --> 01:45.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're standing in solidarity,
the two cathedrals and
our communities together.

01:47.900 --> 01:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Sir Simon
Hughes was the area's member
of Parliament for 32 years from

01:53.533 --> 01:56.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Liberal Democrats,
the third largest party.

01:56.100 --> 01:59.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He lost his seat to the
Labor candidate in 2015.

01:59.400 --> 02:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Winning it back would hurt
Labor and help Theresa May.

02:02.100 --> 02:04.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SIR SIMON HUGHES, Former
Justice Minister: Actually, the
public services are at the top

02:04.866 --> 02:06.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of people's agenda.

02:06.866 --> 02:10.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People want us to have the
police we need, the nurses
we need, the doctors we need.

02:10.466 --> 02:12.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is now an issue.

02:12.500 --> 02:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The security of the country,
dealing with the very few
people who want to disrupt us

02:15.100 --> 02:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a major political issue now
in this country, and it will be
the biggest issue on the desk

02:22.033 --> 02:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the incoming prime minister
and the incoming government.

02:24.600 --> 02:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The belief that
radicalization and terrorism
are fuelled by deprivation,

02:28.733 --> 02:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
social isolation, and
Britain's military campaigns
abroad will guide Jill Rose.

02:33.633 --> 02:35.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JILL ROSE, Voter:
There are two issues.

02:35.700 --> 02:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are the immediate, about
how we stop or try and stop
more terrorist attacks, and

02:41.566 --> 02:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then the bigger picture
that is equally important.

02:43.533 --> 02:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, for me, that means voting
Labor in terms of the approach,
changing this world that

02:49.466 --> 02:54.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
really goes back to the
cuts and the approach of
the current government.

02:56.500 --> 02:59.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Now would you please
welcome the leader of the
Labor Party, Jeremy Corbyn?

02:59.266 --> 03:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Jeremy
Corbyn's Achilles' heel is
security, say his critics.

03:03.633 --> 03:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They fear Britain's defense
would be weakened by a lifelong
self-professed pacifist taking

03:10.033 --> 03:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
control of Britain's Trident
nuclear missile system.

03:12.133 --> 03:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEREMY CORBYN, Leader, Labor
Party: We have to obviously
try to protect ourselves.

03:16.366 --> 03:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We wouldn't use it as first use.

03:18.866 --> 03:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And if we did use it,
millions are going to die.

03:21.933 --> 03:23.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have to think
these things through.

03:23.366 --> 03:25.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Close down NATO.

03:25.366 --> 03:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This
conservative ad uses Corbyn's
past and words to attack him.

03:29.500 --> 03:32.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEREMY CORBYN: Fight all
the cuts, except those
in the armed forces.

03:32.733 --> 03:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our friends from Hezbollah,
friends from Hamas.

03:34.933 --> 03:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATE HOEY, Labor M.P.: I don't
think people need fear because
he said something 30 years

03:39.433 --> 03:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ago or appeared with somebody.

03:40.933 --> 03:43.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, we have all had
our past and our histories.

03:43.466 --> 03:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Kate Hoey has
been a Labor M.P. for 28 years,
and her seat is under threat

03:48.166 --> 03:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
because she supported Brexit.

03:50.200 --> 03:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATE HOEY: I think Jeremy
would know that, being prime
minister, the first duty is to

03:53.566 --> 03:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
protect the British public.

03:55.566 --> 03:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, even though
he has said things in the
past, people grow into a job.

03:59.966 --> 04:02.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think I have
seen changes in Jeremy.

04:02.033 --> 04:05.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have known him for a very
long time, and even over the
last year, I have seen how he's

04:05.566 --> 04:08.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
changed, in terms of the
way he puts his views.

04:08.600 --> 04:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Please welcome the leader
of the Conservative Party, the
prime minister, Theresa May.

04:13.300 --> 04:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: When Theresa
May called the snap election
in April, the Conservatives

04:16.833 --> 04:19.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
were 17 percent ahead of Labor.

04:19.600 --> 04:23.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Her refusal to debate Corbyn
helped erode the advantage.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: You have called a general
election for the good of the
Conservative Party, and it's

04:26.200 --> 04:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to backfire on you.

04:27.733 --> 04:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THERESA MAY, British Prime
Minister: No, I called...

04:31.033 --> 04:33.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

04:33.166 --> 04:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THERESA MAY: I called a general
election because I believe that
the British people have a right

04:38.900 --> 04:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to vote and to say who they
want to see leading them
through the Brexit negotiations.

04:41.933 --> 04:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW PARRIS, Columnist,
The Times: She has personally
been winged like a bird's been

04:46.033 --> 04:47.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
winged.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She has appeared
inadequate and indecisive.

04:49.500 --> 04:54.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She has changed her
mind, and pretended that
she hasn't changed her
mind, and I don't think

04:55.833 --> 04:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people will ever see her in
quite the same way again.

04:57.866 --> 05:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: From his
Thames-side warehouse loft,
former conservative M.P.

05:00.766 --> 05:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Matthew Parris, now a respected
columnist, has written some
damning commentaries about

05:05.400 --> 05:07.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the prime minister.

05:07.900 --> 05:11.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW PARRIS: She doesn't
have those quicksilver
qualities that are perhaps
needed in a statesman

05:12.266 --> 05:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and needed in negotiation.

05:13.833 --> 05:15.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
She's rigid.

05:15.400 --> 05:18.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
THERESA MAY: The
conservative party can
build a better Britain.

05:18.100 --> 05:22.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This song,
banned from the air by the BBC,
has hit the top of the British

05:22.366 --> 05:23.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
charts.

05:23.566 --> 05:27.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN (singing):
She's a liar, liar.

05:27.033 --> 05:29.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Oh, she's a liar, liar.

05:29.833 --> 05:32.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Oh, you can't trust
her, no, no, no.

05:32.533 --> 05:36.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But above this
betting shop in East London,
there's optimism in the campaign

05:36.766 --> 05:40.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
office of Conservative
candidate Lee Scott.

05:40.033 --> 05:45.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's trying to reclaim a seat
lost to Labor in 2015, and
says he's reaping the benefit

05:46.400 --> 05:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of May's promise to
crack down on extremists.

05:48.433 --> 05:51.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LEE SCOTT, Candidate
for Parliament: They
are totally committed
to going out and voting

05:51.966 --> 05:54.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for me.

05:54.033 --> 05:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SASHA JOHNSTON, Voter: Anyone
slightly to the right is being
made to feel almost guilty

05:56.100 --> 05:58.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to have to be center-right.

05:58.200 --> 06:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEE SCOTT: You know, they want
to try and make people feel
guilty to love their country,

06:02.066 --> 06:06.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
guilty to want to stand
up for what's right,
guilty for wanting to
try to have a firm law

06:06.633 --> 06:07.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and order policy.

06:07.633 --> 06:09.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're not going to work.

06:09.666 --> 06:12.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on the doorsteps, people
are saying to me that it's
about strong leadership.

06:12.266 --> 06:16.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that strong leadership
is coming from Theresa May,
certainly not from Mr. Corbyn.

06:16.166 --> 06:20.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The latest
opinion polls suggest that
Theresa May's gamble will pay

06:20.000 --> 06:23.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
off, and that she will be
returned to office with
an increased majority.

06:23.600 --> 06:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But many pollsters have been
wrong in the recent past, most
notably failing to correctly

06:27.833 --> 06:31.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
predict the Brexit vote during
last year's E.U. referendum.

06:31.600 --> 06:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant in London.

06:35.966 --> 06:40.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
Thank you, Malcolm.
