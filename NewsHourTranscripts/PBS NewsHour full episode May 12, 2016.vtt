JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:05.472 --> 00:06.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:

00:08.308 --> 00:11.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House:
We talked about what it takes to
unify, where

00:11.812 --> 00:13.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our differences were and how we
can bridge
these gaps.

00:13.981 --> 00:18.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In a bid for
party unity, House
Speaker Paul Ryan and other top
Republican

00:19.086 --> 00:21.021 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
leaders meet with Donald Trump.

00:21.121 --> 00:25.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Thursday:
Brazil's unpopular President
Dilma Rousseff

00:25.559 --> 00:30.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is suspended and could be
removed from office,
in the wake of economic and
political turmoil.

00:30.597 --> 00:35.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we head to
Puerto Rico,
where the island battles to
contain an outbreak

00:35.836 --> 00:37.738 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Zika virus.

00:37.838 --> 00:39.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AMARILYS ALVAREZ SANCHEZ,
Nutritionist (through
translator): There is a lack of
understanding

00:39.773 --> 00:45.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in sexual relations, and that
the virus can
be transmitted from the father
to the mother.

00:45.178 --> 00:49.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Women will laugh and say they're
already pregnant,
but they don't realize the need
for condoms.

00:50.017 --> 00:52.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:52.686 --> 00:56.690 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:56.790 --> 01:09.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Republican
presidential
drama shifted today to a new
stage, Washington.

01:10.070 --> 01:15.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The man who's now all but
certain to be the
party's presidential nominee
went behind closed

01:15.175 --> 01:19.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doors with party leaders who had
wanted someone
else.

01:19.179 --> 01:21.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has our report.

01:21.181 --> 01:26.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: This morning, Donald
Trump went
to the headquarters of the
institution he's

01:26.386 --> 01:31.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shaken to its foundation, the
Republican Party.
He met for about an hour with
House Speaker

01:31.959 --> 01:37.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Paul Ryan, who has yet to
endorse Trump, chaperoned
by party chair Reince Priebus.

01:37.331 --> 01:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REINCE PRIEBUS, Republican
National Committee
Chairman: It was cooperative.
There was a

01:39.666 --> 01:43.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
good spirit in the room. So, I'm
very hopeful.
I thought it was great.

01:43.670 --> 01:48.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In a joint statement,
Trump and
Ryan struck a conciliatory tone,
calling it:

01:48.775 --> 01:54.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"A great conversation. While we
were honest
about our few differences, we
recognize that

01:54.548 --> 01:59.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are also many important
areas of common
ground and it was a very
positive step toward

02:00.053 --> 02:01.455 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unification."

02:01.555 --> 02:05.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a news conference, Â®MDNM-Ryan
stressed
the things that unite them.

02:05.459 --> 02:08.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House:
Look, here's what we agree on. A
Hillary Clinton

02:08.829 --> 02:13.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presidency would be a disaster
for this country.
It's effectively a third Obama
term, and the

02:13.867 --> 02:19.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other thing we all know is most
Americans
do not like where this country
is headed.

02:19.239 --> 02:23.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: While there was still
no endorsement,
Ryan said it was a good
beginning to try to

02:24.077 --> 02:28.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meld Trump's populist followers
with Ryan's
small-government brand of
conservatism.

02:28.782 --> 02:33.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN: The question is,
what is it
that we need to do to unify the
Republican

02:33.453 --> 02:39.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Party and all strains of
conservative wings
in the party? We had a very good
and encouraging

02:39.192 --> 02:41.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
productive conversation on just
how to do
that.

02:41.361 --> 02:47.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Later, Trump tweeted:
"Great day
in D.C. with Speaker Ryan and
Republican leadership.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Things working out really well."

02:49.836 --> 02:53.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In his news conference, Ryan
made clear there
are principles he will not
abandon.

02:54.041 --> 02:57.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN: Look, there are
just things
we really believe in as
conservatives. We

02:57.544 --> 03:01.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
believe in limited government.
We believe
in the Constitution. We believe
in the proper

03:01.681 --> 03:04.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
role of the differences and the
separations
of powers.

03:04.885 --> 03:08.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
These are things that are
important to us,
and so we just had a good
exchange of views

03:08.388 --> 03:10.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on these kinds of issues.

03:10.390 --> 03:15.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Ryan's reluctance to
fully embrace
Trump reflects concerns by
Republican lawmakers

03:15.495 --> 03:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about facing voters this fall
with Trump at
the top of the ticket.

03:20.300 --> 03:24.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Norman Ornstein is a scholar at
the conservative
American Enterprise Institute.
He says Ryan

03:24.938 --> 03:26.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is walking a tightrope.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NORMAN ORNSTEIN, Resident
Scholar, American
Enterprise Institute: Ryan is a
smart guy

03:28.542 --> 03:35.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who understands that the Trump
candidacy for
an awful lot of voters is
radioactive. So,

03:35.282 --> 03:42.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
partly, what Ryan was doing was
giving a little
cover for his colleagues in the
House when

03:42.255 --> 03:48.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they go out there to run,
showing that you
can get a little distance from
Trump without

03:48.595 --> 03:53.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
completely trashing him and
alienating his
own backers.

03:53.967 --> 04:01.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Outside today's
meeting, a crush
of cameras and protests over
immigration created

04:01.475 --> 04:02.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a circus-like atmosphere.

04:02.876 --> 04:06.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PROTESTER: When our communities
are under
attack, what do we do?

04:06.246 --> 04:07.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PROTESTERS: Stand up, fight
back!

04:08.048 --> 04:12.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Congressional
Democrats seemed
to relish the Republicans'
apparent disarray,

04:12.285 --> 04:16.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senate Minority Leader Harry
Reid jabbing
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,
who also

04:16.990 --> 04:18.692 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
met with Trump.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. HARRY REID (D-NV), Minority
Leader: Since
Senator McConnell has so
enthusiastically

04:20.560 --> 04:24.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
embraced Trump, we can only
assume he agrees
with Trump's view that women are
dogs and

04:24.965 --> 04:26.867 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pigs.

04:26.967 --> 04:32.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can only assume that the
Republican leader
is not repulsed by Donald
Trump's vulgar behavior

04:32.539 --> 04:34.374 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
towards women.

04:34.474 --> 04:39.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But the Democrats'
presidential
contest continues to threaten
their own party

04:39.246 --> 04:45.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unity. Front-runner Hillary
Clinton was in
New York, and Bernie Sanders and
his underdog

04:45.418 --> 04:51.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign traveled to Mount
Rushmore, where
South Dakota holds its primary
on June 7.

04:51.424 --> 04:55.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang on Capitol
Hill.

04:55.362 --> 04:59.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the day's
other news:
A federal judge in Washington
struck down

04:59.332 --> 05:04.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
federal spending to subsidize
health care
for low-income Americans. It
comes to $175

05:04.971 --> 05:10.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
billion over a decade. House
Republicans argued
the Obama administration is
spending the money

05:10.210 --> 05:14.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
without congressional approval,
and the judge
agreed. The White House plans an
appeal.

05:15.081 --> 05:20.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Islamic State
suicide bombers
struck again in Iraq today, just
a day after

05:20.420 --> 05:26.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
killing nearly 100 people in
Baghdad. This
time, they blew up two truck
bombs in the

05:26.193 --> 05:31.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
recently liberated city of
Ramadi; 17 Iraqi
solders were killed.

05:31.631 --> 05:37.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in Baghdad, Prime Minister
Haider al-Abadi
visited victims of yesterday's
attacks. And

05:37.437 --> 05:40.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two more bombings in the city
killed five
people today.

05:40.840 --> 05:46.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In Syria, a
cease-fire expired
in Aleppo, and fighting flared
north of the

05:46.479 --> 05:51.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
city. Government forces battled
rebels for
control of a district just north
of the city.

05:51.718 --> 05:54.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It sits on the supply route to
rebel-held
portions of Aleppo.

05:54.821 --> 06:00.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The United States
powered up
an $800 million missile shield
in Romania

06:00.460 --> 06:06.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
today, drawing the ire of
Russia. The site
has been in the works for years
to stave off

06:06.132 --> 06:11.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
potential ballistic missiles
fired toward
Europe. U.S. and NATO officials
attended today's

06:11.638 --> 06:14.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ceremony at the remote Romanian
site.

06:14.841 --> 06:19.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Deputy Defense Secretary Robert
Work insisted
the focus is on Iran, and not
Moscow.

06:20.046 --> 06:24.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT WORK, U.S. Deputy Defense
Secretary:
It was never, ever about Russia.
We have offered

06:24.150 --> 06:28.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the Russians to show them the
technical
specs. We have done everything
we can to try

06:28.922 --> 06:35.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to make sure that they
understand the capability
of the system and why it doesn't
pose any

06:35.929 --> 06:38.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
type of a threat to their
strategic deterrence.

06:38.732 --> 06:43.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Even so, a senior
Russian Foreign
Ministry official called the
shield part of

06:43.336 --> 06:49.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- quote -- "the military and
political containment
of Russia." He said the move
will hurt efforts

06:49.342 --> 06:51.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to repair ties with NATO.

06:51.278 --> 06:55.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Turkey lashed
out at the
European Union today over
letting Turks travel

06:56.082 --> 07:00.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
within the E.U. without visas.
It's part of
an agreement to curb the flow of
migrants.

07:00.654 --> 07:06.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the E.U. says the deal also
calls for
Turkey to reform its terrorism
laws, and not

07:06.126 --> 07:08.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to target journalists and
political opponents.

07:09.029 --> 07:13.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Ankara today, Turkish
President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan said that issue is an
internal matter.

07:13.900 --> 07:19.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, Turkish
President (through
translator): You see the E.U.'s
attitude.

07:19.105 --> 07:23.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is it? The E.U. says we
should soften
our stance in fight against
terrorism and

07:23.476 --> 07:28.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against terror organizations.
Since when have
you, the E.U., started to govern
Turkey?

07:28.315 --> 07:32.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Since the
migrant deal took
effect, the numbers crossing
from Turkey have

07:32.218 --> 07:36.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fallen dramatically. Still, the
E.U. today
allowed five member countries to
maintain

07:36.556 --> 07:38.825 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
new border controls for another
six months.

07:38.925 --> 07:43.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The government of
Malaysia
says two more pieces of debris
have been found

07:43.596 --> 07:50.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Malaysia Airlines Flight
370. The jetliner
disappeared more than two years
ago off Western

07:50.103 --> 07:56.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Australia, with 239 people on
board. The latest
debris was discovered in South
Africa and

07:56.843 --> 08:02.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on Rodrigues Island off
Mauritius. But they
offer no clue as to what
happened to the plane.

08:02.682 --> 08:08.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Back in this
country, Senate
negotiators have agreed on $1.1
billion in

08:08.421 --> 08:12.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
emergency funding to fight the
Zika virus.
That's less than President Obama
wanted, and

08:12.692 --> 08:16.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
it's likely to be reduced
further in the House.
Zika is linked to severe birth
defects and

08:17.063 --> 08:22.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has spread across the Americas.
But health
officials are not predicting
widespread outbreaks

08:22.335 --> 08:24.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the United States.

08:24.304 --> 08:28.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: U.S. energy
companies are going
to have to find ways to cut
methane emissions

08:28.608 --> 08:35.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by nearly half over the next
decade. The Environmental
Protection Agency issued a final
rule today.

08:35.281 --> 08:41.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It says producers have to repair
leaks at
wellheads and capture gas that
escapes during

08:41.187 --> 08:45.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
hydraulic fracturing, or

HARI SREENIVASAN: Wall Street
had a lackluster
day. The Dow Jones industrial
average gained

08:49.195 --> 08:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nine points to close at 17720.
The Nasdaq
fell 23 points, and the S&amp;P 500
slipped a

08:54.134 --> 08:55.935 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fraction.

08:56.035 --> 09:00.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Pope Francis
is signaling
openness to a greater role for
women in the

09:00.373 --> 09:06.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Roman Catholic Church. He agreed
today to
have a commission study whether
to allow female

09:06.379 --> 09:11.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deacons. They'd preside over
weddings and
funerals, plus other functions.

09:11.351 --> 09:15.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the pope gave no indication
that he'd
consider admitting women to the
priesthood.

09:15.488 --> 09:20.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Still to come
on the "NewsHour":
Brazil's president suspended
amid corruption

09:20.660 --> 09:25.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
charges; new details in the
doping charges
against Russian athletes; Puerto

of grit and
what it takes to succeed; and
much more.

09:42.582 --> 09:47.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Months of political turmoil in
Brazil reached
a divisive climax early today,
as Dilma Rousseff,

09:48.054 --> 09:51.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president of South America's
largest nation,
found herself on the losing end
of a vote

09:52.058 --> 09:57.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Brazil's Senate that could
ultimately remove
her from office.

09:57.397 --> 10:01.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dilma Rousseff emerged from the
presidential
palace in Brasilia this morning
to throngs

10:01.835 --> 10:06.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of cheering, flag-waving
supporters. She greeted
the crowd, and declared her
defiance.

10:06.673 --> 10:11.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DILMA ROUSSEFF, Brazilian
President (through
translator): This process is a
coup, because

10:11.377 --> 10:15.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's an impeachment without a
crime. I didn't
commit a crime of
responsibility. I am being

10:15.982 --> 10:18.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the target, a victim of a great
injustice.

10:18.384 --> 10:22.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Rousseff's
impassioned speech
came just hours after Brazil's
Senate voted

10:22.956 --> 10:29.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
55-22 to remove her from office,
at least
temporarily. Her critics
included another

10:29.562 --> 10:31.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
former president who was
impeached in 1992.

10:31.531 --> 10:35.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FERNANDO COLLOR DE MELLO, Former
President
of Brazil (through translator):
We arrived

10:35.602 --> 10:39.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the peak of a crisis. We have
arrived at
the ruin of a government, at the
ruin of a

10:39.439 --> 10:44.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country. The greatest crime of
responsibility
is in the irresponsibility and
disregard of

10:44.477 --> 10:48.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
politics, the irresponsibility
for the deterioration
of the economy of a country.

10:48.915 --> 10:52.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Supporters of
Rousseff,
including Brazil's attorney
general, branded

10:52.452 --> 10:54.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the move a historic injustice.

10:54.487 --> 10:58.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE EDUARDO CARDOZO, Brazilian
Attorney General
(through translator): An honest
and innocent

10:58.324 --> 11:02.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
woman, right at this moment, IS
being condemned.
A judicial presence is being
used to oust

11:02.996 --> 11:07.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a legitimately elected
president. An innocent
person is being condemned.

11:07.634 --> 11:13.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Outside,
pro-Rousseff demonstrators
briefly clashed with police. But
in cities

11:13.206 --> 11:18.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
across the country, there were
fireworks celebrating
the vote. The divisions were
evident everywhere.

11:18.845 --> 11:23.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I used
to like Dilma
a lot, but at this moment I
think Brazil should

11:23.816 --> 11:26.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be congratulated, and I am sure
things will
get much better.

11:26.753 --> 11:31.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): It
is very saddening
to know that an honest woman
will lose the

11:31.424 --> 11:33.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
presidency and was judged by
criminals.

11:33.760 --> 11:39.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The drive to
take down Rousseff
began last year as anger spread
over an extensive

11:39.132 --> 11:44.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
corruption scandal at Petrobras,
Brazil's
state-owned oil company.
Rousseff herself

11:44.771 --> 11:49.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was never implicated in the
corruption. Instead,
she was charged with
manipulating government

11:50.009 --> 11:55.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
accounts to cover up the
country's deficit.
She insisted her decisions were
entirely legal.

11:55.882 --> 12:00.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DILMA ROUSSEFF (through
translator): I carried
out those actions. These actions
have been

12:00.787 --> 12:03.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
taken by all the presidents of
the republic
who have been in office.

12:04.023 --> 12:08.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Even so, the
impeachment
process morphed into a
referendum on Rousseff's

12:09.062 --> 12:15.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
entire presidency, as the worst
downturn in
decades laid waste to the
country's economy.

12:15.301 --> 12:18.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Simon Romero is the Brazil
bureau chief for
The New York Times.

12:18.338 --> 12:22.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIMON ROMERO, The New York
Times: There was
a booming economy back in the
previous decade.

12:22.842 --> 12:29.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was an emerging powerhouse on
the global
stage. But Brazil's own
recession has just

12:29.315 --> 12:35.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
become so severe and the wounds
to the economy
are to be self-inflicted by the
policies that

12:35.154 --> 12:41.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dilma Rousseff was championing
just a few
years ago, that really her
government just

12:41.294 --> 12:43.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
became unsustainable in that
sense.

12:43.363 --> 12:48.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Rousseff was
elected president
in 2010, the first woman to hold
the office.

12:48.868 --> 12:54.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She'd once belonged to a Marxist
guerrilla
group and was tortured during
years of a military

12:54.607 --> 12:59.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dictatorship. But she endured,
and ultimately
became chief of staff in the
administration

12:59.545 --> 13:05.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of popular leftist President
Luiz Inacio Lula
da Silva, during which 30
million people were

13:05.718 --> 13:09.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brought out of poverty. Rousseff
was his handpicked
successor.

13:09.956 --> 13:16.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now the Senate has 180 days to
hold a trial,
and decide whether to make her
removal permanent.

13:16.596 --> 13:19.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She insisted today she's far
from finished.

13:19.465 --> 13:24.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DILMA ROUSSEFF (through
translator): We will
remain united, mobilized, and
peaceful. We

13:24.504 --> 13:27.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are those that know how to fight
the daily
fight.

13:27.206 --> 13:33.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For now, the
75-year-old
vice president, Michel Temer, is
acting president.

13:33.246 --> 13:38.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's promised to cut spending
and privatize
many state-controlled sectors,
but he's also

13:38.151 --> 13:40.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been implicated in the Petrobras
scandal.

13:40.253 --> 13:44.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIMON ROMERO: The most recent
poll by one
of the country's biggest polling
companies

13:45.091 --> 13:49.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
put his approval ratings in the
single digits,
and only 2 percent of the
respondents in that

13:50.096 --> 13:54.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
poll said that they would vote
for him for
president. So he's really
starting with low

13:54.367 --> 13:56.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
expectations at this point.

13:56.202 --> 14:00.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All of this as
Brazil is
struggling with the Zika virus.
And in just

14:00.273 --> 14:07.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
under three months, Rio de
Janeiro will host
the Olympic Games.

14:07.413 --> 14:23.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: new
revelations about
an elaborate scheme of alleged
doping at the

14:23.229 --> 14:29.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2014 Winter Olympics. A top
Russian Olympic
official says that his
government orchestrated

14:29.535 --> 14:34.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a plan to supply dozens of
athletes with
performance-enhancing
drugs.

14:34.640 --> 14:40.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The head of Russia's anti-doping
lab during
the competition in Sochi,
Russia, Grigory

14:40.813 --> 14:47.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rodchenkov, told The New York
Times he created
a cocktail of drugs for a
state-run doping

14:47.120 --> 14:54.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
program that included 15 medal
winners. Among
those alleged to have received
drugs are members

14:54.227 --> 15:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the cross-country ski team
and two bobsledders
who won two gold medals.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russian officials deny the
accusations.

15:03.970 --> 15:08.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rebecca Ruiz is one of The Times
reporters,
and she joins me now.

15:08.574 --> 15:11.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rebecca, thank you for talking
with us.

15:11.978 --> 15:16.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There have been rumors, I guess,
in the air
for a long time about banned
substances being

15:16.616 --> 15:20.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
used by Russian athletes. What
exactly did
you learn?

15:20.319 --> 15:24.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBECCA RUIZ, The New York
Times: Well, not
just rumors, Judy. It's
fascinating, because

15:24.290 --> 15:32.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia does lead the world in
doping violations
among its athletes
internationally.

15:32.431 --> 15:40.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what is fascinating, Mr.
Rodchenkov provided
incredible details that in many
ways validated

15:40.439 --> 15:47.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a report that came out last
fall. It was published
by the World Anti-Doping Agency,
and it was

15:47.613 --> 15:52.585 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
the result of an
almost-year-long inquiry.
He confirmed a lot of what the
WADA report

15:52.685 --> 15:54.854 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
had said broadly.

15:54.954 --> 16:01.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The WADA report said that at the
Olympic laboratory
in Sochi in 2014, there had been
a police

16:01.561 --> 16:08.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presence, that FSB officers, the
Russian police,
had been present on site in the
laboratory.

16:08.568 --> 16:11.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Some had been seen in lab coats.

16:11.938 --> 16:19.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He provided details that some of
those agents
he worked with every night to
substitute out

16:19.445 --> 16:25.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the tainted urine of top Russian
athletes
who were expected to win medals
at the Games.

16:25.218 --> 16:29.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, essentially,
he is saying
the government was behind this?

16:29.188 --> 16:36.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBECCA RUIZ: He is saying that
the sports
ministry gave him direct orders
to operate,

16:36.762 --> 16:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to follow -- to execute these
orders and to
-- quote, unquote -- "win at any
cost."

16:40.466 --> 16:45.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Rebecca, why
is he, why
is Mr. Rodchenkov coming
forward? Why is he

16:45.271 --> 16:47.139 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
talking?

16:47.240 --> 16:51.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBECCA RUIZ: Well, ahead of the
Summer Games
in Rio, which are in three
months, Mr. Rodchenkov

16:51.477 --> 16:58.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said he wants it known that
there is state-sponsored
doping in Russia, that a lot of
these athletes

16:58.217 --> 17:04.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are due to compete in Rio,
he said, without
providing names of those
competing in the

17:04.690 --> 17:10.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Summer Games, that they have
been on his three-drug
cocktail in years past.

17:10.196 --> 17:15.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, meanwhile, track and field
athletes,
Russia's track and field
athletes were suspended

17:15.167 --> 17:20.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from global competition in the
wake of the
report last fall. So, currently,
officials

17:20.873 --> 17:27.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are deciding whether that ban
will be lifted
in advance of the Olympics in
August.

17:27.680 --> 17:32.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We saw that the
Russian government
is saying it isn't true. He said
this is simply

17:32.551 --> 17:36.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a continuation of the
information attack on
Russian sport.

17:37.089 --> 17:41.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBECCA RUIZ: Yes, that's what
officials told
us as well, and we absolutely
included their

17:41.627 --> 17:46.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
denials of our allegations. We
reached out
to the six sports federations
whose athletes

17:46.265 --> 17:51.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were implicated, whose names we
had in this
spreadsheet that showed dozens
of athletes

17:51.737 --> 17:59.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who competed at the Sochi Games
who Mr. Rodchenkov
says doped throughout the games
and many of

17:59.478 --> 18:01.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
whom captured medals.

18:01.347 --> 18:06.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is Mr. Rodchenkov
safe in the
United States? I ask because you
report that

18:06.319 --> 18:13.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
two of his former close
colleagues back in
Russia died unexpectedly a few
months ago,

18:13.392 --> 18:14.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just within a few weeks of each
other.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REBECCA RUIZ: That's correct.

18:17.096 --> 18:21.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In fact, he departed in
November. He fled
to the United States, fearing
for his safety.

18:21.667 --> 18:26.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He went to Los Angeles. We're
not giving any
specifics about his location
beyond that.

18:26.806 --> 18:34.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But two of his close colleagues
from the anti-doping
world did die unexpectedly,
suddenly, in February

18:34.780 --> 18:36.449 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
within weeks of each other.

18:36.549 --> 18:40.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just finally,
Rebecca,
is the International Olympic
Committee, is

18:40.720 --> 18:42.755 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
anyone investigating this now?

18:42.855 --> 18:47.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBECCA RUIZ: We contacted the
International
Olympic Committee today. They
said that they

18:47.193 --> 18:53.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were worried about these very
detailed allegations,
and they called on WADA, the
World Anti-Doping

18:53.399 --> 18:58.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Agency, to act and to
investigate his specific
claims.

18:58.871 --> 19:05.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WADA, meanwhile, has had board
meetings today
in Canada, and we have been
unable to connect

19:05.878 --> 19:11.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with any WADA official by phone
and to get
specific answers to our
questions. But they

19:11.450 --> 19:17.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have said that they are looking
into allegations
of doping by Russian athletes
throughout the

19:17.523 --> 19:22.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Olympic Games in Sochi, not just
before the
Games, in the lead-up to the
Games, as Mr.

19:22.194 --> 19:28.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rodchenkov also said happened at
past competitions,
leading up to Beijing, leading
up to London.

19:28.868 --> 19:33.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he says that, throughout the
entirety
of the Sochi Games, Russian
athletes were

19:33.639 --> 19:34.440 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
doping.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, quite a
story.

19:36.208 --> 19:39.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rebecca Ruiz, who reported on
this for The
New York Times, we thank you.

19:39.378 --> 19:47.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REBECCA RUIZ: Thank you very
much, Judy.

19:47.520 --> 19:57.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now the second in
our two-part
series about Puerto Rico's major
troubles.

19:57.663 --> 20:02.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Zika outbreak is hitting the
island sharply
this spring. And it's expected
to get worse,

20:03.002 --> 20:07.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a source of major concern for
women living
and visiting there.

20:07.773 --> 20:12.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown recently went to
Puerto Rico
to see how officials are
grappling with Zika.

20:12.711 --> 20:18.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: At the emergency
operations
center in San Juan last week, it
was day 90

20:18.350 --> 20:20.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the island's battle with
Zika.

20:20.252 --> 20:22.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HECTOR COLON, Deputy Director,
Puerto Rico
Department of Health: There is
in red has

20:22.254 --> 20:24.256 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
26 to 50 cases.

20:24.356 --> 20:29.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This center is
used to dealing
with hurricanes and other
emergencies. But

20:29.328 --> 20:34.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
priority number one now is the
mosquito-borne
virus that's been spreading here
since last

20:34.967 --> 20:39.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
December, with some 785 cases so
far.

20:39.171 --> 20:47.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Deputy Director Hector Colon
showed us how
teams stay in touch with
hospitals, and call

20:47.847 --> 20:53.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
individuals to offer counseling
and information
on how to protect their
families. The most

20:53.385 --> 20:55.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
urgent focus is on pregnant
women.

20:55.554 --> 21:02.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HECTOR COLON: We monitor
especially the pregnant
women that test positive to
Zika. We offer

21:02.561 --> 21:09.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them to do a test. And the ones
that test
positive, we monitor them very
closely once

21:09.435 --> 21:11.337 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they give birth.

21:11.437 --> 21:15.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The fear is that
Puerto Ricans
will experience what was first
seen in Brazil:

21:15.574 --> 21:21.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
babies born with abnormally
small heads and
brain damage, a condition known
as microcephaly.

21:21.914 --> 21:27.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mysteries abound with Zika,
including why
birth defects occur and who is
most susceptible.

21:27.553 --> 21:31.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most adults who get the virus
have few or
no symptoms.

21:31.223 --> 21:37.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Puerto Rico, with its warm and
wet climate,
its economy in a shambles, is a
prime breeding

21:37.396 --> 21:43.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ground for mosquitoes and the
virus they bring.
No cases of microcephaly have
been reported

21:43.502 --> 21:47.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here so far, but there has been
one death
associated with the virus, and
the Centers

21:47.907 --> 21:54.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Disease Control predicts
that an astounding
20 percent of the island's 3.5
million people

21:54.113 --> 21:59.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will likely contract Zika this
year, all this
while the government is
defaulting on its

21:59.652 --> 22:02.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
debt and cutting back on
services.

22:02.655 --> 22:05.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In San Juan, we found a range of
reactions.

22:05.858 --> 22:09.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I'm not afraid of Zika.

22:09.528 --> 22:11.530 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Why not? Why not?

22:11.630 --> 22:17.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I guess because it hasn't
been near
by me. I have never met anyone
who has been

22:17.269 --> 22:24.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sick of Zika or any kind of
danger about the
mosquitoes.

22:24.543 --> 22:25.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: It's dangerous.

22:25.477 --> 22:27.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes? Are you
afraid?

22:27.379 --> 22:36.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Yes, I'm a little, because
the women
are pregnant have a lot of
consequences because

22:36.622 --> 22:38.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the mosquito that bites and
it has the
virus, the Zika.

22:38.724 --> 22:42.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Mosquito-borne
diseases are
nothing new here. But Zika
presents major

22:42.628 --> 22:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new challenges, to understand
it, prevent
it, to educate people about it,
while avoiding

22:48.033 --> 22:51.103 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fear and panic.

22:51.203 --> 22:57.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a women, infant and children,
or WIC, center,
we watched a counseling session
for two pregnant

22:57.876 --> 23:00.079 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
women.

23:00.179 --> 23:05.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Neither Katherine Merced nor
Nicole Ramirez
has contracted Zika, but they
told us they

23:05.150 --> 23:06.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
had plenty of questions.

23:06.885 --> 23:08.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLE RAMIREZ, Expecting Mother
(through
translator): In the first three
months of

23:08.821 --> 23:14.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pregnancy, I heard that Off had
a chemical
that could lead to
complications, so I didn't

23:14.159 --> 23:15.995 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
put it on.

23:16.095 --> 23:17.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHERINE MERCED, Expecting
Mother (through
translator): I'm terrified,
worried more than

23:17.663 --> 23:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anybody, because it could be
sexually transmitted
to me.

23:20.833 --> 23:26.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In fact, says
nutritionist
Amarilys Alvarez Sanchez,
repellents such

23:26.205 --> 23:31.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as Off are safe, but Zika can
still be transmitted
sexually.

23:31.443 --> 23:36.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AMARILYS ALVAREZ SANCHEZ,
Nutritionist (through
translator): There is a lack of
understanding

23:36.582 --> 23:42.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in sexual relations, and that
the virus can
be transmitted from the father
to the mother.

23:42.221 --> 23:47.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Women will laugh and say they're
already pregnant,
but they don't realize the need
for condoms.

23:47.192 --> 23:52.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Condoms must be
used, that
is, even after a woman is
pregnant.

23:52.398 --> 23:58.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a nearby room, CDC behavioral
scientist
Melissa Mercado conducted a
focus group to

23:58.537 --> 24:04.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
learn what women know about
Zika, what questions
they have, and where public
education efforts

24:04.276 --> 24:05.978 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
might reach them.

24:06.078 --> 24:07.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MELISSA MERCADO, Centers for
Disease Control
and Prevention: We are trying to
reach to

24:08.013 --> 24:11.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the women, so we also need to
know what types
of media they are using, so that
the message

24:11.717 --> 24:17.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually gets to her and to them
in a way
that it's most accessible and
clear. We want

24:17.389 --> 24:23.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
information to be clear in what
they need
to know to protect themselves
and their babies.

24:23.996 --> 24:36.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In the meantime,
research goes
on at CDC labs on the outskirts
of San Juan.

24:36.442 --> 24:42.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Roberto Barrera heads a team in
the entomology
and ecology section that's
studying Zika-transmitting

24:42.214 --> 24:46.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yellow-fever mosquitoes to
better understand
how to eradicate them.

24:46.118 --> 24:47.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. ROBERTO BARRERA, Centers for
Disease Control
and Prevention: You're looking
at thousands

24:47.619 --> 24:49.455 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of eggs.

24:49.555 --> 24:52.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's a big
problem, since they
have built up resistance to
permethrin, the

24:52.324 --> 24:54.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
most commonly used insecticide.

24:54.893 --> 24:58.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dr. Barrera showed us a strain
raised in the
lab.

24:58.597 --> 25:06.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. ROBERTO BARRERA: So, you
compare the response
of a local mosquito and with
this mosquito

25:06.305 --> 25:11.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that has been in a lab for so
long. And you
compare, and you can evaluate
the degree of

25:11.377 --> 25:13.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
resistance to the insecticide
that you're
testing.

25:14.079 --> 25:17.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Field workers set
traps like
these around the island to
gather mosquito

25:18.083 --> 25:20.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
eggs, which are then raised in
the lab.

25:20.285 --> 25:25.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this is where you bring the
live mosquitoes
to test the insecticides?

25:25.491 --> 25:30.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a separate trailer, Barrera
and other researchers
try out different insecticides
and use timers

25:30.963 --> 25:32.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to measure the effect.

25:32.464 --> 25:35.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. ROBERTO BARRERA: The idea is
to raise
the survival or the mortality.

25:35.834 --> 25:41.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Higher-tech
equipment was being
used in the diagnostic
laboratory next door,

25:41.607 --> 25:45.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where scientists study samples
of the virus
to distinguish it from other
mosquito-borne

25:46.044 --> 25:51.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
illnesses, such as dengue, that
are also endemic
to the island.

25:51.283 --> 25:53.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Dr. Jorge Munoz heads this one.

25:53.185 --> 25:57.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JORGE MUNOZ, Centers for
Disease Control
and Prevention: What made me
worry was the

25:57.389 --> 26:06.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
diagnostic of the disease. We
knew that separating
Zika from dengue is difficult in
the laboratory.

26:06.498 --> 26:10.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need a specific test to be
able to separate
them, to tell them apart.

26:10.369 --> 26:15.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Munoz says his
team has developed
a test that's being tried out in
labs around

26:15.174 --> 26:21.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Caribbean region. But it's
just a beginning,,
with much still to learn about
the disease,

26:21.113 --> 26:22.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
its impact, and how to treat it.

26:23.015 --> 26:24.750 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
As of now, there is no vaccine.

26:24.850 --> 26:27.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you worry, as a scientist?
You see what
happens in the public, right?
There gets a

26:27.853 --> 26:28.520 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sense of panic.

26:28.620 --> 26:30.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DR. JORGE MUNOZ: That's right.

26:30.722 --> 26:36.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And that could
overrun the
science, right, or the pace of
the science.

26:36.562 --> 26:43.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JORGE MUNOZ: Yes, it put us
a test. We
need to react and provide
solutions very quickly.

26:43.101 --> 26:48.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Puerto Rico
Governor Alejandro
Garcia Padilla expressed his
concerns to me

26:48.707 --> 26:51.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
about fears he said were
overblown and based
on ignorance.

26:51.910 --> 26:55.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. ALEJANDRO GARCIA PADILLA,
Puerto Rico:
Anyone can travel to Puerto
Rico. The U.S.

26:55.481 --> 27:02.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Olympic team will go to Rio in a
couple of
months. And that's the mecca of
Zika. So it's

27:03.088 --> 27:12.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
safe to travel here. But if the
woman is pregnant
or trying to, then they should
avoid to come

27:12.397 --> 27:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Puerto Rico or to go to
Central Florida.

27:15.033 --> 27:20.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: It was a
not-so-subtle reminder
that concerns such as the ones
these pregnant

27:20.472 --> 27:25.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mothers have may soon become
more common on
the mainland.

27:25.177 --> 27:33.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From San Juan, Puerto Rico, I'm
Jeffrey Brown
for the "PBS NewsHour."

27:33.952 --> 27:40.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

27:40.692 --> 27:45.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": new
evidence
of the shrinking middle class;
what a political

27:45.597 --> 27:52.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
journalist learned by taking his
son to work;
and music concerts for animals.

27:52.170 --> 27:56.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: What drives a person
to become
successful? That's the question
behind MacArthur

27:56.241 --> 28:01.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
genius fellow and University of
Pennsylvania
psychology professor Angela
Duckworth's research.

28:01.513 --> 28:05.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She pins it on grit, an
intangible, but essential
trait.

28:05.984 --> 28:09.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Economics correspondent Paul
Solman spent
a day with her in Philadelphia
to try to figure

28:09.254 --> 28:14.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out what that trait is made up
of. It's part
of our weekly Making Sense
report, which airs

28:14.593 --> 28:16.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
every Thursday on the
"NewsHour."

28:16.428 --> 28:23.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERTO DIAZ, Curtis Institute
of Music in
Philadelphia: As the sound
opens, we have

28:23.402 --> 28:25.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to have the vibrato open more.

28:25.304 --> 28:34.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: World-renowned
violist Roberto
Diaz. Diaz now heads the
tuition-free Curtis

28:34.279 --> 28:39.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Institute of Music in
Philadelphia, the hardest
college in America to get into,
where he's

28:39.518 --> 28:41.353 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
taught for years.

28:41.453 --> 28:46.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But what sets Diaz and his
students apart?

28:46.558 --> 28:52.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERTO DIAZ: What we do here is
teach students
how to work and motivate
themselves over a

28:52.698 --> 28:54.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
very long period of time.

28:54.633 --> 29:00.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: That pretty much
defines grit,
the catchword concept of
psychologist Angela

29:00.672 --> 29:06.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Duckworth and subject of her new
book, "Grit:
The Power of Passion and
Perseverance."

29:06.445 --> 29:08.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA DUCKWORTH, Author, "Grit:
The Power
of Passion and Perseverance":
Nobody gets

29:08.313 --> 29:12.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be good at something without
effort, no
matter what your aptitude is.
And grit is

29:12.584 --> 29:17.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the effort part of the
equation, right?
Grit says, you know, whatever
your talent

29:17.456 --> 29:20.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is, you're going to have to
invest effort
in order to develop skill.

29:20.359 --> 29:25.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: For years now,
Professor Duckworth
has been on a mission: to teach
grit to those

29:25.697 --> 29:29.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who lack it. When she began her
career as
an inner-city teacher:

29:29.601 --> 29:34.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: It struck me
that the gap
between my highest-achieving and
my lowest-achieving

29:34.740 --> 29:41.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kids was yawning. How can we get
kids to do
better, and in particular the
kids who I could

29:41.747 --> 29:47.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tell from interacting with them
had the aptitude,
had the talent, to learn what I
was asking

29:47.319 --> 29:49.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them to learn, but weren't?

29:49.321 --> 29:54.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, Duckworth
became a psychologist,
working in recent years on a
grit curriculum

29:54.359 --> 29:55.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at KIPP charter schools.

29:56.094 --> 29:59.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Clap twice.
Put up your
right hand. Put up your left
hand.

30:00.032 --> 30:03.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Like the Infinity
Middle School
in New York City's Harlem that
we visited

30:04.036 --> 30:05.804 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not too long ago.

30:05.904 --> 30:11.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But is grit a function of nature
or nurture?
To Duckworth, it's a silly
question, because

30:11.543 --> 30:13.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
grit is like most traits.

30:13.345 --> 30:17.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: It's partly
genetic. But
human beings could learn to be
grittier.

30:17.115 --> 30:25.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But to teach grit,
Duckworth
thinks, you first need to
understand it, see

30:25.223 --> 30:29.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it in action. So we spent a day
in her hometown
of Philadelphia.

30:29.728 --> 30:37.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What could KIPP kids learn from
a viola virtuoso
about grit? Passion,
perseverance, payoff,

30:37.869 --> 30:39.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
even if only to yourself.

30:39.738 --> 30:45.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERTO DIAZ: Many of these
details that we
spend countless hours on may not
be noticed

30:45.510 --> 30:47.412 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at all.

30:47.512 --> 30:56.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's connecting a note, a
certain way from
here to there, and then that one
to the next

30:56.855 --> 31:03.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one. The emotional content in
that phrase
is what will actually make a
difference to

31:03.762 --> 31:11.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you. And this is the kind of
detail, that
that kind of work never ends. It
never ends.

31:12.070 --> 31:18.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: If you look at
true experts,
they never get bored, right,
because what

31:18.110 --> 31:23.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they find is ever, ever greater
nuance in
what they do.

31:23.715 --> 31:29.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: They become
immersed, says Duckworth,
and then grit isn't a grind, but
more like

31:29.488 --> 31:33.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an act of grace. That ducks the
big question,
though.

31:33.158 --> 31:37.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Why do some
people try,
try again, and why do some
people not? That's

31:37.696 --> 31:39.464 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what I'm after.

31:39.564 --> 31:44.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Looking for an
answer, Duckworth
developed a quiz called The Grit
Scale, and

31:44.970 --> 31:50.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tested it out at West Point. She
found that
grit mattered more than
intelligence, leadership

31:50.442 --> 31:59.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quality, even physical fitness
in predicting
which entering plebes would
finish boot camp.

31:59.251 --> 32:05.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Local super chef Marc Vetri
confirms it. Which
young cooks will survive his
kitchen? Their

32:05.590 --> 32:09.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
grit helps him spot them faster
than pasta
reaches al dente.

32:09.528 --> 32:15.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARC VETRI, Chef: It's not
always the sharpest
guys. It's not always the guys
with the most

32:15.567 --> 32:22.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
skill. It's just the guys or the
girls that
have the biggest work ethic. And
that's the

32:22.474 --> 32:23.041 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
grit, I think.

32:23.141 --> 32:25.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Say when, chef.

32:25.110 --> 32:29.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Vetri's grit has
certainly paid
off. He recently sold five of
his restaurants

32:29.748 --> 32:34.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to Philly-based Urban
Outfitters. Vetri started
out gritty.

32:34.252 --> 32:38.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: But you did
get more gritty,
more passionate, more resilient.
I don't know.

32:38.990 --> 32:44.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARC VETRI: It's interesting.
Yes, it's interesting.
And your experiences, right,
once they start

32:44.863 --> 32:51.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to work for you, you know what?
Hey, that
worked. Maybe I really need to
start acting

32:51.369 --> 32:53.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like this more often.

32:53.238 --> 32:58.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Duckworth is trying
to promote
the early teaching of restraint,
self-control,

32:58.276 --> 33:02.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
delay of gratification, long
enough so their
benefits become apparent.

33:02.781 --> 33:05.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE GOLDEN, Philadelphia Mural
Arts Program:
This mural was created three
years ago.

33:06.051 --> 33:11.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Jane Golden, who
heads the city's
Mural Arts Program, may be, says
Duckworth,

33:11.122 --> 33:12.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the city's grittiest individual.

33:13.058 --> 33:16.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE GOLDEN: My father used to
say, you're
like -- you're dogged, you're
like a dog with

33:16.194 --> 33:21.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a bone, you're -- you know,
failure is not
a permanent state. It's just
not.

33:21.299 --> 33:26.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Golden took us to
see "Family
Interrupted" made in a prison,
then transferred

33:27.005 --> 33:28.773 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to this wall.

33:28.874 --> 33:33.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The lead artist for the mural,
Eric Okdeh,
also worked with the prisoners
to show the

33:33.278 --> 33:38.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
impact of their incarceration.
Q.R. Codes
are used to tell their stories
in their own

33:38.717 --> 33:40.518 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
words.

33:40.619 --> 33:43.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I said man, you know what?
I'm ashamed
to be in here. I ain't got no
reason to be

33:43.188 --> 33:45.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in prison. I'm smart. I'm
ashamed of myself.

33:45.156 --> 33:48.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE GOLDEN: Every person we
keep out of the
prison system is a victory.
Every young person

33:48.760 --> 33:52.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who graduates from high school
and moves on
to higher ed, that is fantastic.

33:52.464 --> 33:58.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Turning negative
energy into
positive energy, through passion
and purpose.

33:58.103 --> 34:03.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, then is grit also the answer
to economic
success, to a gratifying life?

34:03.742 --> 34:07.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALFIE KOHN, Author, "Myth of the
Spoiled Child":
There's a very big difference
between helping

34:07.312 --> 34:16.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kids to decide whether and when
to be gritty,
and to deify or romanticize the
concept of

34:16.388 --> 34:18.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
grit as inherently valuable.

34:18.556 --> 34:21.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Educator Alfie Kohn
is a grit
skeptic.

34:21.226 --> 34:26.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALFIE KOHN: I don't want
children, or adults,
for that matter, to be fearful
that if they

34:26.965 --> 34:31.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say this isn't working, I don't
derive pleasure
from this, I'm going to move on
to something

34:31.736 --> 34:36.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
else, that they will be accused
of not being
sufficiently single-minded or
having enough

34:36.608 --> 34:37.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
stick-to-itiveness.

34:37.509 --> 34:39.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Moreover, says
Kohn:

34:39.711 --> 34:46.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALFIE KOHN: These concepts have
the effect
of blaming kids in dire
circumstances for

34:46.184 --> 34:52.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their circumstances, instead of
looking at
how poverty and racial
discrimination hold

34:52.724 --> 34:53.925 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
kids back.

34:54.025 --> 34:56.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Duckworth concedes
the point,
to a degree.

34:56.962 --> 35:02.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: I think grit
is a very important
thing to being successful, but
it's also important

35:02.634 --> 35:09.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have a situation, have a --
have a life
that has opportunities for you
to do well,

35:09.474 --> 35:12.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right? And that's separate from
your grit.

35:12.544 --> 35:18.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the other thing I would say
grit is not
a substitute for is having
values, you know,

35:18.283 --> 35:23.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
empathy for other people, other
aspects of
character. So, grit is an
important thing,

35:23.722 --> 35:25.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but I don't think it's the only
thing.

35:25.657 --> 35:29.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," this
is economics correspondent Paul
Solman, reporting

35:29.260 --> 35:37.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Philadelphia on a story
that required
no delay of gratification at
all.

35:38.069 --> 35:49.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We have spent
much time
this year talking about the
travails of the

35:49.114 --> 35:55.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
middle class. Now a new analysis
shows how
it's shrinking in most U.S.
metro areas.

35:55.553 --> 36:00.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From Boston to Goldsboro, North
Carolina,
to Midland, Texas, to Seattle,
there are fewer

36:00.358 --> 36:06.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
adults living in middle class
households across
the country than there were in
2000. The analysis

36:06.398 --> 36:13.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the Pew Research Center found
that in 160
metro areas, there was an
increase of lower-income

36:13.405 --> 36:19.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
households. And 172 metro areas
saw a rise
in upper-income households.

36:19.177 --> 36:24.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This year, we're teaming up with
American
Public Media's Marketplace and
PBS' "Frontline"

36:24.282 --> 36:29.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on how economic forces are
affecting Americans.
It's called How the Deck Is
Stacked.

36:29.921 --> 36:32.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the host of Marketplace, Kai
Ryssdal,
joins us again.

36:32.724 --> 36:37.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kai, just so we're all on the
same page, who
is really middle class vs. who
thinks they're

36:37.996 --> 36:39.731 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
middle class?

36:39.831 --> 36:43.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL, Marketplace: So,
for the purposes
of this study, Hari, it goes
like this.

36:43.368 --> 36:50.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anybody making from two-thirds
to twice the
median income in this country.
So, it's $47,000

36:50.241 --> 36:53.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to about $125,000, if you want
to run the
numbers.

36:53.111 --> 36:56.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, those are
the folks
that are actually in the middle
class. But

36:56.681 --> 37:00.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we kind of feel like there are a
lot of people
in the middle class, a lot of
people who would

37:00.452 --> 37:03.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want to self-identify as a
member of the middle
class. I'm the average Joe.

37:03.888 --> 37:07.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Right, that's what
we are in
this country. Right? We are
aspirational.

37:07.492 --> 37:09.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We want inclusive prosperity.

37:09.394 --> 37:13.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you stop seven people -- 10
people on the
street, probably seven of them
would say I

37:13.631 --> 37:17.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
am the middle class. And that's
why this study
matters, right, because what
happens in this

37:17.969 --> 37:22.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
economy is that the middle class
drives it.
The middle class are the
consumers. Right?

37:22.240 --> 37:26.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Their upper ends are the
investors. The lower
end are getting by. The middle
class are the

37:26.744 --> 37:28.613 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
consumers in this economy.

37:28.713 --> 37:33.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what this study really
says is, this
is bad news for the future of
economic growth

37:33.384 --> 37:35.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in this country, and that's why
it matters.

37:35.353 --> 37:38.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: As we pointed
out, there
were some places where the
middle class got

37:38.456 --> 37:42.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
smaller because people got
richer and there
were other places where the
middle class got

37:42.360 --> 37:45.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
smaller because people got
poorer. A couple
of those different locations,
examples?

37:45.363 --> 37:47.065 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
KAI RYSSDAL: Yes.

37:47.165 --> 37:49.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there are some really good
ones in this
study. So, if you look at
Goldsboro, North

37:49.567 --> 37:53.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carolina, right, it used to be a
railroad
junction. It used to have a big
Air Force

37:53.505 --> 37:59.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
base by it. It is an old-economy
town. It
is a town that is seeing the
economy go away

38:00.044 --> 38:01.779 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
from it.

38:01.880 --> 38:05.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And right in that town, you see
more people
sliding from the middle class to
the lower

38:06.084 --> 38:09.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
class. They're having a tougher
time getting
by. If you look at a place like
Midland, Texas,

38:09.654 --> 38:14.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which the Pew Research folks
polled out, Midland,
Texas, is an energy economy.

38:14.192 --> 38:17.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The energy economy in the last
15 years in
this country has been doing
really well, and

38:17.795 --> 38:22.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so people there are moving from
the middle
class to the upper class. It's
not a zero-sum

38:22.667 --> 38:26.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
game, but this economy is
changing, and that's
what's driving this entire study
and the fate

38:26.638 --> 38:28.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the middle class.

38:28.473 --> 38:30.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, we have
heard of the
middle class declining in rural
areas. Is

38:30.341 --> 38:34.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there a difference when we see
that this as
such a big deal in metro cities
as well?

38:35.013 --> 38:39.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Well, the root of
this study
is income inequality, right?

38:39.817 --> 38:43.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have known about it for a
long time
in the rural areas. It is now
coming to these

38:43.555 --> 38:47.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things called metropolitan
statistical areas,
these big centers of population,
some big,

38:47.792 --> 38:52.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some less big, where the bulk of
the population
in this country lives.

38:52.130 --> 38:58.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wages have been stagnant in this
economy for
decades now, right, which means
incomes and

38:58.169 --> 39:02.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
household wealth are stagnant,
which means
there is more income inequality.
And when

39:02.373 --> 39:06.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you have income inequality, you
have more
going to the low end, you have
more going

39:06.377 --> 39:11.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the high end, and those
drivers of prosperity
in America are getting, as you
said in the

39:11.449 --> 39:13.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
beginning, hollowed out.

39:13.384 --> 39:15.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How does this
square with
the people you have been talking
in the series

39:16.020 --> 39:17.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you're working on as you report
this?

39:17.655 --> 39:19.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Well, here's the
thing.

39:19.457 --> 39:23.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm going out in the field next
week to talk
to a couple that we first met in
a coffee

39:23.528 --> 39:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shop about six months ago here
in downtown
Los Angeles. They're both
teachers. One of

39:28.333 --> 39:32.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them has a master's degree. They
are literally
the epitome of the American
middle class.

39:32.370 --> 39:36.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right? You think, if they can't
make it on
a teacher's salary, then
something is up.

39:36.474 --> 39:40.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here's the deal. We were sitting
there chatting
over a cup of coffee and a piece
of pie. And

39:40.445 --> 39:45.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the husband said to me: "We have
given up.
We're done. We know we're never
going to own

39:45.183 --> 39:49.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a house. We're never going to
grow beyond
the middle class. We're buried
in student

39:49.520 --> 39:52.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
debt. We don't really know if
we're going
to be able to afford to send our
child to

39:52.590 --> 39:54.058 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
school."

39:54.158 --> 39:57.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they have given up, and that
tells what
you is at root in this study.

39:57.695 --> 40:03.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Marketplace's
Kai Ryssdal, thanks so much.

40:03.134 --> 40:08.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAI RYSSDAL: You bet.

40:08.840 --> 40:16.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the latest
addition to the
"NewsHour" bookshelf, a
diagnosis of Asperger's

40:16.347 --> 40:21.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
syndrome leads one father to
consider what
kind of role he should play in
his son's life.

40:22.020 --> 40:27.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I recently spoke with Ron
Fournier, journalist
and senior political columnist
for "The National

40:27.992 --> 40:33.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Journal," about his new book,
"Love That Boy:
What Two Presidents, Eight Road
Trips, and

40:33.798 --> 40:38.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
My Son Taught Me About a
Parent's Expectations."

40:38.269 --> 40:41.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Ron Fournier, welcome.

40:41.306 --> 40:43.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RON FOURNIER, Author, "Love That
Boy: What
Two Presidents, Eight Road
Trips, and My Son
Taught Me About a Parent's
Expectations":
Thanks for having me.

40:43.141 --> 40:44.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Your book has
struck a nerve.
I think it -- maybe it's because
you bring

40:44.942 --> 40:49.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us along on your journey to
understand your
son. How did you decide to do
that?

40:50.014 --> 40:55.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RON FOURNIER: My wife said,
you're going to
do this. My wife, Lori, is a
remarkable woman

40:55.720 --> 41:00.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who literally, the day we got
him diagnosed,
we were walking out of the
doctor's office,

41:01.059 --> 41:04.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and all I was concerned about
was how this
was going to affect me, and can
my boy not

41:04.762 --> 41:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
play sports, and all the things
that a self-involved
father might.

41:08.366 --> 41:12.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Lori said, it's time to step
up. You have
got to step out and get him out
in the world,

41:12.637 --> 41:16.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where we can start learning
things that we
thought up until then -- he was
12 at the

41:16.274 --> 41:19.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time -- that we thought were
uncomfortable
to him, but we just learned,
because of the

41:20.044 --> 41:21.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
autism, was actually unnatural
to him.

41:22.013 --> 41:26.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I had to step up and spend
more time with
him. I had spent a lot of time,
as we do in

41:27.085 --> 41:32.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this town -- I'm on the road,
away from the
family. So she said, get out. I
want you to

41:32.123 --> 41:34.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go to presidential libraries,
presidential
sites.

41:34.459 --> 41:38.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His fixation at the time was
history. And
that was the job, covering the
presidency.

41:38.329 --> 41:41.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It kept me away from him. So she
sent us out
on these road trips.

41:41.265 --> 41:45.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: People know what
autism is,
but they're not as familiar with
Asperger's.

41:46.037 --> 41:47.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tell us what that is.

41:47.905 --> 41:50.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RON FOURNIER: Asperger's
syndrome is on the
high end of the autism spectrum,
meaning these

41:50.675 --> 41:57.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are young men and women who are
fairly functional,
but they don't have the social
graces that

41:57.482 --> 41:59.183 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we're born with.

41:59.283 --> 42:01.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They don't know naturally how to
make eye
contact, how to modulate your
voice, how to

42:01.753 --> 42:08.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shake hands, how to hold a
conversation and
read the social clues coming off
of somebody.

42:08.526 --> 42:14.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And why did your
wife, Lori,
think that taking Tyler, your
son, around

42:14.565 --> 42:18.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to visit your work, why did she
think that
would make a difference?

42:18.870 --> 42:23.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RON FOURNIER: Well, she knew
that I had to
be more involved in his life, in
our children's

42:23.808 --> 42:28.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
life. I had spent a lot of time
working. And
we had just learned from the
doctor that,

42:28.880 --> 42:34.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
although the social graces
aren't inherent
in Aspies, which is what they're
called, they

42:34.619 --> 42:36.621 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can be learned.

42:36.721 --> 42:41.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For one thing, these kids happen
to be off-the-chart
smart. If you get them in
settings and constantly

42:42.059 --> 42:46.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
repeat to them, here's how you
shake hands,
here's how you look people in
the eyes, here's

42:46.464 --> 42:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how you have a conversation,
they can learn
those things.

42:49.434 --> 42:53.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, we were right at the
beginning of the
process, literally within the
first 15 minutes,

42:53.471 --> 42:55.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and she said, get him out in the
world.

42:55.973 --> 43:00.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You have your son
meet presidents,
former presidents, but you do it
in a very

43:00.511 --> 43:02.380 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
natural way.

43:02.480 --> 43:08.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you think makes these
encounters,
these sessions Tyler has with,
say, Bill Clinton,

43:08.419 --> 43:10.588 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
feel like a real conversation?

43:10.688 --> 43:14.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RON FOURNIER: I don't think it
was me. I think
it was Bill Clinton and George
Bush, and,

43:14.492 --> 43:19.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a briefer extent, he had a
brief meeting
with a -- just a grip-and-grin
at a Christmas

43:19.464 --> 43:21.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
party with the Obamas.

43:21.365 --> 43:24.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It says something about the
three of them,
those three couples, or those
three presidents

43:24.702 --> 43:31.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and first lady Michelle Obama. I
can be awfully
cynical in my job. And I love
holding powerful

43:31.509 --> 43:34.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people accountable. And I'm
proud of what
I have done. But it's easy to
forget these

43:34.712 --> 43:37.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are human beings who are public
servants.

43:37.548 --> 43:41.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And President Bush and Clinton,
to different
degrees, wanted to connect with
Tyler. They

43:41.319 --> 43:45.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were doing a favor, not for me.
Neither one
of them had anything to gain
from me. But

43:45.990 --> 43:52.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this was a young man who was
struggling with
autism, who had a fascination
with the presidency.

43:52.597 --> 43:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they did their best to
connect with
him. I think I have got to give
them the credit.

43:55.700 --> 44:00.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You could argue,
of course,
this is a book for parents of
children with

44:00.538 --> 44:02.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
special needs, to some extent.

44:02.440 --> 44:08.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's also really for parents
of all kinds,
parents with all kinds of
children, because

44:09.013 --> 44:14.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you write about parents today
want their children
to be successful, want their
children to be

44:14.218 --> 44:14.719 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
happy.

44:14.819 --> 44:16.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RON FOURNIER: Right.

44:16.721 --> 44:20.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That really comes
through loud
and clear, that you're saying to
these parents,

44:20.391 --> 44:24.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wait a minute. Stop before you
get carried
away here.

44:24.595 --> 44:29.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RON FOURNIER: What I try to do
here was understand
that my problem wasn't Tyler's
autism. My

44:29.967 --> 44:33.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
problem wasn't Tyler. My problem
was me.

44:33.271 --> 44:37.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had certain expectations for
my son that
he couldn't meet because of his
condition.

44:37.408 --> 44:41.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Oh, actually, he couldn't
because he's not
me. I have to help make him the
best that

44:41.312 --> 44:42.947 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he can be.

44:43.047 --> 44:45.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, then I -- the more parents I
talk to,
the more child development
experts I talk

44:45.716 --> 44:50.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to, I realize that partly
because of who we
are and the baggage that we
bring into parenthood,

44:50.321 --> 44:53.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and partly because of the times
that we live
in, which are awfully scary to
raise children,

44:53.691 --> 44:58.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as you know, we have certain
expectations,
certain pressures that we put on
all of our

44:58.195 --> 44:59.997 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
kids.

45:00.097 --> 45:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want them to be geniuses. We
want them
to be popular. We want them to
have successful

45:02.600 --> 45:07.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
careers. We want them to follow
us into our
education paths. We want them to
be happy,

45:07.972 --> 45:09.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
whatever that means.

45:09.840 --> 45:13.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the problem is, those
expectations, if
they're misplaced, don't just
shape our kids.

45:13.844 --> 45:15.613 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They can misshape our kids.

45:15.713 --> 45:18.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right. And this
desire that
they all go to Harvard, that
they have lot

45:19.050 --> 45:20.851 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of friends, they're popular.

45:20.952 --> 45:23.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RON FOURNIER: Right. Social
scientists will
tell you -- the science will
tell you, you

45:23.788 --> 45:28.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
don't want your kid to be
popular. You don't
want your kids to have a whole
-- a big number

45:28.159 --> 45:32.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of friends, because that often
puts them in
social situations, puts
pressures upon them

45:33.064 --> 45:36.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to stay in that A-list category.
That leads
them down the wrong path.

45:36.701 --> 45:39.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, I want
to ask you,
how is Tyler doing today, and
what does he

45:40.037 --> 45:42.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think about this book, about the
fact that
you wrote it?

45:42.406 --> 45:44.075 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RON FOURNIER: Thanks for asking.

45:44.175 --> 45:46.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's doing great. He is going to
graduate
from a public school here in
Arlington very

45:47.011 --> 45:51.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shortly here in June. And he's
looking forward
to the next step in his life,
which looks

45:51.983 --> 45:55.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like it's going to be probably a
couple of
community college classes, a
little bit of

45:55.553 --> 45:57.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
work, a little bit of community
service.

45:57.388 --> 46:03.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is going to take him a little
bit longer
than a "normal" child to make it
on his own,

46:03.794 --> 46:07.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but we think he's going to get
there. With
the book, you know, he's a
typical -- first

46:07.465 --> 46:11.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of all, he's kind of a typical
teenage boy.
He's just involved in his own
life.

46:11.335 --> 46:16.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's even more so with an
Aspie. He's
really just into the present. So
he appreciates

46:16.741 --> 46:20.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the book. He had full veto
authority over
the book. He likes some of the
attention he's

46:20.211 --> 46:24.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
getting around it. We had a book
party back
in our hometown of Detroit last
week that

46:24.215 --> 46:26.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he got a kick out of taking part
in that.

46:26.317 --> 46:31.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he doesn't want to be a
whole lot of attention.
He jokes that he wants to be a
covert celebrity,

46:32.023 --> 46:32.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
whatever that means.

46:32.957 --> 46:34.125 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:34.225 --> 46:35.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RON FOURNIER: So, he's doing
good. Thanks
for asking.

46:35.593 --> 46:37.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Did he end up
vetoing anything?

46:37.528 --> 46:45.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RON FOURNIER: Yes, actually,
there was a couple
passages in the book where -- in
the original

46:45.136 --> 46:48.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
manuscript. But, mainly, they
were stylistic,
where he thought I was making
myself look

46:48.172 --> 46:49.273 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
too smart.

46:49.373 --> 46:51.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I won't ask you
what you left
out.

46:51.242 --> 46:57.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ron Fournier, the book is "Love
That Boy,"
and it really is a remarkable
book. Thank

46:57.415 --> 46:58.482 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

46:58.582 --> 47:05.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RON FOURNIER: Thank you so much.

47:05.556 --> 47:11.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now the latest
edition in
our Brief But Spectacular
series.

47:11.362 --> 47:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, Laurel Braitman on the
emotional
depths of a howl. A
writer-in-residence at

47:16.400 --> 47:22.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Stanford Medical School,
Braitman's book "Animal
Madness" explores mental illness
in all creatures.

47:22.573 --> 47:27.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And her latest project discovers
how music
can be good for even the wildest
souls.

47:27.378 --> 47:30.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAUREL BRAITMAN, Author, "Animal
Madness":
I think communicating with other
animals is

47:30.347 --> 47:34.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exactly like communicating with
other human
animals.

47:34.351 --> 47:39.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The way to woo a dolphin is
usually just to
be like super sexy and really
outgoing. Dogs

47:39.256 --> 47:43.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
too, you know, they will seem to
be the most
curious and most attracted to
the person that's

47:43.194 --> 47:55.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
least interested in them.

47:55.773 --> 48:01.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
almost all of the same kinds of
mental illnesses
or at least similar to those in
people, so,

48:01.178 --> 48:05.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everything from post-traumatic
stress disorder
to mood disorders like
depression.

48:05.649 --> 48:16.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lots of other creatures have
also wound up
on these drugs, Zoloft, Lexapro,
all kinds

48:16.861 --> 48:18.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
States even have their own
psychiatrists.

48:19.029 --> 48:23.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We think about them as
entertainment, like
going to the zoo and watching
the elephants.

48:23.534 --> 48:27.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one thing that makes me sad
is that we
don't usually think about what
entertains

48:27.138 --> 48:29.006 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

48:29.106 --> 48:32.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of my favorite emotional
experiences is
to listen to music. I wanted to
put on concerts

48:32.643 --> 48:36.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for other animals, because I had
a feeling
that there was a lot that we
could learn by

48:36.447 --> 48:39.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
watching other animals listen
and respond
to music.

48:39.683 --> 48:44.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first music for animal show
I did was
actually for a very lonely
miniature donkey.

48:44.989 --> 48:49.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He hated it. He ran away. He ate
thistles
and he only came back when we
started playing

48:49.326 --> 48:51.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bluegrass standards and Nina
Simone.

48:51.796 --> 49:02.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the most recent concerts
was for wolves
at Wolf Haven sanctuary in
Southern Washington.

49:02.940 --> 49:07.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that one was awesome,
because these wolves,
most of them, they spent more
than a decade

49:07.845 --> 49:12.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on a 10-foot chain. They were
part of a roadside
attraction in Alaska.

49:12.583 --> 49:17.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought these wolves deserved
a concert.
So I worked with the band Black
Prairie. My

49:17.822 --> 49:30.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
collaborator Aubree
Bernier-Clarke made a
really beautiful film of it.
They came from

49:30.634 --> 49:35.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very far away to as close as
they possibly
could be to see the band.

49:35.739 --> 49:45.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, at the end, the band
howled, and
the wolves responded.

49:45.783 --> 49:47.685 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(HOWLING)

49:47.785 --> 49:55.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LAUREL BRAITMAN: I'm just
fascinated by all
this stuff. I think it makes us
better people

49:55.392 --> 49:58.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to realize that we're animals
just like everyone
else.

49:58.329 --> 50:01.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By looking into their eyes and
seeing what
they're doing, we really begin
to understand

50:02.032 --> 50:03.901 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ourselves.

50:04.001 --> 50:08.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My name is Dr. Laurel Braitman,
and this is
my Brief But Spectacular take on
animal madness.

50:08.138 --> 50:11.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Maybe they
will end all
their concerts like that, with a
howl?

50:11.842 --> 50:13.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I was about to
say, they can't
applaud, but they can howl.

50:14.011 --> 50:14.545 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

50:14.645 --> 50:16.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

50:16.513 --> 50:19.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

JUDY WOODRUFF: And finally
tonight, our "NewsHour"
Shares: something that caught
our eye that

50:25.723 --> 50:28.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
might be of interest to you,
too.

50:28.292 --> 50:32.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scientists often travel to the
ends of the
Earth in the name of research,
but Ph.D. student

50:32.997 --> 50:38.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kiya Riverman's work requires
her to climb
directly into the heart of
glaciers.

50:38.502 --> 50:44.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We spoke with Riverman by phone
recently about
exploring caves of ice on
Svalbard -- that's

50:44.341 --> 50:48.746 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a set of islands north of
Iceland -- and asked
what she hopes to discover.

50:48.846 --> 50:52.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIYA RIVERMAN, Graduate Student,
Penn State
University: My name is Kiya
Riverman. And

50:52.216 --> 50:59.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am a graduate student at Penn
State University,
where I study glaciers and ice
sheets and

50:59.123 --> 51:01.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how they might contribute to sea
level rise.

51:01.525 --> 51:07.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a warming world, there's this
potential
for ice to flow out into the
ocean and contribute

51:07.765 --> 51:14.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to sea level rise. And so
understanding what
controls the way that ice flows
and how that

51:14.271 --> 51:16.907 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
changes is really of importance.

51:17.007 --> 51:22.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I am out in the field, I am
first and
foremost interested in
understanding, what

51:22.146 --> 51:27.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the geometry of this glacier,
how thick
is the ice, what's underneath
it, because,

51:27.151 --> 51:31.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in order to understand how it
might change
in the future, I have to have a
good sense

51:31.221 --> 51:33.023 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of what it looks like right now.

51:33.123 --> 51:38.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Inside the cave systems, the
main thing that
I'm interested in studying is
where there

51:38.462 --> 51:45.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are waterfalls. So, where water
exists underneath
ice, it can have a big impact on
the way that

51:45.302 --> 51:50.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ice moves. There haven't really
been good
descriptions of why there are
waterfalls inside

51:50.674 --> 51:52.576 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of glaciers.

51:52.676 --> 51:58.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I map where they are and
how they change
through time. And so I'm
specifically answering

51:58.949 --> 52:04.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these little questions about how
water cuts
through glaciers, in order to
say something

52:04.488 --> 52:11.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about how increased amounts of
water in the
future will speed them up or
slow them down.

52:11.261 --> 52:18.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every time I go in the system,
I'm learning
something new about how water
flows through

52:18.135 --> 52:24.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
glaciers. And it's also just a
fun physical
test of what can I take and
learning the limits

52:24.708 --> 52:30.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of both the science, but the
limits of my
own body and my ability to be in
this harsh

52:30.581 --> 52:32.116 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
place.

52:32.216 --> 52:34.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And a couple
of news updates
before we leave you tonight.

52:34.685 --> 52:40.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is word U.S. special
operations troops
have been stationed at outposts
in Libya since

52:40.224 --> 52:45.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
late last year. According to The
Washington
Post, fewer than 25 troops are
trying to enlist

52:45.362 --> 52:49.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
local support for a possible
offensive against
ISIS.

52:49.166 --> 52:53.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the U.S. Navy has fired the
commander
of 10 American sailors who were
captured after

52:53.637 --> 53:00.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
warning into Arabs waters this
past January.
The Navy said in a statement it
lost confidence

53:00.244 --> 53:02.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the commander's ability.

53:02.746 --> 53:04.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm
Hari Sreenivasan.

53:04.615 --> 53:06.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

53:06.583 --> 53:10.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening with Mark Shields and
Michael Gerson.

53:10.821 --> 53:36.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
