00:16.550 --> 00:17.150
DIVIDES WITHIN THE U.S.

00:17.150 --> 00:19.186
GOVERNMENT.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.074
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING AND

00:41.074 --> 00:42.276
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:42.276 --> 00:43.744
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS OPPOSING

00:43.744 --> 00:44.878
THE RELEASE OF A DETAINEE AT THE

00:44.878 --> 00:46.413
U.S. MILITARY PRISON IN

00:46.413 --> 00:47.748
GUANTANAMO, BAY CUBA, WHO HAS

00:47.748 --> 00:48.548
BEEN ON A HUNGER STRIKE FOR

00:48.548 --> 00:50.417
EIGHT YEARS.

00:50.417 --> 00:52.019
THE MILITARY IS FORCE-FEEDING

00:52.019 --> 00:55.422
TARIQ BA ODAH TO KEEP HIM ALIVE.

00:55.422 --> 00:57.958
THE 36-YEAR-OLD DETAINEE NOW

00:57.958 --> 00:59.426
WEIGHS 74 POUNDS, ROUGHLY THE

00:59.426 --> 01:01.695
WEIGHT OF A 10-YEAR-OLD BOY.

01:01.695 --> 01:03.196
THAT'S LESS THAN HALF WHAT HE

01:03.196 --> 01:04.665
WEIGHED WHEN HE WAS SENT TO

01:04.665 --> 01:06.833
GUANTANAMO 13 YEARS AGO.

01:06.833 --> 01:08.735
BA ODAH HAS NEVER BEEN FORMALLY

01:08.735 --> 01:10.871
CHARGED OR CONVICTED OF A CRIME,

01:10.871 --> 01:12.839
AND HE IS AMONG THE 52 DETAINEES

01:12.839 --> 01:14.741
WHO HAVE BEEN CLEARED FOR

01:14.741 --> 01:16.009
RELEASE BY A TASK FORCE OF U.S.

01:16.009 --> 01:18.645
NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCIES.

01:18.645 --> 01:20.247
LAST NIGHT, THE JUSTICE

01:20.247 --> 01:21.848
DEPARTMENT FILED PAPERS IN

01:21.848 --> 01:23.417
FEDERAL COURT OPPOSING ANY

01:23.417 --> 01:24.084
COURT-ORDERED RELEASE FOR BA

01:24.084 --> 01:26.019
ODAH.

01:26.019 --> 01:27.888
HOWEVER, A DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN

01:27.888 --> 01:29.623
TOLD THE NEWSHOUR THE OBAMA

01:29.623 --> 01:31.191
ADMINISTRATION WILL CONTINUE TO

01:31.191 --> 01:32.492
WORK ON RESETTLING HIM IN A

01:32.492 --> 01:34.428
COUNTRY THAT WILL TAKE HIM.

01:34.428 --> 01:35.963
BA ODAH IS A YEMENI CITIZEN

01:35.963 --> 01:36.897
WHOSE FAMILY LIVES IN SAUDI

01:36.897 --> 01:38.098
ARABIA.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.533
THIS CASE HIGHLIGHTS THE

01:39.533 --> 01:41.201
DIFFICULTIES FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA

01:41.201 --> 01:42.836
TO FULFILL HIS PROMISE TO EMPTY

01:42.836 --> 01:44.237
GUANTANAMO AND CLOSE THE PRISON

01:44.237 --> 01:46.506
BEFORE HE LEAVES OFFICE.

01:46.506 --> 01:48.942
116 DETAINEES REMAIN.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.078
ONLY SEVEN FACE CURRENT CHARGES,

01:51.078 --> 01:52.212
INCLUDING FIVE MEN FOR THE

01:52.212 --> 01:54.247
SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS.

01:54.247 --> 01:58.352
REPORTER JESS BRAVIN HAS BEEN

01:58.352 --> 01:59.152
COVERING ISSUES RELATED TO

01:59.152 --> 01:59.987
GUANTANAMO SINCE 2002 AND COVERS

01:59.987 --> 02:01.021
THE US SUPREME COURT FOR "THE

02:01.021 --> 02:02.089
WALL STREET JOURNAL."

02:02.089 --> 02:03.557
HE IS ALSO THE AUTHOR OF "THE

02:03.557 --> 02:04.291
TERROR COURTS: ROUGH JUSTICE AT

02:04.291 --> 02:05.292
GUANTANAMO BAY."

02:05.292 --> 02:06.026
HE JOINS ME NOW FROM WASHINGTON,

02:06.026 --> 02:09.429
D.C.

02:09.429 --> 02:10.230
FIRST LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CLASS

02:10.230 --> 02:11.331
OF DETAINEES THAT THIS

02:11.331 --> 02:12.199
INDIVIDUAL FALLS INTO.

02:12.199 --> 02:14.167
HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE ONE OF 52

02:14.167 --> 02:15.168
WHO HAVE BEEN CLEARED FOR

02:15.168 --> 02:15.902
TRANSFER.

02:15.902 --> 02:17.471
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

02:17.471 --> 02:18.238
WHO CLEARED HIM?

02:18.238 --> 02:20.974
>> WELL, MOST OF THOSE 52 MEN

02:20.974 --> 02:23.910
WERE CLEARED IN 2009 AND 2010 BY

02:23.910 --> 02:26.213
A TASK FORCE OF MILITARY

02:26.213 --> 02:28.949
INTELLIGENCE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:28.949 --> 02:30.450
OFFICIALS WHO THE PRESIDENT

02:30.450 --> 02:31.651
APPOINTED TO REVIEW THE

02:31.651 --> 02:33.587
SITUATION AT GUATANAMO BAY.

02:33.587 --> 02:36.156
A FEW OF THEM WERE CLEARED MORE

02:36.156 --> 02:38.258
RECENTLY BY WHAT'S CALLED A

02:38.258 --> 02:39.626
PERIODIC REVIEW BOARD THAT'S

02:39.626 --> 02:42.195
SUPPOSED TO REEXAMINE THE

02:42.195 --> 02:42.963
DETAINEES' CASES FROM TIME TO

02:42.963 --> 02:44.664
TIME TO SEE IF THEY ARE A THREAT

02:44.664 --> 02:46.333
TO U.S. SECURITY.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.634
>> Sreenivasan: SO IT SEEMS ON

02:47.634 --> 02:49.236
THE ONE HAND YOU HAVE THE U.S.

02:49.236 --> 02:50.337
STATE DEPARTMENT WHO WANTS TO

02:50.337 --> 02:51.605
GET ON WITH THIS AND TRANSFER

02:51.605 --> 02:53.206
THEM AWAY TO OTHER COUNTRIES.

02:53.206 --> 02:54.908
AND THEN ON THE OTHER HAND,

02:54.908 --> 02:55.776
YOU'VE GOT THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:55.776 --> 02:57.310
JUSTICE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:57.310 --> 02:59.012
DEFENSE FIGHTING TO KEEP THEM

02:59.012 --> 03:00.514
THERE, OR APT LEAST NOT TO HAVE

03:00.514 --> 03:02.783
A RULE IMPOSED TO MAKE THEM

03:02.783 --> 03:03.450
MOVE.

03:03.450 --> 03:04.418
>> WELL, RIGHT.

03:04.418 --> 03:06.720
THERE'S A VERY-- THERE ARE MANY,

03:06.720 --> 03:07.988
MANY CONTRADICTIONS YOU COULD

03:07.988 --> 03:09.289
SAY IN AMERICA'S GUANTANAMO

03:09.289 --> 03:09.990
POLICY.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.591
AND THIS IS JUST ONE OF THEM.

03:11.591 --> 03:13.393
YES, HE IS SOMEONE WHO THE U.S.

03:13.393 --> 03:15.962
GOVERNMENT HAS SAID SHOULD BE

03:15.962 --> 03:16.963
TRANSFERRED MORE THAN FIVE YEARS

03:16.963 --> 03:17.631
AGO.

03:17.631 --> 03:18.765
IN OTHER WORDS, THERE'S NO

03:18.765 --> 03:20.634
JUSTIFICATION REALLY FOR HOLDING

03:20.634 --> 03:21.234
HIM IN GUANTANAMO BAY.

03:21.234 --> 03:22.636
THE REASON HE'S THERE IS

03:22.636 --> 03:24.805
BECAUSE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, FOR

03:24.805 --> 03:26.973
ITS OWN POLITICAL OR DIPLOMATIC

03:26.973 --> 03:27.974
REASONS, HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO

03:27.974 --> 03:30.377
FIND A PLACE TO SEND HIM THAT IT

03:30.377 --> 03:31.978
CONSIDERS SECURE ENOUGH.

03:31.978 --> 03:34.781
SO THAT'S NOT REALLY HIS FAULT.

03:34.781 --> 03:36.983
SO HE HAS BEEN ON HUNGER STRIKE

03:36.983 --> 03:38.785
FOR EIGHT YEARS, AND HE HAS

03:38.785 --> 03:41.488
FILED WHAT'S CALLED A HABEAS

03:41.488 --> 03:42.489
CORPUS. IN FEDERAL DISTRICT

03:42.489 --> 03:43.490
COURT.

03:43.490 --> 03:44.724
THAT'S A LEGAL PROCESS BY WHICH

03:44.724 --> 03:45.926
ANY PRISONER CAN CHALLENGE WHAT

03:45.926 --> 03:46.927
THEY CONSIDER TO BE ILLEGAL

03:46.927 --> 03:47.928
DETENTION.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.996
SO HE HAS THIS LEGAL ACTION

03:49.996 --> 03:50.697
GOING.

03:50.697 --> 03:52.799
THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO

03:52.799 --> 03:54.401
OPPOSE HIM, EVEN THOUGH, AS YOU

03:54.401 --> 03:55.936
SAY, THE STATE DEPARTMENT

03:55.936 --> 03:56.970
RECOMMENDED DROPPING THE

03:56.970 --> 03:57.938
OPPOSITION BECAUSE THAT WOULD

03:57.938 --> 03:59.172
HELP CLEAR THE WAY TO GET HIM

03:59.172 --> 04:00.841
OUT OF GUANTANAMO BAY.

04:00.841 --> 04:01.842
>> Sreenivasan: SO I'M

04:01.842 --> 04:03.210
ASSUMING THAT OTHER PRISONERS

04:03.210 --> 04:04.444
AND THEIR LAWYERS ARE WATCHING

04:04.444 --> 04:08.348
THIS AND PERHAPS THIS IS-- THE

04:08.348 --> 04:10.016
PRECEDENT BEING SET IF THIS

04:10.016 --> 04:11.818
HABUS CORPUS WAS HANDED DOWN, IF

04:11.818 --> 04:15.388
HE WAS I GUESS COMPELLED TO BE

04:15.388 --> 04:17.257
TRANSFERRED, THAT IS WHAT IS THE

04:17.257 --> 04:18.492
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND

04:18.492 --> 04:19.759
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE DOES NOT

04:19.759 --> 04:21.128
WANT BECAUSE EVERY OTHER

04:21.128 --> 04:22.028
DETAINEE WOULD LINE UP.

04:22.028 --> 04:23.497
>> WELL, THEY DON'T WANT TO

04:23.497 --> 04:25.132
ENCOURAGE OTHER DETAINEES TO

04:25.132 --> 04:26.333
PERSIST IN HUNGER STRIKES,

04:26.333 --> 04:27.834
ALTHOUGH THEY DON'T NEED A LOT

04:27.834 --> 04:29.369
OF ENCOURAGEMENT.

04:29.369 --> 04:30.804
MANY HAVE BEEN ON HUNGER STRIKE

04:30.804 --> 04:31.671
FOR A LONG TIME.

04:31.671 --> 04:32.939
THEY DON'T LIKE TO BE TOLD WHO

04:32.939 --> 04:33.473
TO DO.

04:33.473 --> 04:34.875
HOWEVER, AS A BINDING LEGAL

04:34.875 --> 04:36.576
MATTER IT'S NOT PRECEDENT IN

04:36.576 --> 04:37.077
THAT SENSE.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.211
IN OTHER WORDS, JUST BECAUSE THE

04:38.211 --> 04:39.713
GOVERNMENT CHOOSES NOT TO OPPOSE

04:39.713 --> 04:41.414
HIS PETITION DOES NOT MEAN THAT

04:41.414 --> 04:43.550
ANY OTHER PRISONER WHO FILES A

04:43.550 --> 04:44.651
SIMILAR LEGAL ACTION

04:44.651 --> 04:45.952
AUTOMATICALLY GETS THE SAME

04:45.952 --> 04:46.720
TREATMENT.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.722
THEY CAN CHOOSE TO OPPOSE OR NOT

04:48.722 --> 04:49.990
OPPOSE EACH PETITION

04:49.990 --> 04:51.391
INDIVIDUALLY, AND IT DOES NOT

04:51.391 --> 04:52.392
CREATE A BINDING LEGAL

04:52.392 --> 04:53.226
PRECEDENT.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.428
BUT IN GENERAL, THE DEFENSE

04:55.428 --> 04:56.062
DEPARTMENT, THE JUSTICE

04:56.062 --> 04:56.897
DEPARTMENT, AREN'T IN THE

04:56.897 --> 04:59.633
BUSINESS OF ACQUIESCING TO WHAT

04:59.633 --> 05:00.500
PRISONERS WANT.

05:00.500 --> 05:01.868
IF THEY ARE GOING TO TRANSFER

05:01.868 --> 05:03.236
THIS DETAINEE, THEY WANT TO DO

05:03.236 --> 05:04.504
IT ON THEIR TERMS, NOT BECAUSE

05:04.504 --> 05:06.473
THERE'S A COURT ORDER THAT'S

05:06.473 --> 05:07.207
HASTENING THE WAY.

05:07.207 --> 05:07.974
THE STATE DEPARTMENT FEELS THAT

05:07.974 --> 05:10.177
THE COURT ORDER WOULD REMOVE A

05:10.177 --> 05:11.745
NUMBER OF OBSTACLES THAT

05:11.745 --> 05:14.214
CONGRESS IMPOSED ON DETAINEE

05:14.214 --> 05:15.448
TRANSFERS AFTER PRESIDENT OBAMA

05:15.448 --> 05:17.083
TOOK OFFICE, AND IT WOULD MAKE

05:17.083 --> 05:19.219
IT SOMEWHAT EASIER TO GET THIS

05:19.219 --> 05:20.720
GUY WHO NOW WEIGHS ABOUT 75

05:20.720 --> 05:22.822
POUNDS OUT OF DETENTION AND INTO

05:22.822 --> 05:23.690
SOME OTHER COUNTRY.

05:23.690 --> 05:24.457
>> Sreenivasan: LET'S TALK.

05:24.457 --> 05:25.125
THAT.

05:25.125 --> 05:26.893
I MEAN, HE'S BEING KEPT ALIVE

05:26.893 --> 05:29.229
THROUGH FORCED FEEDING.

05:29.229 --> 05:29.829
DESCRIBE THIS PROCESS.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.932
I MEAN, HE CAN'T ABE HEALTHY

05:31.932 --> 05:33.466
HUMAN BEING AT 75 POUNDS.

05:33.466 --> 05:34.968
>> WELL, THAT'S ABOUT HALF OF

05:34.968 --> 05:36.770
HIS TYPICAL WEIGHT, OR HIS

05:36.770 --> 05:37.771
NORMAL WEIGHT, ACCORDING TO THE

05:37.771 --> 05:38.471
DEFENSE DEPARTMENT.

05:38.471 --> 05:39.839
I MEAN, THE ONLY INFORMATION WE

05:39.839 --> 05:42.108
HAVE ON HIS CONDITION IS FROM

05:42.108 --> 05:43.310
THE GOVERNMENT.

05:43.310 --> 05:45.512
IT'S A DAILY PROCESS WHERE

05:45.512 --> 05:47.714
YOU'RE STRAPPED TO A CHAIR AND A

05:47.714 --> 05:49.249
FEEDING TUBE IS INSERTED IN YOUR

05:49.249 --> 05:52.285
NOSE AND A SORT OF ENSURE-LIKE

05:52.285 --> 05:53.653
LIQUID IS PUMPED INTO YOU.

05:53.653 --> 05:55.055
ACTUALLY, RIGHT NOW, THERE IS A

05:55.055 --> 05:56.122
COURT ACTION THAT'S BEEN FILED

05:56.122 --> 05:57.757
BY A NUMBER OF NEWS

05:57.757 --> 05:58.525
ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING THE

05:58.525 --> 06:00.694
"WALL STREET JOURNAL," THAT IS

06:00.694 --> 06:03.129
SEEKING TO HAVE VIDEOTAPES OF

06:03.129 --> 06:04.764
THE FORCE FEEDING PROCESS OF A

06:04.764 --> 06:07.667
DIFFERENT DETAINEE RELEASED SO

06:07.667 --> 06:09.603
THE PUBLIC CAN SEE FOR ITSELF

06:09.603 --> 06:12.839
HOW HUMANE THIS PROCESS IS.

06:12.839 --> 06:13.673
DETAINEES SAY IT'S NOT.

06:13.673 --> 06:15.575
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT IT IS.

06:15.575 --> 06:16.810
>> Sreenivasan: JESS BRAVIN OF

06:16.810 --> 06:18.144
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL,"

06:18.144 --> 06:18.678
THANKS SO MUCH.

06:18.678 --> 06:22.582
>> OF COURSE.

06:22.582 --> 06:23.450
>> Sreenivasan: CHINESE STATE

06:23.450 --> 06:24.618
MEDIA REPORTS THE DEATH TOLL

06:24.618 --> 06:25.919
FROM THIS WEEK'S CHEMICAL

06:25.919 --> 06:27.420
WAREHOUSE EXPLOSION IN THE PORT

06:27.420 --> 06:29.189
CITY OF TIANJIN HAS RISEN ABOVE

06:29.189 --> 06:29.990
100, WITH 21 FIREFIGHTERS AMONG

06:29.990 --> 06:30.724
THE FATALITIES.

06:30.724 --> 06:31.858
FIREFIGHTERS CONTINUE TO BATTLE

06:31.858 --> 06:32.892
FIRES FROM SMALL EXPLOSIONS AND

06:32.892 --> 06:34.327
SEARCH FOR SURVIVORS.

06:34.327 --> 06:35.695
TODAY, RESCUERS DISCOVERED A 50-

06:35.695 --> 06:36.796
YEAR-OLD MAN FOUND INSIDE A

06:36.796 --> 06:38.365
SHIPPING CONTAINER.

06:38.365 --> 06:39.666
CHINESE OFFICIALS DENY ISSUING

06:39.666 --> 06:40.900
AN EVACUATION ORDER NEAR THE

06:40.900 --> 06:42.535
BLAST SITE.

06:42.535 --> 06:43.436
BUT A TWO MILE AREA HAS BEEN

06:43.436 --> 06:45.872
CORDONED OFF.

06:45.872 --> 06:47.574
40 PEOPLE TRYING TO CROSS THE

06:47.574 --> 06:49.109
MEDITERRANEAN SEA FROM LIBYA TO

ITALY WERE FOUND DEAD TODAY ON

06:50.010 --> 06:51.311
THEIR BOAT.

06:51.311 --> 06:52.812
ITALIAN OFFICIALS BELIEVE THEY

06:52.812 --> 06:55.282
DIED FROM INHALING FUEL FUMES.

06:55.282 --> 06:56.983
THE ITALIAN NAVY RESCUED 320

06:56.983 --> 06:59.519
OTHER MIGRANTS TODAY.

06:59.519 --> 07:01.321
250,000 MIGRANTS, MAINLY FROM

07:01.321 --> 07:02.589
AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST, HAVE

07:02.589 --> 07:04.624
CROSSED TO EUROPE THIS YEAR.

07:04.624 --> 07:05.959
MORE THAN 2,300 PEOPLE HAVE DIED

07:05.959 --> 07:07.861
MAKING THE TRIP.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.063
SEA RESCUES THIS SUMMER ARE

07:10.063 --> 07:11.998
APPROACHING 1,000 MIGRANTS A DAY

07:11.998 --> 07:14.734
OFF OF ITALY AND GREECE.

07:14.734 --> 07:16.202
THE SECRET SERVICE CONFIRMS TO

07:16.202 --> 07:17.671
THE NEWSHOUR IT IS EMBARKING ON

07:17.671 --> 07:19.539
AN AGGRESSIVE HIRING PLAN.

07:19.539 --> 07:21.074
REUTERS REPORTED TODAY THE

07:21.074 --> 07:22.876
AGENCY PLANS TO HIRE 700 NEW

07:22.876 --> 07:24.711
UNIFORMED OFFICERS AND 400

07:24.711 --> 07:25.745
SPECIAL AGENTS OVER THE NEXT

07:25.745 --> 07:27.447
FIVE YEARS.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.249
THAT WOULD EXPAND SECRET SERVICE

07:29.249 --> 07:30.684
STAFF BY 17% FROM ITS CURRENT

07:30.684 --> 07:32.852
6,600 EMPLOYEES.

07:32.852 --> 07:34.421
THE HIRING SPREE COMES IN

07:34.421 --> 07:36.089
RESPONSE TO SECURITY BREACHES AT

07:36.089 --> 07:37.857
THE WHITE HOUSE AND AGENTS BEING

07:37.857 --> 07:39.225
CAUGHT WITH PROSTITUTES ON A

07:39.225 --> 07:41.428
PRESIDENTIAL TRIP TO COLOMBIA.

07:41.428 --> 07:43.263
A NEW STUDY SUGGESTS POLICE

07:43.263 --> 07:45.165
OFFICERS MAY BE MORE LIKELY TO

07:45.165 --> 07:46.900
BE KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY IN

07:46.900 --> 07:47.901
STATES WITH HIGHER RATES OF GUN

07:47.901 --> 07:49.936
OWNERSHIP.

07:49.936 --> 07:51.304
THE STUDY PUBLISHED BY "THE

07:51.304 --> 07:52.772
AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC

07:52.772 --> 07:54.941
HEALTH" REVIEWED AN F.B.I.

07:54.941 --> 07:57.010
DATABASE OF 782 POLICE HOMICIDES

07:57.010 --> 07:59.779
BETWEEN 1996 AND 2010.

07:59.779 --> 08:02.048
IT FOUND ALABAMA, ARKANSAS,

08:02.048 --> 08:03.750
IDAHO, MISSISSIPPI, AND MONTANA

08:03.750 --> 08:05.318
AMONG THE STATES WITH THE

08:05.318 --> 08:06.586
HIGHEST RATE OF POLICE HOMICIDES

08:06.586 --> 08:09.022
AND GUN OWNERSHIP.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.390
STATES WITH THE LOWEST

08:10.390 --> 08:11.558
PERCENTAGE OF GUN OWNERS, LIKE

08:11.558 --> 08:12.525
CONNECTICUT, NEW YORK, NEW

08:12.525 --> 08:13.893
JERSEY, MASSACHUSETTS, AND RHODE

08:13.893 --> 08:15.061
ISLAND, WERE AMONG STATES WITH

08:15.061 --> 08:16.596
THE LOWEST RATE OF POLICE

08:16.596 --> 08:18.131
HOMICIDES.

08:18.131 --> 08:19.699
WYOMING HAD THE HIGHEST RATE OF

08:19.699 --> 08:21.167
GUN OWNERSHIP IN THE U.S. BUT NO

08:21.167 --> 08:22.001
POLICE HOMICIDES IN THE PERIOD

08:22.001 --> 08:23.803
STUDIED.

08:23.803 --> 08:24.904
92% OF POLICE HOMICIDES WERE

08:24.904 --> 08:27.173
COMMITTED WITH GUNS.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.809
10 DAYS AFTER A SPILL OF MINE

08:29.809 --> 08:31.344
WASTE WATER, COLORADO'S ANIMUS

08:31.344 --> 08:32.645
RIVER IS OPEN AGAIN TO

08:32.645 --> 08:34.347
RECREATIONAL USE.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.849
COLORADO'S DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

08:35.849 --> 08:37.016
HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT SAID

08:37.016 --> 08:38.318
YESTERDAY THE CONTAMINATION

08:38.318 --> 08:41.321
LEVELS ARE BELOW WHAT MIGHT HURT

08:41.321 --> 08:42.322
HUMAN HEALTH.

08:42.322 --> 08:43.323
TO UNDERSCORE THE POINT, EARLIER

08:43.323 --> 08:44.023
THIS WEEK, GOVERNOR JOHN

08:44.023 --> 08:45.392
HICKENLOOPER PUT A BACTERIA-

08:45.392 --> 08:46.893

08:46.893 --> 08:47.694
BOTTLE OF RIVER WATER AND DRANK

08:47.694 --> 08:49.028
IT.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.530
THE RIVER HAD TURNED ORANGE

08:50.530 --> 08:51.931
AFTER A CLEAN-UP CREW

08:51.931 --> 08:53.233
ACCIDENTALLY BREACHED A DAM

08:53.233 --> 08:54.234
HOLDING BACK METALS USED IN GOLD

08:54.234 --> 08:55.635
MINING.

08:55.635 --> 08:56.936
THREE MILLIONS GALLONS OF

08:56.936 --> 08:58.338
CONTAMINATED WATER SPILLED INTO

08:58.338 --> 08:59.139
THE RIVER, BUT HAVE SINCE BEEN

08:59.139 --> 09:00.407
DILUTED.

09:00.407 --> 09:02.008
DOWNSTREAM NEW MEXICO HAS LIFTED

09:02.008 --> 09:03.676
A BAN ON DRINKING WATER FROM

09:03.676 --> 09:04.344
WELLS IN THE ANIMUS RIVER

09:04.344 --> 09:05.712
VALLEY.

09:07.447 --> 09:08.948
TAKE AN IN-DEPTH LOOK AT FOLKSY

09:08.948 --> 09:10.049
COMEDIAN WILL ROGERS ON THE 80th

09:10.049 --> 09:11.951
ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH.

09:11.951 --> 09:15.755
VISIT pbs.org/newshour.

09:17.624 --> 09:18.992
>> Sreenivasan: THE NATIONAL

09:18.992 --> 09:20.827
DEBATE OVER EDUCATION QUALITY,

09:20.827 --> 09:22.562
INTEGRATION, AND FUNDING IS

09:22.562 --> 09:23.496
PLAYING OUT IN TWO STATES THIS

09:23.496 --> 09:25.231
WEEK: WASHINGTON AND FLORIDA.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.400
WE BEGIN WITH WASHINGTON STATE,

09:27.400 --> 09:28.968
WHERE STATE LEADERS WILL MEET

09:28.968 --> 09:30.437
MONDAY TO BEGIN ADDRESSING

09:30.437 --> 09:31.638
INEQUITIES IN PUBLIC SCHOOL

09:31.638 --> 09:33.139
FUNDING.

09:33.139 --> 09:34.574
THE MOVE COMES AFTER THE STATE

09:34.574 --> 09:36.543
SUPREME COURT IMPOSED A

09:36.543 --> 09:38.478
$100,000-A-DAY FINE THIS WEEK,

09:38.478 --> 09:40.113
BECAUSE THE JUDGES SAY,

09:40.113 --> 09:41.481
KINDERGARTEN-THROUGH-12th GRADE

09:41.481 --> 09:42.315
EDUCATION IS INSUFFICIENTLY

09:42.315 --> 09:43.950
FUNDED.

09:43.950 --> 09:45.885
THE COURT SAID THE STATE NEEDS

09:45.885 --> 09:47.954
TO DO MORE TO REDUCE CLASS SIZE,

09:47.954 --> 09:49.722
EXPAND KINDERGARTEN, AND RAISE

09:49.722 --> 09:51.858
TEACHER PAY.

09:51.858 --> 09:53.626
OTHER STATES, SUCH AS KANSAS,

09:53.626 --> 09:54.794
OHIO, AND NEW JERSEY, HAVE ALSO

09:54.794 --> 09:55.495
BEEN EMBROILED IN COURT FIGHTS

09:55.495 --> 09:56.996
OVER SCHOOL FUNDING.

09:56.996 --> 09:58.298
JOINING ME NOW TO DISCUSS THE

09:58.298 --> 09:59.466
PROBLEMS IN WASHINGTON STATE IS

09:59.466 --> 10:00.200
"SEATTLE TIMES" REPORTER JOSEPH

10:00.200 --> 10:02.969
O'SULLIVAN.

10:02.969 --> 10:04.404
SO WE'RE ALL PAYING ATTENTION TO

10:04.404 --> 10:06.606
THE $100,000-A-DAY FINE.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.842
THAT SEEMS LIKE STICKER SHOCK TO

10:08.842 --> 10:10.210
A VIEWER OR AUDIENCE MEMBER BUT

10:10.210 --> 10:11.211
THIS HAS BEEN A LONG TIME

10:11.211 --> 10:11.778
COMING.

10:11.778 --> 10:12.612
HOW DID WE GET HERE?

10:12.612 --> 10:16.282
>> SO THE WASHINGTON STATE

10:16.282 --> 10:19.419
CONSTITUTION SAYS EXPRESSLY THAT

10:19.419 --> 10:22.455
EDUCATION IS THE QUOTE, UNQUOTE,

10:22.455 --> 10:24.324
PARAMOUNT DUTY OF THE STATE TO

10:24.324 --> 10:25.959
PROVIDE FOR.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.594
A FAMILY SUED THE STATE, ALONG

10:27.594 --> 10:28.928
WITH SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND

10:28.928 --> 10:30.396
TEACHERS UNIONS SAYING THAT THE

10:30.396 --> 10:33.333
STATE WAS UNDERFUNDING.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.735
AND IT MADE ITS WAY TO THE

10:35.735 --> 10:37.937
SUPREME COURT WHICH IN 1212

10:37.937 --> 10:39.806
AGREED SAYING THE STATE WAS

10:39.806 --> 10:40.673
UNCONSTITUTIONALLY UNDERFUNDING

10:40.673 --> 10:41.307
THE SCHOOL SYSTEM.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.076
SO THE COURT IMPOSED A 2018

10:43.076 --> 10:44.711
DEADLINE FOR THE STATE TO COME

10:44.711 --> 10:46.012
UP WITH MORE FUNDING AND FIX

10:46.012 --> 10:47.247
SOME SPECIFIC PROBLEMS.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.449
>> Sreenivasan: SO HERE WE ARE

10:49.449 --> 10:52.719
NOW, THE COURTS-- THE JUDGES

10:52.719 --> 10:54.754
BASICALLY SAY THEY'RE COMPLETELY

10:54.754 --> 10:55.421
DISSATISFIED.

10:55.421 --> 10:56.856
THEY'RE SLAPPING THIS

10:56.856 --> 10:58.124
SIGNIFICANT FINE ON THEM, BUT IT

10:58.124 --> 11:00.159
DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE CAUSED THE

11:00.159 --> 11:01.594
TYPE OF DETERRENT WE THINK.

11:01.594 --> 11:03.396
IN YOUR REPORTING, YOU SAY SOME

11:03.396 --> 11:04.898
OF THE LEGISLATORS SAY LET'S

11:04.898 --> 11:07.100
KEEP RACKING UP THE FINES UNTIL

11:07.100 --> 11:08.368
JANUARY BALL BECAUSE THAT WILL

11:08.368 --> 11:10.336
STILL ONLY ADD UP TO $14 MILLION

11:10.336 --> 11:11.938
VERSUS WHAT WE HAVE TO FUND THIS

11:11.938 --> 11:12.338
THING BY.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.740
>> SURE, THAT'S THE THING.

11:13.740 --> 11:17.176
THE PENALTY IS SYMBOLIC BECAUSE

11:17.176 --> 11:19.512
$14 MILLION IN A BUDGET $38

11:19.512 --> 11:21.014
BILLION LARGE ISN'T THAT MUCH

11:21.014 --> 11:22.115
MONEY, AND THE PROBLEM IS

11:22.115 --> 11:23.917
SIGNIFICANTLY BIGGER IN THE

11:23.917 --> 11:26.553
PORTION OF THE COURT'S DECISION

11:26.553 --> 11:28.988
ON TEACHER COMPENSATION.

11:28.988 --> 11:30.790
IT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT $3.5

11:30.790 --> 11:32.358
BILLION EVERY TWO-YEAR BUDGET

11:32.358 --> 11:33.259
CYCLE TO FIX.

11:33.259 --> 11:35.194
>> Sreenivasan: OKAY, SO WHAT

11:35.194 --> 11:37.931
ARE SOME OF THE INEQUITIES?

11:37.931 --> 11:40.133
WHAT'S AT THE CORE OF THIS?

11:40.133 --> 11:44.203
WHAT SORT OF PROGRAMS ARE

11:44.203 --> 11:44.904
MISSING.

11:44.904 --> 11:46.673
IS THERE INEQUITY FROM ONE

11:46.673 --> 11:48.908
NEIGHBORHOOD TO ONE COMMUNITY TO

11:48.908 --> 11:49.742
THE OTHER.

11:49.742 --> 11:52.779
>> THE STATE LEGISLATURE HAS

11:52.779 --> 11:55.181
PROVIDED MORE MONEY FOR TRORS

11:55.181 --> 11:57.216
COSTS AND OPERATION SUPPLIES.

11:57.216 --> 11:59.552
THEY'VE PUT MONEY INTO FUNDING

11:59.552 --> 12:01.688
ALL-DAY KINDERGARTEN, AND

12:01.688 --> 12:04.057
KINDERGARTEN-THREE CLASS-SIZE

12:04.057 --> 12:04.490
REDUCTION.

12:04.490 --> 12:06.092
ONE OF PIECES HANGING OUT THERE

12:06.092 --> 12:08.394
IS THE STATE ISN'T FUNDING

12:08.394 --> 12:09.395
TEACHER PAY ENOUGH.

12:09.395 --> 12:10.396
IN WASHINGTON STATE, LOCAL

12:10.396 --> 12:12.465
PROPERTY TAX LEVIES PROVIDE

12:12.465 --> 12:13.933
SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR TEACHER

12:13.933 --> 12:15.768
PAY, SO LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS

12:15.768 --> 12:17.036
WIND UP COMING UP WITH MORE

12:17.036 --> 12:18.638
MONEY TO PAY THEIR TEACHERS.

12:18.638 --> 12:23.242
AND SEE THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG

12:23.242 --> 12:24.410
INEQUALITY QUESTIONS.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.445
POORER SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT

12:25.445 --> 12:27.547
DON'T HAVE AS WEALTHY RESIDENTS

12:27.547 --> 12:29.415
AND GOOD PROPERTY TAX LEVIES,

12:29.415 --> 12:30.883
THEY CAN'T PROVIDE FUNDING FOR

12:30.883 --> 12:32.752
THEIR TEACHERS AS EASILY AS A

12:32.752 --> 12:33.953
WEALTHY DISTRICT CAN.

12:33.953 --> 12:35.154
AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS

12:35.154 --> 12:36.456
THAT LAWMAKERS ARE GOING TO HAVE

12:36.456 --> 12:37.323
TO FIGURE OUT.

12:37.323 --> 12:39.292
AND IT'S KIND OF-- ONE OF THE

12:39.292 --> 12:40.493
THINGS THAT'S BEING TALKED ABOUT

12:40.493 --> 12:42.362
IS A PROPERTY TAX LEVY SWAP

12:42.362 --> 12:43.529
WHEREBY SOME OF THE RICHER

12:43.529 --> 12:44.897
DISTRICTS WOULD SEND MONEY-- PAY

12:44.897 --> 12:46.599
MORE MONEY AND SEND THAT MONEY

12:46.599 --> 12:48.234
TO THE POORER DISTRICTS BUT

12:48.234 --> 12:49.569
THAT'S VERY POLITICALLY

12:49.569 --> 12:50.703
COMPLICATED TO DO BECAUSE IT'S,

12:50.703 --> 12:52.905
YOU KNOW, POLITICALLY TRICKY FOR

12:52.905 --> 12:53.740
EVERYBODY.

12:53.740 --> 12:54.574
>> Sreenivasan: WHERE ELSE IS

12:54.574 --> 12:55.508
THIS HAPPENING?

12:55.508 --> 12:57.744
OR IS THIS JUST PECULIAR TO

12:57.744 --> 12:58.978
WASHINGTON STATE BECAUSE OF HOW

12:58.978 --> 13:00.113
THE CONSTITUTION'S WRITTEN?

13:00.113 --> 13:02.782
>> SO, THESE HAVE PLAYED OUT IN

13:02.782 --> 13:06.452
A LOT OF STATES.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.121
ABOUT 45 STATES HAVE HAD SOME

13:08.121 --> 13:09.856
KIND OF LITIGATION BEFORE.

13:09.856 --> 13:10.857
FOR WASHINGTON STATE, WE

13:10.857 --> 13:12.191
ACTUALLY HAD A SIMILAR CASE BACK

13:12.191 --> 13:14.460
IN THE 70s TO DEAL WITH

13:14.460 --> 13:15.795
TEACHER COMPENSATION AND LOCAL

13:15.795 --> 13:16.896
PROPERTY TAX LEVIES.

13:16.896 --> 13:18.998
SO IT'S NOT SUPER UNUSUAL.

13:18.998 --> 13:20.700
WHAT IS UNUSUAL FOR US THIS TIME

13:20.700 --> 13:22.502
IS THAT IT'S THE FIRST TIME THE

13:22.502 --> 13:24.003
STATE HAS SANCTIONED-- THE COURT

13:24.003 --> 13:25.271
HAS SANCTIONED THE STATE AND

13:25.271 --> 13:26.572
FINED THE STATE.

13:26.572 --> 13:27.807
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT

13:27.807 --> 13:29.375
JOSEPH O'SULLIVAN FROM "THE

13:29.375 --> 13:30.710
SEATTLE TIMES," THANKS SO MUCH.

13:30.710 --> 13:34.881
>> THANK YOU.

13:34.881 --> 13:35.648
>> Sreenivasan: TURNING NOW TO

13:35.648 --> 13:36.849
FLORIDA THIS WEEK, THE "TAMPA

13:36.849 --> 13:37.950
BAY TIMES" PUBLISHED AN

13:37.950 --> 13:39.218

NEIGHBORHOODS OF ST. PETERSBURG,

13:42.155 --> 13:43.489

IN PART, RACIAL RE-SEGREGATION

13:47.126 --> 13:48.127
OVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS.

13:48.127 --> 13:50.530

14:00.173 --> 14:01.607

14:01.607 --> 14:02.308
WROTE THE STORY.

14:02.308 --> 14:05.912
HE JOINS ME NOW.

14:05.912 --> 14:06.946
SO, YOU KNOW, LET'S INOCULATE

14:06.946 --> 14:08.081
SOME OF THE BASIC RESERVATIONS

14:08.081 --> 14:09.849
THAT COME UP WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

14:09.849 --> 14:10.616
STORIES LIKE THIS.

14:10.616 --> 14:13.252
THAT THIS IS' POVERTY PROBLEM

14:13.252 --> 14:14.520
AND YOU REPORT THIS IS NOT.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.021
WHY?

14:15.021 --> 14:15.888
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

14:15.888 --> 14:19.592
FROM OUR REPORTING WE LOOKED AT

14:19.592 --> 14:22.762
ANY MEASURE THAT YOU CAN THINK

14:22.762 --> 14:25.198
OF-- ANY SOCIOECONOMIC

14:25.198 --> 14:26.666
MEASURE THAT YOU CAN THINK OF

14:26.666 --> 14:27.166
A NEIGHBORHOOD.

14:27.166 --> 14:28.534
WE LOOKED AT THE LEVELS OF

14:28.534 --> 14:29.969
POVERTY, MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD

14:29.969 --> 14:32.271
INCOME, RATES OF COLLEGE

14:32.271 --> 14:33.539
GRADUATION, RATES OF

14:33.539 --> 14:34.907
SINGLE-PARENT HOMES, AND BY ANY

14:34.907 --> 14:36.843
MEASURE WE COULD FIND, PINNELLAS

14:36.843 --> 14:38.010
COUNTY, FLORIDA, FALLS DEAD IN

14:38.010 --> 14:39.378
THE MIDDLE OF THE PACK OF ALL

14:39.378 --> 14:40.913
FLORIDA COUNTIES.

14:40.913 --> 14:42.615
>> Sreenivasan: BUT IT'S STILL

14:42.615 --> 14:43.983
PRODUCING THESE FAILURE FACTORS.

14:43.983 --> 14:44.851
ANOTHER RESERVATION IS PEOPLE

14:44.851 --> 14:46.219
ARE GOING TO SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:46.219 --> 14:48.554
IT'S THE PARENTS' PROBLEM.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.523
THE KIDS WEREN'T READY TO START

14:50.523 --> 14:51.357
SCHOOL.

14:51.357 --> 14:52.925
HAD THEY GOT THERE THEY WERE

14:52.925 --> 14:53.559
ALREADY BEHIND.

14:53.559 --> 14:54.927
BUT YOU FOUND OUT--

14:54.927 --> 14:55.962
>> THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT.

14:55.962 --> 14:56.896
AND THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST

14:56.896 --> 14:58.164
COMMON THING YOU HEAR WHEN

14:58.164 --> 15:00.133
YOU'RE DOING A STORY LIKE THIS.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.735
WHAT WE DID IS WE ANALYZED A

15:02.735 --> 15:04.570
BATCH OF KINDERGARTEN-READINESS

15:04.570 --> 15:06.005
DATA, TESTS THAT KIDS TAKE WHEN

15:06.005 --> 15:07.073
THEY'RE COMING INTO KINDERGARTEN

15:07.073 --> 15:08.341
TO SEE HOW PREPARED THEY ARE

15:08.341 --> 15:09.942
SHOWING UP FOR SCHOOL.

15:09.942 --> 15:12.478
AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT OUR

15:12.478 --> 15:14.947
KIDS IN THESE SCHOOLS WERE NO

15:14.947 --> 15:16.649
LESS PREPARED THAN CHILDREN IN

15:16.649 --> 15:17.850
SCORES OF OTHER SCHOOLS ACROSS

15:17.850 --> 15:19.619
FLORIDA BUT IT WAS ONLY AFTER A

15:19.619 --> 15:21.821
FEW YEARS IN THESE FIVE SCHOOLS

15:21.821 --> 15:22.755
THAT THEY WERE FALLING

15:22.755 --> 15:23.589
DRAMATICALLY BEHIND.

15:23.589 --> 15:24.590
>> Sreenivasan: AND THESE FIVE

15:24.590 --> 15:25.458
SCHOOLS WERE NOT ALWAYS THAT

15:25.458 --> 15:26.058
WAY.

15:26.058 --> 15:26.993
YOU TRACE IS BACK TO SOMETHING

15:26.993 --> 15:28.928
THAT HAPPENED EIGHT YEARS AGO.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.997
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT

15:30.997 --> 15:32.165
RESEGREGATION IS LEADING TO

15:32.165 --> 15:32.865
THESE PROBLEMS?

15:32.865 --> 15:35.668
>> WELL, I MEAN, THIS ABSOLUTELY

15:35.668 --> 15:37.170
WAS A RECENT PHENOMENON.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.806
EIGHT YEARS AGO, SCHOOLS WERE

15:39.806 --> 15:41.007
ABOUT AVERAGE.

15:41.007 --> 15:42.375
KIDS WERE PERFORMING MUCH

15:42.375 --> 15:44.544
BETTER, AND THEN OUR SCHOOL

15:44.544 --> 15:47.146
BOARD VOTED FAIR PLAN THAT

15:47.146 --> 15:48.381
EFFECTIVELY RESEGREGATED THE

15:48.381 --> 15:49.081
SCHOOLS.

15:49.081 --> 15:51.818
IT ENDED INTEGRATION EFFORTS AND

15:51.818 --> 15:53.186
CREATED A SITUATION WHERE

15:53.186 --> 15:55.288
CHILDREN IN PREDOMINANTLY BLACK

15:55.288 --> 15:56.189
NEIGHBORHOODS WERE SUDDENLY

15:56.189 --> 15:57.423
GOING TO PREDOMINANTLY BLACK

15:57.423 --> 15:58.257
SCHOOLS.

15:58.257 --> 15:59.258
THEY KNEW THAT THIS WAS GOING TO

15:59.258 --> 16:02.461
HAPPEN WHEN THEY MADE THIS

16:02.461 --> 16:03.262
DECISION.

16:03.262 --> 16:05.698
AND IN ORDER TO MAKE IT GO DOWN

16:05.698 --> 16:07.834
EASIER, THEY PROMISED THAT THESE

16:07.834 --> 16:08.634
SCHOOLS WOULD BE FLOODED WITH

16:08.634 --> 16:09.869
MONEY AND RESOURCES.

16:09.869 --> 16:10.469
>> Sreenivasan: DID THAT

16:10.469 --> 16:11.137
HAPPEN.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.505
>> SOCIAL WORKERS, COUNSELORS,

16:12.505 --> 16:14.440
THAT TYPE OF THING.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.209
NO, THAT NEVER HAPPENED.

16:16.209 --> 16:17.276
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT DID

16:17.276 --> 16:18.110
HAPPEN AS A RESULT?

16:18.110 --> 16:20.379
>> WELL, AS A RESULT, THE

16:20.379 --> 16:22.148
SCHOOLS GOT A LITTLE BIT WORSE

16:22.148 --> 16:23.349
ACADEMICALLY, AND A LITTLE BIT

16:23.349 --> 16:24.717
MORE DISORDERED AND CHAOTIC YEAR

16:24.717 --> 16:26.519
AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.120
TEACHERS FLED.

16:28.120 --> 16:29.989
KIDS BEGAN NOT TO FEEL SAFE IN

16:29.989 --> 16:31.657
CLASS, AND WE GOT TO THE

16:31.657 --> 16:33.526
SITUATION WHERE WE ARE TODAY.

16:33.526 --> 16:34.660
>> Sreenivasan: YOUR REPORTING

16:34.660 --> 16:36.162
ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THAT THERE ARE

16:36.162 --> 16:37.196
OTHER COUNTIES IN FLORIDA THAT

16:37.196 --> 16:38.664
MIGHT BE STATISTICALLY WORSE OFF

16:38.664 --> 16:40.766
BUT ARE HAVING BETTER OUTCOMES

16:40.766 --> 16:42.401
BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING THINGS

16:42.401 --> 16:45.771
THAT THIS COUNTY IS NOT.

16:45.771 --> 16:46.372
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

16:46.372 --> 16:48.674
YOU SEE IN BROWARD COUNTY, FOR

16:48.674 --> 16:50.877
EXAMPLE, THEY CREATED AN OFFICE

16:50.877 --> 16:53.412
DEDICATED SLOWLY TO RAISING THE

16:53.412 --> 16:54.747
ACHIEVEMENT LEVELS OF BLACK

MALES.

16:55.281 --> 16:56.983
THEY TRACK THEIR STUDENTS'

16:56.983 --> 16:58.084
PROGRESS IN REAL TIME.

16:58.084 --> 16:59.185
OWNER COUNTY HAS A SIMILAR

16:59.185 --> 17:02.488
OFFICE THAT TARGETS MINORITY

17:02.488 --> 17:03.689
ACHIEVEMENT.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.691
DEVAL COUNTY IS PAYING TEACHERS

17:09.862 --> 17:11.063

20:37.403 --> 20:40.072
STATION.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.407
>> Reporter: HYDROGEN CAN BE

20:41.407 --> 20:42.441
USED TO RUN VEHICLES AND

20:42.441 --> 20:44.276
MACHINERY.

20:44.276 --> 20:46.011
ROGERS USES IT THAT WAY, AND HE

20:46.011 --> 20:48.013
USES HIS OWN INTRICATE AND

20:48.013 --> 20:49.548
EXPENSIVE EXPERIMENT IN OFF THE

20:49.548 --> 20:50.382
GRID LIVING TO PRESS HOME A

20:50.382 --> 20:52.017
POINT.

20:52.017 --> 20:54.220
>> WE'RE EXPERIMENTING WITH ALL

20:54.220 --> 20:55.488
THIS BECAUSE WE CAN, AND BECAUSE

20:55.488 --> 20:56.322
I WANT TO AND IT'S THE RIGHT

20:56.322 --> 20:57.623
THING TO DO.

20:57.623 --> 20:59.225
>> Reporter: ROGERS IS CONFIDENT

20:59.225 --> 21:00.759
THAT AS ENERGY STORAGE

21:00.759 --> 21:02.461
TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES, THE NUMBER

21:02.461 --> 21:03.963
OF RESIDENTS CHOOSING TO MOVE

21:03.963 --> 21:04.930
OFF OF THE ELECTRICAL GRID WILL

21:04.930 --> 21:06.365
INCREASE.

21:06.365 --> 21:07.466
>> OKAY, SO I'M A HIGHER NET

21:07.466 --> 21:08.734
WORTH INDIVIDUAL.

21:08.734 --> 21:10.569
I CAN AFFORD TO DO THIS.

21:10.569 --> 21:11.504
BUT IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

21:11.504 --> 21:12.438
BEFORE EVERYONE CAN AFFORD TO DO

21:12.438 --> 21:13.405
THIS.

21:13.405 --> 21:15.741
AND WHEN THEY CAN, THEY WILL.

21:15.741 --> 21:16.942
>> Sreenivasan: SINCE WE FIRST

21:37.963 --> 21:39.498
HOW'S THAT WORKING OUT FOR YOU?

21:39.498 --> 21:42.034
>> IT'S NOT!

21:52.111 --> 21:52.711
>> Sreenivasan: FINALLY

21:52.711 --> 21:53.879
TONIGHT, A WEEK-LONG HEAT WAVE

21:53.879 --> 21:55.848
IN EGYPT HAS LEFT AT LEAST 93

21:55.848 --> 21:56.982
PEOPLE DEAD.

21:56.982 --> 21:59.151

22:09.395 --> 22:10.262
55,000 FANS WERE THERE.

22:10.262 --> 22:12.531
THE BAND'S HALF-HOUR SET WAS THE

22:12.531 --> 22:14.333
FIRST ROCK CONCERT TO FILL A
