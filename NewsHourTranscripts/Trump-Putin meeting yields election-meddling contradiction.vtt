JUDY WOODRUFF: It was the most
highly anticipated meeting
yet of the Trump presidency.

00:04.833 --> 00:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the first time since
he took office, Mr. Trump
was face-to-face with
his Russian counterpart,

00:10.833 --> 00:11.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Vladimir Putin.

00:11.866 --> 00:13.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
On the agenda?

00:13.900 --> 00:17.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syria, North Korea, and
Moscow's meddling in the 2016
election, about which there is

00:19.600 --> 00:21.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
still disagreement.

00:21.533 --> 00:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From the G20 summit in Hamburg,
Germany, special correspondent
Ryan Chilcote reports.

00:28.433 --> 00:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: What was planned
to last just over half-an-hour
turned into an unexpected

00:33.133 --> 00:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
two hours and 15 minutes.

00:36.100 --> 00:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump and
Russian President Vladimir
Putin began their much
anticipated face-to-face

00:43.066 --> 00:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by exchanging visibly friendly
greetings, given the state
of U.S.-Russia relations.

00:45.233 --> 00:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: We're going to
have a talk now, and obviously

00:50.900 --> 00:52.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that will continue.

00:52.933 --> 00:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we look forward to a lot of
very positive things happening
for Russia, for the United

00:54.366 --> 00:57.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
States and for
everybody concerned.

00:57.333 --> 00:59.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it's an honor
to be with you.

00:59.800 --> 01:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through
translator): I'm delighted
to be able to meet

01:02.566 --> 01:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you personally, Mr. President,
and I hope, as you said, our
meeting will yield positive

01:07.000 --> 01:09.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
results.

01:09.066 --> 01:13.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: News of what was
discussed came afterward from
the countries' top diplomats,

01:15.000 --> 01:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson
and Foreign Minister Sergei
Lavrov, among them, allegations

01:19.900 --> 01:21.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that Russia meddled
in the U.S. election.

01:21.866 --> 01:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In an audio-only briefing,
Tillerson said Mr. Trump brought
up the issue at the outset,

01:26.733 --> 01:29.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and said the pair had a
robust and lengthy discussion.

01:29.266 --> 01:34.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary
of State: The president opened
the meeting with President

01:36.233 --> 01:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Putin by raising the concerns
of the American people regarding
Russian interference in the

01:40.033 --> 01:41.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
2016 election.

01:41.966 --> 01:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The two leaders agreed, though,
that this is a substantial
hindrance in the ability

01:48.633 --> 01:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of us to move the Russian-U.S.
relationship forward, and
agreed to exchange further work

01:55.266 --> 01:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regarding commitments of
noninterference in the
affairs of the United
States and our democratic

02:01.033 --> 02:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
process, as well as
those of other countries.

02:03.500 --> 02:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: Tillerson added,
Putin denied any involvement.

02:06.766 --> 02:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Russian foreign minister
offered his own account.

02:08.933 --> 02:12.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SERGEI LAVROV, Russian Foreign
Minister (through translator):
President Trump said that the

02:12.266 --> 02:16.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaign is already taking on
a rather strange character,
because during the many months

02:16.566 --> 02:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that these accusations
have been aired, there
hasn't been a single fact.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
President Trump has said
he's heard President
Putin's definitive
statements that is not

02:24.366 --> 02:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
true, and that the
Russian leadership didn't
intervene in the election,
and that he accepts

02:28.466 --> 02:30.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
those statements.

02:30.500 --> 02:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: Yesterday, Mr.
Trump conceded Russia likely
played a role, but stopped short

02:33.800 --> 02:36.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of blaming them solely
for the election hack.

02:36.433 --> 02:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tillerson today said the
Russians asked for proof of
interference, but stressed, both

02:41.133 --> 02:43.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
leaders agreed it's
best to move on.

02:43.266 --> 02:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REX TILLERSON: The president's
rightly focused on, how do we
move forward from what may be

02:49.500 --> 02:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
simply an intractable
disagreement at this point?

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the relationship
-- and the president
made this clear as well
-- it's too important.

02:59.033 --> 03:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's too important to not
find a way to move forward,
not dismissing the issue in

03:01.866 --> 03:03.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
any way.

03:03.966 --> 03:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: The two leaders
also discussed a cease-fire
plan in place for southwestern

03:08.333 --> 03:10.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Syria.

03:10.400 --> 03:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REX TILLERSON: I think this is
our first indication of the U.S.
and Russia being able to work

03:15.900 --> 03:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
together in Syria, and as a
result of that, we had a very
lengthy discussion regarding

03:21.033 --> 03:24.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other areas in Syria that we
can continue to work together
on to de-escalate the areas.

03:27.066 --> 03:29.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: Tillerson,
though, reiterated
the U.S. position that
Syrian President Bashar

03:29.666 --> 03:33.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
al-Assad must eventually
go, something Russia
has publicly opposed.

03:33.500 --> 03:38.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All the while, outside today's
summit, there was no letup
in massive demonstrations.

03:40.333 --> 03:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clashes between protesters
and police engulfed Germany's
second largest city.

03:46.633 --> 03:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police again resorted to
water cannons and tear gas to
disperse crowds, and scores were

03:49.266 --> 03:51.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
arrested.

03:51.233 --> 03:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
German officials say more
than 100 police officers
have been injured.

03:58.500 --> 04:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile everyone here
inside the G20 conference
center, and, by that I
mean, not just journalists,

04:04.033 --> 04:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but a lot of the G20 delegations
as well, are focused on
trying to find out as much

04:09.766 --> 04:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as they possibly can what
actually was discussed
behind closed doors
between the presidents

04:12.233 --> 04:14.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the United States
and Russia -- Judy.

04:14.300 --> 04:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're right,
a lot of questions, Ryan,
two hours and 20 minutes.

04:18.033 --> 04:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, this
contradiction that is
apparently there, you have
the Russian foreign minister

04:24.933 --> 04:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying that President Trump
accent President Putin's denial
about Russian metaling and

04:31.000 --> 04:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then, as we heard, Secretary
of State Rex Tillerson is
saying they just -- they are

04:35.866 --> 04:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
intractably in disagreement.

04:37.300 --> 04:39.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, how do we read this?

04:39.666 --> 04:43.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RYAN CHILCOTE: Yes,
it's an interesting one.

04:43.566 --> 04:47.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The straight answer is,
we really don't know
exactly what was said.

04:47.166 --> 04:52.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Russian foreign minister,
as you pointed out, did indeed
say that President Trump had

04:52.033 --> 04:54.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
accepted President
Putin's denial.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now, I thought about this.

04:56.833 --> 05:01.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You could have theoretically
accept something without
concurring with the view.

05:02.900 --> 05:04.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But that's not
what happened here.

05:04.366 --> 05:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I listened to all of the Russian
foreign minister's comments.

05:06.400 --> 05:09.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have been speaking
Russian for 28 years.

05:09.133 --> 05:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And together with a group of six
native speakers, we went through
the entire statement on the

05:14.733 --> 05:15.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issue.

05:15.733 --> 05:17.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He went much further.

05:17.766 --> 05:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said, right, that President
Trump has also asserted in this
meeting that he hadn't heard

05:21.033 --> 05:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a single fact in the
month of allegations of
meddling in the election.

05:28.033 --> 05:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, how does that meddle
-- sort of fit in with what
Rex Tillerson was saying?

05:34.400 --> 05:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, interesting, the U.S.
secretary of state kind of gave
us some mixed signals, didn't

05:36.400 --> 05:38.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
he?

05:38.400 --> 05:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On one the hand, he began the
press conference by saying
that President Trump had really

05:40.933 --> 05:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pressed President Putin and
pushed him on this issue, but
he also said -- and I quote

05:47.933 --> 05:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - "The two presidents didn't
relitigate the past, that
they were committed to working

05:51.833 --> 05:53.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
towards the future."

05:53.900 --> 05:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was the U.S.' position
that the best way to do that
was to try in the future to

05:57.433 --> 06:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
win some kind of guarantee,
some kind of commitment
in writing from the
Russians that they wouldn't

06:01.833 --> 06:05.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interfere in the future in U.S.
domestic policy or elections.

06:05.100 --> 06:07.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let
me turn you to Syria.

06:07.933 --> 06:12.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After the meeting, it was
announced that the two countries
have agreed on a cease-fire

06:12.500 --> 06:16.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for a part of Syria and
that ongoing civil war.

06:16.866 --> 06:19.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What do we know about
the details of that?

06:19.366 --> 06:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: So, what we know
is that both the United States
and Russia have been discussing

06:26.266 --> 06:27.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this for some time.

06:27.966 --> 06:31.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It looks like most
of the agreement was
worked out in advance.

06:31.266 --> 06:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They signed a memorandum of
understanding between Russia,
the United States and Jordan

06:35.366 --> 06:40.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that they would have
a cease-fire that will
begin shortly in the
south in Syria, and that

06:42.300 --> 06:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there would be a plan to
de-escalate or lower, reduce the
violence in the southwest of the

06:45.233 --> 06:47.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

06:47.233 --> 06:51.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The secretary of state did
say that there was still a
couple more meetings that were

06:51.200 --> 06:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
necessary, maybe another week
to work out the details of who
would actually be providing

06:55.000 --> 06:57.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
security on the ground.

06:57.033 --> 06:59.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would point out that,
remember, it's not just Russia
and the United States that

06:59.766 --> 07:00.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have forces in Syria.

07:00.966 --> 07:02.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Iran does as well.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it would be interesting
to see how they fit
into this agreement.

07:04.933 --> 07:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would also point out that
we have had four cease-fire
agreements before this.

07:10.666 --> 07:12.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: True.

07:12.833 --> 07:16.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Ryan, finally, so many
journalists there and
others watching this
meeting today between

07:17.833 --> 07:19.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Russian and
the U.S. president.

07:19.500 --> 07:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are people taking away?

07:21.533 --> 07:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What did you take away from
this, I mean, in terms of how
they addressed -- how they

07:24.900 --> 07:27.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
looked when they were
together, what they said?

07:27.566 --> 07:32.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RYAN CHILCOTE: Well, the
body language was warm.

07:32.433 --> 07:33.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's no doubt.

07:33.433 --> 07:35.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no questioning that.

07:35.166 --> 07:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You could really see that.

07:37.233 --> 07:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Putin, for his part,
when he was speaking Russian,
he was very differential.

07:41.366 --> 07:43.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He was very polite.

07:43.933 --> 07:47.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was very -- went out of
his way to be respectful,
calling President Trump
"Mr. President" as

07:49.300 --> 07:51.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he addressed him.

07:51.900 --> 07:55.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then we heard from
Rex Tillerson say that
