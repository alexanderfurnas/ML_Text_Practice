00:05.339 --> 00:07.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:07.808 --> 00:09.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:09.276 --> 00:12.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES COMEY, FBI Director: No
charges are
appropriate in this case.

00:12.079 --> 00:17.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Despite declaring
Hillary Clinton's
use of a private e-mail server
while secretary

00:17.384 --> 00:23.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of state extremely careless, the
FBI says
there is not enough evidence to
bring criminal

00:23.223 --> 00:24.992 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
charges.

00:25.025 --> 00:30.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, we kick off a new series,
Fault Lines.
We go in the trenches to see how
one isolated

00:30.764 --> 00:35.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
town is fighting fiercely to
separate from
Ukraine and join Russia.

00:35.936 --> 00:39.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANYA, Ukraine (through
translator): I'm ready
to die for my home. I will not
let A single

00:39.439 --> 00:42.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fascist into my home. I will
fight them as
long as my heart beats.

00:42.876 --> 00:48.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And an update
from Baltimore:
Another police officer stands
trial this week

00:48.482 --> 00:53.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the death of a 25-year-old
black man, Freddie
Gray. A look at why the
prosecution is having

00:53.854 --> 00:56.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
such a hard time making its
case.

00:56.456 --> 01:03.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:03.964 --> 01:06.767 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:06.800 --> 01:16.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For Hillary
Clinton today,
a recommendation and a rebuke
from the Federal

01:16.677 --> 01:23.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bureau of Investigation. It came
after a year-long
investigation into her use of a
private e-mail

01:23.350 --> 01:25.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
server when she was the nation's
top diplomat.

01:25.886 --> 01:28.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES COMEY, FBI Director: No
charges are
appropriate in this case.

01:28.488 --> 01:34.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: With those seven
words, FBI
Director James Comey all but
lifted the legal

01:34.594 --> 01:41.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
threat to the Democrats'
presidential nominee-to-be.
He said, in essence,
investigators found no

01:41.101 --> 01:44.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wanton wrongdoing to make
criminal charges
stick.

01:44.805 --> 01:49.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: Although there is
evidence of
potential violations of the
statutes regarding

01:49.843 --> 01:55.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the handling of classified
information, our
judgment is that no reasonable
prosecutor

01:55.215 --> 01:57.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would bring such a case.

01:57.184 --> 02:02.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But Comey also
spoke in blistering
terms about Clinton's use of a
private e-mail

02:02.489 --> 02:04.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
server as secretary of state.

02:04.524 --> 02:09.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: Although we didn't
find clear
evidence that Secretary Clinton
or her colleagues

02:09.529 --> 02:15.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
intended to violate laws
governing the handling
of classified information, there
is evidence

02:15.268 --> 02:20.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that they were extremely
careless in their
handling of very sensitive,
highly classified

02:20.407 --> 02:22.175 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
information.

02:22.209 --> 02:26.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton has
acknowledged it
was a mistake to use a private
e-mail system,

02:27.014 --> 02:31.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
but she's asserted that
classified material
was never handled improperly.

02:31.151 --> 02:38.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I didn't e-mail any classified
material to

02:38.358 --> 02:41.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anyone on my e-mail. There is no
classified
material.

02:41.361 --> 02:48.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Today, however,
the FBI found
that 110 e-mails contained
information that

02:48.335 --> 02:56.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was classified when it was sent
or received.
And the FBI also found it is --
quote -- "possible"

02:56.076 --> 02:59.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that hostile actors got access
to the secretary's
account.

02:59.479 --> 03:04.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: Any reasonable
person in Secretary
Clinton's position, or in the
position of

03:04.251 --> 03:09.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
those with whom she was
corresponding about
these matters, should have known
that an unclassified

03:09.322 --> 03:11.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
system was no place for that
conversation.

03:11.525 --> 03:16.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The announcement
came after
the FBI interviewed Clinton for
three-and-a-half-hours

03:16.963 --> 03:23.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Saturday. The candidate was
speaking in
Washington as Comey made his
report. She didn't

03:23.603 --> 03:27.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
address it there, or later, in
Charlotte,
North Carolina.

03:27.040 --> 03:33.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, her campaign issued a
statement,
saying: "We are pleased that the
career officials

03:33.213 --> 03:38.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
handling this case have
determined that no
further action is appropriate.
We are glad

03:38.885 --> 03:42.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that this matter is now
resolved."

03:42.189 --> 03:48.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican reaction to Comey's
announcement
was swift and strongly negative.
The GOP's

03:48.395 --> 03:56.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presumptive presidential nominee
Donald Trump
took to Twitter, saying: "No
charges. Wow.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.638 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
#riggedsystem."

03:58.672 --> 04:03.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And House Speaker Paul Ryan said
in a statement:
"This announcement defies
explanation. No

04:03.743 --> 04:06.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
one should be above the law."

04:06.113 --> 04:11.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House said it would
have no official
response to the FBI findings.

04:11.051 --> 04:16.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They now go to the Justice
Department, where
Attorney General Loretta Lynch
said last week

04:16.656 --> 04:23.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she will follow prosecutors'
recommendations.
That followed a furor over her
impromptu meeting

04:23.196 --> 04:28.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with former President Bill
Clinton. The FBI
also found the State Department
was generally

04:29.002 --> 04:31.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lax about handling classified
material.

04:31.571 --> 04:36.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A department spokesman responded
that, "We
take it very, very seriously."

04:36.676 --> 04:41.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will take a closer look at
the FBI findings
after this news summary.

04:41.314 --> 04:46.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of this unfolded on the same
day that
President Obama campaigned with
Hillary Clinton

04:46.620 --> 04:52.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the first time this year.
The one-time
rivals flew together on Air
Force One, and

04:52.159 --> 04:56.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
appeared at a rally in
Charlotte, North Carolina.
The president said Clinton is
ready for the

04:56.830 --> 04:58.632 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Oval Office.

04:58.665 --> 05:03.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
I can tell you this. Hillary
Clinton has been

05:03.537 --> 05:10.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tested, she has seen up close
what's involved
in making those decisions, and
there has never

05:10.243 --> 05:20.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been any man or woman more
qualified for this
office than Hillary Clinton,
ever.

05:20.353 --> 05:22.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

05:22.222 --> 05:27.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Republican Donald
Trump also
campaigns in North Carolina
tonight.

05:27.227 --> 05:32.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraqi search teams recovered
more bodies in
Baghdad today, and the death
toll from Sunday's

05:33.033 --> 05:40.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
bombing soared to 250.
Distraught family members
held funeral processions in the
Iraqi capital.

05:40.407 --> 05:46.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They carried caskets past
charred buildings
as word came that the country's
interior minister

05:46.079 --> 05:47.847 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has resigned.

05:47.881 --> 05:53.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, officials in
Istanbul, Turkey,
jailed 17 more suspects in last
week's airport

05:53.887 --> 05:56.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bombings that killed 45.

05:56.623 --> 06:02.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An El-Al flight from New York to
Tel Aviv
made it safely to Israel today
after a bomb

06:02.262 --> 06:08.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
threat that turned out to be a
hoax. The flight
was escorted across Europe by
French, Swiss

06:08.235 --> 06:13.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Bulgarian warplanes. In Tel
Aviv, family
members anxiously waited for
relatives who'd

06:13.873 --> 06:17.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been on board and were unaware
of the drama
until landing.

06:17.444 --> 06:21.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MACHLIS, Passenger: I
heard that the
plane was accompanied by a
fighter plane,

06:21.615 --> 06:27.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Switzerland or from what,
but I didn't
see it. And just as well that I
didn't see

06:27.787 --> 06:30.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it. It wouldn't have helped my
situation.

06:30.323 --> 06:34.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: El-Al, Israel's
national carrier,
is considered one of the world's
most secure

06:34.794 --> 06:36.563 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
airlines.

06:36.596 --> 06:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's fresh economic fallout
from Britain's
decision to leave the European
Union. The

06:40.834 --> 06:47.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
British pound tumbled today to a
new 31-year
low against the dollar, while
business confidence

06:47.374 --> 06:53.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dropped sharply. And major real
estate funds
moved to stop a run on their
assets. The Bank

06:53.246 --> 06:58.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of England reacted with moves to
help banks
free up more money for lending.

06:58.718 --> 07:04.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In France, the government
invoked special
constitutional powers to push a
labor reform

07:04.057 --> 07:09.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bill closer to enactment. The
measure would
make it easier to hire and fire
workers, and

07:09.629 --> 07:15.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it has angered labor unions.
Thousands of
union members marched through
Paris in protest

07:15.368 --> 07:20.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today, and opposition lawmakers
walked out
as the prime minister defended
the bill in

07:20.307 --> 07:22.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the National Assembly.

07:22.208 --> 07:26.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MANUEL VALLS, French Prime
Minister (through
translator): I decided after
much deliberation

07:26.313 --> 07:31.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to commit the responsibility of
the government
to the vote in its new reading.
The government

07:31.251 --> 07:35.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is proudly transparent, and
proudly courageous,
because we are acting in the
interests of

07:35.755 --> 07:37.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the French people.

07:37.557 --> 07:40.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The labor bill
still has to
get through the French Senate
and through

07:40.860 --> 07:43.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the National Assembly a final
time.

07:44.030 --> 07:49.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Wall Street, stocks fell as
concerns about
Britain's economy grew and oil
prices slumped.

07:49.636 --> 07:56.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 108
points to close at 17840. The
Nasdaq fell

07:56.876 --> 08:01.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
39 points, and the S&amp;P 500
slipped 14.

08:01.247 --> 08:07.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NASA's Juno spacecraft is now
safely in orbit
around Jupiter. The
solar-powered probe completed

08:08.021 --> 08:13.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the final leg of its five-year
journey last
night. On the ground, in
Pasadena, California,

08:13.927 --> 08:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the flight team burst into
cheers as Juno
beamed back signals confirming
its arrival.

08:19.899 --> 08:23.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANE BROWN, Juno Program
Executive: It's
amazing. I mean, the more you
know about the

08:23.436 --> 08:27.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mission, you know just how
tricky this was,
and to have it be flawless, I
mean, I can't

08:27.974 --> 08:32.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really put it into words. You
imagine what
it might feel like, but to
actually have it,

08:32.445 --> 08:35.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to know that we can all go to
bed tonight
not worrying about what is going
to happen

08:35.882 --> 08:38.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tomorrow, it's pretty awesome.

08:38.051 --> 08:43.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Beginning in
August, the probe
is due to begin its mission of
mapping Jupiter

08:43.590 --> 08:46.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over a period of 20 months.

08:46.559 --> 08:51.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And former Congressman, federal
judge and
White House counsel Abner Mikva
died Monday

08:51.931 --> 08:57.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of bladder cancer. The Illinois
Democrat spent
10 years in the House, before
serving on a

08:57.070 --> 09:01.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
federal appeals court, and then
at the Clinton
White House. He received the
Presidential

09:01.875 --> 09:08.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Medal of Freedom in 2014. And in
a statement
today, President Obama called
him a mentor

09:08.348 --> 09:12.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and friend. Abner Mikva was 90
years old.

09:12.051 --> 09:17.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
how the FBI's
recommendation of no criminal
charges against

09:17.056 --> 09:22.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton could influence
the election;
inside the simmering conflict in
Ukraine's

09:22.962 --> 09:33.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
separatist regions; questions of
justice denied
in the Freddie Gray trial; and
much more.

09:33.006 --> 09:41.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
separatist regions; questions of
justice denied
in the Freddie Gray trial; and
much more.

09:41.981 --> 09:46.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And now back to today's
announcement from
the FBI, and the bureau's
year-long probe

09:46.953 --> 09:50.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into Hillary Clinton's e-mail
practices as
secretary of state.

09:50.457 --> 09:57.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, we will delve into the
FBI's findings
with Carrie Johnson. She's
justice correspondent

09:57.130 --> 09:58.398 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for NPR.

09:58.431 --> 10:01.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Carrie Johnson, welcome back to
the "NewsHour."

10:01.067 --> 10:05.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, you told us today
that what
the FBI director did, how he
said this today

10:05.138 --> 10:07.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was unusual. What did you mean
by that?

10:07.807 --> 10:13.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON, NPR: Judy, maybe
even unprecedented.
Nobody I have talked with who's
worked with

10:13.513 --> 10:18.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Justice Department or the
FBI over the
past 25 years can remember an
incident in

10:18.318 --> 10:23.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which an FBI director held a
news conference
to announce his recommendation
about an ongoing

10:23.623 --> 10:25.458 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
criminal matter.

10:25.492 --> 10:30.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is what has happened today.
And, moreover,
FBI Director Jim Comey entered
into an unusual

10:30.630 --> 10:36.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amount of detail about the
nature of the investigation
and all of the steps that the
FBI has taken,

10:36.236 --> 10:42.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
painstaking steps, thousands of
hours of FBI
agents' time, a puzzle -- the
FBI director

10:42.742 --> 10:47.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
likened to getting a jigsaw
puzzle that's
completed, dumping it on the
ground and putting

10:47.881 --> 10:50.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all the pieces back together
again.

10:50.283 --> 10:54.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what Jim Comey says the
FBI's task
was here investigating Hillary
Clinton's e-mail

10:54.320 --> 10:55.154 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
server.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And yet, in the
end...

10:56.556 --> 10:57.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: In fact, for
the...

10:57.490 --> 10:58.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I was just going
to say...

10:59.025 --> 10:59.626 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

10:59.659 --> 11:00.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: I'm sorry.

11:00.059 --> 11:01.094 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

11:01.127 --> 11:01.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: No, go ahead.
Finish your thought.

11:01.694 --> 11:03.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CARRIE JOHNSON: Sure.

11:03.696 --> 11:08.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, he said that it wasn't
just one e-mail
server, Judy. Apparently, she
used different

11:08.768 --> 11:13.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
servers over time and multiple
different BlackBerrys,
so this was kind of a
complicated investigation,

11:13.706 --> 11:15.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more than we knew.

11:15.642 --> 11:19.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And yet, in the
end, Director
Comey said they didn't feel
there was sufficient

11:19.812 --> 11:29.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
information, there was no
determination that
criminal charges should be made.
I think people

11:29.656 --> 11:32.191 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are having a hard time squaring
that.

11:32.225 --> 11:37.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: Yes, including
some Republicans,
as you mentioned in your
newscast.

11:37.764 --> 11:42.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what the FBI director said
was they looked
at three different things in the
course of

11:42.335 --> 11:47.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
this investigation, and
ultimately concluded
that no reasonable prosecutor
would bring

11:48.007 --> 11:51.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a criminal case based on the
facts that the
FBI had at hand.

11:51.678 --> 11:56.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What they were looking at was,
A, whether
Hillary Clinton's e-mail server
had been hacked

11:56.316 --> 12:03.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by any foreign governments or
criminals, B,
whether there was any willful or
intentional

12:03.656 --> 12:09.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
activity with respect to
mishandling classified
information, and, C, whether
there was negligence,

12:09.362 --> 12:12.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
gross negligence, in the
handling of government
secrets.

12:12.165 --> 12:17.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, what the FBI concluded
after reviewing
tens of thousands of pages of
documents, interviewing

12:17.704 --> 12:22.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton on Saturday for
three-and-a-half-hours
in a room, and many of her
closest aides,

12:22.241 --> 12:28.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was that they could find no
clear evidence
of intent to mishandle
government information

12:28.047 --> 12:33.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and government secrets, no
direct evidence
whatsoever that anybody engaged
in obstruction

12:33.553 --> 12:39.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of justice or lied to
investigators and, certainly,
the FBI director said, no
evidence of spying

12:39.792 --> 12:42.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or disloyalty to the U.S.
government.

12:42.662 --> 12:48.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And because they looked back at
a series of
plea deals and indictments over
the last many

12:48.134 --> 12:54.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years, they couldn't find a case
quite like
this one. Jim Comey said the
facts were just

12:54.040 --> 12:59.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not there to go forward with an
intentional
criminal case against Hillary
Clinton or against

12:59.345 --> 13:01.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anybody else in her inner
circle.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, Carrie
Johnson,
thank you.

13:03.016 --> 13:08.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we know that it's now up to
the Department
of Justice to decide what to do
to make that

13:08.521 --> 13:09.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
announcement. That comes next.

13:09.856 --> 13:11.824 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Carrie Johnson, we thank you.

13:11.858 --> 13:14.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: Absolutely.
Thank you.

13:14.093 --> 13:18.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now the
political fallout
from today's FBI announcement.

13:18.264 --> 13:23.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We start with Sean Spicer, chief
strategist
and communications director for
the Republican

13:23.236 --> 13:26.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
National Committee. I spoke to
him a short
time ago.

13:26.873 --> 13:28.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Sean Spicer, welcome.

13:28.875 --> 13:36.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the FBI director -- the FBI
director said
that, despite the finding by his
investigators

13:36.282 --> 13:42.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that e-mails were handled in an
extremely
careless way, that they wouldn't
recommend

13:43.022 --> 13:45.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a criminal prosecution. What's
your reaction?

13:45.458 --> 13:48.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, Communications
Director, Republican
National Committee: Well, today
was an indictment

13:48.461 --> 13:52.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Hillary Clinton's judgment
more than anything,
and an indictment on, frankly,
her fitness

13:52.532 --> 13:54.267 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be president.

13:54.300 --> 13:58.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The 15-minute press conference
was started
with 14 minutes of the director
laying out

13:58.871 --> 14:02.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
her recklessness, her
mishandling of stuff,
the culture that was created at
the State

14:02.909 --> 14:07.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Department. I don't see how the
conclusion
matches the first 14 minutes.

14:07.213 --> 14:11.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The director made a very clear
case that there
were excessive classified
e-mails that she

14:11.451 --> 14:16.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had handled, over 100 at the
top-secret level.
She was reckless with her --
with her handling

14:16.823 --> 14:18.691 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of e-mail.

14:18.725 --> 14:20.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, for someone who
wants to be president
and oversee our national
security, whether

14:20.760 --> 14:24.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or not there was actually a
criminal indictment
is sort of beside the point. The
fact of the

14:24.097 --> 14:29.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
matter is the FBI recognized
that her handling
of classified information, her
handling of

14:29.235 --> 14:34.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
national security was, indeed,
reckless and
not up to someone who should be
president.

14:34.907 --> 14:38.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, as you
know, he said
that in order to bring a
criminal charge,

14:38.778 --> 14:44.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there had to be finding that
Secretary Clinton
or the people around her were
intentional

14:44.817 --> 14:48.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the way they violated
whatever rules there
were at the State Department.
Are you saying

14:48.755 --> 14:52.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that was an erroneous finding on
his part?

14:52.825 --> 14:57.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: Well, obviously, I
think there
is one thing -- the
investigation, I think,

14:57.363 --> 14:59.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was thorough. I think there's --
I don't have
a problem with that.

14:59.465 --> 15:04.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I don't understand the
conclusion, to be honest
with you, on two fronts. Number
one, the definition

15:05.004 --> 15:09.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is gross negligence. And I think
that by what
the director laid out meets the
legal definition

15:09.776 --> 15:14.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of that. She clearly, whether
intentionally
or not, broke the law. The law
was broken,

15:14.947 --> 15:16.649 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the rules weren't followed.

15:16.682 --> 15:21.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You don't -- the law doesn't say
unless you
meant to break it. It's -- the
law is the

15:21.187 --> 15:25.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
law, and if you break it, you
face a penalty.
Thousands of people have been
prosecuted for

15:25.691 --> 15:30.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
mishandling classified
information, and there
is no question she was -- did
that.

15:30.163 --> 15:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, number two, just when it
goes to the
intent, the entire reason she
set up these

15:34.433 --> 15:38.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
private servers -- and make sure
we all get
that that's something that sort
of came out

15:38.204 --> 15:41.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today, that it wasn't just one
server, it
was multiple -- he talked about
how it was

15:41.941 --> 15:43.676 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
susceptible to foreign hacking.

15:43.709 --> 15:49.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the fact is that she set the
server up
in the first place to avoid
detection, to

15:49.448 --> 15:54.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
avoid being monitored and to
avoid transparency.
So this wasn't the use of a
Gmail or a private

15:54.654 --> 16:01.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yahoo! account. She specifically
set this
server up to evade detection and
monitoring.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That in itself goes to intent,
as far as I'm
concerned.

16:03.596 --> 16:06.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is an
appropriate punishment,
in your view?

16:06.499 --> 16:11.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: Well, I'm not a
lawyer. I'm not
in the Department of Justice.

16:11.637 --> 16:16.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do -- I think that not
saying that you
can lay out a case of 14 minutes
of how the

16:16.642 --> 16:22.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- how it was wrong and then say
that it shouldn't,
you know, be prosecuted, I don't
understand

16:22.348 --> 16:24.584 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how you square that circle,
right?

16:24.617 --> 16:29.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He laid out 14 minutes of ways
that she personally
mishandled classified
information, and then

16:29.255 --> 16:34.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said the culture at the State
Department was
reckless under her leadership.
So I don't

16:34.961 --> 16:39.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
understand how you can come to
the conclusion
that then you don't seek
prosecution. I hope

16:39.298 --> 16:42.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the Department of Justice
actually overrules
this.

16:42.101 --> 16:48.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Your party's
nominee for president-to-be,
Donald Trump, is saying that the
system is

16:48.040 --> 16:51.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rigged. He looked at what
happened, said the
system is rigged.

16:51.110 --> 16:53.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you agree with him? And, if
so, who's rigging
it?

16:54.013 --> 16:58.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: Well, I think
there's no question
that when you look at the
countless people

16:58.851 --> 17:03.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who have been prosecuted,
including General
Petraeus, you have to say, how
do you come

17:03.322 --> 17:07.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to this conclusion and not say
that there
should be a prosecution?

17:07.059 --> 17:12.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I actually believe that the
director left
more questions than he answered.
And I think

17:12.365 --> 17:16.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's where I think, after a
week where the
attorney general, Loretta Lynch,
has a private

17:16.802 --> 17:21.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
secret meeting with former
President Bill
Clinton, then Secretary Clinton
gets a special

17:21.574 --> 17:25.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meeting that no one else in
America would
get on the Saturday of a holiday
weekend at

17:25.611 --> 17:29.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FBI headquarters, and then
Tuesday they come
out with the announcement,
Tuesday afternoon,

17:29.515 --> 17:32.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they go to North Carolina to
have a rally,
a unity rally with the president
of the United

17:32.752 --> 17:34.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
States on Air Force One.

17:34.387 --> 17:38.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will be honest with you. I
think today created
more questions than it answered.

17:38.624 --> 17:43.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sean Spicer with
the Republican
National Committee, thank you
very much.

17:43.529 --> 17:45.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: Thanks, Judy.

17:45.164 --> 17:48.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now a
different view.

17:48.167 --> 17:53.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining us live from Capitol
Hill is U.S.
Representative Xavier Becerra of
California.

17:53.272 --> 17:57.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is one of the top-ranking
Democrats in
Congress.

17:57.109 --> 17:59.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Representative Becerra, thank
you very much
for being here.

17:59.445 --> 18:04.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even without a recommendation to
prosecute,
these were pretty damning
findings, weren't

18:04.583 --> 18:05.918 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
they?

18:05.952 --> 18:07.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
REP. XAVIER BECERRA (D),
California: Judy,
thanks for having me.

18:07.853 --> 18:12.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as we have known, and as
the secretary
of her said, we need to do
things differently,

18:12.158 --> 18:16.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all of us, whether it's at the
State Department
or in our own home. We have
learned that we

18:16.262 --> 18:22.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
need to evolve, because
technology is moving
so quickly, that you can't have
the old password

18:22.401 --> 18:25.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you used to have on your
e-mail account,
because you know it's not
sufficient enough

18:25.771 --> 18:27.473 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to clear you.

18:27.506 --> 18:30.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, clearly, if you're going to
be passing
along information that's
classified, you're

18:30.376 --> 18:34.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talking about very sensitive
matters at State
Department, you have to be even
more careful.

18:34.180 --> 18:37.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, yes, I think it's clear --
and the secretary
has admitted -- that we need to
make sure

18:37.917 --> 18:42.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we're doing everything
possible to protect
Americans and the information
that we generate.

18:42.254 --> 18:47.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you
explain, though,
Congressman, Secretary Clinton's
repeated

18:47.593 --> 18:53.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
statements that no classified
information
was sent or received, when the
FBI found that

18:53.466 --> 18:55.267 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it was?

18:55.301 --> 18:57.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. XAVIER BECERRA: And, Judy,
I think we're
all interested in learning a
little bit more

18:57.370 --> 19:03.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about what Director Comey was
saying, because
it could be the difference
between what you

19:03.576 --> 19:10.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are communicating at a
particular moment,
which doesn't receive a
classified designation

19:10.416 --> 19:16.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or a top-secret designation, and
afterwards
may, or, in the opinion of
someone who would

19:16.422 --> 19:22.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have seen that e-mail, say, at
the FBI or
at CIA, they may have said, oh,
this particular

19:22.194 --> 19:24.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
communication should have been
classified.

19:24.330 --> 19:29.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There has been a dispute that's
run for years
between State Department and
some of our intelligence

19:29.835 --> 19:34.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agencies about what really
should be classified.
We got to the point where we
were overclassifying

19:34.640 --> 19:39.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
information. And so it's a
matter of balance,
I think, but we will find out a
little bit

19:39.178 --> 19:42.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more once we all have the
information that
Director Comey was referring to.

19:43.015 --> 19:47.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We just heard
Sean Spicer,
a spokesman at the Republican
National Committee,

19:47.420 --> 19:54.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying that, whatever was done
in a criminal
manner, that what happened with
regard to

19:55.027 --> 20:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these e-mails showed, in his
word, or demonstrated,
in his words, an indictment of
her fitness

20:00.499 --> 20:02.234 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be president.

20:02.268 --> 20:06.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. XAVIER BECERRA: Well, let's
step back
for a moment. As Mr. Spicer
himself said,

20:06.872 --> 20:09.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he is not an attorney. He's a
partisan.

20:09.041 --> 20:13.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clearly, his words were very
partisan, and
that's why we have not put
partisans in charge

20:13.779 --> 20:18.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the investigation. We put the
professionals,
the investigators at the FBI in
charge of

20:18.717 --> 20:23.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this, because we don't need
partisans to start
talking about these things and
making decisions.

20:23.556 --> 20:28.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We want people who are
dispassionate, who
are nonpartisan, who will look
at this information

20:28.527 --> 20:30.296 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
objectively.

20:30.329 --> 20:34.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those who are professionals
and do this
for a living for the safety of
our country

20:34.800 --> 20:39.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have come to the conclusion that
the information
doesn't warrant any action
against the secretary.

20:39.505 --> 20:45.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I take the word of someone
who's at the
FBI and is a professional vs.
the claims of

20:45.311 --> 20:47.079 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a partisan.

20:47.113 --> 20:50.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, even
Democrats, though,
Congressman, say that the
decision by the

20:50.583 --> 20:57.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
secretary to use a private
e-mail server was,
in their words -- with the
potential for classified

20:57.723 --> 21:02.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
information to get out there,
was a serious
lapse in judgment.

21:02.528 --> 21:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. XAVIER BECERRA: And I think
the secretary
would say to you that she made a
mistake,

21:07.800 --> 21:13.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she would do it differently
today. So far,
there is no evidence that shows
that the e-mails

21:13.973 --> 21:18.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
were hacked and that any
information was lost
to anyone in particular.

21:18.110 --> 21:22.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Judy, I think everyone
agrees the reason
the FBI is looking into this is
because it's

21:22.248 --> 21:26.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a serious matter. And, by the
way, this should
be a reminder to all of us, you
better be

21:26.652 --> 21:31.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
updating your passwords. You
better be making
sure that your own systems that
you use to

21:31.257 --> 21:36.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
communicate electronically are
secure, because
technology is running way faster
than most

21:36.529 --> 21:38.297 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
people believe.

21:38.330 --> 21:41.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those who are trying to do
us harm are
trying to keep up, and so it's
up to us to

21:41.867 --> 21:45.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
do the best we can. And
certainly at the Department
of State, they certainly should
be doing the

21:45.538 --> 21:47.039 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
best job possible as well.

21:47.072 --> 21:50.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just very
quickly, do you now
believe this matter is closed?

21:50.743 --> 21:54.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. XAVIER BECERRA: Certainly,
it should
run the time that's necessary,
and I will

21:54.747 --> 21:58.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leave that to the professionals,
those who
are the investigators, to tell
us when it's

21:58.684 --> 22:00.419 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ultimately done.

22:00.452 --> 22:04.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clearly, by the FBI saying that
they find
no basis to take any action, I
think we're

22:04.290 --> 22:08.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coming close, but we have to
hear from the
Department of Justice and their
career prosecutors.

22:09.028 --> 22:12.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But my sense is that, if the
evidence isn't
there to move forward with any
action, that

22:12.798 --> 22:16.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the prosecutors will say, we
probably need
to bring this to a close.

22:16.068 --> 22:19.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Representative
Xavier Becerra,
thank you very much.

22:19.505 --> 22:26.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. XAVIER BECERRA: Thank you,
Judy.

22:26.879 --> 22:34.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tonight, we begin
a weeklong
series from Eastern Europe that
we're calling

22:34.320 --> 22:35.988 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Fault Lines.

22:36.021 --> 22:40.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Friday, NATO will announce
the largest
military buildup in Europe since
the Cold

22:40.292 --> 22:44.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
War. Tensions between the West
and Russia
have reached the highest level
since the fall

22:44.964 --> 22:49.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the Soviet Union. This week,
we will examine
the causes of that tension.

22:49.668 --> 22:56.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we begin with Europe's
only active
front line, in Eastern Ukraine.
For two years,

22:56.275 --> 23:00.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fighters for the self-proclaimed
Donetsk People's
Republic, with the backing of
Russia, have

23:00.913 --> 23:07.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fought the Ukrainian government
to gain autonomy.
The West, including the U.S., is
backing Ukraine's

23:07.486 --> 23:10.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government; 10,000 people have
died.

23:10.389 --> 23:15.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With the help of the Pulitzer
Center on Crisis
Reporting, special correspondent
Nick Schifrin

23:15.294 --> 23:20.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and producer Zach Fannin
traveled to Donetsk,
and discovered that what is
supposed to be

23:20.099 --> 23:23.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a cease-fire is anything but.

23:23.469 --> 23:32.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: On the front line
in Eastern
Ukraine, the war is fought in
trenches.

23:32.244 --> 23:36.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the end of each trench, small
outposts
are manned by men who call
themselves rebels.

23:36.248 --> 23:39.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They fight to separate from
Ukraine and join
Russia.

23:39.184 --> 23:42.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
IVAN, Ukraine (through
translator): It's intense
all the time, all the time.

23:42.921 --> 23:46.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Ivan, who
declined to give
his last name, grew up in a
nearby village.

23:46.558 --> 23:51.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their enemies, fellow Ukrainians
fighting
to stay united, are only 1,000
feet away.

23:51.463 --> 23:54.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IVAN (through translator): I can
see their
positions over there.

23:54.800 --> 24:08.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: There's supposed
to be a cease-fire.
But the fighting starts every
night. On average,

24:08.247 --> 24:14.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
one fighter for the
self-declared Donetsk
People's Republic dies every
day.

24:14.953 --> 24:19.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This war is like going back 100
years. This
is a trench war, and you can
hear some of

24:20.025 --> 24:24.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the explosions in the distance,
and not very
far away from us. These guys
have been fighting

24:24.630 --> 24:30.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here since January, and they say
that the
front line hasn't moved at all.

24:30.369 --> 24:32.137 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What motivates you to be here?

24:32.171 --> 24:35.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IVAN (through translator): My
home is five
kilometers from here. How could
I not fight

24:35.808 --> 24:37.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
if the war is so close?

24:37.076 --> 24:40.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW, Ukraine: I decided to be
useful here
at least.

24:40.212 --> 24:44.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Andrew, who also
refused to
give his last name, is former
Soviet special

24:44.583 --> 24:47.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forces. He says he came here to
train a ragtag
army.

24:47.853 --> 24:49.755 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Were you sent here by Russia?

24:49.788 --> 24:56.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW: No. No. I'm a volunteer,
so nobody
-- nobody pay me something. I
don't see professionally

24:56.929 --> 25:02.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ready people. So, I see taxis. I
see drivers.

25:02.735 --> 25:05.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Come, guys. Let's go.

25:05.270 --> 25:09.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Their base used
to be a local
school. They resist Ukraine's
alliance with

25:09.942 --> 25:14.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Europe. They align with Russia.
And as the
war persists, their desire to
separate grows.

25:14.947 --> 25:19.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Once
an army targets
its own people, they become the
enemy.

25:19.685 --> 25:22.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANDREW: How we can be in one
state now?

25:22.354 --> 25:24.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: So you have to
separate now?

25:24.990 --> 25:27.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANDREW: Sure. They have to
separate.

25:27.860 --> 25:34.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The front is
280-miles-long.
To get to the village of
Spartak, we needed

25:34.233 --> 25:37.536 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an armed escort.

25:37.569 --> 25:41.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On this front line, Anya, who
also declined
to give her last name, leads
what she calls

25:41.607 --> 25:46.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
an infantry brigade. The
professional Russian
soldiers here whom U.S.
officials say number

25:46.445 --> 25:48.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the thousands are invisible.

25:48.847 --> 25:52.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, as we walk down this road,
what is the
risk here?

25:52.718 --> 25:56.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANYA, Ukraine (through
translator): Total
risk. We're now walking in their
snipers'

25:56.655 --> 26:00.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
scopes. Here, everything is
within their snipers'
reach.

26:00.259 --> 26:06.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: This is incoming.

26:06.865 --> 26:11.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We had been here just a few
minutes when we
heard the incoming bullets above
our head,

26:11.270 --> 26:15.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so we have taken cover. We're
staying low
right now, and we're beginning
to hear rebel

26:15.507 --> 26:18.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
soldiers beginning to fire back.

26:18.210 --> 26:19.578 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(GUNFIRE)

26:19.611 --> 26:31.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I will
take him
out quickly.

MAN (through translator): Are
you kidding?

26:38.063 --> 26:39.264 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(GUNFIRE)

26:39.298 --> 26:42.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANYA (through translator): Let's
go! Let's
go! Stay down.

26:42.968 --> 26:47.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Like many of
these fighters,
Anya's not a trained soldier.
She was a successful

26:47.639 --> 26:52.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chain store owner. But she's
become a true
believer in a pro-Russian and
anti-European

26:52.377 --> 26:54.179 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
future.

26:54.213 --> 26:58.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANYA (through translator): The
entire Ukraine
is fighting with us following
NATO orders.

26:58.083 --> 27:02.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are nothing on their own.
You are writing
that I'm a blonde separatist who
will come

27:02.187 --> 27:05.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and start killing your children.
Yes, I will
do just that.

27:05.324 --> 27:08.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Are you willing
to die for
this cause?

27:08.227 --> 27:11.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANYA (through translator): Yes,
of course,
I'm ready to die for my home. I
will not let

27:11.463 --> 27:15.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a single fascist into my home. I
will fight
them as long as my heart beats.

27:15.534 --> 27:20.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: When she and the
city use fascist,
it's inspired by the Soviet
Union's role in

27:20.706 --> 27:25.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the war against fascist Nazi
Germany. In May,
a downtown parade celebrated the
Soviet Union's

27:25.911 --> 27:27.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
World War II victory.

27:27.746 --> 27:34.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the children of World War
II veterans
say this war is against the same
enemy. Training

27:34.186 --> 27:42.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for that war starts young.
Teenage girls spend
Saturday afternoons with Russian
Kalashnikovs.

27:42.261 --> 27:46.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The average Russian soldier
needs more than
10 seconds to do this;
15-year-old Katerina

27:46.632 --> 27:48.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
needs nine seconds.

27:48.433 --> 27:53.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATERINA, Ukraine (through
translator): Since
I was little, I preferred
playing football

27:53.038 --> 27:54.840 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with boys to playing with dolls.

27:54.873 --> 28:01.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Next up, Soviet
hazmat suits.
Their teacher, Sergey Fomchenko,
is a former

28:01.046 --> 28:03.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Soviet soldier and police
officer.

28:03.048 --> 28:05.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SERGEY FOMCHENKO, Former Soviet
Soldier (through
translator): Why, when we look
toward Russia,

28:05.484 --> 28:10.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do they call it a crime? In
general, the whole
of Eastern Ukraine aligns with
Russia. I would

28:10.722 --> 28:12.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like us to be part of Russia.

28:12.591 --> 28:18.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Upstairs, he
shows me where
a rocket struck this school.
Ukraine and Russia

28:18.330 --> 28:23.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have agreed Donetsk should
eventually reintegrate
into Ukraine. But everyone we
spoke to rejected

28:23.569 --> 28:24.503 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

28:24.536 --> 28:27.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Would you ever be able to go
back to Ukraine?

28:27.306 --> 28:31.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SERGEY FOMCHENKO (through
translator): A lot
of blood was spilled. Many
people died. Graduates

28:31.777 --> 28:36.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this school and other schools
are now in
the army. For what? To go back
to Ukraine?

28:36.481 --> 28:37.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think it won't happen.

28:37.983 --> 28:48.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: So the training
continues.
They know their AKs by heart.

28:48.026 --> 28:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: So the training
continues.
They know their AKs by heart.

28:54.633 --> 28:59.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When they're not training,
they're proselytizing.
The Donetsk military is short on
recruits.

28:59.705 --> 29:05.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the girls hand out recruiting
flyers to
fighting-age males, anyone
between 18 and

29:05.043 --> 29:10.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
55. Katerina also rejects
returning to Ukraine,
because of what this war has
forced her to

29:10.849 --> 29:12.618 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
see.

29:12.651 --> 29:14.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATERINA (through translator):
There was a
shell in my apartment block.
Everything was

29:14.419 --> 29:18.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
blown up. When someone you know
gets injured
or killed, it's very hard to
keep going.

29:18.857 --> 29:23.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: That
unwillingness to reunite
means Donetsk, with the help of
Russia, is

29:23.295 --> 29:26.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
becoming more and more
autonomous.

29:26.264 --> 29:32.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Downtown, city workers whose
salaries are
paid by Russia look after public
gardens.

29:32.838 --> 29:38.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In supermarkets, the shelves are
stocked with
Russian products. The only
currency accepted

29:38.410 --> 29:44.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is Russian rubles. Residents try
and lead
normal lives. In the main
square, with the

29:44.116 --> 29:48.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Vladimir Lenin statue, families
rent toy cars
by the hour.

29:48.720 --> 29:58.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the opera house built under
Stalin, a matinee
showing of Giuseppe Verdi's
"Masked Ball,"

29:58.630 --> 30:06.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the audience was about
two-thirds full at
$3 a ticket. And across the
street, at the

30:06.204 --> 30:11.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chicago nightclub, an Italian
band invited
by the local government delivers
distraction

30:11.276 --> 30:21.086 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and ideology.

30:21.119 --> 30:25.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this city is an orphan. The
Donetsk People's
Republic was birthed with the
help of Russian

30:26.024 --> 30:30.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
soldiers. Today, it's not
claimed by Russia,
and it's isolated from Ukraine.
There are

30:30.328 --> 30:33.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
no working banks, and no way to
pick up pensions.

30:33.265 --> 30:40.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The best salary in town is a
soldier's, $225
per month. Vadim Bazey and
Alexandr Goryakin

30:40.305 --> 30:41.973 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are both 17.

30:42.007 --> 30:45.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VADIM BAZEY, Ukraine (through
translator):
Right now, there's no prospects
here.

30:45.177 --> 30:48.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXANDR GORYAKIN, Ukraine
(through translator):
The best option in terms of
opportunities

30:48.447 --> 30:51.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is to go abroad, for example, to
America or
England.

30:51.950 --> 30:55.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But that's
impossible, because
they're physically stuck.

30:56.021 --> 31:02.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They can't get Ukrainian
passports. And their
Donetsk I.D.s allow access only
to Russia.

31:02.794 --> 31:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For those without the means to
leave the front
lines, life is even more
difficult.

31:07.866 --> 31:12.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Valentina Nikolayevna sleeps in
her cellar
because she's scared of
shelling. She hasn't

31:12.971 --> 31:16.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had running water or electricity
in two years.

31:16.308 --> 31:18.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Has it been worth it?

31:18.276 --> 31:21.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALENTINA NIKOLAYEVNA, Ukraine
(through translator):
During the second World War, it
took us, the

31:21.580 --> 31:27.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Soviet Union, four years to
cross half of
Europe. Here, it's been two
years and we're

31:27.252 --> 31:28.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the same spot.

31:28.653 --> 31:32.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Can you just
describe how difficult
life has gotten?

31:32.190 --> 31:34.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALENTINA NIKOLAYEVNA (through
translator):
I would have never believed it
if two years

31:34.826 --> 31:43.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ago you would have told me I was
going to
live in a basement. Very hard.

31:43.835 --> 31:50.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Nearby, this is
all that's
left of the Donetsk Airport. It
was built

31:50.375 --> 31:56.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only four years ago. Down the
street, this
neighborhood is full of homes
partially or

31:56.181 --> 31:59.985 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
completely damaged.

32:00.018 --> 32:04.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this is where we found
Zakharova Vladimirovna
and her 3-year-old grandson,
Peter. They have

32:04.923 --> 32:13.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spent nearly the entire war on
these streets.
They invited me in their home.
Her husband,

32:13.799 --> 32:18.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Zakharoff Pavlovich, grew up in
this house.
A Ukrainian rocket landed in
their backyard.

32:18.303 --> 32:21.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZAKHAROFF PAVLOVICH, Ukraine
(through translator):
There were so many rockets. We
just heard

32:21.840 --> 32:23.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the noise of one above us.

32:23.875 --> 32:29.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: This collection
of bricks used
to be their bomb shelter. They
stay because

32:29.614 --> 32:33.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they fear looters. They both
agree they have
suffered, but don't necessarily
agree on the

32:33.952 --> 32:35.654 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
solution.

32:35.687 --> 32:38.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZAKHAROFF PAVLOVICH (through
translator):
Good people from around here
were killed.

32:38.523 --> 32:40.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were good guys. What did
they die for?

32:40.458 --> 32:44.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZAKHAROVA VLADIMIROVNA, Ukraine
(through translator):
We have always known this part
of Ukraine

32:44.129 --> 32:48.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was very different from the
rest. But we didn't
know that they hated us so much.
We want to

32:49.000 --> 32:50.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have autonomy here.

32:50.936 --> 32:55.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: That desire to
separate means
they will keep fighting. But
they can't overpower

32:55.407 --> 33:01.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their enemy. So the front lines
will remain
frozen in place, with little
chance of a thaw.

33:01.880 --> 33:05.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Nick
Schifrin
in Donetsk.

33:05.550 --> 33:11.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tune in tomorrow,
as Nick Schifrin
continues his reporting from the
other side,

33:11.289 --> 33:17.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as Ukraine fights not only the
war in its
east, but deep corruption from
within.

33:17.262 --> 33:22.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now the latest on the Freddie
Gray case and
the trials surrounding his
death.

33:22.367 --> 33:27.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Six officers were charged after
Gray broke
his neck and died while in a
police van in

33:27.572 --> 33:34.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Baltimore April 2015. His death
led to riots
and civil unrest. But
prosecutors have not

33:34.379 --> 33:39.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
secured any convictions in those
trials or
in the trials of those officers
yet.

33:39.818 --> 33:41.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our look.

33:41.586 --> 33:46.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: The first
prosecution of an
officer ended in a hung jury.
The two that

33:46.224 --> 33:50.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
followed, both heard and decided
by a judge,
resulted in acquittals.

33:50.328 --> 33:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now Lieutenant Brian Rice has
elected to have
Judge Barry Williams decide his
fate, rather

33:55.133 --> 34:00.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than a jury, in a trial that
begins this week.
In the meantime, state's
attorney Marilyn

34:00.171 --> 34:04.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mosby and prosecutors face wide
and critical
scrutiny.

34:04.175 --> 34:09.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We look at these cases and
beyond with Debbie
Hines, a former Baltimore
prosecutor and now

34:09.114 --> 34:13.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a practicing trial attorney, and
Lawrence
Brown, a professor of public
health at Morgan

34:13.685 --> 34:18.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State University. He wrote a
recent op-ed
in The New York Times titled
"More Injustice

34:18.690 --> 34:20.058 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Baltimore."

34:20.091 --> 34:20.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to both of you.

34:20.959 --> 34:22.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want to start with you, Debbie
Hines.

34:22.294 --> 34:25.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why has it been so hard for
prosecutors to
get a conviction?

34:25.664 --> 34:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBBIE HINES, Former Baltimore
Prosecutor:
Well, you know, despite what
everybody thinks,

34:28.500 --> 34:30.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these cases have always been an
uphill battle.

34:30.602 --> 34:33.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have not been the slam dunk
that the
public may think.

34:33.939 --> 34:35.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: From the start,
you mean?

34:35.106 --> 34:36.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEBBIE HINES: From the start,
from the very
start.

34:36.942 --> 34:40.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are circumstantial murder
cases. I have
tried circumstantial murder
cases. They are

34:40.912 --> 34:46.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
extremely difficult, because
what we mean
when we say circumstantial is,
there's no

34:46.051 --> 34:50.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
witness. There's no eyewitness.
The only people
that really know what happened
is the victim,

34:50.989 --> 34:53.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who is deceased, and the police
officers that
are tried.

34:53.491 --> 35:00.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I try to compare the case not
to just this
case, but to the other infamous
case of Casey

35:00.665 --> 35:05.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anthony, where everyone thought
in America
that she had killed her
2-year-old toddler,

35:05.437 --> 35:09.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but that was a circumstantial
case, and it's
really hard to pull them
together.

35:09.474 --> 35:14.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Lawrence Brown,
do you buy
that as a reason for the no
convictions in

35:14.212 --> 35:16.881 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
this case, or do you see
something more going
on?

35:16.915 --> 35:19.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAWRENCE BROWN, Professor of
Public Health,
Morgan State University: Well, I
think that's

35:19.217 --> 35:24.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
certainly a part of it, but
what's really
also a factor is, I don't
believe that the

35:24.189 --> 35:30.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prosecution has ever shown
exactly when the
murder of Freddie Gray had taken
place.

35:30.362 --> 35:36.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think they have shown
the exact time
of the jury, who caused it? What
was -- what

35:36.368 --> 35:41.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is it that caused his vertebrae
to crack in
three separate places and his
voice box to

35:41.506 --> 35:46.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be crushed? So, without showing
that, all
the officers can say, well, I
wasn't involved

35:46.144 --> 35:50.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this part, I wasn't involved
in that part,
and no one is held accountable.

35:50.215 --> 35:55.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, staying with
you, do you
see then -- you are saying it's
a weak prosecution

35:55.854 --> 36:01.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strategy? Do you think that
state attorney
Marilyn Mosby oversold or
overpromised what

36:01.926 --> 36:03.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
she had in terms of the
evidence?

36:03.828 --> 36:11.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAWRENCE BROWN: Well, I mean,
when she went
out on May the 1st, 2015, to
reassure Baltimore

36:11.269 --> 36:15.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and to really sort of let people
know that
she was going to seek justice
for Freddie

36:15.306 --> 36:20.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gray, that had a really powerful
effect, because
it wasn't just what she said. It
was the way

36:20.979 --> 36:22.714 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
she said it.

36:22.747 --> 36:26.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So to see now the way that the
efforts are
going, it's a real
disappointment, I think,

36:26.451 --> 36:31.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to many. It's not just the
police brutality
that I think a lot of people are
looking at.

36:31.089 --> 36:37.395 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's also a way that the
prosecution and seemingly
the entire criminal justice
system is failing

36:37.429 --> 36:42.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
people who live in those
disinvested Red Line
black communities who are more
exposed to

36:42.700 --> 36:44.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
police brutality.

36:44.502 --> 36:47.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Debbie Hines, of
course, from
the beginning, this case and
others have also

36:47.272 --> 36:53.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
raised the questions of more
systemic issues
involving the police and young
black men in

36:53.344 --> 36:55.080 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
particular.

36:55.113 --> 36:59.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you see -- for example, some
people have
thought that the judge might be
giving the

36:59.517 --> 37:02.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
extra benefit of the doubt to
the police?

37:02.220 --> 37:07.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBBIE HINES: I think the judge
-- and I have
all respect for Judge Williams,
but I think

37:07.992 --> 37:11.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that he doesn't like the
prosecution's case.

37:11.329 --> 37:16.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What he is saying, though, is
not that they
have a weak case. He is saying
as to going

37:16.401 --> 37:22.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to what Lawrence said, that he
understands
what the prosecution is saying
as to how Freddie

37:22.307 --> 37:27.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gray died at what was this
fourth stop of
the van, where he was injured at
that moment

37:27.245 --> 37:29.147 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in time.

37:29.180 --> 37:35.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he also sees the defense's
position, which
is that it was a freak accident,
it just happened,

37:35.887 --> 37:41.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was nothing criminal. And in
a criminal
case where a judge says, I see
what the prosecution

37:41.259 --> 37:46.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is saying, I see what the
defense is saying,
you can't have those things
equal, because

37:46.364 --> 37:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then the state doesn't meet its
burden of
proof.

37:48.266 --> 37:53.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, Lawrence
Brown, you're
in Baltimore. What is the mood
there? Is there

37:53.805 --> 37:58.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a gathering sense that there
just may not
be any convictions in this case
that got so

37:58.543 --> 38:01.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much attention and roused the
community so
much?

38:01.913 --> 38:08.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAWRENCE BROWN: Well, I think
there is the
sense that people are really
disappointed

38:08.486 --> 38:13.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at this point in the efforts of
the prosecution
team.

38:13.691 --> 38:18.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, the passion with which
she came out
with -- Marilyn Mosby -- on May
the 1st, which

38:18.897 --> 38:25.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was only four days after the
uprising itself
on April the 27th, which was the
day that

38:25.303 --> 38:32.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Freddie Gray was being laid to
rest, you know,
it really did set up a situation
where we

38:32.544 --> 38:36.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thought it was a moment of
catharsis, it was
a moment of jubilation.

38:36.247 --> 38:41.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now that sort of sense of
catharsis and
jubilation is rapidly fading
away with the

38:41.719 --> 38:47.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hung jury, two not-guilty
verdicts, and what
looks like a possibility that
none of the

38:47.625 --> 38:49.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
officers will be held
accountable.

38:49.561 --> 38:55.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's something
that's very frustrating
for many residents here in the
city. And I

38:55.600 --> 39:00.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feel that we're really a city on
edge right
now, and I don't know that we're
really doing

39:00.939 --> 39:02.740 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
anything to really address that.

39:02.774 --> 39:06.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Debbie Hines,
there's also
been -- if you look at this case
and others

39:06.077 --> 39:11.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even beyond Freddie Gray, some
have said that
just by bringing them to trial,
right, it

39:11.950 --> 39:18.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
raises enough public scrutiny to
make -- perhaps
bring some changes, certainly in
police processes.

39:18.823 --> 39:20.625 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Do you see that?

39:20.658 --> 39:23.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBBIE HINES: I definitely see
that. And I
have always said that I think
the cases should

39:23.328 --> 39:25.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
always have been brought.

39:25.129 --> 39:29.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there was always enough
there in terms
of probable cause to bring the
cases. And

39:29.867 --> 39:33.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even Judge Williams, although
there may have
been the acquittals and the hung
jury, he

39:33.705 --> 39:38.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't dismiss the case. Even
today, that
is what Lieutenant Rice wanted,
was a dismissal

39:38.176 --> 39:41.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the charges, and he didn't
dismiss the
charges.

39:41.446 --> 39:46.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But out of the cases, I see a
greater thing
happening. And what I mean by
that is, the

39:46.584 --> 39:51.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
police department in Baltimore
has already
instituted changes as a result
of this case.

39:51.689 --> 39:55.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're going to require body
cameras. They're
going to require that the police
officers

39:55.693 --> 40:00.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
must sign off when they get the
general orders.
They can't say, oh, I wasn't at
work that

40:00.164 --> 40:02.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
day, I didn't have the general
order.

40:02.400 --> 40:06.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the most important thing in
terms of with
respect to the Freddie Gray
case, the chief

40:06.738 --> 40:11.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of police is saying that if
someone like Freddie
Gray or any other prisoner in
Baltimore city

40:11.209 --> 40:16.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
requests a medic, the Baltimore
police must
take the prisoner to a hospital.

40:16.080 --> 40:18.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This is happening
whether there
are convictions or not?

40:18.616 --> 40:19.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DEBBIE HINES: Exactly.

40:19.284 --> 40:20.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK.

40:20.518 --> 40:22.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Debbie Hines and Lawrence Brown,
thank you
both very much.

40:22.120 --> 40:23.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DEBBIE HINES: Thank you.

40:23.921 --> 40:29.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAWRENCE BROWN: Thank you.

40:29.694 --> 40:37.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next: How much
emphasis should
we put on reading and other
subjects in the

40:37.935 --> 40:40.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
earliest years of school and
preschool?

40:40.905 --> 40:45.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Some say that crucial
development through
playtime is getting lost in the
shuffle for

40:45.610 --> 40:47.578 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the very youngest students.

40:47.612 --> 40:52.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Cat Wise
has this story
for our weekly series on
education, Making

40:52.850 --> 40:53.685 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

CHILD: Let's go, Liam. Let's go,
Karen.

40:55.953 --> 41:01.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: At ages 3, 4, and 5,
most children
want to play pretend.

41:01.492 --> 41:03.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHILD: This is our babies.

41:03.227 --> 41:05.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: But in today's world
of high-stakes
academic testing, some preschool
teachers

41:05.997 --> 41:09.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
feel pressure to put away the
baby dolls and
pick up the school books.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERALYN BYWATER MCLAUGHLIN,
Mission Hill:
I have been teaching for 25
years, and I have

41:11.969 --> 41:13.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
seen a big change.

41:13.638 --> 41:16.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So you're pretending to be the
sister? And
you're pretending to go on a
walk?

41:16.908 --> 41:21.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Geralyn Bywater

prekindergarten at Mission Hill,
a public

41:21.079 --> 41:22.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
school in Boston.

41:22.680 --> 41:24.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHILD: I'm the momma.

41:24.148 --> 41:25.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GERALYN BYWATER MCLAUGHLIN: So
you're the
momma?

41:26.017 --> 41:28.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: She and other
educators have started
a campaign they call Defending
the Early Years.

41:28.586 --> 41:33.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERALYN BYWATER MCLAUGHLIN: The
goal of Defending
the Early Years is to really
help rally early

41:33.424 --> 41:40.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
childhood educators to push back
against this
push-down of academics into the
early years.

41:40.064 --> 41:44.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The standardized tests, the
disappearance
of play, teachers are feeling
it, and we're

41:44.902 --> 41:48.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
helping to bring voice to their
frustrations
and their concerns.

41:48.840 --> 41:50.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHILD: This is my baby.

41:50.808 --> 41:55.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Bywater McLaughlin
says education
policies that tie government
funding to academic

41:55.546 --> 42:00.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
performance like No Child Left
Behind and
Race to the Top have put
pressure on preschool

42:00.284 --> 42:04.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and kindergarten teachers to
prepare students
to compete in higher grades.

42:04.155 --> 42:06.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY CARLSSON-PAIGE, Lesley
University: The
teachers feel like they're over
a barrel.

42:06.758 --> 42:10.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have got to drill the kids
on these things
to get the scores so the program
doesn't lose

42:10.628 --> 42:12.397 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
funds.

42:12.430 --> 42:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Nancy Carlsson-Paige
is a professor
emerita at Lesley University and

"Taking Back Childhood."

42:17.769 --> 42:21.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY CARLSSON-PAIGE: There's
been a snowball
that's been rolling for 15 or 16
years. It's

42:21.873 --> 42:28.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
propelled by a belief that you
will improve
education and close the
achievement gap if

42:28.179 --> 42:30.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you have accountability, if you
have more
testing.

42:30.615 --> 42:35.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Carlsson-Paige points
to new expectations
for children to read in
kindergarten.

42:35.920 --> 42:40.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's the harm in getting a
kindergartner
to learn to read? I mean, is
there a harm?

42:40.691 --> 42:45.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY CARLSSON-PAIGE: There is
an absolute
harm. It's harmful because
you're forcing

42:45.129 --> 42:50.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children to learn things that
are out of step
with where they are
developmentally. And you're

42:50.868 --> 42:54.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doing it in a way that it
contradicts how
they learn.

42:54.739 --> 42:59.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Advocates of Defending
the Early
Years say young children do best
in schools

42:59.911 --> 43:04.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that emphasize play and
project-based learning,
like Mission Hill Elementary, a
pilot school.

43:04.816 --> 43:06.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JADA BROWN, Mission Hill: So,
the cabinet
is for what?

43:06.717 --> 43:10.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Here, desks are
replaced by project
areas, where kindergarten
teacher Jada Brown

43:10.288 --> 43:13.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says young students can pursue
interests at
their own pace.

43:13.324 --> 43:19.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JADA BROWN: Our school is really
focused on
trying to make sure that kids
are engaged

43:19.497 --> 43:23.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in activities that they are
choosing, that
they're interested in, and that
it's not the

43:23.901 --> 43:26.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
adults who are pushing
particular things on
them.

43:26.537 --> 43:27.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHILD: We could use this for
measurements.

43:27.772 --> 43:29.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JADA BROWN: We could use that
for measurements.

43:29.574 --> 43:33.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: On this day,
kindergartners built
cabinets for a pretend kitchen,
and learned

43:33.244 --> 43:35.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
some math while doing it.

43:35.213 --> 43:40.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHILD: We're putting a math
thing over there,
because Josie is trying to help
me with my

43:40.751 --> 43:41.419 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
math.

43:41.452 --> 43:43.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JADA BROWN: What kind of math?

43:43.187 --> 43:46.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's so much math that
actually happens
in building. How do you build a
structure?

43:46.891 --> 43:53.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you make sure that it's
standing? It's
all math. It's science. It's
trying to figure

43:53.231 --> 43:55.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out, how do you make something
that's stable.

43:55.500 --> 43:59.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY CARLSSON-PAIGE: The fact
of the matter
is, play and learning are the
same thing with

43:59.337 --> 44:00.238 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
young children.

44:00.271 --> 44:02.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHILD: Josie, I need a few
sticks for this.

44:02.640 --> 44:08.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: How do you respond to
those that
say, but kids are coming to
school to learn,

44:08.779 --> 44:13.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they should be writing their
ABCs, and they
can play at home?

44:13.217 --> 44:18.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JADA BROWN: The home looks very
different
from school. There is a lot
that's going on

44:18.422 --> 44:24.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in that classroom, whether it's
art or math.
The materials that are in the
classroom are

44:24.428 --> 44:26.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot different from what you
might see at
home.

44:26.764 --> 44:30.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Ayla Gavins is the
principal of
Mission Hill.

44:30.067 --> 44:33.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AYLA GAVINS, Principal, Mission
Hill: For
us, the skills are not taught in
isolation,

44:33.971 --> 44:39.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but they're taught embedded in
some sort of
meaningful work or exercise. I
believe they

44:39.844 --> 44:41.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
learn more because they're
motivated.

44:41.078 --> 44:42.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BILLYE TOUSSAINT, Parent: What
do you think,
Ayan (ph)?

44:42.747 --> 44:45.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: Parent Billye
Toussaint's daughter
attends preschool at Mission
Hill.

44:45.983 --> 44:49.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILLYE TOUSSAINT: One of the
things I really,
really wanted my own children to
have is this

44:49.820 --> 44:55.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ability to not always need an
adult, like,
pushing, pushing, pushing, and
able to really

44:55.726 --> 44:57.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
take control of their own
learning.

44:57.328 --> 44:59.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: You go straight to your
independent work.

44:59.664 --> 45:03.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Kindergarten looks and
feels a lot
different at Harlem Prep, a
high-performing

45:03.734 --> 45:09.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
charter school in New York City.
The focus
is on school work over play.

45:09.240 --> 45:11.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT PONDISCIO, Fordham
Institute: What
is the argument that is being
made here?

45:11.542 --> 45:15.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Robert Pondiscio, a
fellow at the
Fordham Institute, who also
teaches civics

45:15.746 --> 45:20.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at Harlem Prep's high school,
says play-based
learning does benefit some
children, but may

45:20.384 --> 45:23.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not the best way to serve
low-income students.

45:23.654 --> 45:27.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT PONDISCIO: If you are a
low-income
kid, you don't have the
enrichment opportunities

45:27.658 --> 45:33.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that more fortunate kids get.
And that really
means that you show up for
school on day one

45:33.431 --> 45:38.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
further behind. So if schools
are not aggressively
attacking that problem from day
one, those

45:38.836 --> 45:41.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kids will not only not catch up;
they will
fall further behind.

45:41.639 --> 45:46.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Pondiscio believes
high expectations,
like reading in kindergarten,
have helped

45:46.444 --> 45:48.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Harlem Prep students excel.

45:48.346 --> 45:52.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT PONDISCIO: Nobody, but
nobody is going
to sensibly argue that young
children shouldn't

45:52.883 --> 45:58.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spend a lot of time in pre-K and
kindergarten
playing. I'm not suggesting that
we should

45:58.556 --> 46:04.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be turning anybody's pre-K or
kindergarten
into an academic hothouse. But I
worry that

46:04.428 --> 46:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it could become easily an
intellectual death
sentence for low-income
children.

46:08.799 --> 46:13.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Students like ours are simply
not going to
get that rich vocabulary, that
rich background

46:13.037 --> 46:18.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
knowledge, that linguistic
proficiency that
other kids bring to school from
home.

46:18.242 --> 46:24.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Harlem Prep takes
pride in preparing
children for college at a young
age; 93 percent

46:24.615 --> 46:29.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the students in the Democracy
Prep Network
go on to college, including some
of the country's

46:29.353 --> 46:31.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
most elite schools.

46:31.355 --> 46:37.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For her part, Nancy
Carlsson-Paige says the
best preparation for college
start with age-appropriate

46:37.628 --> 46:39.296 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
teaching.

46:39.330 --> 46:41.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY CARLSSON-PAIGE: The faulty
thinking
is, we will prepare kids to be
college- and

46:41.932 --> 46:47.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
career-ready by drilling them on
letters and
numbers when they're really
little, and that

46:47.038 --> 46:54.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will get them ready for success
in school.
But the truth is the complete
opposite.

46:54.679 --> 47:04.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Both experts agree the
final destination
should be college. The issue is
how to start

47:04.822 --> 47:06.757 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the very young on that path.

47:06.791 --> 47:16.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Cat
Wise.

47:16.600 --> 47:24.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight:
wizards young
and old. Harry Potter is back.

47:24.508 --> 47:29.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so is Jeffrey Brown, with a
look at the
latest version of Potter-mania
from his recent

47:29.513 --> 47:31.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
trip to the United Kingdom.

47:31.348 --> 47:36.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: At Platform 9 3/4
in London's
King Cross Station, it's time
again for fans

47:36.987 --> 47:51.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to take the leap into the
magical world of
Harry Potter, the young wizard
of eight films,

47:51.802 --> 47:56.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, of course, the books that
have sold in
the hundreds of millions.

47:56.273 --> 48:01.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now Harry is back, quite a bit
older and with
children of his own, played by
actor Jamie

48:01.612 --> 48:07.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parker, and for the first time
on stage, in
the new play told in two parts,
"Harry Potter

48:07.585 --> 48:11.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the Cursed Child," now at
the Palace Theatre
in London's West End.

48:11.422 --> 48:16.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
J.K. ROWLING, "Harry Potter"
Author: You have
been amazing for years at
keeping Harry Potter

48:16.093 --> 48:18.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
secrets, so you didn't spoil the
books for
readers who came after you.

48:19.029 --> 48:23.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's still in
previews and
all very hush-hush, so, no, we
can't show

48:23.634 --> 48:29.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you scenes. Potter author J.K.
Rowling, who
worked on this with an
experienced theater

48:29.173 --> 48:32.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
team, is begging fans not to
spoil the plot.

48:32.076 --> 48:38.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
J.K. ROWLING: So I'm asking you
one more time
to keep secrets and let
audiences enjoyed

48:38.382 --> 48:41.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Cursed Child" with all the
surprises that
we have built into the story.

48:41.252 --> 48:46.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Time Out London
staff writer
Kate Lloyd got a look, but
wasn't giving much

48:46.524 --> 48:48.292 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
away.

48:48.325 --> 48:50.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATE LLOYD, Time Out London: It
felt like
going to the greatest hit show
of your favorite

48:50.127 --> 48:54.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pop star. It just felt like
everyone there
had read the books, loved them,
and now was

48:54.265 --> 48:59.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reliving the experience with a
bit of new
stuff, but it was very much
rooted in the

48:59.737 --> 49:01.605 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
old stories.

49:01.639 --> 49:05.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Just a block
away, we saw the
Harry Potter phenomenon in
action, at an exhibition

49:05.209 --> 49:12.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of graphic art and original film
props now
at the House of MinaLima
gallery.

49:12.416 --> 49:17.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Miraphora Mina and her partner
Eduardo Lima
helped create the Potter look
for the films.

49:17.822 --> 49:19.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Her theory of Potter's appeal?

49:19.657 --> 49:25.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIRAPHORA MINA, MinaLima Design:
So everything
you see story wise and prop
wise, you as an

49:25.496 --> 49:29.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
audience can think, oh, yes, I'm
going to
get my letter, or I'm going to
read that newspaper.

49:29.867 --> 49:34.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not a completely reinvented
world. It's
kind of the real world and
shifted about 20

49:34.505 --> 49:36.373 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
percent.

49:36.407 --> 49:40.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In many ways,
perhaps, it's
more a re-imagining than a
re-invention, something

49:40.311 --> 49:45.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we found some 400 hundred miles
to the north,
at the source of all things
Potter.

49:45.850 --> 49:50.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The story of Harry Potter itself
of course
comes with its own legends about
where it

49:50.321 --> 49:54.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was written, what it's all based
on. And a
lot of it began here in
Edinburgh, Scotland.

49:54.058 --> 49:55.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Eric, American student
wearing a cape.

49:55.659 --> 50:00.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC GEISTFELD, The Potter
Trail: Ah, it's
a dream job really.

50:00.865 --> 50:01.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Dream job.

50:01.532 --> 50:02.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ERIC GEISTFELD: Dream job.

50:02.132 --> 50:03.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Why?

50:03.968 --> 50:06.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC GEISTFELD: Read all the
books, seen all
the movies, played all the video
games, bought

50:06.270 --> 50:10.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all the toys since I was a
little kid.

50:10.207 --> 50:15.012 align:left position:25%,start line:66.67% size:75%
JEFFREY BROWN:
Twenty-two-year-old Eric
Geistfeld
of Eden Prairie, Minnesota, is
finishing his

50:15.045 --> 50:19.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
studies at the University of
Edinburgh, with
a degree in physics, real magic,
as he told

50:19.950 --> 50:24.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me. But he may be an even bigger
student of
J.K. Rowling and Harry Potter.

50:24.989 --> 50:31.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We followed as he led a group
along the city's
Potter Trail. It includes the
famed Greyfriars

50:31.295 --> 50:35.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kirkyard, the cemetery where
J.K. Rowling
gathered names for characters.

50:35.432 --> 50:37.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC GEISTFELD: Well, she
obviously got the
name from this grave because, in
the mid to

50:37.401 --> 50:41.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
late 1990s, there used to be a
bench that
rang along this wall in
Greyfriars Kirkyard,

50:41.939 --> 50:45.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and she would come here and do a
lot of the
brainstorming for her first
Harry Potter novel

50:45.743 --> 50:46.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
within these very walls.

50:47.011 --> 50:48.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And just beyond
that.

50:48.512 --> 50:50.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC GEISTFELD: Hogwarts, the
wizarding boarding
school.

50:50.748 --> 50:54.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: George Heriot's
School, the
inspiration for the mythical
Hogwarts School

50:55.019 --> 50:57.187 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

50:57.221 --> 51:01.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then there's the Elephant House
Cafe, where,
as all Potter-heads know,
Rowling, then a

51:02.026 --> 51:07.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
poor single mom, would sit for
hours with
one cup of coffee and write.
Standing over

51:07.731 --> 51:12.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Victoria Street, which Rowling
turned into
a kind of wizard mall in her
books, our guide

51:12.836 --> 51:16.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said the sense of place is a key
to understanding
the world of Harry Potter.

51:16.941 --> 51:20.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC GEISTFELD: J.K. Rowling
came here in
the mid to late 1990s and just
saw something

51:20.678 --> 51:24.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this street, sort of felt a
magic of her
own and decided to base an
entire location

51:24.548 --> 51:26.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
off of it in the books.

51:26.350 --> 51:30.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The history of Edinburgh has
really bled into
Harry Potter, its settings, its
characters,

51:30.187 --> 51:33.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and sort of a lot of the themes
of Harry Potter
as well.

51:33.557 --> 51:40.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Back in London,
where things
can look plenty Potter-esque as
well, Financial

51:40.130 --> 51:44.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Times journalist Jenny Lee told
me the spell
for her has always been in the
storytelling.

51:44.835 --> 51:48.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNY LEE, Financial Times: A
really epic
piece of storytelling, which is
incredibly

51:48.272 --> 51:51.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
compelling and unlike anything I
had ever
read before.

51:51.408 --> 51:55.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And as a
playwright herself,
she's interested to see how it
works in a

51:55.946 --> 51:57.715 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
new form.

51:57.748 --> 52:00.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JENNY LEE: There is an
excitement, not a hype,
but an excitement around the
fact that it

52:00.884 --> 52:04.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is theater, that people can come
to the theater,
and in the same way that she got
a new generation

52:05.022 --> 52:09.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of kids reading, that we may get
a new generation
of kids coming to theater for
the first time.

52:09.827 --> 52:12.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This could be a
way to bring
young people to the theater?

52:12.296 --> 52:15.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNY LEE: Absolutely, I think
so. I think
that this is not going to be
published as

52:15.632 --> 52:19.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a novel. It's going to be
published as a play
text. And if people can't make
it to the theater,

52:19.336 --> 52:23.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they might just have to buy the
play text
and read that. And that could be
a young person's

52:23.107 --> 52:26.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first encounter with that
medium, with the
play text itself. And that
excites me.

52:26.877 --> 52:30.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Of course, Eric
Geistfeld and
no doubt millions of others want
more than

52:30.814 --> 52:34.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the text, but the first batch of
tickets sold
out almost immediately.

52:34.718 --> 52:39.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC GEISTFELD: Accio tickets.
Oh. Accio is
a summoning spell, so whenever
you wave your

52:39.723 --> 52:41.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wand and you yell accio, it will
fly to you.
So...

52:42.026 --> 52:43.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Accio tickets?

52:43.293 --> 52:44.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ERIC GEISTFELD: Accio tickets.

52:44.561 --> 52:46.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But they haven't
come yet?

52:46.430 --> 52:48.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC GEISTFELD: They haven't
come yet. I assume
they're flying from London to
here, so it

52:48.832 --> 52:52.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
might take a little while, but I
hope they're
on their way.

52:52.136 --> 52:53.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Good luck.

52:53.604 --> 52:55.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ERIC GEISTFELD: Thank you.

52:55.372 --> 52:59.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: From Edinburgh
and London,
I'm Jeffrey Brown for the "PBS
NewsHour."

52:59.309 --> 53:11.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tune in later
tonight. Our
own Hari Sreenivasan sits in for
Charlie Rose

53:11.588 --> 53:16.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and discusses the changing ways
we get our
news with Vox Media's Melissa
Bell.

53:16.994 --> 53:22.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MELISSA BELL, Vox: We can get a
little distracted
by Facebook as the sole
conversation topic.

53:22.633 --> 53:27.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that there's more of a
theme here
with the overall Internet and
how we're presenting

53:27.271 --> 53:32.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
news to people in today's day
and age. It
is not -- it's one of many
access points where

53:32.309 --> 53:37.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we can meet people. It's an
opportunity, in
that there's a hungry audience
waiting for

53:37.981 --> 53:42.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us there, but we also need to
remember that
there's a lot of different
places for us to

53:42.453 --> 53:44.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reach audiences in this day and
age.

53:44.188 --> 53:46.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's tonight on
"Charlie
Rose."

53:46.423 --> 53:49.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

53:49.193 --> 53:57.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening. For all of us at the
"PBS NewsHour,"

53:57.234 --> 54:06.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.
