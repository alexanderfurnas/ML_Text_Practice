JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:06.106 --> 00:07.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.107 --> 00:08.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:08.809 --> 00:11.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
President Obama weighs in on the
presidential

00:11.879 --> 00:17.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign, as Donald Trump's feud
with the
Khan family has more Republicans
distancing

00:17.684 --> 00:20.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
themselves from their party
nominee.

00:20.120 --> 00:24.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead this
Tuesday: controlling
Zika in the United States.

00:24.658 --> 00:31.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The CDC issues an unprecedented
warning urging
pregnant women to stay away from
a Miami neighborhood

00:31.465 --> 00:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
where the virus is spreading.

00:33.233 --> 00:38.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And debating the
math myth
-- why one college professor
says advanced

00:38.805 --> 00:41.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
math classes are not only
unnecessary, but
harmful.

00:41.575 --> 00:45.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW HACKER, Professor
Emeritus, Queens
College: We immediately plunge
people into

00:45.178 --> 00:47.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
geometry and algebra.

00:47.814 --> 00:52.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as a result, Americans are
really quite
illiterate in terms of numbers.

00:52.953 --> 01:00.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:00.327 --> 01:02.996 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:03.030 --> 01:12.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A presidential
broadside today
aimed at Donald Trump.

01:12.606 --> 01:17.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama took on the man
who is running
to succeed him in his strongest
terms yet.

01:17.110 --> 01:20.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
I think the Republican nominee
is unfit to

01:20.948 --> 01:22.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
serve as president.

01:22.215 --> 01:27.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I said so last week, and he
keeps on proving
it.

01:27.220 --> 01:32.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The rebuke came
at a news conference
with the visiting prime minister
of Singapore.

01:32.326 --> 01:37.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president drew a sharp
distinction between
Donald Trump and the Republican
nominees he

01:37.698 --> 01:40.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had faced, John McCain and Mitt
Romney.

01:40.500 --> 01:45.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: I never thought
that they couldn't
do the job.

01:45.238 --> 01:53.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And had they won, I would have
been disappointed,
but I would have said to all
Americans, they

01:53.580 --> 02:00.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are -- this is our president and
I know they
are going to abide by certain
norms and rules

02:00.787 --> 02:05.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and common sense, will observe
basic decency.

02:05.692 --> 02:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All of this
followed Trump's
repeated criticisms of Khizr and
Ghazala Khan,

02:12.699 --> 02:17.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
parents of a U.S. army officer
who died in
Iraq.

02:17.070 --> 02:21.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican leaders condemned the
remarks,
but Mr. Obama said that's not
enough.

02:21.208 --> 02:28.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: This is daily and
weekly where
they are distancing themselves
from statements

02:28.782 --> 02:30.550 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he's making.

02:30.584 --> 02:35.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There has to be a point at which
you say,
this is not somebody I can
support for president

02:35.589 --> 02:37.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the United States.

02:37.391 --> 02:42.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One New York
Republican congressman,
Richard Hanna, did just that
today.

02:42.195 --> 02:47.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In a newspaper opinion
columnist, he wrote:
"Mr. Trump has attacked the
parents of a slain

02:47.667 --> 02:49.102 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
U.S. soldier.

02:49.136 --> 02:51.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where do we draw the line?

02:51.038 --> 02:56.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While I disagree with her on
many issues,
I will vote for Hillary
Clinton."

02:56.843 --> 03:01.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump was speaking in Northern
Virginia as
the president held his news
conference, and

03:01.948 --> 03:06.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he made no mention of the Obama
criticism
or the Khans.

03:06.353 --> 03:08.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it was in the air just the
same.

03:08.221 --> 03:15.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
A man came up to me and he
handed me his Purple

03:15.162 --> 03:16.863 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Heart.

03:16.897 --> 03:21.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Purple Heart,
given to
those wounded or killed in
action, came from

03:21.701 --> 03:23.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a retired lieutenant colonel.

03:23.203 --> 03:26.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I always wanted to
get the Purple
Heart.

03:26.573 --> 03:28.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This was much easier.

03:28.341 --> 03:33.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Later, Trump did
answer the
president in a statement,
charging he and

03:33.280 --> 03:39.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his former secretary of state
betrayed American
security and American workers.

03:39.186 --> 03:45.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Trump declared -- quote --
"Hillary Clinton
has proven herself unfit to
serve in any government

03:45.826 --> 03:47.227 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
office."

03:47.260 --> 03:51.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump supporters at the rally
appeared unfazed
by the latest blowup.

03:51.598 --> 03:53.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: The coverage is just
insane.

03:53.733 --> 03:56.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think they make a big deal
about that.

03:56.336 --> 03:59.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First of all, he was speaking
from his heart.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he wasn't accusing them or
saying anything.

04:01.541 --> 04:05.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Trump moves on to
campaign
in Florida tomorrow.

04:05.212 --> 04:08.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Clinton will be in Colorado.

04:08.615 --> 04:13.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also today, Donald Trump told
The Washington
Post he is not ready to endorse
Republican

04:13.353 --> 04:16.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
House Speaker Paul Ryan for
reelection.

04:16.123 --> 04:22.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also said he won't support
Republican Senators
John McCain and Kelly Ayotte for
new terms.

04:22.295 --> 04:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the day's other
news: The president
also made a renewed pitch for
the Trans-Pacific

04:27.434 --> 04:31.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Partnership, the trade deal he's
pushing in
the face of growing opposition.

04:31.705 --> 04:35.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both presidential candidates
oppose it, but
Mr. Obama warned against trying
to pull back

04:36.009 --> 04:38.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on trade, and away from
globalization.

04:38.245 --> 04:43.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: To try to pull up
a drawbridge
on trade would only hurt us and
hurt our workers.

04:43.683 --> 04:48.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the answer is to make sure
that globalization
and trade is working for us, not
against us.

04:48.622 --> 04:52.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And TPP is designed to do
precisely that.

04:52.325 --> 04:56.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The president also
played down
Russia's possible role in
hacking the Democratic

04:56.830 --> 04:58.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
National Committee's e-mails.

04:58.798 --> 05:02.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said it only adds to an
already long list
of differences.

05:02.435 --> 05:06.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There's more
fallout from those
Democratic Party e-mails that
showed staffers

05:06.873 --> 05:10.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
favoring Hillary Clinton and
disparaging Bernie
Sanders.

05:10.877 --> 05:16.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Associated Press reports the
DNC's chief
executive has resigned, and two
other staffers

05:16.349 --> 05:17.784 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
also quit today.

05:17.817 --> 05:22.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Party chair, Congresswoman
Debbie Wasserman
Schultz, resigned last week.

05:22.189 --> 05:28.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In Syria, rebels
accused government
forces of a new chemical weapons
attack today.

05:28.395 --> 05:34.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say a helicopter dropped
barrels of toxic
gas in Idlib province, near
where a Russian

05:34.301 --> 05:38.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
helicopter was shot down Monday;
33 people
were affected.

05:38.171 --> 05:43.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Video posted on social media
showed victims
being treated with oxygen, but
it's unclear

05:43.176 --> 05:45.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what kind of gas was used.

05:45.078 --> 05:49.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thousands of
mourners in Normandy,
France, attended a funeral mass
today for

05:49.683 --> 05:51.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a murdered Catholic priest.

05:51.551 --> 05:56.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Father Jacques Hamel had his
throat cut by
Islamic State militants last
week.

05:56.756 --> 06:03.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, an archbishop led a
solemn public ceremony
inside the Rouen Cathedral to
pay tribute

06:03.196 --> 06:04.164 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the cleric.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was later buried in a private
service.

06:06.299 --> 06:12.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The death toll has
climbed past
90 across India, after a week of
monsoon flooding.

06:12.672 --> 06:15.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A million other people have been
forced to
flee.

06:15.508 --> 06:20.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The flooding has caused heavy
damage across
three states in the northern and
eastern parts

06:20.180 --> 06:21.248 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the country.

06:21.281 --> 06:24.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It follows two straight years of
widespread
drought.

06:24.251 --> 06:28.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in the U.S.,
New York
City Police Commissioner Bill
Bratton is stepping

06:28.989 --> 06:30.757 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
down.

06:30.790 --> 06:35.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He led the nation's largest
force in the 1990s,
and returned to the position in
2014.

06:35.996 --> 06:41.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said today he's leaving at a
time of extreme
tensions between police and
minorities, but

06:41.835 --> 06:43.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said he's confident in the
department's future.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRATTON, New York City
Police Commissioner:
The mistrust of the criminal
justice system,

06:46.940 --> 06:50.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
particularly by our minority
communities,
the immigration issues that are
so paramount

06:50.910 --> 07:00.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
at the moment, the anger
directed at our Muslim
community, we, I believe, in New
York City

07:00.320 --> 07:03.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at this time are better prepared
than anyplace
else in America.

07:04.024 --> 07:09.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Bratton has been
hailed for
cutting crime, but criticized
over incidents

07:09.296 --> 07:11.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of alleged excessive force by
police.

07:11.965 --> 07:16.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
James O'Neill, currently the New
York City
department's top chief, will
take over as

07:16.636 --> 07:18.371 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
commissioner.

07:18.405 --> 07:22.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And Wall Street
slipped on lackluster
auto sales and falling oil
prices.

07:22.642 --> 07:26.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 90 points
to close at 18313.

07:26.713 --> 07:32.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 46 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
gave up 13.

07:32.085 --> 07:37.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
Florida's fight to contain the
Zika virus;

07:37.357 --> 07:43.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the back-story to Donald Trump's
latest comments
on Ukraine; an advocate for
teaching more

07:43.396 --> 07:49.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
practical mathematics; and much
more.

07:49.736 --> 08:02.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In Florida, workers
went door
to door today to check for
mosquitoes, and

08:02.382 --> 08:06.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to spray in neighborhoods, in
the hope of
clamping down on the Zika virus.

08:06.886 --> 08:12.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials say 15 people have
become infected
in Miami's Wynwood neighborhood,
and it's

08:12.425 --> 08:17.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
believed these are the first
mosquito-transmitted
cases in the mainland U.S.

08:17.630 --> 08:22.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The CDC says the mosquitoes are
proving harder
to eradicate than expected.

08:22.369 --> 08:27.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For an on-the-ground look, I'm
joined by Alina
Hudak, the deputy mayor of
Miami-Dade County.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you for joining us.

08:29.509 --> 08:35.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know now of 15 locally
transmitted case
of Zika infections.

08:35.682 --> 08:39.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How many more are likely, and
are you prepared
to handle an increase?

08:39.552 --> 08:42.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALINA HUDAK, Deputy Mayor,
Miami-Dade County,
Florida: Gwen, thank you for the
opportunity

08:42.922 --> 08:46.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to speak tonight to you and to
your viewers.

08:46.393 --> 08:50.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would like to clarify first
and foremost
that the confirmed cases in
Miami-Dade County

08:50.730 --> 08:53.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are 12.

08:53.767 --> 09:00.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to reiterate and really
just be very
clear about our mosquito control
program here

09:00.073 --> 09:01.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Miami-Dade County.

09:01.808 --> 09:06.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a very strong and
aggressive program
that we have had in place since
1935.

09:06.079 --> 09:12.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have many years of a proven
track record
in managing and controlling
disease.

09:12.218 --> 09:17.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We work together with our
Department of Health,
with the Department of
Agriculture.

09:17.323 --> 09:22.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have had consultations with
the CDC, and
they are working very closely
with us.

09:22.629 --> 09:28.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we feel very confident that
this can be
contained and it can be
contained to a very

09:28.501 --> 09:31.037 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
small area.

09:31.070 --> 09:35.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want the viewers to understand
that we're
talking about one square mile in
a community

09:35.909 --> 09:42.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is over 2,000 square miles,
and I think
that's important for context and
for people

09:42.248 --> 09:45.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to understand exactly the area
that we're
talking about.

09:45.251 --> 09:51.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Why is it confined
so far to this
one area, Wynwood, which
contains an art district

09:51.224 --> 09:54.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and attracts people from outside
of the neighborhood?

09:54.160 --> 09:55.628 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Why there?

09:55.662 --> 09:59.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ALINA HUDAK: You know, I
certainly would be
speculating relative to that.

09:59.799 --> 10:06.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a high international
presence there
and a lot of travel in that
community.

10:06.739 --> 10:12.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is unknown exactly how it is
that the transmission
takes place, and obviously there
is a lot

10:12.078 --> 10:16.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of focus on the mosquito, but
there are many
unknowns about this disease.

10:16.382 --> 10:22.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, quite frankly, we
have been
able to isolate at this point
these particular

10:22.555 --> 10:25.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cases, in consultation with the
Department
of Health.

10:25.325 --> 10:29.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our crews have been there every
single day,
and have been on the ground
since day one.

10:29.529 --> 10:33.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The moment that a suspected case
is identified,
our crews are there.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They do inspection.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They do treatment.

10:35.902 --> 10:38.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we have, again, a very
aggressive program.

10:38.471 --> 10:43.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition to that, we have a
very aggressive
outreach program to our
residents, and we're

10:43.176 --> 10:47.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
communicating with our residents
regularly
about the part and the role that
they play

10:47.113 --> 10:49.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in being our partner with this.

10:49.549 --> 10:50.517 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We want our...

10:50.550 --> 10:51.518 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

10:51.551 --> 10:52.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And pardon me.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are you asking them to do?

10:54.420 --> 10:57.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALINA HUDAK: We're asking our
residents to
look in their backyards, to
drain any standing

10:57.257 --> 10:58.558 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
water.

10:58.591 --> 11:00.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're asking our residents and
our visitors
to wear repellent.

11:00.827 --> 11:05.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I heard someone today in a
meeting describe
it as you leave your house in
the morning

11:05.064 --> 11:08.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in Miami and you put on
sunscreen.

11:08.268 --> 11:15.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Put on insect repellent and help
us and be
preventive and do your part in
preventing

11:15.341 --> 11:17.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the spread of this disease.

11:17.243 --> 11:21.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For months now,
there has been
a discussion about this, that it
was going

11:21.714 --> 11:25.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to spread, that it was going to
come to the
U.S., that there were going to
be transmissions

11:25.485 --> 11:27.420 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that began and ended here.

11:27.453 --> 11:29.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why could this not have been
avoided?

11:29.822 --> 11:36.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALINA HUDAK: Well, you know, I
would say to
that we have disease in the
world for millions

11:36.496 --> 11:41.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of years, and that we have
mosquitoes in the
world for millions of years.

11:42.001 --> 11:49.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We -- again, since February,
when our governor
declared a public health
concern, an emergency,

11:49.409 --> 11:54.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our program, you know, continues
to do all
of the things that we do on a
regular basis,

11:54.480 --> 11:58.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not only in responding to
service requests
from our community, but in
working with the

11:58.384 --> 12:02.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Department of Health and making
sure that
at any point that there was a
suspicion of

12:02.522 --> 12:07.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a case, that we were out in that
particular
area, in that region, that we do
inspections

12:07.994 --> 12:09.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and that we do treatment.

12:09.862 --> 12:15.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there has been and there
continues to
be a very aggressive mosquito
control program...

12:15.068 --> 12:16.035 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

12:16.069 --> 12:17.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALINA HUDAK: ... the mosquito.

12:17.103 --> 12:18.304 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Pardon me again.

12:18.338 --> 12:21.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do you encourage caution?

12:22.008 --> 12:24.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like you said, put on sunscreen
and put on
the repellent.

12:25.011 --> 12:27.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you encourage that
without inducing
panic?

12:27.513 --> 12:31.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALINA HUDAK: Well, we have
several methods
by which we do that.

12:31.250 --> 12:36.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our mayor has blessed and
authorized us to
spend whatever we need to spend
to be able

12:36.356 --> 12:37.790 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to do the appropriate outreach.

12:37.824 --> 12:41.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he personally has been -- he
has hosted
media briefings.

12:41.894 --> 12:48.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have hosted a variety of
media opportunities
to get the message out to the
community.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have information on our Web
site.

12:50.269 --> 12:53.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have information on all of
our municipalities'
Web sites.

12:53.373 --> 12:56.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have our code enforcement
personnel in
the community.

12:56.309 --> 12:59.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have done direct mailing to
our community.

12:59.612 --> 13:04.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We work very closely with our
local media
to be sure that that message is
being given

13:04.484 --> 13:10.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the public, and we provide
information
to any civic organization, any
organization

13:10.923 --> 13:12.725 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that wants the information.

13:12.759 --> 13:16.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're making sure that that
message -- and
to everyone who is listening
today, please

13:16.362 --> 13:19.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
put on your insect repellent if
you're living
in Florida.

13:19.098 --> 13:23.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can tell you that I personally
was in the
-- I was in the Wynwood area
this afternoon.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is a beautiful community.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it is a place that I love to
go to with
my family.

13:27.707 --> 13:29.175 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And I go often.

13:29.208 --> 13:30.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I am planning to go.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have family visiting from
Pennsylvania next
week.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I intend to take them there
for lunch
or dinner.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.382 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: OK.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Deputy Mayor Alina Hudak of
Miami-Dade County,
thank you very much.

13:38.785 --> 13:44.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALINA HUDAK: Thank you.

13:44.791 --> 13:54.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tonight, we launch a
new election
year series, Candidates in
Context.

13:54.834 --> 14:04.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tonight, we launch a
new election
year series, Candidates in
Context.

14:04.577 --> 14:08.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Between now and Election Day, we
will strive
to go beyond the headlines to
explain what's

14:09.015 --> 14:10.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
happening and why.

14:10.950 --> 14:15.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins kicks it off
with a closer
look at Donald Trump's recent
statements on

14:15.455 --> 14:17.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Russia and Ukraine.

14:17.290 --> 14:20.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: First, here's
what Donald
Trump said.

14:20.526 --> 14:24.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was over the weekend about
Ukraine and
Russian President Vladimir
Putin.

14:24.097 --> 14:26.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
You know, I have my own ideas.

14:26.499 --> 14:28.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's not going into Ukraine, OK,
just so you
understand.

14:29.001 --> 14:30.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is not going to go into
Ukraine.

14:30.737 --> 14:32.371 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
All right?

14:32.405 --> 14:33.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can mark it down, you can
put it down,
you can take it any way you
want.

14:33.740 --> 14:35.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC News:
He is already
there, isn't he?

14:35.141 --> 14:37.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Well, he is there
in a certain
way, but I'm not there.

14:37.176 --> 14:38.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have Obama there.

14:38.845 --> 14:43.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Critics point
out Vladimir
Putin and Russia are in Ukraine
now.

14:43.249 --> 14:45.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's look at some facts.

14:45.118 --> 14:49.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're talking about two critical
areas, Crimea
on the Black Sea, and the
Donbass region in

14:49.622 --> 14:50.823 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Eastern Ukraine.

14:50.857 --> 14:52.525 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
First, Crimea.

14:52.558 --> 14:58.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 1991, as the Soviet Union
dissolved, Ukraine
and Russia became separate
nations.

14:58.164 --> 15:05.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Voters in Crimea were split, but
they voted
54 percent for Ukrainian
independence.

15:05.304 --> 15:11.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tensions built, protests
erupted, and, in
2014, Ukrainians pushed out a
pro-Russian

15:11.043 --> 15:13.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
government in Kiev.

15:13.246 --> 15:19.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Crimea, unidentified forces,
no flags on
their uniform, fomented an
uprising and a

15:19.152 --> 15:23.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
referendum going the other way,
in favor of
Russia.

15:23.656 --> 15:28.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then Russia annexed Crimea, with
international
outcry, but little bloodshed.

15:28.261 --> 15:33.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, in the Donbass
region, war broke
out, as militant separatists
took over towns

15:33.733 --> 15:36.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and fought Ukrainian government
forces.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's a war that continues
today.

15:38.871 --> 15:42.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The key question, what was
Russia's role?

15:42.208 --> 15:47.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know Russian troops stationed
in Crimea
did seize key positions there,
and Russia

15:47.580 --> 15:51.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
confirmed that it sent soldiers
on intelligence
missions in Donbass.

15:51.450 --> 15:56.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Ukrainian government says
Russia has done
far more, sending more soldiers
and weapons.

15:56.355 --> 15:59.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, this brings us back to Mr.
Trump.

15:59.158 --> 16:04.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here is his clarification on his
words that
Putin isn't going into Ukraine
from a speech

16:04.931 --> 16:06.699 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
yesterday.

16:06.732 --> 16:12.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: But a couple of
papers said,
Donald Trump doesn't realize
that the Crimea

16:12.939 --> 16:14.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was already taken.

16:14.373 --> 16:18.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know it exact -- two years
ago, approximately,
OK, approximately?

16:18.511 --> 16:21.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was taken during Obama's
watch.

16:21.147 --> 16:26.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In other words,
Trump argues
that he knew about Crimea, but
he wasn't talking

16:26.252 --> 16:30.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about Crimea when he spoke of
Putin and Ukraine.

16:30.389 --> 16:31.557 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That is notable.

16:31.591 --> 16:34.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It would be a profound shift in
U.S. policy.

16:34.060 --> 16:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Obama administration sees
Crimea and Eastern
Ukraine as sovereign parts of
Ukraine, and

16:40.566 --> 16:43.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
accuses Putin of violating
international law.

16:43.703 --> 16:48.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a sharp turn in policy, as
is something
else Trump said last week.

16:48.374 --> 16:51.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was asked if he'd remove U.S.
sanctions
against Russia.

16:51.878 --> 16:52.845 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
His answer?

16:52.879 --> 16:53.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We will be looking
at that,
yes.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We will be looking.

16:55.648 --> 16:59.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And that is a
change from
where Trump was in 2014, when he
said this

16:59.085 --> 17:01.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about punishing Russia over
Ukraine:

17:01.320 --> 17:02.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: We should
definitely bee strong.

17:02.922 --> 17:06.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We should definitely do
sanctions, and we
have to show some strength.

17:06.092 --> 17:11.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: One final piece
of context
about Trump's campaign chairman,
Paul Manafort.

17:11.631 --> 17:16.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Manafort advised the campaigns
of Viktor Yanukovych,
the pro-Russian leader of
Ukraine, who was

17:16.535 --> 17:18.738 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
deposed in 2014.

17:18.771 --> 17:22.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Manafort has said he was pushing
Western interests.

17:22.475 --> 17:27.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we look closely at the
candidate's words,
the Trump campaign insist Mrs.
Trump's overall

17:27.513 --> 17:32.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
belief is that the U.S. should
be less involved
in the entire region.

17:32.285 --> 17:38.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins for the "PBS
NewsHour."

17:38.958 --> 17:49.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now a look at how
required
math classes may factor into the
academic

17:49.035 --> 17:53.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
success or failure of high
school and college
students.

17:53.139 --> 17:58.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has the story
as part of
our weekly education series,
Making the Grade.

17:58.110 --> 18:02.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW HACKER, Professor
Emeritus, Queens
College: Words and numbers, we
use them both.

18:02.648 --> 18:04.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We use them for different
reasons.

18:04.517 --> 18:07.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Even if you
aren't going
to be an engineer, getting
through high school

18:07.586 --> 18:09.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or college means getting through
math.

18:09.588 --> 18:10.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GENAO, Student: Why do
we need to
take all these math classes?

18:10.589 --> 18:11.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not necessary.

18:11.958 --> 18:15.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not needed for what we are
actually learning.

18:15.528 --> 18:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Andrew Hacker,
the college
professor teaching at the front
of this classroom

18:20.099 --> 18:22.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at New York's Queens College,
agrees.

18:22.068 --> 18:27.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW HACKER: The goal is to
have everybody
do a full menu of mathematics,
up to and including

18:27.573 --> 18:28.708 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
calculus.

18:28.741 --> 18:32.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't see any rational
reason for this
at all.

18:32.945 --> 18:37.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I'm suggesting is that at
least there
should be other options,
alternatives, instead

18:38.017 --> 18:41.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of this rigid math curriculum
for everyone.

18:41.420 --> 18:46.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Minimum
requirements for
math are different across the
country, but

18:46.258 --> 18:50.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many states today demand getting
through the
quadratic equations and two
years of algebra

18:50.529 --> 18:56.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to graduate high school, and
most college
degrees also require some math
credits.

18:56.502 --> 19:01.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Hacker writes about this
perceived disconnect
between academic requirements
and the everyday

19:01.173 --> 19:04.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
needs of graduates in his recent
book, "The
Math Myth."

19:04.643 --> 19:08.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANDREW HACKER: It's actually
several myths.

19:08.714 --> 19:15.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the myths is that every
one of us is
going to have to know algebra,
geometry, trigonometry

19:15.921 --> 19:21.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the 21st century, because
that's the way
a high-tech age is going.

19:21.227 --> 19:22.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a total myth.

19:22.762 --> 19:28.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At most, 5 percent of people
really use math,
advanced math, in their work.

19:28.434 --> 19:33.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You're also
drawing a distinction
in your book between mathematics
and arithmetic.

19:33.205 --> 19:34.173 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Explain that.

19:34.206 --> 19:35.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW HACKER: Yes.

19:35.441 --> 19:37.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We use math, the term,
indiscriminately.

19:38.010 --> 19:43.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we teach arithmetic
really very well
up through grades, let's say,
five or six.

19:43.315 --> 19:45.084 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We do it.

19:45.117 --> 19:49.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then, instead of continuing
with arithmetic
to what I would call adult
arithmetic, or

19:49.955 --> 19:55.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sophisticated arithmetic, we
immediately plunge
people into geometry and
algebra.

19:55.494 --> 20:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as a result, Americans are
really quite
illiterate in terms of numbers.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Hacker's
alternative?

20:02.835 --> 20:04.136 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Teaching what he calls numeracy.

20:04.170 --> 20:10.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW HACKER: It's income per
hour, essentially,
per person.

20:10.242 --> 20:12.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is Norway well ahead of the
United States?

20:12.711 --> 20:13.679 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK.

20:13.712 --> 20:15.614 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's continue with that.

20:15.648 --> 20:18.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Where he
focuses on developing
his students' mathematical
literacy by giving

20:18.851 --> 20:20.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them some real-world perspective
on the subject.

20:21.020 --> 20:26.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW HACKER: How to read a
corporate report,
how to look at the federal
budget, how to

20:26.826 --> 20:33.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
parse the numbers on the
campaign trail, how
votes are cast, and how many
seats are won,

20:33.766 --> 20:38.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all sorts of assignments like
this, which
only require arithmetic, but
adult arithmetic.

20:39.004 --> 20:43.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A political
scientist by
training, Hacker and his
assertions have predictably

20:43.642 --> 20:47.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
put college and high school math
departments
across the country on the
defensive.

20:47.646 --> 20:50.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DIANE BRIARS, President,
National Council
of Teachers of Mathematics: We
need algebra

20:50.316 --> 20:55.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as a basic way of making sense
of our world.

20:55.855 --> 20:59.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many mathematical relationships
are described
using algebra.

20:59.258 --> 21:03.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Diane Briars
is president
of the National Council of
Teachers of Mathematics.

21:03.996 --> 21:08.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We chatted with her on nearly
her home turf,
the National Museum of
Mathematics in Manhattan.

21:08.667 --> 21:16.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANE BRIARS: Algebra gives us a
way of representing
relationships in general, so
that we can reason

21:16.208 --> 21:20.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about them in the general case,
instead of
specific cases.

21:20.179 --> 21:27.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Algebraic equations and
expressions are also
ways of describing patterns that
we may see

21:27.453 --> 21:28.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and differences between those
patterns.

21:28.954 --> 21:31.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANDREW HACKER: This is put about
by the mathematicians.

21:31.590 --> 21:35.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think they have to say this:
Mathematics
trains the mind.

21:35.861 --> 21:38.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's no evidence for this
whatever.

21:39.031 --> 21:41.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mathematics trains the mind for
mathematics.

21:41.767 --> 21:46.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Hacker thinks
math is a
powerful divider of high school
success.

21:46.105 --> 21:50.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A number of students succeed and
move onward,
while a sizable fraction do not.

21:50.509 --> 21:57.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW HACKER: One out of every
five of our
citizens has not finished high
school.

21:57.082 --> 21:59.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have a 20 percent dropout
rate.

21:59.618 --> 22:02.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's one of the highest in the
developed world.

22:02.454 --> 22:08.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the chief academic reason
for this dropout
rate is algebra in the ninth
grade.

22:08.561 --> 22:11.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The fail rate
is something
Diane Briars doesn't dispute.

22:11.997 --> 22:21.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANE BRIARS: The fact that
failing algebra
I as a ninth grader is -- makes
a student

22:21.140 --> 22:25.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more likely to drop out is a
huge problem
that the mathematics education
community is

22:25.811 --> 22:28.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
actively engaged in.

22:28.847 --> 22:34.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the ways we're addressing
that is by
building a stronger foundation
in K-8 mathematics.

22:34.386 --> 22:38.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With a more solid conceptual
understanding
in K-8 mathematics, students are
going to

22:38.857 --> 22:41.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be much better prepared to be
successful in
algebra I.

22:41.994 --> 22:45.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But Hacker
says the math
failure is greater than just
high school.

22:45.564 --> 22:51.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW HACKER: Forty-seven
percent of people
who start a four-year college do
not get a

22:51.070 --> 22:52.071 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
degree.

22:52.104 --> 22:55.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a very high dropout rate,
close to
half.

22:55.708 --> 23:02.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chief academic reason, freshman
math course,
which people fail and don't make
up.

23:02.281 --> 23:05.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And why don't we ask ourselves,
look at the
talent we're losing.

23:05.284 --> 23:10.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Why are the
institutions
in high school and in college
structured the

23:10.756 --> 23:13.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way they are to emphasize math,
as we do today?

23:13.759 --> 23:19.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW HACKER: Here's the big
word I always
hear: Let's be rigorous, the big
R. Let's

23:19.265 --> 23:24.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be rigorous, so let's make
everybody coming
into community college pass a
stiff algebra

23:24.169 --> 23:25.137 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
test.

23:25.170 --> 23:27.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That shows how rigorous we are.

23:27.706 --> 23:29.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Same thing at a higher level.

23:29.541 --> 23:35.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you take Princeton, Stanford,
Yale, they
want virtually all of their
incoming students,

23:35.814 --> 23:44.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
except for athletes and a few
alumni children,
to have an SAT score on math of
at least 700.

23:44.323 --> 23:45.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's very high.

23:45.324 --> 23:47.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's the top 7 percent.

23:47.159 --> 23:48.127 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

23:48.160 --> 23:50.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're Princeton, we're rigorous.

23:50.229 --> 23:54.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in the name of rigor, we
have this irrational
math barrier.

23:54.500 --> 23:58.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Diane Briars
agrees with
that too, but only up to a
point.

23:58.203 --> 24:02.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANE BRIARS: You can argue
that, for some
of them, that requirement may
have been put

24:02.341 --> 24:08.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there to ensure that they filter
people out.

24:08.314 --> 24:16.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, being able to
be facile
with symbols and equations is
necessary for

24:16.155 --> 24:17.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a number of trades.

24:18.023 --> 24:24.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, the electricians
union has passing
a course in algebra I as a
requirement for

24:24.363 --> 24:26.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an apprenticeship program.

24:26.165 --> 24:29.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So both sides
agree that
the formula for the right amount
of math isn't

24:29.768 --> 24:31.537 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
optimal.

24:31.570 --> 24:35.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Figuring out the right equation
may be one
of the first major problems for
new graduates

24:35.341 --> 24:36.542 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
everywhere.

24:36.575 --> 24:41.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

24:56.095 --> 25:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community; and the troubles
still plaguing
Rio just days before the opening
ceremony.

25:01.734 --> 25:07.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: a report on the
Bakken oil fields
in North Dakota, where
employment and the

25:07.406 --> 25:10.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
economy are directly affected by
the price
of oil.

25:10.943 --> 25:16.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Oil prices have dropped since
their peak in
2014, and drilling has slowed,
idling rigs

25:16.715 --> 25:21.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and sending the once booming
economy into
uncertainty.

25:21.186 --> 25:26.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Inside Energy's Emily Guerin
takes us on a
tour of Oil Bust Alley, a short
stretch of

25:26.492 --> 25:31.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
highway where the boom and bust
of the oil
industry plays out.

25:31.263 --> 25:39.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMILY GUERIN: I have spent two
years reporting
on the Bakken oil field in North
Dakota.

25:39.104 --> 25:44.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have seen it when it was
booming, back in
2014, and now, when it's
busting.

25:44.410 --> 25:49.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's one highway in the oil
field town
of Dickinson, Highway 22, where
you can see

25:49.415 --> 25:51.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the entire boom and bust story.

25:51.717 --> 25:57.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we're going on a road trip
through Oil
Bust Alley to see what we can
learn in this

25:57.089 --> 26:03.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
five-mile stretch of road about
how a community
changes when the price of oil
crashes.

26:03.362 --> 26:08.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's start with the obvious
losers: businesses
directly involved in the
drilling and production

26:08.667 --> 26:09.902 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of oil.

26:09.935 --> 26:13.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I'm standing in front a
field of stacked
drilling rigs.

26:13.105 --> 26:15.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's about 27 back there.

26:15.073 --> 26:16.842 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We just counted.

26:16.875 --> 26:19.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's actually about the
same amount
that are actively drilling for
oil in North

26:19.945 --> 26:21.313 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Dakota.

26:21.346 --> 26:24.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two years ago, when the price of
oil was high,
there were over 180.

26:24.249 --> 26:30.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's really a sign of how
much things
have slowed down here in the oil
field.

26:30.122 --> 26:37.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every time a drilling rig gets
idled, about
120 people lose their jobs,
people like Kaley

26:37.229 --> 26:42.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Haugen's husband, who worked on
a drilling
rig for over a decade before
being laid off

26:42.267 --> 26:44.069 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last year.

26:44.102 --> 26:48.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Haugen has also seen a huge
impact of the
slowdown on her business, the
Uniform Unit,

26:48.740 --> 26:50.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which is right on Highway 22.

26:50.476 --> 26:53.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KALEY HAUGEN, Uniform Unit: We
do uniforms
for a variety of industries.

26:53.912 --> 26:59.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We do flame-resistant clothing
for the oil
and gas industry, as well as
electrical.

26:59.485 --> 27:06.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We do scrubs, medical uniforms,
and then we
also have brought in tactical
for EMS management

27:06.492 --> 27:08.293 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
services.

27:08.327 --> 27:11.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMILY GUERIN: The Uniform Unit
just opened
last spring, right as oil prices
were tanking.

27:11.563 --> 27:17.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KALEY HAUGEN: If we would've
been operating
two years ago, three years ago,
I would bet

27:17.035 --> 27:19.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
90 percent of our business would
have been
oil field.

27:19.838 --> 27:23.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now I would say we're pretty
even within the
different fields.

27:23.342 --> 27:29.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I would say 30 percent
oil fields,
30 percent tactical, 30 percent
scrubs, so

27:29.414 --> 27:32.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
definitely different than I
thought.

27:32.351 --> 27:36.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EMILY GUERIN: Hotels have also
been hit hard
by the slowdown.

27:36.355 --> 27:41.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Over 1,000 new hotel rooms were
built in Dickinson
in the past 12 years.

27:41.927 --> 27:47.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Connie Hank and Bill Evans
manage and do maintenance
in three of those hotels just
off Highway

27:47.332 --> 27:49.101 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
22.

27:49.134 --> 27:51.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL EVANS, Maintenance Worker:
When I got
here in March of '14, there were
no vacancies.

27:51.870 --> 27:56.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If somebody checked out, you
already had somebody's
name who was waiting on that
room.

27:56.608 --> 28:02.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CONNIE HANK, Manager: You
would've been paying
$80 a night for a single and
almost -- just

28:02.614 --> 28:04.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about $100 for a double.

28:04.816 --> 28:06.585 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That was cheap.

28:06.618 --> 28:09.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And now you can get a room for
$32 a night.

28:09.688 --> 28:10.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's a big change.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BILL EVANS: Drastic.

28:12.257 --> 28:17.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EMILY GUERIN: Now their three
hotels are at
less than 30 percent occupancy.

28:17.162 --> 28:20.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They end up with a lot of time
on their hands.

28:20.432 --> 28:25.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CONNIE HANK: I'm sitting here
waiting, praying
that a car pulls into my parking
lot.

28:25.637 --> 28:28.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that was the truth.

28:28.073 --> 28:30.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We look like a bunch of
vultures.

28:30.042 --> 28:33.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The minute they walked in the
door, it was
like, hey, thank you for coming
here, you

28:33.278 --> 28:35.047 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
know?

28:35.080 --> 28:38.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMILY GUERIN: Just down the
highway, there
are signs that other parts of
the housing

28:38.183 --> 28:40.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
market are also hurting.

28:40.452 --> 28:44.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, coming up, there's a man
camp graveyard.

28:44.122 --> 28:51.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's just a field full of
trailers that are
just like jumbled together,
almost piled on

28:51.663 --> 28:57.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
top of each other, because
people don't have
a need to house these workers
anymore because

28:57.169 --> 29:00.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they have laid off so many of
their employees.

29:00.238 --> 29:03.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The slowdown in the oil field
hasn't been
uniformly bad.

29:03.976 --> 29:09.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Custom cabinet manufacturer TMI
Systems had
25 percent growth last year.

29:09.281 --> 29:16.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That means they need a lot of
new workers.

29:16.822 --> 29:21.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
General manager Tom Krank says a
few years
ago, the cost of living was high
in Dickinson

29:21.493 --> 29:24.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
due to the housing shortage
brought on by
the influx of oil workers.

29:24.963 --> 29:27.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM KRANK, General Manager, TMI
Systems: With
the rents where they were at, it
was tough

29:28.000 --> 29:32.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to even attract people with
that, because
even though we had good wages,
the rents beyond

29:32.871 --> 29:35.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where they could justify moving
out here to
work for us.

29:35.307 --> 29:38.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EMILY GUERIN: But now there's no
longer a
labor shortage.

29:38.310 --> 29:41.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are far more applicants
than job openings.

29:41.713 --> 29:43.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And rental prices are dropping.

29:43.348 --> 29:46.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So TMI Systems is having no
trouble hiring.

29:46.551 --> 29:51.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM KRANK: As time went on, the
oil field
layoffs got deeper and deeper,
and pretty

29:51.823 --> 29:55.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
soon we started seeing some of
our former
employees coming back.

29:55.160 --> 29:58.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EMILY GUERIN: Scott Weiand is
one of them.

29:58.063 --> 30:04.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He worked at TMI for 21 years
before leaving
in 2012 load crude oil onto rail
cars.

30:04.169 --> 30:07.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT WEIAND, Installer, TMI
Systems: For
me, I was looking for a
challenge, possibly

30:07.739 --> 30:08.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a little higher pay.

30:08.740 --> 30:10.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obviously, that's an attraction
for people.

30:10.709 --> 30:13.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But with the slowdown in the oil
business,
I wanted to look for other
opportunities.

30:13.712 --> 30:17.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one of the first things in
mind for me
was TMI.

30:17.449 --> 30:22.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EMILY GUERIN: The slowdown is
also benefiting
the local government.

30:22.087 --> 30:27.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dickinson City Administrator
Shawn Kessel
says hiring is easier and
expenses are lower,

30:27.859 --> 30:31.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because they no longer have to
compete with
higher oil field salaries.

30:31.930 --> 30:35.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But on the downside, the oil
bust has sent
tax revenue tumbling.

30:35.467 --> 30:40.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHAWN KESSEL, Dickinson City
Administrator:
We have lost about $1.5 million
into our general

30:40.439 --> 30:41.406 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fund.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's a big hit to the general
fund.

30:43.642 --> 30:46.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our general fund is about $16
million.

30:46.611 --> 30:51.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So to lose 1.5 out of that fund
causes you
to be creative.

30:51.817 --> 30:53.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EMILY GUERIN: Creative.

30:53.585 --> 30:57.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If I have learned anything
covering the oil
field, it's that oil booms and
busts force

30:57.756 --> 31:02.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
communities, individuals and
businesses to
be creative.

31:02.160 --> 31:04.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Take this Taco Bell right on
Highway 22.

31:04.663 --> 31:06.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Take your order when
you're ready.

31:06.131 --> 31:07.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EMILY GUERIN: Hi.

31:07.132 --> 31:09.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Can I get an order of nachos,
please?

31:09.267 --> 31:14.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They couldn't hire or retain
workers during
the boom because it was so easy
to get a higher-paying

31:14.740 --> 31:15.707 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
job.

31:15.741 --> 31:17.709 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So they decided to triage.

31:17.743 --> 31:20.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For a while, only their
drive-through was
open.

31:20.545 --> 31:22.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You couldn't go inside.

31:22.647 --> 31:26.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now they're fully staffed again.

31:26.618 --> 31:31.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we headed out of town, we
drove past the
drilling rig graveyard one last
time.

31:31.456 --> 31:36.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For Kessel, those idled rigs are
actually
a sign that the oil industry
hasn't given

31:36.728 --> 31:38.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
up on North Dakota.

31:38.597 --> 31:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHAWN KESSEL: What that means
is, when they
stack them like that, they can
respond quickly

31:42.434 --> 31:44.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
when things change.

31:44.302 --> 31:47.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When that price goes up, they
can just simply
move it from that rig yard to
wherever that

31:48.006 --> 31:51.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their is on the wells that they
want to invest
in next.

31:51.710 --> 31:56.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMILY GUERIN: Like many people
in Western
North Dakota, Kessel wants the
oil activity

31:56.615 --> 32:01.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to come back, just not quite as
crazy as last
time.

32:01.987 --> 32:12.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Emily Guerin,
reporting from Highway 22 in
Dickinson, North

32:12.998 --> 32:14.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Dakota.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Tonight, police
officers across
the country are heading out in
their neighborhoods

32:23.408 --> 32:27.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to talk to citizens, part of an
effort called
National Night Out.

32:27.679 --> 32:33.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This summer has been marked in
places by shootings
and heated tensions between law
enforcement

32:33.185 --> 32:34.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and those they serve.

32:34.719 --> 32:37.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there are cities leading the
way to improve
things.

32:37.789 --> 32:43.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As part of our Race Matters
conversation focusing
on solutions, special
correspondent Charlayne

32:43.428 --> 32:46.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hunter-Gault reports from Gary,
Indiana.

32:46.364 --> 32:51.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Karen
Marie Freeman-Wilson
became native of her native
Gary, Indiana,

32:51.803 --> 32:53.705 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after three attempts.

32:53.738 --> 32:58.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
High on her list of priorities
was improving
relations between the police and
the predominantly

32:58.310 --> 33:03.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
black community, not great in a
town with
high unemployment dating back to
the steel

33:03.415 --> 33:09.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mill closures in the '70s, in
addition to
a history of police brutality
and crime.

33:09.521 --> 33:14.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Mayor Freeman-Wilson is
starting to change
Gary, and we sat down with the
mayor to discuss

33:14.693 --> 33:16.228 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
her solutions.

33:16.261 --> 33:18.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mayor Freeman-Wilson, thank you
for joining
us.

33:18.396 --> 33:22.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
How high on your list of
priorities was police-community
relations?

33:22.901 --> 33:26.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN MARIE FREEMAN-WILSON,
Mayor of Gary,
Indiana: Well police-community
relations was

33:26.171 --> 33:31.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very high on my list, because
public safety
was one of the greatest concerns
in our community.

33:31.910 --> 33:33.578 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Why?

33:33.612 --> 33:38.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN MARIE FREEMAN-WILSON: We
had a very
high and still have a high
murder rate.

33:38.183 --> 33:43.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had and have a high rate of
crime, even
though it's gone down.

33:43.255 --> 33:49.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot has to do with the fact
that there's
frustration associated with not
having employment,

33:49.861 --> 33:53.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with not having adequate income,
with poverty.

33:53.531 --> 34:00.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as a result of that, people
tend to be
angry or angrier.

34:00.505 --> 34:05.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as a result of that anger,
you will find
that people resort to violence
sometimes.

34:05.944 --> 34:10.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But at
the time that
you took office, there was real
conflict between

34:10.248 --> 34:11.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the community and the police.

34:11.716 --> 34:13.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What was the biggest problem
that you had
to deal with there?

34:14.019 --> 34:16.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREN MARIE FREEMAN-WILSON:
Well, there was
distrust of the police.

34:16.254 --> 34:18.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Why?

34:18.089 --> 34:22.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN MARIE FREEMAN-WILSON:
Residents often
thought that perhaps the police
were involved

34:22.527 --> 34:29.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in illegal activity, or, more
often, didn't
care about what happened in
neighborhoods.

34:29.334 --> 34:35.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a big gulf in between
the fact that
some of our police officers do
not live in

34:35.140 --> 34:41.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the city, and, as a result of
them not living,
that they didn't understand what
was happening

34:41.279 --> 34:42.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the neighborhoods.

34:42.514 --> 34:44.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So, what
did you do?

34:44.349 --> 34:48.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN MARIE FREEMAN-WILSON:
Well, we became
involved in the national
initiative on building

34:48.486 --> 34:54.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
police and community trust, an
initiative
out of the John Jay College of
Criminal Justice,

34:54.392 --> 35:00.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as well as other organizations,
Yale University,
the National Institute of
Justice, and other

35:00.332 --> 35:06.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
research organizations, that
really look at
ways to build police and
community trust.

35:07.005 --> 35:10.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so they come in, they talk
to members
of the community.

35:11.009 --> 35:14.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They provide training for the
police department.

35:14.946 --> 35:19.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our police officers have all
gone through
implicit bias training.

35:19.351 --> 35:21.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: What's
that?

35:21.119 --> 35:26.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN MARIE FREEMAN-WILSON:
That's training
to really check your biases, to
ask you to

35:26.725 --> 35:29.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
look at the way that you look at
other people.

35:29.294 --> 35:33.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, do I look at you and think a
certain thing?

35:33.231 --> 35:36.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And how does that impact the way
that I interact
with you?

35:37.002 --> 35:43.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, as a police officer, do I
look at an African-American
male, whether I am an
African-American male

35:43.041 --> 35:48.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or not, and think a certain
thing, and as
a result act a certain way
towards that person?

35:48.813 --> 35:52.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So, what
would you
say is the result of that?

35:52.050 --> 35:57.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN MARIE FREEMAN-WILSON: What
we have found
is that police listen to the
community more,

35:57.756 --> 36:01.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the community listens to our
police officers
more.

36:01.960 --> 36:04.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's more positive
interaction.

36:04.229 --> 36:10.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have also found that there's
more of an
effort to interact when it's not
-- when a

36:11.002 --> 36:12.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
crisis is not occurring.

36:13.004 --> 36:20.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, in August, we will have
our National
Night Out, when the community
comes out on

36:20.812 --> 36:22.547 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an evening.

36:22.580 --> 36:27.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the police, fire, and other
departments
of the city get together.

36:27.252 --> 36:33.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's really focused on
public safety and
the fact that you can go out
after dark, you

36:33.525 --> 36:37.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can interact after dark in a
positive way.

36:37.629 --> 36:40.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The police bring their canine
units out.

36:40.532 --> 36:44.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And young people will get a
chance to interact
with the canine.

36:44.135 --> 36:45.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And not
be bitten
by them.

36:45.637 --> 36:47.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREN MARIE FREEMAN-WILSON: And
not be bitten
by them.

36:47.605 --> 36:49.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a positive thing.

36:49.240 --> 36:51.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: What's
the complexion
of your police department?

36:51.676 --> 36:53.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And does that matter?

36:53.545 --> 36:57.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN MARIE FREEMAN-WILSON:
About 55 percent
of our police department is
African-American.

36:57.382 --> 37:02.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Another 35 to 40 percent is
Caucasian.

37:02.120 --> 37:04.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the remaining officers are
Latino.

37:04.756 --> 37:06.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that absolutely does matter.

37:06.724 --> 37:13.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's important that
young African-American
children see police officers,
see people in

37:13.298 --> 37:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
authority that look like them.

37:15.667 --> 37:20.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: What you
have achieved
here sounds pretty good.

37:20.972 --> 37:23.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It actually sounds very good.

37:23.608 --> 37:27.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it applicable in other
circumstances in
other cities?

37:27.378 --> 37:33.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN MARIE FREEMAN-WILSON: I
believe that
the solution is really for the
police to establish

37:33.818 --> 37:40.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a rapport with the community
that doesn't
necessarily involve an official
interaction.

37:40.125 --> 37:42.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Sometimes, it's midnight
basketball.

37:42.660 --> 37:47.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Other, times it's some type of
youth league.

37:47.332 --> 37:53.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sometimes, it's an explorers
program, where
you are recruiting young people
to be involved

37:53.972 --> 37:55.773 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with the police.

37:55.807 --> 37:59.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Other times, it's just
neighborhood forums
or neighborhood meetings where
you help people

37:59.711 --> 38:01.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to keep their community safe.

38:01.980 --> 38:09.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you know the officers, then
you're less
inclined to think that they are
there to harass

38:09.287 --> 38:10.989 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

38:11.022 --> 38:15.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you know the community,
you will
understand that the overwhelming
-- overwhelming

38:15.193 --> 38:18.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
number of citizens are really
law-abiding
people.

38:18.096 --> 38:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And you
mentioned
earlier the fact that your
murder rate is

38:21.866 --> 38:22.834 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going down.

38:22.867 --> 38:24.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you attribute that to?

38:24.736 --> 38:27.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN MARIE FREEMAN-WILSON: We
attribute the
reduction in the murder rate to
the fact that

38:27.505 --> 38:33.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have now focused on those
most likely to
be involved in criminal
activity.

38:33.611 --> 38:37.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so there was a time when we
were just
doing sweeps.

38:37.215 --> 38:40.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think a lot of people call it
broken window
policing.

38:40.785 --> 38:42.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Yes,
city of Gary.

38:42.120 --> 38:45.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREN MARIE FREEMAN-WILSON: And
so everybody
would get stopped.

38:45.290 --> 38:46.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You might get stopped.

38:46.291 --> 38:47.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I might get stopped.

38:47.992 --> 38:52.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there might be positive
results in terms
of being able to detect a crime,
or there

38:52.931 --> 38:54.599 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
might not.

38:54.632 --> 39:00.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now we focus on those who are
most likely
to be involved in criminal
behavior.

39:00.572 --> 39:06.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we send them not just a
punitive message,
but we send them a message that
we would like

39:06.678 --> 39:10.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to see you become productive,
law-abiding
citizens.

39:10.315 --> 39:17.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want to support you in that
effort, but
if you choose to continue in the
road of crime,

39:17.789 --> 39:22.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you continue to be involved
in non-productive
behavior, we will hold you
accountable for

39:22.460 --> 39:23.628 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

39:23.661 --> 39:25.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And when
do you tell
them that?

39:25.430 --> 39:27.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN MARIE FREEMAN-WILSON:
Well, we focus
on those individuals who are on
probation

39:27.532 --> 39:28.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and parole.

39:28.900 --> 39:32.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we conduct what they refer
to as call-ins.

39:32.837 --> 39:35.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so these call-ins are
meetings.

39:35.340 --> 39:40.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're meetings that involve
the community,
meetings that involve
individuals on probation

39:40.144 --> 39:41.913 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and parole.

39:41.946 --> 39:48.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And essentially what we tell
them is, we want
to help you, we want to support
you, but we

39:48.920 --> 39:53.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also want peace and safety in
this community,
and that the killing has to
stop.

39:53.992 --> 39:57.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Well,
Mayor Freeman-Wilson,
thank you for joining us.

39:57.929 --> 40:05.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAREN MARIE FREEMAN-WILSON:
Thank you.

40:05.236 --> 40:12.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: With the Summer
Olympics set to
open in Brazil later this week,
big questions

40:12.076 --> 40:17.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remain about whether Rio de
Janeiro is ready,
and whether it can get
completely ready in

40:17.415 --> 40:18.383 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

40:18.416 --> 40:19.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our look.

40:19.984 --> 40:23.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The governor
recently declared
a state of public calamity.

40:24.022 --> 40:28.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
City waterways are fouled and
filled with
bacteria, streets are clogged
with traffic,

40:28.493 --> 40:31.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and transportation projects
aren't finished.

40:31.062 --> 40:36.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And beyond the Olympics,
political chaos,
as President Dilma Rousseff
awaits an impeachment

40:36.367 --> 40:38.136 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
trial.

40:38.169 --> 40:41.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Days before the start of the
Olympic Games,
we look at the state of play in
Brazil with

40:41.205 --> 40:48.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NPR's Rio de Janeiro-based Lulu
Garcia-Navarro,
Alex Cuadros, author of the book
"Brazillionaires,"

40:48.746 --> 40:53.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a look at wealth and inequality
in Brazil
in the decade leading up to the
Olympics,

40:53.685 --> 40:58.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Paulo Sotero, director of
the Brazil Institute
at the Woodrow Wilson
International Center

40:58.856 --> 41:01.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for Scholars in Washington, D.C.

41:01.526 --> 41:02.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to all of you.

41:02.927 --> 41:04.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lulu Garcia-Navarro, let me
start with you.

41:04.829 --> 41:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How prepared or unprepared is
Brazil for these
Games?

41:08.866 --> 41:14.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And how are people that you're
talking to
feeling about the Games just
before they start?

41:14.138 --> 41:16.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, National
Public Radio:
I mean, I think it's undeniable
that it's

41:16.841 --> 41:22.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been very bumpy, just starting
with the athletes
and the Olympic Village.

41:22.747 --> 41:24.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Half of them couldn't move in.

41:24.649 --> 41:30.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They had to send in an army of
repairmen to
fix basic infrastructure
questions like electricity

41:30.321 --> 41:32.090 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and plumbing.

41:32.123 --> 41:36.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have seen a lot of other
complaints,
just today in the media village,
some of the

41:36.694 --> 41:39.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reporters complaining about the
lack and quality
of food.

41:39.664 --> 41:41.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So it has been very bumpy.

41:41.332 --> 41:46.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If you speak to ordinary
Brazilians, they
are not surprised by the
problems, but they

41:46.537 --> 41:48.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are definitely disappointed.

41:48.272 --> 41:52.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And just to stay
with you a
moment, even today, we heard of
reports of

41:52.977 --> 41:58.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
huge amounts of traffic, 70-mile
backups there
in Rio.

41:58.516 --> 41:59.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Have you experienced some of
that?

42:00.017 --> 42:01.252 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: I have.

42:01.285 --> 42:06.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I mean, Rio is always a
challenging city to
move around in.

42:06.290 --> 42:10.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a city with huge mountains
and poor infrastructure.

42:10.895 --> 42:17.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Add to that the fact that you
have dedicated
lanes now that are for Olympic
transportation,

42:17.435 --> 42:20.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
buses and cars for the IOC
members.

42:20.405 --> 42:24.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's meant that just
people who are
moving around the city in
regular vehicles

42:24.275 --> 42:26.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have had to face enormous
amounts of traffic.

42:26.978 --> 42:33.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Getting from Copacabana to the
main Olympic
venues, which are about 20 miles
away, took

42:33.618 --> 42:35.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me about two-and-a-half a hours
the other
day.

42:35.420 --> 42:37.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, it is a challenge.

42:37.221 --> 42:40.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Alex Cuadros, the
promise was
that these Games, of course,
would benefit

42:40.825 --> 42:46.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brazilians beyond the Olympics,
right, that
they would reach the larger
society.

42:46.164 --> 42:50.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In what ways do you see that
happening, and
where is it falling short?

42:50.668 --> 42:56.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALEX CUADROS, Author,
"Brazillionaires": Well,
look, I think that the Olympics
were pitched

42:56.674 --> 43:03.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Brazilians as an excuse to
modernize all
of this woefully lacking
infrastructure in

43:03.915 --> 43:05.683 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Rio.

43:05.716 --> 43:10.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some of the projects that
were built really
will help the population at
large.

43:10.188 --> 43:15.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A number of express bus lines
were created
that are going to be a big
benefit to the

43:15.760 --> 43:23.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
working-class Brazilians who can
spend two-and-a-half-hours
commuting each way every day.

43:23.968 --> 43:29.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Lulu talking about the
traffic, you know,
she brings up a really
interesting point,

43:29.407 --> 43:37.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is, why were most of the
Olympic installations
put in this wealthy suburb known
as Barra

43:37.648 --> 43:39.650 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
da Tijuca?

43:39.684 --> 43:45.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an area of the city where
only 300,000
people live, and where people
are generally

43:45.156 --> 43:48.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
much wealthier than the rest of
the city.

43:48.092 --> 43:56.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, poorer areas of the
city like the
north side remain desperately in
need of public

43:56.534 --> 43:58.302 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
works.

43:58.336 --> 44:02.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Paulo Sotero, of
course, the
original idea also -- this goes
back to when

44:02.106 --> 44:07.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brazil got the Olympics in 2009,
I think -- was
a kind of coming out party for
the country

44:07.879 --> 44:14.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the world stage, right, to
present itself
as a major power and certainly
an economic

44:14.685 --> 44:15.653 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
power?

44:15.686 --> 44:17.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Where does that -- how does that
look now?

44:17.588 --> 44:20.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAULO SOTERO, Director, Brazil
Institute,
Wilson Center: Well, it looks
like the government

44:20.491 --> 44:25.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
oversold the story, because that
really didn't
come to pass.

44:25.997 --> 44:33.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brazil a few years after that
entered into
its most serious economic crisis
in a century.

44:33.804 --> 44:36.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Eleven million people lost their
jobs.

44:36.941 --> 44:41.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the promise of the Olympics
didn't have
a chance.

44:41.546 --> 44:46.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, we know now
that people
in the government in the state
of Brazil were

44:46.450 --> 44:53.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
involved in a criminal
organization, so says
the attorney general of the
country, stealing,

44:53.424 --> 44:58.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
assaulting the largest Brazilian
company,
Petrobras, headquartered in Rio.

44:58.596 --> 45:05.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, obviously, if we knew then
what we know
now, I believe most Brazilians
would have

45:05.670 --> 45:07.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been against hosting the
Olympics.

45:07.838 --> 45:14.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now most Brazilians are
disappointed,
and not expecting much from the
Olympics.

45:14.912 --> 45:18.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, Lulu, let me
go back to
you in Rio.

45:18.316 --> 45:21.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One major issue, of course, is
security.

45:21.052 --> 45:25.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With all that's happened in
various cities
around the world over the past
months, how

45:25.656 --> 45:27.024 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
big a threat is it there?

45:27.058 --> 45:28.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How seriously is it being taken?

45:28.826 --> 45:32.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: I think
it's now being
taken extremely seriously, but,
again, as

45:32.129 --> 45:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with everything here, the
criticism is that
the Brazilian government took
the threat too

45:36.434 --> 45:38.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
seriously too late.

45:38.369 --> 45:42.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look around the streets
of Rio de Janeiro
right now, it's a heavily
militarized city.

45:42.974 --> 45:45.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have over 80,000 security
forces here.

45:45.910 --> 45:48.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's twice the number of the
London Games.

45:48.479 --> 45:50.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so you're not lacking for
security.

45:50.815 --> 45:55.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But certainly there are serious
questions
about how safe the venues are.

45:55.853 --> 45:59.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were just questions today
about some
of the security measures at some
of the main

45:59.390 --> 46:01.125 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
venues.

46:01.158 --> 46:05.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we still have to see
exactly how the
Brazilian government is going to
deal with

46:05.429 --> 46:07.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the very real threat of
terrorism.

46:07.231 --> 46:11.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, Alex Cuadros,
when you
look -- you have been looking at
the financial

46:11.402 --> 46:16.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
state and the economic state of
the country
for the last decade or so.

46:16.140 --> 46:21.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Apart -- sports aside, what
would constitute
success for Brazil at this
point?

46:21.479 --> 46:23.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And what are the prospects?

46:23.147 --> 46:29.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX CUADROS: Well, look, I
think that the
near term for Brazil is not
pretty.

46:29.286 --> 46:34.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, it's in the deepest
recession in
possibly a century.

46:34.659 --> 46:36.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Millions of jobs have been lost.

46:36.427 --> 46:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the same time, I think
that Paulo
pointed to this moment when
there was this

46:42.533 --> 46:49.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amazing optimism about Brazil,
and I think
that people exaggerated then in
their euphoria

46:50.007 --> 46:52.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about Brazil's prospects as a
country.

46:52.343 --> 46:58.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that, by the same
token, right
now, people may be exaggerating
in their pessimism.

46:58.816 --> 47:05.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, it may be that we're
approaching, if we
haven't reached, the bottom of
the well, and

47:05.856 --> 47:10.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that simply by virtue of the
fact that we
have fallen so much in Brazil,
things are

47:10.528 --> 47:12.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to start to bounce back.

47:12.329 --> 47:15.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: You mean
expectations are so
low at this point that perhaps
things will

47:15.599 --> 47:17.368 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
look OK?

47:17.401 --> 47:24.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX CUADROS: Well, look, you
know, the economy
has shrunk by so much that, when
there is

47:24.842 --> 47:31.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a rebound, it's going to be
significant, just
because of the base of
comparison.

47:31.315 --> 47:35.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, you know, Brazil is not a
Venezuela.

47:35.586 --> 47:40.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're not seeing kleptocracy on
the scale
that we see there.

47:40.458 --> 47:42.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a functioning country.

47:42.226 --> 47:44.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a diverse economy.

47:44.662 --> 47:48.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that, at least in
the medium-term,
it's going to bounce back.

47:48.566 --> 47:52.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's also true,
Paulo Sotero,
that we have gone into many
other Olympics

47:52.369 --> 47:55.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thinking, oh, they're not ready,
this is going
to be a disaster, they're going
to have all

47:55.639 --> 47:58.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kinds of problems, only to see
some great
success.

47:58.743 --> 48:00.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, what do you think the
prospects are here?

48:00.678 --> 48:04.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAULO SOTERO: I think prospects
to have a
good Olympics is reasonable now.

48:04.915 --> 48:06.016 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Reasonable?

48:06.050 --> 48:07.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAULO SOTERO: Reasonable.

48:07.918 --> 48:12.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Do not underestimate the
capacity of Brazilians
in general and people from Rio
in particular

48:12.356 --> 48:13.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to throw a party.

48:13.891 --> 48:18.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Cariocas, as we call them,
are famous
for that.

48:18.729 --> 48:22.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have the Carnival every
year that are
great parties.

48:23.000 --> 48:26.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They happen on the clock.

48:26.337 --> 48:28.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they are very
well-organized.

48:28.305 --> 48:34.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I believe also, as the athletes
converge,
you know, their effort, their
merits will

48:34.345 --> 48:40.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take over, and this will be a
story of the
real Olympics, but it will be,
above all,

48:40.618 --> 48:42.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a story about the Olympics.

48:42.820 --> 48:47.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is a very positive,
interesting event.

48:47.458 --> 48:53.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People -- actually, tourists
coming to Rio
will be very warmly welcomed by
people.

48:53.497 --> 48:54.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They already are.

48:54.598 --> 48:56.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, actually, they should
mingle with the
people.

48:56.834 --> 49:00.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They should go up to the hills
and be with
the people.

49:00.704 --> 49:07.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Actually, the best summer in
Brazil are up
in the (INAUDIBLE) in the
so-called slums.

49:07.411 --> 49:09.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a very generous and nice
people.

49:09.780 --> 49:13.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, don't equate Rio and slums
with crime.

49:13.551 --> 49:19.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, there's crime there, but,
as Lulu said,
heavy security for 15 days.

49:19.890 --> 49:21.358 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, enjoy Rio.

49:21.392 --> 49:23.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Enjoy the Olympics.

49:23.194 --> 49:26.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, Lulu, just
20 seconds
here, just, is your sense that
people really

49:26.597 --> 49:29.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
feel the weight of this, I mean,
that there's
a lot riding on this?

49:29.700 --> 49:33.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: I feel that
they do feel
that there is a lot riding on
this, but they're

49:33.304 --> 49:35.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also very much ready for it to
be over.

49:36.006 --> 49:37.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's been a huge buildup.

49:37.808 --> 49:40.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This has been a country that has
been going
through so many different
things, as we have

49:40.177 --> 49:44.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mentioned, economic, political
crises, the
World Cup just two years ago,
and now this.

49:44.215 --> 49:49.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think Cariocas want this
to be a success,
but I also think that they very
much want

49:49.086 --> 49:51.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
these Games to be over soon.

49:51.288 --> 49:53.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, in the
meantime,
let them begin, right?

49:53.824 --> 49:58.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lulu Garcia-Navarro, Alex
Cuadros, Paulo Sotero,
thank you, all three, very much.

49:58.162 --> 49:59.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAULO SOTERO: Thank you.

49:59.930 --> 50:04.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, PBS will
be airing
three Olympic-themed
documentaries tonight.

50:04.802 --> 50:09.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One profiles the story of
Claressa Shields,
who comes from Flint, Michigan.

50:09.306 --> 50:14.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She goes by the nickname T-Rex,
and was 17
when she was the first U.S.
woman to ever

50:14.979 --> 50:17.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
win boxing gold in 2012.

50:17.781 --> 50:19.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She hasn't lost since.

50:19.884 --> 50:24.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight's "Independent Lens"
follows her rise,
but also looks at why she's
never gotten the

50:24.121 --> 50:27.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fame or endorsements that often
follow the
gold.

50:27.524 --> 50:29.293 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Here's a look.

50:29.326 --> 50:30.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTHONY BARTKOWSKI, USA Boxing:
I wanted to
pull us together and just talk
about a few

50:30.728 --> 50:34.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things of how we want to help
you and see
if there's other ways.

50:35.032 --> 50:39.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know you're trying to get some
sponsorships
and endorsements, et cetera.

50:39.203 --> 50:42.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: We see these other people
getting all
these big endorsements and all
that.

50:42.873 --> 50:46.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTHONY BARTKOWSKI: Claressa was
one of 46
gold medals for the U.S. team.

50:46.810 --> 50:56.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIE GOLDSTICKER, Did you even
sit down and
look at who from that group has
the huge endorsement

50:56.420 --> 50:58.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deals, it's Gabby Douglas and
her gym (INAUDIBLE)
and Ryan Lochte.

50:58.255 --> 51:05.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you have somebody who was
in homes every
night on prime-time television
on national

51:05.162 --> 51:07.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
television, the reality is
people see them.

51:07.464 --> 51:10.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, what do we do to address
that situation?

51:10.501 --> 51:14.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want every time you're on TV,
if a potential
sponsor sees you, for them be
drawn to you

51:14.905 --> 51:18.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and say, oh, I want to work with
that girl.

51:18.142 --> 51:25.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we would love for you stop
saying that
you like beating people up and
making them

51:25.115 --> 51:26.550 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cry.

51:26.583 --> 51:27.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLARESSA SHIELDS, Olympic Boxer:
You would
love me to stop saying that?

51:27.151 --> 51:28.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANTHONY BARTKOWSKI: Yes.

51:28.118 --> 51:29.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Stop saying that.

51:29.119 --> 51:30.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLARESSA SHIELDS: Why?

51:30.521 --> 51:32.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTHONY BARTKOWSKI: Because it
makes it seems
like you're a bully.

51:32.323 --> 51:33.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLARESSA SHIELDS: When it comes
to somebody
wanting to get behind me and
say, I want this

51:33.157 --> 51:33.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
person to represent my brand, I
box.

51:34.024 --> 51:35.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIE GOLDSTICKER: I understand
that.

51:35.326 --> 51:37.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: I understand what you're
saying.

51:37.328 --> 51:39.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Just it's like an image thing.

51:39.330 --> 51:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to kind of tone it down
a little
bit.

51:43.167 --> 51:45.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIE GOLDSTICKER: I hear you
say so many
other things about being a role
model in your

51:45.836 --> 51:50.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community, wanting to be this
and that and
wanting to bring something
positive to Flint

51:50.040 --> 51:51.008 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and all of that.

51:51.041 --> 51:52.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANTHONY BARTKOWSKI: Yes.

51:52.042 --> 51:53.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That all builds on it.

51:53.344 --> 51:55.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLARESSA SHIELDS: OK.

51:55.612 --> 51:58.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I can reword that.

51:58.649 --> 51:59.717 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK.

51:59.750 --> 52:04.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JULIE GOLDSTICKER: Just
something to think
about.

52:04.822 --> 52:07.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANTHONY BARTKOWSKI: Reword that.

52:07.858 --> 52:09.293 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:09.326 --> 52:11.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLARESSA SHIELDS: I really
haven't been letting
people get in my ear.

52:11.795 --> 52:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're all like, Gabby has
this, Gabby getting
that, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby.

52:15.966 --> 52:16.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK.

52:16.934 --> 52:17.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She won a gold medal.

52:17.935 --> 52:18.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She won two of them.

52:18.936 --> 52:20.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I can't help what the society is
not doing.

52:20.437 --> 52:23.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Like, they ignore me, but they
love her.

52:23.674 --> 52:28.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Like, I can't help that.

52:28.946 --> 52:35.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If USA Boxing don't give me the
money, then
I won't -- I'm going pro.

52:35.486 --> 52:36.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I deserve what the males got.

52:36.487 --> 52:37.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I won a gold medal.

52:37.821 --> 52:42.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's no way in the world that
I shouldn't
get paid the same.

52:42.393 --> 52:44.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not about money.

52:44.094 --> 52:47.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's just about getting what you
deserve,
respect me as being a woman,
respect me as

52:47.231 --> 52:54.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being black, respect me as being
an athlete
who represented the United
States, you know?

52:54.304 --> 52:56.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what it's about.

52:56.407 --> 53:02.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You can watch the
entire "Independent
Lens" film, "T-Rex: Her Fight
for Gold."

53:02.513 --> 53:08.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's tonight on most PBS
stations or streaming
now at PBS.org.

53:08.352 --> 53:13.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online right
now: Would
a $15 minimum wage hurt the
economy?

53:13.557 --> 53:18.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On our Making Sense page, one
columnist looks
to wage hike examples in
Washington state

53:18.929 --> 53:20.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and sees little to fear.

53:20.831 --> 53:23.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:23.867 --> 53:29.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

Woodruff.
