SOUTHWEST U.S. BORDER BETWEEN

04:32.172 --> 04:34.274 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAST OCTOBER AND THIS MARCH.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REUTERS REPORTER JULIA EDWARDS,

04:35.775 --> 04:37.277 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO COVERS HOMELAND SECURITY,

04:37.277 --> 04:39.212 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BROKE THE STORY THIS WEEK, AND

04:39.212 --> 04:40.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE JOINS ME NOW FROM WASHINGTON

04:40.981 --> 04:42.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO DISCUSS IT.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIA, THESE RAIDS ARE COMING IN

04:43.950 --> 04:45.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESPONSE TO A SURGE OF PEOPLE

04:45.852 --> 04:47.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMING FROM CENTRAL AMERICA.

04:47.821 --> 04:51.291 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO'S COMING AND WHY THE SURGE?

04:51.291 --> 04:52.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO WE KNOW THAT WOMEN AND

04:52.759 --> 04:53.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHILDREN-- SOME TRAVELING

04:53.927 --> 04:55.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOGETHER, SOME CHILDREN

04:55.262 --> 04:57.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRAVELING WITHOUT A GUARDIAN--

04:57.597 --> 04:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE BEEN COMING UP FROM THE

04:59.166 --> 05:00.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THREE COUNTRIES IN CENTRAL

05:00.734 --> 05:03.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICA THEY CALL THE NORTHERN

05:03.170 --> 05:03.870 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRIANGLE.

05:03.870 --> 05:05.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WOULD BE GUATEMALA, EL

05:05.705 --> 05:07.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SALVADOR AND HONDURAS.

05:07.507 --> 05:08.808 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE ESCAPING POVERTY.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE HAS BEEN EXTREME DROUGHT

05:10.810 --> 05:12.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THAT REGION THIS YEAR AND

05:12.045 --> 05:14.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALSO ESCAPING VIOLENCE.

05:14.181 --> 05:16.650 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE DRUG CARTELS WHO HAVE

05:16.650 --> 05:18.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY MADE LIVING CONDITIONS

05:18.518 --> 05:20.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY POOR IN THESE PLACES.

05:20.654 --> 05:23.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO SINCE 2014 WE REALLY

05:23.089 --> 05:25.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEGAN TO SEE A SURGE OF PEOPLE

05:25.592 --> 05:27.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMING ACROSS THE BORDER, UP

05:27.727 --> 05:29.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGH MEXICO, TAKING VERY

05:29.896 --> 05:31.932 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DANGEROUS JOURNEYS, OFTEN PAYING

05:31.932 --> 05:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HUMAN SMUGGLERS EXORBITANT

05:33.633 --> 05:35.101 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRICES JUST TO GET THEM ACROSS

05:35.101 --> 05:36.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BORDER.

05:36.236 --> 05:37.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WE SAW A BIT OF A DIP IN

05:37.504 --> 05:39.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
2015.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.073 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND

05:40.073 --> 05:41.374 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECURITY THOUGHT THAT THEY HAD

05:41.374 --> 05:42.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE OR LESS GOTTEN THIS PROBLEM

05:42.776 --> 05:44.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDER CONTROL BY TRYING TO GET

05:44.177 --> 05:45.779 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MESSAGE BACK TO CENTRAL

05:45.779 --> 05:47.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICA THAT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

05:47.781 --> 05:48.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD NOT STAY IN THE UNITED

05:48.949 --> 05:49.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES.

05:49.849 --> 05:51.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOWEVER, AT THE END OF LAST YEAR

05:51.818 --> 05:54.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND COMING UP UNTIL ABOUT LAST

05:54.154 --> 05:55.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCH, THE LATEST NUMBERS WE

05:55.422 --> 05:56.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE AVAILABLE, THERE'S ACTUALLY

05:56.957 --> 05:58.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN A SURGE AGAIN.

05:58.491 --> 06:00.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THERE WERE RAIDS LIKE THIS IN

06:00.694 --> 06:01.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JANUARY.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THESE RAIDS THAT ARE GOING TO

06:03.663 --> 06:04.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPEN IN THE NEXT MONTH OR

06:04.564 --> 06:05.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, ALLEGEDLY GOING TO HAPPEN IN

06:05.899 --> 06:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NEXT MONTH OR SO, HOW ARE

06:06.733 --> 06:09.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY EXPECTED TO BE DIFFERENT?

06:09.302 --> 06:10.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO THE RAIDS IN JANUARY WERE

06:10.737 --> 06:13.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST OVER TWO DAYS, JANUARY 2-3,

06:13.240 --> 06:14.808 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND FOCUSED ON THREE STATES--

06:14.808 --> 06:15.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TEXAS, GEORGIA, AND NORTH

06:15.976 --> 06:17.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAROLINA.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.645 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE RAIDS ARE TO TAKE PLACE

06:18.645 --> 06:21.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVER A 30-DAY PERIOD NATIONWIDE.

06:21.748 --> 06:23.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND A DOCUMENT THAT WENT OUT TO

06:23.116 --> 06:25.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FIELD OFFICES, IT EXPLAINED

06:25.151 --> 06:26.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO EACH ENFORCEMENT FIELD OFFICE

06:26.720 --> 06:28.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE INVENTORY

06:28.822 --> 06:30.223 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF WHO WAS IN THEIR FIELD, WHO

06:30.223 --> 06:32.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAD ALREADY GOTTEN A FINAL ORDER

06:32.025 --> 06:33.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF DEPORTATION.

06:33.026 --> 06:33.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT IS A POINT THE WHITE

06:33.927 --> 06:35.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOUSE IS REALLY TRYING TO DRIVE

06:35.028 --> 06:35.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOME AS WELL.

06:35.795 --> 06:36.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

06:36.963 --> 06:37.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY GONE THROUGH THE COURT

06:37.831 --> 06:38.999 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYSTEM, THEIR CASES HAVE BEEN

06:38.999 --> 06:40.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEARD, THEY WERE NOT GRANTED

06:40.267 --> 06:42.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASYLUM AND A JUDGE HAS ORDERED

06:42.168 --> 06:44.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEM TO HAVE DEPORTATION.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN JANUARY IT WAS 121 WOMEN AND

06:46.706 --> 06:47.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHILDREN WHO WERE ARRESTED.

06:47.874 --> 06:49.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS TIME, WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE

06:49.309 --> 06:50.477 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANY MORE THAN THAT.

06:50.477 --> 06:52.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> ONCE PEOPLE ARE APPREHENDED,

06:52.279 --> 06:53.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE DO THEY GO?

06:53.780 --> 06:55.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW LONG IS THE PROCESS?

06:55.548 --> 06:57.684 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WE KNOW THAT IN JANUARY, WHEN

06:57.684 --> 06:59.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ICE AGENTS CAME TO THE DOORS OF

06:59.386 --> 07:00.887 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE FAMILIES OFTEN IN THE

07:00.887 --> 07:03.323 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EARLY MORNING HOURS, ARRESTED

07:03.323 --> 07:04.924 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEM, THEY BROUGHT THEM TO

07:04.924 --> 07:06.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DETENTION FACILITIES.

07:06.226 --> 07:08.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS ONE VERY NOTABLE ONE IN

07:08.328 --> 07:09.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DILLEY, TEXAS, WHERE WOMEN AND

07:09.929 --> 07:11.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHILDREN WERE KEPT WHERE THEY

07:11.064 --> 07:12.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD BE PROCESSED.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WAS A BIT OF A BACK AND

07:13.633 --> 07:14.701 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORTH THAT GOES ON THERE WHILE

07:14.701 --> 07:15.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE AT THE DETENTION

07:15.502 --> 07:16.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACILITY.

07:16.236 --> 07:17.137 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF THEY ARE APPROVED THEY WILL

07:17.137 --> 07:19.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE PUT ONTO PLANES AND DEPORTED

07:19.773 --> 07:20.373 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BACK.

07:20.373 --> 07:21.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE TWO CANDIDATES RUNNING

07:21.174 --> 07:23.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THE DEMOCRATIC TICKET HAVE

07:23.243 --> 07:24.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRITICIZED THE OBAMA

07:24.878 --> 07:26.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY HERE.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW DO THEY DEFEND IT?

07:28.381 --> 07:29.282 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN

07:29.282 --> 07:31.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YESTERDAY WAS ASKED HOW DO YOU

07:31.885 --> 07:32.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEFEND THE POLICY?

07:32.919 --> 07:34.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT HE STUCK TO IS IT IS IN THE

07:34.654 --> 07:37.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT'S PRIORITIES TO

07:37.557 --> 07:39.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEPORT PEOPLE WHO ARE RECENT

07:39.092 --> 07:40.994 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARRIVALS, THAT IS PEOPLE WHO

07:40.994 --> 07:42.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE ARRIVED AFTER JANUARY 1,

07:42.662 --> 07:43.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
2014.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT DATE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE

07:45.098 --> 07:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF COURSE WE SAW A SURGE START

07:46.766 --> 07:48.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AROUND 2014.

07:48.368 --> 07:49.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND AT THE SAME TIME THAT OBAMA

07:49.936 --> 07:51.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAID OUT HIS IMMIGRATION

07:51.371 --> 07:54.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXECUTIVE ACTION IN NOVEMBER OF

07:54.107 --> 07:58.078 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
2014, WE SAW THAT THERE WAS

07:58.078 --> 08:00.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANOTHER CAVEAT TO THAT, THAT

08:00.580 --> 08:02.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHILE HE WAS GOING TO PROTECT

08:02.215 --> 08:03.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME PEOPLE FROM

08:03.183 --> 08:03.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEPORTATION, THERE WERE

08:03.917 --> 08:05.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE PRIORITIES

08:05.352 --> 08:07.153 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR DEPORTATION, AND THAT WAS

08:07.153 --> 08:09.322 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRIMINAL ALIENS AND ALSO NEW

08:09.322 --> 08:10.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARRIVALS.

08:10.056 --> 08:11.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S SORT OF PART OF A STRATEGY

08:11.257 --> 08:12.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF WE CAN'T DEPORT EVERYONE

08:12.759 --> 08:14.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE, THAT IS 11 MILLION PEOPLE.

08:14.961 --> 08:16.830 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WE WANT TO TRY TO SECURE

08:16.830 --> 08:19.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUR BORDERS AND SAY NO, YOU

08:19.432 --> 08:21.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN'T COME TO THE U.S. ILLEGALLY

08:21.267 --> 08:22.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND EXPECT TO SAY.

PATIENTS TO DO WHAT THEY CAN TO

12:52.538 --> 12:54.374 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AVOID MOSQUITO BITES.

12:54.374 --> 12:55.108 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

COMMUNITY'S VERY POOR.

12:56.676 --> 12:57.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE NOT

12:57.810 --> 12:59.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY AFFORDABLE TO THEM.

12:59.912 --> 13:00.613 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

13:06.019 --> 13:07.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY SHOULD USE SCREENS AND THEY

13:07.120 --> 13:08.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE AIR

13:10.323 --> 13:11.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

AFFORDABLE TO OUR COMMUNITY,

13:12.558 --> 13:13.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

PLACES.

20:34.433 --> 20:36.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE GOAL HERE IN LIBYA IS

20:36.335 --> 20:38.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY TO HELP ENHANCE U.S.

THE GROUND.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.341 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE IDEA IS THAT THESE SMALL

20:42.341 --> 20:44.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NUMBERS OF AMERICANS SPECIAL

20:44.710 --> 20:46.779 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPERATION FORCES WILL SORT

20:46.779 --> 20:47.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGH THE FACTIONS AND

20:47.847 --> 20:50.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IDENTIFY POTENTIAL RECIPIENTS OF

AMERICAN SUPPORT IN THE FUTURE.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

STATES, THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

20:54.820 --> 20:56.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS

20:56.255 --> 20:58.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
READY, IF THEY DO DECIDE TO

20:58.290 --> 21:00.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAUNCH AN EXPANDED OPERATION IN

21:00.392 --> 21:02.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIBYA, THAT THEY HAVE PARTNER

21:02.261 --> 21:03.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THEY GO IN AND DO THE FIGHTING.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> FROM THIS STRATEGY, WHAT

21:08.134 --> 21:10.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

FROM FIGHTING ISIS IN IRAQ AND

21:12.905 --> 21:15.207 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYRIA?

21:15.207 --> 21:15.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

PARTNER ON THE GROUND.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT JUST A CAPABLE MILITARY

21:22.214 --> 21:24.016 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTNER BUT ALSO A PARTNER
