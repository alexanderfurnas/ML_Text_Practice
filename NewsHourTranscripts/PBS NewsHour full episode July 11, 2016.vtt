GWEN IFILL: Good
evening. I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:06.540 --> 00:09.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: American tragedies,
protests across the U.S., as
turmoil

00:13.881 --> 00:18.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
over race and justice
shake the nation.

00:18.218 --> 00:23.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead: our
Politics Monday duo take on how
racial tensions could shape

00:23.624 --> 00:28.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the presidential race, plus
looking ahead to vice president
picks and a big expected

00:28.662 --> 00:30.497 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
endorsement.

00:30.497 --> 00:35.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And we start our
series The End of AIDS in San
Francisco, where the country's

00:35.936 --> 00:41.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most ambitious campaign to
control the disease faces very
real challenges.

00:41.074 --> 00:46.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KENNETH GROSENBACH, HIV Patient:
I'm not really being too much on
the responsible end for

00:46.146 --> 00:52.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my meds or for my relationship.
I am just trying to make it day
by day.

00:52.686 --> 00:59.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:59.726 --> 01:04.064 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:04.064 --> 01:13.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The nation is still
grappling tonight with a series
of tragedies, recent

01:13.640 --> 01:18.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
police killings of black men,
and the sniper attack in Dallas.

01:18.412 --> 01:27.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It follows a long weekend of
crowds confronting police and of
mass arrests. Protesters are

01:27.487 --> 01:33.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
taking to the streets across the
country. But in Dallas, the
anger is tempered by grief

01:33.860 --> 01:38.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for the five officers
killed Thursday night.

01:38.298 --> 01:42.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Police Chief David Brown said
today he is running on fumes.

01:42.636 --> 01:47.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROWN, Dallas Police
Chief: My brain is fried. The
memorization it takes to run

01:47.674 --> 01:53.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a major city police department
just on a normal process day
with all things that happen is

01:53.480 --> 01:57.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
overwhelming. So this
transpiring along with the
normal things that are
continuing to happen

01:57.184 --> 02:00.754 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
in the city is
difficult at best.

02:00.754 --> 02:04.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Doctors who tried to
save Thursday's victims grew
emotional at a hospital news

02:04.291 --> 02:06.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
conference today.

02:06.693 --> 02:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. BRIAN WILLIAMS, Parkland
Memorial Hospital: This killing,
it has to stop, black men dying

02:12.866 --> 02:19.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and being forgotten, people
retaliating against the people
that are sworn to defend us. We

02:19.439 --> 02:23.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have to come together
and end all this.

02:23.410 --> 02:30.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Meanwhile,
detectives are reviewing more
than 170 hours of body camera
video,

02:30.417 --> 02:36.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plus 300 witness and officer
statements. They're searching
for more background on Micah
Johnson,

02:36.456 --> 02:41.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the gunman who opened fire
during an otherwise peaceful
protest.

02:41.762 --> 02:47.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His parents told TheBlaze Web
site today that his time in the
Army Reserve wasn't what he

02:47.667 --> 02:53.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thought it would be. They say he
changed from a fun-loving
extrovert into a hermit. Johnson

02:53.940 --> 02:58.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
died after a lengthy
standoff with police.

02:58.412 --> 03:02.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chief Brown said today he has no
regrets about the decision to
kill him with a robot-delivered

03:02.115 --> 03:03.850 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bomb.

03:03.850 --> 03:08.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROWN: We knew through
negotiations this was the
suspect, because he was asking,

03:08.889 --> 03:14.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how many did he get? And he was
telling us how many more he
wanted to kill. This wasn't

03:14.394 --> 03:19.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an ethical dilemma for
me. I would do it again.

03:19.733 --> 03:25.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In Baton Rouge,
Louisiana, authorities arrested
nearly 200 protesters
demonstrating

03:25.705 --> 03:32.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the killing of Alton
Sterling, captured on video last
week, apparently by two
officers.

03:32.879 --> 03:36.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Among those arrested, prominent
Black Lives Matter activist
DeRay McKesson, who was released

03:36.883 --> 03:38.518 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sunday.

03:38.518 --> 03:41.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DERAY MCKESSON, Activist: The
only people that were violent
last Saturday night were

03:41.021 --> 03:45.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the Baton Rouge Police
Department. The protesters
remain peaceful both here and
across the country.

03:45.959 --> 03:50.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Again, I remain deeply
disappointed in the Baton Rouge
Police Department.

03:50.230 --> 03:56.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Last night, Baton
Rouge officers in riot gear kept
protesters from entering

03:56.103 --> 04:04.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Interstate 110 with what
activists described as
heavy-handed tactics. Hundreds
also marched

04:04.845 --> 04:10.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the weekend in St. Paul,
Minnesota, where picture was
shot to death during a traffic

04:10.083 --> 04:13.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stop; 21 officers were
injured Saturday night.

04:13.820 --> 04:16.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Today, city leaders said
they were caught off guard.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLES COLEMAN, Mayor of St.
Paul, Minnesota: The folks that
were out there will all tell

04:18.925 --> 04:24.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you that the restraint that our
officers showed was second to
none, but at some point when

04:24.397 --> 04:27.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our officers are being bombarded
by concrete and rebar, to the
point where they are being

04:27.534 --> 04:29.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
injured, we need to respond.

04:29.569 --> 04:34.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But community
activist Robin Hickman said she
wasn't surprised at all.

04:34.608 --> 04:38.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBIN HICKMAN, Activist: We
don't have relationships with
our young people, our people who
are

04:38.011 --> 04:44.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just fed up, just have no hope.
That's what you're going to get.

04:44.651 --> 04:49.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Demonstrators also
tried to block highways in
Memphis and Los Angeles. Back

04:49.322 --> 04:54.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Dallas, police Chief Brown
had a message today for
protesters around the country.

04:54.294 --> 05:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROWN: Become a part of
the solution. Serve your
communities. Don't be a part of

05:00.700 --> 05:09.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the problem. We're hiring. We're
hiring. Get off that protest
line and put an application

05:09.709 --> 05:15.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in. And we will put you in your
neighborhood and we will help
you resolve some of the problems

05:15.448 --> 05:17.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you're protesting about.

05:17.717 --> 05:22.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: President Obama will
travel to Dallas tomorrow for a
citywide interfaith

05:22.889 --> 05:27.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
service, and meet with victims'
families. He will be joined by
Vice President Biden,

05:27.661 --> 05:33.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as well as former President
George W. Bush, and his wife,
Laura.

05:33.099 --> 05:38.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Later, Dallas officials
announced funerals for the five
officers will begin on
Wednesday.

05:38.605 --> 05:42.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will return to Dallas and to
the newly recharged national
debate over policing and

05:42.876 --> 05:46.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
race after the news summary.

05:46.012 --> 05:51.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There's been yet
another deadly incident with
police, this time in Michigan.

05:51.017 --> 05:57.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two bailiffs were shot dead
today at a courthouse in St.
Joseph, 200 miles west of
Detroit.

05:57.057 --> 06:01.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The local sheriff says the
gunman was killed as well. A
deputy was wounded, along with

06:01.928 --> 06:05.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one other person, and the
complex was put on lockdown.

06:05.865 --> 06:10.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Republican
presidential candidate Donald
Trump called today for greater
support

06:10.503 --> 06:16.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for police, labeling himself the
law and order candidate. Trump
campaigned in Virginia Beach,

06:16.409 --> 06:20.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Virginia, and addressed the
sniper killing of the officers
in Dallas.

06:20.413 --> 06:24.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: America's police and
law enforcement personnel

06:24.317 --> 06:31.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are what separates civilization
from total chaos and the
destruction of our country as

06:31.524 --> 06:38.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we know it. It's time for our
hostility against our police and
against all members of law

06:38.198 --> 06:43.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
enforcement to end and end
immediately, right now.

06:43.637 --> 06:48.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Trump also talked
about killings of black men by
police, and said -- quote

06:48.441 --> 06:53.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- "Everyone will be protected
equally and justly without
prejudice."

06:53.179 --> 06:57.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Democrat Hillary
Clinton's campaign confirmed
primary rival Bernie Sanders
will

06:57.784 --> 07:01.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
appear with her in New
Hampshire tomorrow.

07:01.054 --> 07:06.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The race to be
Britain's next prime minister
ended abruptly today. Ruling

07:06.026 --> 07:11.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Conservatives formally chose
Home Secretary Theresa May to be
their leader after her sole

07:11.064 --> 07:17.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
remaining rival, Andrea Leadsom,
dropped out of the running. May
called for unity, and

07:17.003 --> 07:22.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
laid out her, priorities
starting with heeding voters'
wishes to quit the European
Union.

07:22.008 --> 07:27.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THERESA MAY, British Home
Secretary: Brexit means Brexit,
and we're going to make a
success

07:27.614 --> 07:34.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of it. Second, we need to unite
our country, and, third, we need
a strong, new, positive

07:34.220 --> 07:37.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
vision for the future
of our country.

07:37.590 --> 07:42.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: May will be the
second woman to lead Britain,
after Margaret Thatcher,

07:42.595 --> 07:46.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and she won't have to wait long.
After today's turn of events,
Prime Minister David Cameron

07:46.099 --> 07:49.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
announced that he will
step down on Wednesday.

07:49.569 --> 07:55.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In South Sudan, the
president and vice president
called for a cease-fire,

07:55.008 --> 08:00.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after five days of renewed
fighting between their forces.
Thousands fled the capital,

08:00.480 --> 08:06.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Juba, fearing the civil war that
ended last year is resuming.
Government forces attacked

08:06.086 --> 08:11.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a U.N. peacekeeping base and a
camp sheltering civilians. At
least two U.N. peacekeepers

08:11.024 --> 08:14.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from China and a local
U.N. staffer were killed.

08:14.594 --> 08:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The United States
will send another 560 troops to
Iraq. It's the second

08:20.533 --> 08:25.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
increase in three months, and is
aimed at helping the Iraqis
recapture Mosul from the

08:25.672 --> 08:31.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Islamic State group, also known
as ISIS or ISIL. Defense
Secretary Ash Carter announced

08:31.111 --> 08:35.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the move in Baghdad today, where
he met with U.S. commanders and
Prime Minister Haider

08:35.081 --> 08:36.816 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
al-Abadi.

08:36.816 --> 08:40.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ASHTON CARTER, U.S. Defense
Secretary: At every step of this
campaign, we have generated

08:40.854 --> 08:47.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and seized additional
opportunities to hasten ISIL's
lasting defeat. And with these
additional

08:47.694 --> 08:53.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. forces I'm describing
today, we will bring unique
capabilities to the campaign

08:53.299 --> 08:58.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and provide critical support to
the Iraqi forces at a key moment
in the fight.

08:58.171 --> 09:01.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The troop
increase will bring the total
U.S. deployment in Iraq to more

09:01.241 --> 09:03.977 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than 4,600.

09:03.977 --> 09:10.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Back in this
country, upbeat economic data
helped Wall Street. The Dow
Jones industrial

09:10.049 --> 09:16.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
average gained 80 points to
close near 18227. The Nasdaq
rose almost 32 points, and the

09:16.022 --> 09:20.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
S&amp;P 500 added seven, to
finish at a record high.

09:20.860 --> 09:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And national
basketball superstar Tim Duncan
is calling it a career, after 19

09:27.000 --> 09:31.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years with the San Antonio Spurs
and five championships. He's
considered one of the

09:31.938 --> 09:36.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
greatest power forwards ever,
and has long been the face of
the franchise. With him,

09:36.042 --> 09:39.879 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the team never
missed the playoffs.

09:39.879 --> 09:43.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also today, Jordan Spieth became
the latest top golfer to
withdraw from the Olympics in

09:43.950 --> 09:47.187 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Brazil, citing the Zika virus.

09:47.187 --> 09:51.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Still to come on the
"NewsHour": a black Dallas
police officer's message to

09:51.958 --> 09:58.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other police officers and to
President Obama; it's Politics
Monday, what to expect in the

09:58.431 --> 10:02.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
week leading up to the
Republican nominating
convention; NATO's tentative
support for Ukraine

10:02.902 --> 10:10.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
against Russia; and much more.

10:10.243 --> 10:22.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The past week has
underscored just how deep some
of the dividing lines are

10:22.922 --> 10:28.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the country, and none more so
than when it comes to law
enforcement and criminal
justice.

10:28.328 --> 10:33.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
African-American police are
walking an especially difficult
tightrope.

10:33.099 --> 10:36.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan spoke this
weekend with Lieutenant Thomas
Glover. He's the president of
the Black

10:36.936 --> 10:39.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Police Association
of Greater Dallas.

10:39.739 --> 10:42.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What's
happened to this city in the
last couple of days?

10:42.909 --> 10:44.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LT. THOMAS GLOVER,, President,
Black Police Association of
Greater Dallas: I don't know.

10:44.344 --> 10:53.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's symptomatic of a
move that may be sweeping the
country. It's symbolic of

10:53.286 --> 10:57.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people crying out to get the
people in charge to listen to
them, and I think we will have

10:57.690 --> 11:00.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to listen this time.

11:00.326 --> 11:04.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: These were
your fellow officers. These are
people you served on the force
with,

11:04.364 --> 11:06.799 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your friends.

11:06.799 --> 11:11.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LT. THOMAS GLOVER: Yes. One of
them was a subordinate of mine
for about a year three

11:11.271 --> 11:16.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years ago, and I know him
and love him dearly.

11:16.109 --> 11:25.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it's -- again, I am
extremely saddened by the fact
that five officers lost

11:25.318 --> 11:32.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their lives in the city of
Dallas, and it took this to get
attention to a problem that

11:32.292 --> 11:37.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people have been screaming about
for years. Violence toward the
police is not the answer.

11:37.230 --> 11:41.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It has never been the answer,
and it will never be the answer.

11:41.401 --> 11:46.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Are the
concerns of African-American
communities in the United States
right now

11:46.739 --> 11:50.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against police departments and
how the police are treating
them, are they legitimate?

11:50.009 --> 11:54.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LT. THOMAS GLOVER: Yes,
I think so, definitely.

11:54.247 --> 12:01.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would be a fool to sit here
and deny that. I have been
pulled over and profiled. I used

12:01.621 --> 12:07.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to own a vehicle that had
22-inch rims. It was totally
black, blacked out with
dark-tinted

12:07.293 --> 12:11.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
windows, and over the four-year
period that I drove it, I
probably got stopped a
half-a-dozen

12:11.030 --> 12:17.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
times, and most of it was five,
six, eight blocks from my
church.

12:17.670 --> 12:24.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you state that they are not
legitimate, people want to paint
you as being anti-police,

12:24.711 --> 12:30.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anti-law enforcement. Well, I'm
pro-police, I'm pro-law
enforcement, and I'm anti-police

12:30.750 --> 12:38.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
misconduct. I am anti-police
mistreatment. I am anti-police
discrimination.

12:38.024 --> 12:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When there is misconduct, that
officer needs to be, I will use
the word crucified, because

12:47.066 --> 12:54.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when one officer, whether it be
in a small town in New Jersey or
a major city on the

12:54.307 --> 13:00.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
West Coast or a mid-sized city
in Central United States,
anytime an officer commits

13:00.513 --> 13:07.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
misconduct, it reflects what I
have to deal with, what almost a
million other police officers

13:07.020 --> 13:09.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have to deal with
around the country.

13:09.122 --> 13:14.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: When you see a
video or videos like the ones
that came out this week,

13:14.927 --> 13:18.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as a member of the
African-American community, that
could have been a member of your
family,

13:18.531 --> 13:19.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what goes through you?

13:19.732 --> 13:22.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LT. THOMAS GLOVER: I'm
appalled that it happens.

13:22.902 --> 13:28.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will be honest. I didn't cry,
the first one I saw that came
out of Baton Rouge. I

13:28.341 --> 13:34.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was very concerned. But the
second one that I saw in
Minnesota, I shed tears. I was
sitting

13:34.080 --> 13:38.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the sofa in my house, and I
began to cry and boo -- just
like I knew the person, because

13:38.985 --> 13:45.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I knew it was symbolic of a
major problem that we have in
this country.

13:45.124 --> 13:51.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As an African-American police
officer, every day that you
serve, it's almost like you're

13:51.197 --> 13:59.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
serving two masters. And I hate
to be so straightforward. Many
people expect us from the blue
side,

13:59.972 --> 14:07.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I mean law enforcement, to
be quiet, to walk a tightrope,
and to just be indifferent.

14:07.213 --> 14:12.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the other hand, in your
community, you are expected to
make a difference. I know

14:12.618 --> 14:17.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in all my years, I have heard
it, and now I have people
calling me saying, Glover, we

14:17.390 --> 14:22.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
told you so. You see it? A guy
got shot in the back running
away from a police officer,

14:22.829 --> 14:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and he never would have been in
trouble had not someone covertly
recorded it on a cell

14:27.066 --> 14:29.736 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
phone video.

14:29.736 --> 14:36.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all I can do is say, yes,
you're right. We become adept at
doing both of them very

14:36.909 --> 14:43.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well. We do the police job
extremely well, and we live in
our community extremely well,

14:43.349 --> 14:47.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but, sometimes, and oftentimes,
when you talk to
African-American police
officers, it's

14:47.820 --> 14:51.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of the most grueling and
taxing things that you can do as
a human.

14:51.891 --> 14:59.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you saw it in a video that
went viral on Facebook this week
where the African-American

14:59.398 --> 15:05.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mother, who was a member of a
police department in Ohio
somewhere near Cleveland, a
seven-minute

15:05.004 --> 15:10.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
video of her screaming. And she
is vehemently and emphatically
denouncing the fact that

15:10.643 --> 15:17.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she thinks very poorly -- and I
do, too -- of someone who
polices our community, whether

15:17.049 --> 15:23.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they be black, pink, purple or
green, and are so full of fear,
so full of fear, that

15:23.790 --> 15:26.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they mistreat people.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: When the
president comes, what do you
want to say to him? What do you

15:28.161 --> 15:30.663 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
want him to do?

15:30.663 --> 15:36.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LT. THOMAS GLOVER: Mr.
President, do the right thing.
I'm telling you, as a 35-year
African-American

15:36.402 --> 15:41.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
police officer, that there are
problems in the way we police in
the black community.

15:41.941 --> 15:46.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think you need to take
that charge, Mr. President, and
do whatever is necessary

15:46.078 --> 15:52.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to incite Congress to pass laws
that would allow us to rid the
law enforcement and the

15:52.718 --> 15:56.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
police profession of
these type of people.

15:56.322 --> 16:01.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we get
several views about this moment,
some of the dividing lines and

16:01.093 --> 16:04.630 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
calls on all sides for change.

16:04.630 --> 16:08.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kasim Reed is the mayor of
Atlanta. He has been dealing
with protests throughout the

16:08.701 --> 16:13.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weekend. The Reverend Jesse
Jackson, he's founder and
president of the Rainbow/PUSH

16:13.606 --> 16:19.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coalition. He's one of the
country's most well-known civil
rights leaders. DeRay McKesson,

16:19.011 --> 16:24.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's an activist co-founder of
Black Lives Matter. He was
arrested and released after

16:24.417 --> 16:29.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
protests in Baton Rouge this
weekend. And Julian Zelizer,
he's a professor of history

16:29.689 --> 16:34.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at Princeton University. He is
the author of "The Fierce
Urgency of Now," a book about

16:34.493 --> 16:37.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the battles over civil rights
and the Great Society.

16:37.663 --> 16:40.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we welcome all of
you to the program.

16:40.366 --> 16:44.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let me start with
you, DeRay McKesson.

16:44.170 --> 16:52.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Listening to Lieutenant -- we
just heard from Lieutenant Tom
Glover in Dallas. How divided

16:52.478 --> 16:57.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is this country, based on what
you have seen there in Louisiana
over the weekend? Where

16:57.884 --> 17:00.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are we right now?

17:00.286 --> 17:03.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DERAY MCKESSON, Co-Founder,
Black Lives Matter: So, I don't
think that any of the division

17:03.055 --> 17:05.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or the tension is new.

17:05.625 --> 17:09.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is new is that we're
finally having a public
conversation about this stuff.
So when

17:09.695 --> 17:13.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we think about the protests over
the last 22 months, they have
forced these issues of

17:13.332 --> 17:18.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
race, racism, criminal justice
to the forefront, specifically
focused on police violence.

17:18.537 --> 17:22.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm hopeful that more police
officers and more police chiefs
and police unions will

17:22.375 --> 17:26.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
come out acknowledging that the
culture of the police
departments are broken and that

17:26.379 --> 17:30.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there has to be change, that the
police don't get to operate
under a shadow justice system

17:30.616 --> 17:33.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that we can live in a world
where the police don't kill
people.

17:33.252 --> 17:38.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Mayor Kasim
Reed, you were dealing with
protesters, as we said,

17:38.624 --> 17:44.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Atlanta over the weekend.
What did you see? And do you see
these conversations going

17:44.897 --> 17:48.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on across the country and in
your city making a difference
right now?

17:48.401 --> 17:52.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KASIM REED, Mayor of Atlanta,
Georgia: What I saw was an
expression of grief and pain

17:52.338 --> 17:57.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and frustration that
needed to be addressed.

17:57.910 --> 18:05.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I saw that people's First
Amendment rights needed to be
respected. We had 15,000
protesters

18:05.117 --> 18:11.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since Thursday evening through
today. And I couldn't be prouder
of our law enforcement

18:11.791 --> 18:17.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
officials, the Atlanta Police
Department and the Georgia State
Patrol. We have had peaceful

18:17.096 --> 18:21.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
protests. We have had
minimal damage to property.

18:21.500 --> 18:27.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that we have had
respect on both sides of the
conversation. And we have had

18:27.039 --> 18:33.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
less than 25 people arrested. We
take great pride in Atlanta in
being the home of Dr.

18:33.579 --> 18:38.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Martin Luther King and a number
of other civil rights leaders in
the United States, like

18:38.417 --> 18:42.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ambassador Andrew Young and
Congressman John Lewis. And
that's the way we approached the

18:42.688 --> 18:44.523 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
protests.

18:44.523 --> 18:48.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that it made all of
the difference in how the
weekend turned out.

18:48.694 --> 18:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Reverend Jesse
Jackson, from the perspective
that you have from going back

18:53.666 --> 18:58.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the civil rights movement of
the 1960s, how do you look on
these protests of today

18:58.871 --> 19:03.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and how much progress do
you see having been made?

19:03.476 --> 19:05.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. JESSE JACKSON, FOUNDER,
Rainbow/PUSH Coalition: Well,
the protests are very
legitimate,

19:05.878 --> 19:10.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because we're saying
that we matter.

19:10.783 --> 19:19.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When Trayvon Martin is killed
and the killer walks away, when
Rodney King is beaten and

19:19.325 --> 19:24.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is own camera and those who beat
him walk away, when Garner is
killed and they walk

19:24.397 --> 19:29.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
away, it's not just the act, but
the lack of consequences, when
violence occurs upon

19:29.568 --> 19:32.371 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
our people. And
that's a pattern.

19:32.371 --> 19:39.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a combination here, not
just police. Police --
federation are police who
control

19:39.145 --> 19:44.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the discipline, as well as
states' attorneys and judges,
and now prisons for profit. The

19:44.750 --> 19:49.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whole judicial system has come
down on us and it's not right,
it's not fair. And the

19:49.321 --> 19:51.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
protests are legitimate.

19:51.223 --> 19:55.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will only say that violence
takes away our moral authority.
We have the moral high road,

19:55.027 --> 19:58.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and keep that high road.

19:58.531 --> 20:01.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Julian Zelizer,
you are watching all this as
well. You have written about
this

20:01.367 --> 20:03.869 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a great deal.

20:03.869 --> 20:07.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you see the country coming
together in any regard at this
point? Or do we still have

20:07.940 --> 20:10.076 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
a long way to go
before that happens?

20:10.076 --> 20:12.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIAN ZELIZER, Princeton
University: We have a long way
to go.

20:12.778 --> 20:18.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're in a very divisive,
political moment right now, and
one of the possibilities is

20:18.851 --> 20:25.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the response to this is not
to find solutions to the
problems of policing that we
have seen,

20:25.224 --> 20:31.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but to move in a very different
direction. 1968, Richard Nixon
pushed the country toward

20:31.197 --> 20:35.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
law and order, rather than
reforming the criminal justice
system, and there is a
possibility

20:35.601 --> 20:38.437 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
we see the same
thing happen today.

20:38.437 --> 20:42.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think the divisions are
real, they're deep, and I think
it's not unlike some of

20:42.241 --> 20:44.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what we saw in the late '60s.

20:44.310 --> 20:48.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: DeRay McKesson --
go ahead. Were you just
speaking?

20:48.781 --> 20:50.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REV. JESSE JACKSON: I was about
to make a point here that...

20:50.850 --> 20:52.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Reverend
Jackson, go ahead.

20:52.118 --> 20:54.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REV. JESSE JACKSON: ... it's
not just policing poverty.

20:54.787 --> 21:01.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We would ask for a White House
conference on policing, but also
on poverty, the racial

21:01.293 --> 21:05.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
disparity and the plan for
reconstruction. Changing -- if
you have a size 10 shoe in

21:05.865 --> 21:11.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a size 8 foot, it's not a
conversation. You need a shoe
that fits the foot.

21:11.237 --> 21:15.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Our poverty is twice the
national average, number one
infant mortality, number one in

21:15.508 --> 21:20.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
short life expectancy, lack of
access to capital and industry.
We have not recovered from the

21:20.412 --> 21:23.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
economic crisis yet. We
need reconstruction.

21:23.215 --> 21:28.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me use
that as an opportunity to turn
back to DeRay McKesson

21:28.487 --> 21:33.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and ask you, what is it that the
Black Lives Matter movement, as
you see it, is looking

21:33.859 --> 21:35.761 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for?

21:35.761 --> 21:43.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Are you looking for --
specifically for police reform,
and where does it fit on the
spectrum

21:43.636 --> 21:48.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between that and the much bigger
goals that Reverend Jackson is
talking about?

21:48.374 --> 21:52.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DERAY MCKESSON: So, Reverend
Jackson is right that there are
so many things that we need

21:52.578 --> 21:55.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to focus on. I think that what
is true is that what got people
on the streets in August

21:55.714 --> 21:59.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of 2014, when the movement was
born, was the death of Mike
Brown.

21:59.985 --> 22:03.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that -- there is something
visceral about the violence of
the police, that it continues

22:03.522 --> 22:06.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be something that people
organize around, and that is
central. That does not mean it's

22:06.825 --> 22:10.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the only thing that people focus
on. People are doing incredible
work around making sure

22:10.429 --> 22:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we close the racial wealth
gap, on education, and that work
continues.

22:14.500 --> 22:18.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the beauty of the
movement in a sense, is that it
wasn't -- there's no one,

22:18.370 --> 22:22.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two, or three founders of the
movement. I'm certainly not a
founder of any space, but

22:22.308 --> 22:26.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am one of many people doing
work in the space and we see so
many people right now

22:26.478 --> 22:31.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
finding their voice. We saw the
protesters in Atlanta
beautifully raising issues and

22:31.584 --> 22:35.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
being really clear about
solutions, and in Chicago, Baton
Rouge, and so many other places.

22:35.588 --> 22:39.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think it is rooted in the
violence of the police right
now, because the police kill

22:39.892 --> 22:43.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nearly three people -- have
killed nearly three people
already in 2016. But there are

22:43.896 --> 22:45.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people doing really good work
around the racial wealth gap and
education and so many other

22:45.497 --> 22:47.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
things.

22:47.733 --> 22:53.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mayor Reed, what
we're hearing there is that the
goals -- that there's a

22:53.472 --> 22:58.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
long list of goals of many
different kinds, and that -- I
think we're hearing about a

22:58.177 --> 23:01.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
movement that's more
decentralized than what we saw
during the civil rights
movements of

23:01.413 --> 23:02.915 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the '60s.

23:02.915 --> 23:07.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Does that mean it's more likely
to be successful or not?

23:07.886 --> 23:13.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KASIM REED: I think it's likely
to be successful because,
despite the fact that the
country

23:13.425 --> 23:18.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is in a tough time, we continue
to make forward movement.

23:18.230 --> 23:24.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, for example, in the city of
Atlanta, we have had our
officers have bias training.

23:24.603 --> 23:29.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So one of the issues that Black
Lives Matter's members and
others have raised is this bias

23:29.875 --> 23:35.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that many of us are
frequently unaware of.

23:35.914 --> 23:41.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The population of our police
department really mirrors our
city's population. That's
another

23:41.520 --> 23:48.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issue that has been repeatedly
raised. Last year, in 1.6
million interactions with the

23:48.460 --> 23:54.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
public, our police officers
fired their weapons less than 10
times.

23:54.099 --> 23:59.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many of the changes and reforms
that we have experienced is
because we are actually
listening

23:59.605 --> 24:05.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the protesters and to others
and trying to respond. We have a
citizen review board

24:05.311 --> 24:11.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with subpoena power. So the
point I'm making is, is that it
is a very tough time, but
leaders

24:11.550 --> 24:17.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are forward-thinking and
want America to be a better
version of itself are listening

24:17.356 --> 24:23.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very closely and trying to move
without having to respond to a
terrible tragedy.

24:23.996 --> 24:24.797 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

24:24.797 --> 24:26.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
REV. JESSE JACKSON: I'm
sorry. Forgive me.

24:26.999 --> 24:30.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me just --
just a second, Reverend Jackson.

24:30.469 --> 24:34.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to ask Julian Zelizer, is
there enough listening going on,
though? Because there's

24:34.640 --> 24:39.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of conversation over the
weekend about there are
different conversations going on

24:39.278 --> 24:46.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the white community and the
black community and together,
but is there enough talking

24:46.118 --> 24:50.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going on among people who may
disagree and may come together
as a result of what they're

24:50.556 --> 24:53.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hearing from each other?

24:53.125 --> 24:58.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIAN ZELIZER: Well, listen,
the Black Lives Matter movement
has made incredible progress

24:58.263 --> 25:02.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in bringing these issues on to
the table, combined with the
realities people see through

25:02.568 --> 25:05.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the social media.

25:05.604 --> 25:11.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But we do live in a very
fragmented political
environment, where, before this
issue, people

25:11.610 --> 25:17.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't listen to each other. They
watch media that reflects their
own positions, and they

25:17.182 --> 25:21.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even commute -- have communities
with like-minded individuals,
and the parties are very, very

25:21.186 --> 25:22.988 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
polarized.

25:22.988 --> 25:28.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I do worry about some of the
limits that the movement might
have. I will just add the

25:28.994 --> 25:36.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kerner Commission in 1968 put
forward a lot of these issues,
not only policing, but
unemployment

25:36.702 --> 25:42.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and segregation. The black power
movement put these issues on the
table. And, unfortunately,

25:42.574 --> 25:46.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our political systems didn't
respond. So, that's a warning
for what could happen today.

25:46.712 --> 25:50.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to ask
each one of you in just a few
seconds, how much -- what do

25:50.883 --> 25:53.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you want to hear from President
Obama tomorrow when he goes to
Dallas and how much difference

25:53.552 --> 25:55.621 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
will that make?

25:55.621 --> 25:57.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Reverend Jackson?

25:57.790 --> 26:01.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REV. JESSE JACKSON: First of
all, the killer didn't come out
of the civil rights movement.

26:01.393 --> 26:05.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That was a strategy alien
to the way we functioned.

26:05.764 --> 26:11.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secondly, we need some real
renew -- there is a date,
November the 8th. And Trump has

26:11.370 --> 26:16.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thrown down his gauntlet, saying
law and order, trying to imitate
Nixon.

26:16.141 --> 26:21.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We must choose reconciliation
over retaliation and revenge. I
hope President Obama will
address,

26:21.713 --> 26:27.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
underline the police issue, the
issue of jobs, jobs training and
economic reconstruction

26:27.786 --> 26:35.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the race disparity. Race
disparity is real. It is real.
And it's growing.

26:35.360 --> 26:38.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, we
are, unfortunately, out of time.
We hope to come back to all of

26:38.630 --> 26:41.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you in the very near future.

26:41.667 --> 26:47.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reverend Jackson, Mayor Kasim
Reed, DeRay McKesson, Julian
Zelizer, we thank you all.

26:47.739 --> 26:59.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIAN ZELIZER: Thank you.

26:59.685 --> 27:07.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Public debates
automatically turn political, as
the presidential campaigns enter

27:07.626 --> 27:11.163 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their pre-conventional stretch.

27:11.163 --> 27:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joining us, as they do every
Monday, to discuss the issues
that are shaping voters' choices

27:14.933 --> 27:20.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are Tamara Keith of NPR and Amy
Walter of The Cook Political
Report.

27:20.172 --> 27:23.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's compare and assess what we
have seen happen in the last
several days. It's been

27:23.942 --> 27:30.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an amazing period in our nation,
and we have seen the way Donald
Trump handled it. We saw

27:30.415 --> 27:34.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the way Hillary Clinton handled
it. How do you compare those two
things, Amy?

27:34.286 --> 27:37.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Well, I think how I
think there is how they dealt

27:37.789 --> 27:43.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
with it in the immediate
aftermath, which was both were
very sort of nonpolitical. Both

27:43.595 --> 27:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
called for unity. Both called
for sort of ratcheting down the
rhetoric.

27:48.233 --> 27:53.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, though, you saw Donald
Trump talk a little bit more
about this. And if you had

27:53.005 --> 27:56.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to pick the difference of how
Donald Trump is talking about
this and Hillary Clinton

27:56.241 --> 28:02.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is talking about this, she made
a talk at a church this weekend.
She talked about bringing

28:02.047 --> 28:07.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
America together. That's been
really the theme of her campaign
is bringing Americans together.

28:07.452 --> 28:13.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What Donald Trump talked about
is how law and order is what
really -- is much more central

28:13.625 --> 28:19.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to his campaign. So one is
talking about the togetherness
of Americans. The other is
saying

28:19.765 --> 28:24.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the only way to keep us from
falling apart is to have strong
law and order.

28:24.570 --> 28:29.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It sounded very reminiscent of
another Republican presidential
candidate from 1968, which
was...

28:29.441 --> 28:30.075 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Richard Nixon.

28:30.075 --> 28:32.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: ... Richard Nixon.

28:32.444 --> 28:36.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tam, it's not
insignificant where Hillary
Clinton chose to make these
comments.

28:36.448 --> 28:40.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She was speaking at the
quadrennial Conference of
African Methodist Episcopal
Church.

28:40.185 --> 28:41.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH, National
Public Radio: Right.

28:41.787 --> 28:45.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Obviously, we saw
Mother Emanuel AME Church in
Charleston was a member of that.

28:45.123 --> 28:49.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, she was speaking to an
audience which got this.

28:49.061 --> 28:53.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time, I was struck
when she said something like, we
have to learn, as white

28:53.131 --> 28:57.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people, need to start listening
to black people, which shouldn't
be a shocking idea, but somehow

28:57.736 --> 28:58.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it was taken as a big moment.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

29:00.939 --> 29:04.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the other interesting thing
about that is, it's not the
first time she's talk about

29:04.843 --> 29:09.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that. It's not the first time
she's talked about talking to
white people about their

29:09.181 --> 29:14.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
privilege or about listening,
about walking in the shoes of
other people.

29:14.353 --> 29:20.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This has actually been a theme
of her campaign for months now,
but, somehow, in that place,

29:20.993 --> 29:25.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this moment in time, it had a
different resonance than it's
had before. It got noticed.

29:25.897 --> 29:30.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, of course,
tomorrow, President Obama goes
to Dallas and we get to see him.

29:30.502 --> 29:33.171 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
I hate the term
consoler-in-chief again, because
he has to be that so often, but
that's what

29:33.171 --> 29:35.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we see happen again.

29:35.974 --> 29:39.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's talk about what else is on
the candidates' minds right now,
which is, who's going to

29:39.811 --> 29:43.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
run with them? Who is going to
be on their ticket? We have
conventions coming right up.

29:43.148 --> 29:44.650 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And are we any
closer to knowing?

29:44.650 --> 29:45.617 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Do we have any idea?

29:45.617 --> 29:48.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Next week.

29:48.286 --> 29:52.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm terrible when it comes to
predicting who the vice
president is going to be. I'm
always

29:52.124 --> 29:57.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wrong about this. And part of it
is, it's very difficult to
assess from here, and partly

29:57.029 --> 30:02.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because we get so caught up in
the poll and the strategy and
who's going to fill the gaps.

30:02.434 --> 30:06.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at the end of the day, this
is about -- I think sometimes
more important than anything

30:06.271 --> 30:07.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
else is the rapport
-- the rapport.

30:07.706 --> 30:10.075 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The rapport. Yes.

30:10.075 --> 30:14.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: The rapport -- thank
you -- the chemistry that they
have between each other.

30:14.413 --> 30:19.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that that comes across
and it's even more important in
this day and age, where

30:19.017 --> 30:23.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're going to be together and
shot at every single angle,
live-streamed, Snapchatted,

30:23.689 --> 30:27.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on television together. That is
going to come across and become
very important.

30:27.359 --> 30:31.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other piece, as we're seeing
now, that these candidates are
literally trying their

30:31.196 --> 30:36.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
V.P.s out on the trail, on
television. Who succeeds and who
fails under the sharp microscope

30:36.735 --> 30:39.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and under the spotlight?

30:39.371 --> 30:42.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Donald Trump now
today, he appeared with Chris
Christie. Not too long ago, he

30:42.908 --> 30:47.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
was with Mike Pence from
Indiana. He's basically trotting
them all out.

30:47.879 --> 30:51.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does Hillary Clinton do the same
thing, or is she just waiting to
see what he does?

30:51.483 --> 30:55.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, on Thursday,
she is campaigning with Senator
Tim Kaine of Virginia. And they

30:55.854 --> 30:58.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will be in Northern
Virginia together. He is...

30:58.323 --> 31:00.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It won't be the
first time she's done that.

31:00.358 --> 31:06.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And if you're
looking at the wager lists, he's
near the top. Who knows

31:06.098 --> 31:10.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if he's actually at the top of
her list, but in terms of the
parlor game that we're all

31:10.268 --> 31:15.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now playing, because that's what
you do this time of year, he's
near the top of the list.

31:15.040 --> 31:19.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Other people on that list are
Elizabeth Warren, the senator
from Massachusetts, who Hillary

31:19.678 --> 31:24.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton campaigned with, and
also Tom Perez, the labor
secretary, and probably five
other

31:24.449 --> 31:27.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people who I'm not mentioning.

31:27.452 --> 31:30.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That's what's
happening with Republicans.
They're putting out a whole list
of people

31:30.655 --> 31:34.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who may or may not be vetted
right now. But are there other
goals besides that for this

31:34.192 --> 31:36.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
convention coming up?

31:36.862 --> 31:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, the most
important goal, of course, for
Donald Trump is to make it

31:41.800 --> 31:45.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at least appear as if there's
some unity in this party.

31:45.570 --> 31:49.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the first hurdle he has to
overcome is this week as the
rules committee gets together.

31:49.975 --> 31:54.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's talk about that there's
going to be something of a never
Trump moment, where they

31:54.279 --> 31:56.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can unbind delegates. I don't
think that's going to happen. In
fact, I am pretty convinced

31:56.848 --> 31:59.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that's not going to happen.

31:59.217 --> 32:05.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But until that is actually over,
the talk will not die down. Once
he overcomes that

32:05.357 --> 32:08.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hurdle, the next is, what does
this convention look like? There
obviously are a lot who aren't

32:08.593 --> 32:11.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to show up, including the
last sitting Republican
presidents.

32:11.596 --> 32:14.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: The current
Republican governor.

32:14.166 --> 32:19.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Or the current
Republican governor, or the 2012
nominee for the party.

32:19.905 --> 32:24.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I don't think that that's
the bigger problem for Donald
Trump. I think it is -- his
challenge

32:24.009 --> 32:29.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has long been he's done very
well in a primary that was very
narrow focused to a certain

32:29.147 --> 32:32.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
group of voters. He has yet to
make the case to a broader group
of voters. Can he do that

32:32.350 --> 32:35.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in this convention?

32:35.420 --> 32:40.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is his second chance that
he's getting, when people are
tuning in to see, has Donald

32:40.392 --> 32:44.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump turned the corner from
primary candidate to general
candidate?

32:44.696 --> 32:49.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tomorrow in New
Hampshire on the Democratic
side, Bernie Sanders finally
shows

32:49.234 --> 32:54.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up and decides to, we think the
E-word will be used, endorse
Hillary Clinton.

32:54.639 --> 32:59.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes. Yes, the word
from Democratic sources with
knowledge of the negotiations

32:59.277 --> 33:02.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between the Sanders campaign and
the Clinton campaign is that
this is, in fact, an endorsement

33:02.614 --> 33:05.517 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
event.

33:05.517 --> 33:10.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders and Hillary
Clinton will be campaigning
together at a rally in
Portsmouth,

33:10.488 --> 33:18.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New Hampshire. This has been
weeks and weeks in the making.
One source tells me that the

33:18.330 --> 33:22.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaign manager for Hillary
Clinton and the campaign manager
for Bernie Sanders have been

33:22.334 --> 33:26.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
either texting or talking on the
phone every single day since
June 7.

33:26.872 --> 33:29.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Cute.
That's so high school.

33:29.374 --> 33:32.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what about the platform
committee? They actually met,
and Bernie Sanders got a couple

33:32.677 --> 33:34.346 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of things.

33:34.346 --> 33:38.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Bernie Sanders got
a lot of what he was looking
for. The platform includes

33:38.383 --> 33:42.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a $15 minimum wage, for
instance. Also, over the last
week or so, Hillary Clinton's
made

33:42.387 --> 33:45.323 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a number of policy concessions.

33:45.323 --> 33:49.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's moved closer to Bernie
Sanders. She made some
announcements on health care, as

33:49.461 --> 33:56.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well as college affordability.
So Bernie Sanders, you know,
this endorsement isn't for free.

33:56.134 --> 33:58.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bernie Sanders has been pushing
Hillary Clinton, and you can
expect that to continue beyond

33:58.770 --> 33:59.537 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tomorrow.

33:59.537 --> 34:03.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: To the
extent platforms matter.

34:03.208 --> 34:05.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Does a platform
matter, which they don't,
although I think -- good for
him.

34:05.443 --> 34:08.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He got a lot of what he wanted.

34:08.546 --> 34:12.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The most fascinating thing about
this primary has not simply been
how Sanders has pushed

34:12.417 --> 34:16.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton. I think it's
been twofold, one, how far she
has moved from the other

34:16.321 --> 34:21.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton's legacy. Right. She is
really not running as a Bill
Clinton part two. She's

34:21.393 --> 34:23.828 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
running as a Hillary Clinton.

34:23.828 --> 34:27.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she did something that Jeb
Bush and others didn't do, which
is she moved where the party

34:27.499 --> 34:30.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
went. Jeb Bush decided to stay
where his party was in the early
21st century.

34:30.035 --> 34:32.003 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: OK.

34:32.003 --> 34:35.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will see you wherever we are
at this time next week, waiting
probably still for more

34:35.106 --> 34:37.475 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
shoes to drop.

34:37.475 --> 34:44.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Amy Walter of The Cook Political
Report, Tamara Keith of NPR,
thank you both.

34:44.616 --> 34:50.322 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

34:50.322 --> 34:55.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

34:55.260 --> 34:59.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour," we
launch our series The End of
AIDS, starting with a look

34:59.030 --> 35:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at an ambitious initiative
in San Francisco.

35:02.600 --> 35:08.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first: We reported all last
week on the fault lines between
Russia and the West over

35:08.740 --> 35:15.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Russian-backed war in
Ukraine and Moscow's new,
aggressive posture against NATO.

35:15.280 --> 35:18.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Leaders of the North Atlantic
Treaty alliance met over the
weekend in Warsaw, and we go

35:18.216 --> 35:21.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to John Yang for an update.

35:21.486 --> 35:25.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: With us now to
discuss what came out of the
NATO summit and the future of
the

35:25.357 --> 35:29.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alliance is Esther Brimmer. She
has served in various roles at
the State Department.

35:29.928 --> 35:35.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most recently, she was assistant
secretary of state for
international organization
affairs.

35:35.567 --> 35:39.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's now with the Council on
Foreign Relations and teaches at
George Washington University.

35:39.137 --> 35:42.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Esther Brimmer, thanks
for joining us.

35:42.540 --> 35:46.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What would this -- this summit,
the president said it was the
most important moment for

35:46.811 --> 35:51.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NATO since the end of the Cold
War. What were the big decisions
that came out of this meeting?

35:51.649 --> 35:54.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ESTHER BRIMMER, Former State
Department Official: Indeed,
this was an extremely important
summit.

35:54.819 --> 35:59.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was an opportunity for the
leaders to demonstrate that
there was real support and

35:59.591 --> 36:06.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
backing, concrete actions to
support the Eastern allies of
the alliance. What we saw were
that

36:06.664 --> 36:09.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the United States and other
important leaders within the
alliance are showing that they

36:09.801 --> 36:14.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will commit troops
again to Europe.

36:14.372 --> 36:19.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're seeing the deployment of
battalions in those countries
that are most threatened

36:19.144 --> 36:24.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the new tensions with Russia.
And it meant that the alliance
still matters, despite the

36:24.849 --> 36:28.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
turbulence created by the Brexit
vote in the European Union.

36:28.353 --> 36:30.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Let's take
those one by one.

36:30.989 --> 36:36.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First of all, the troops being
sent to Eastern Europe, troops
once again being deployed by

36:36.327 --> 36:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NATO to deter Moscow, this is
sort of a return to the original
purpose of the alliance.

36:42.133 --> 36:44.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ESTHER BRIMMER: Well, indeed.

36:44.502 --> 36:49.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The alliance is, of course, both
a political and a military
alliance to defend the territory

36:49.841 --> 36:56.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the NATO allies. And, once
again, we see that we need to
have a military presence in

36:56.781 --> 37:01.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Europe increased. As we know,
there has always been a U.S.
presence within Europe, which

37:01.152 --> 37:04.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was happily reduced after
the end of the Cold War.

37:04.756 --> 37:08.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
However, now we see that
particularly the Baltic states
and others are concerned about

37:08.760 --> 37:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their security, recognizing the
threats made by Russia against
those non-NATO countries

37:15.366 --> 37:20.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to their east. Importantly, we
see that, though, this is a
multilateral commitment. We see

37:20.805 --> 37:26.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that countries of four nations
will lead the effort to station
rotating battalions in the

37:26.845 --> 37:30.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
eastern part of the
NATO countries.

37:30.615 --> 37:35.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, again, the United States,
but other countries, too, are
part of the response to show
that

37:35.587 --> 37:39.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the alliance as a whole is
committed to the territories of
those countries most under

37:39.157 --> 37:40.859 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pressure.

37:40.859 --> 37:44.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: You spoke also about
the British decision to leave
the European Union. What's

37:44.562 --> 37:46.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that done to NATO?

37:46.197 --> 37:48.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ESTHER BRIMMER: Indeed.

37:48.867 --> 37:53.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we know, that there are
important institutions in the
transatlantic relationship. The
North

37:53.404 --> 37:58.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Atlantic Treaty alliance, NATO,
has always been the underpinning
of that relationship.

37:58.276 --> 38:02.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the European Union has an
important role in other types of
security, including border

38:02.614 --> 38:05.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
issues and others.

38:05.617 --> 38:10.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the relationship between
those countries are also part of
transatlantic security. The

38:10.822 --> 38:16.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United Kingdom is really the
lynchpin. They're both members
of NATO and members of the
European

38:16.461 --> 38:19.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Union. They have an important
role to play. But they have a
sovereign choice about what

38:19.864 --> 38:24.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they were going to do. The vote
for Brexit means that there is a
greater interest, I

38:24.002 --> 38:29.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think, in the United Kingdom in
demonstrating their support for
the transatlantic alliance

38:29.574 --> 38:34.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and showing that they want to
continue to play an important
role as a key nation within

38:34.846 --> 38:37.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.

38:37.482 --> 38:42.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And within Europe,
could NATO emerge as the
unifying force if E.U. is -- if
Britain

38:42.020 --> 38:44.622 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
leaves the E.U.?

38:44.622 --> 38:49.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ESTHER BRIMMER: They really play
two different roles, that the
NATO alliance is a military

38:49.627 --> 38:54.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alliance. Its job is to provide
for the defense of the allies
who are part of it, yet it has

38:54.832 --> 38:58.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a complementary role
to the European Union.

38:58.870 --> 39:04.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But NATO will also continue to
have its political role.
Ultimately, it is an alliance of
values

39:04.909 --> 39:07.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
based on the political values we
share. The United Kingdom will
be an important part of

39:07.879 --> 39:11.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
expressing and defending
those values.

39:11.282 --> 39:15.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And from what we see, they will
continue to want to demonstrate
their leadership in the

39:15.386 --> 39:18.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alliance to demonstrate their
support for the transatlantic
relationship.

39:18.790 --> 39:23.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: With the economic
uncertainty of leaving the
European Union, is it possible

39:23.895 --> 39:28.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Great Britain will no
longer keep up its -- it's one
of the few countries that

39:28.967 --> 39:33.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is meeting its obligation in
defense spending among NATO
members. Is there a danger that

39:33.571 --> 39:36.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that is going to stop?

39:36.107 --> 39:40.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ESTHER BRIMMER: There will be a
great deal of attention toward
seeing whether the United

39:40.245 --> 39:45.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kingdom will be able to maintain
their financial commitment to
the alliance.

39:45.183 --> 39:51.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you have indicated, that of
the 28 members of the alliance,
only four have met the
commitment

39:51.489 --> 39:55.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that was made, ironically, at
the last summit, which was held
in the United Kingdom in Wales,

39:55.727 --> 40:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at which the allies committed to
paying 2 percent towards their
-- towards the alliance.

40:02.900 --> 40:05.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Only four countries meet that.

40:05.536 --> 40:09.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The United Kingdom is one of
them. Although the Cameron
government did institute
significant

40:09.941 --> 40:17.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reductions in public spending in
recent years, they did recently
meet the 2 percent standard.

40:17.415 --> 40:20.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think most allies are hoping
they will continue to do so, but
they will be under economic

40:20.251 --> 40:22.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pressure. It will be a concern.

40:22.220 --> 40:23.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: More interesting
days ahead for Europe.

40:23.421 --> 40:24.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ESTHER BRIMMER: Indeed.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Esther Brimmer,
thanks for being with us.

40:26.858 --> 40:36.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ESTHER BRIMMER: Thank
you very much.

40:36.834 --> 40:44.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now we kick off a
special series about efforts to
try to end the AIDS epidemic.

40:44.942 --> 40:48.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Leaders and researchers from
around the globe will be meeting
at the International AIDS

40:48.813 --> 40:54.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Conference in South Africa next
week. One major focus, how to
stop the epidemic.

40:54.786 --> 40:59.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But with no vaccine or cure in
sight, how likely is that? This
week, we're looking at

40:59.257 --> 41:01.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
efforts around the world.

41:01.859 --> 41:06.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We start in San Francisco, where
we have followed people for the
past six months.

41:06.831 --> 41:10.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Correspondent William Brangham
and producer Jason Kane reported
this series, with the

41:10.335 --> 41:15.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
support of the Pulitzer
Center on Crisis Reporting.

41:15.273 --> 41:22.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: San
Francisco's gay pride events
went off this summer like they
usually

41:22.680 --> 41:27.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do, loud and colorful
and celebratory.

41:27.719 --> 41:32.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there's additional reason to
celebrate. San Francisco, one of
the cities where the

41:32.523 --> 41:36.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AIDS epidemic first emerged, and
one that suffered terribly from
it, has now launched

41:36.327 --> 41:39.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the country's most ambitious
campaign to control it.

41:39.630 --> 41:43.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's called Getting to Zero.

41:43.835 --> 41:50.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Luis Canales is a living example
of that campaign. Canales is
HIV-positive. He got infected
having

41:50.608 --> 41:55.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unprotected sex with another man
three years ago. But -- and this
is one of the linchpins

41:55.980 --> 41:59.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of San Francisco's effort --
Canales was tested and then
started on HIV treatment
immediately

41:59.784 --> 42:01.986 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
after diagnosis.

42:01.986 --> 42:05.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LUIS CANALES, AIDS Patient: Yes,
right away. And I think it was
the next day, I came in

42:05.857 --> 42:07.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and started my meds.

42:07.925 --> 42:10.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. STEVEN DEEKS, University of
California, San Francisco: That,
as a physician is my

42:10.361 --> 42:13.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
goal, to keep people on
therapy for their own good.

42:13.064 --> 42:14.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Steven
Deeks is Canales' doctor.

42:14.866 --> 42:15.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DR. STEVEN DEEKS:
Luis, how you doing?

42:15.800 --> 42:17.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LUIS CANALES: Pretty good.

42:17.135 --> 42:19.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This
approach is called Rapid.

42:19.737 --> 42:23.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Deeks says, the sooner the
virus can be stopped with
antiretroviral drugs, the
better,

42:23.574 --> 42:26.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but it's not just
for the patient.

42:26.744 --> 42:30.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. STEVEN DEEKS: From a public
health perspective -- and I
think this is what's really
driving

42:30.848 --> 42:34.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of interest in the RAPID
program -- someone's on therapy,
they can't pass the virus to
other

42:34.352 --> 42:36.287 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

42:36.287 --> 42:41.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Dr. Diane
Havlir of U.C. San Francisco
pushed the city to embrace RAPID

42:41.259 --> 42:44.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
treatment years before other
cities did. She's also one of
the architects of the entire
Getting

42:44.562 --> 42:48.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Zero plan.

42:48.966 --> 42:52.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She says the idea that treatment
should wait because of cost, or
side effects, or fear

42:52.837 --> 42:55.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people won't stick
with it is outdated.

42:55.206 --> 42:57.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. DIANE HAVLIR, University of
California, San Francisco: If
you have heart attack, you

42:57.542 --> 43:01.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do need to take medicines for
your heart, in most cases for
life. We don't say, how

43:01.612 --> 43:04.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do you feel about this? Do you
want to go home? We say, you
need to start these medicines

43:04.582 --> 43:08.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
now. This is a serious
condition. It's the same with
HIV.

43:08.186 --> 43:11.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Widespread
testing and treatment for HIV is
considered the single best way

43:11.489 --> 43:14.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to curtail this epidemic.

43:14.992 --> 43:19.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Treatment prevents infected
people from progressing to AIDS,
and it reduces the likelihood
that

43:19.263 --> 43:24.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they will infect others. The
Getting to Zero campaign wants
to cut those new HIV infections

43:24.135 --> 43:29.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the city by 90 percent by
2020. That would mean cutting
them from 300 a year now down

43:29.740 --> 43:34.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to about 30. They also want to
cut HIV deaths by a similar
percentage, from about 150 a

43:34.712 --> 43:37.982 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
year today down to just 15.

43:37.982 --> 43:45.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They want to get both down to
zero by 2030. Of course, the
best way to stop HIV is to

43:45.323 --> 43:48.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stop people getting infected in
the first place, so San
Francisco is aggressively
promoting

43:48.326 --> 43:51.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
its prevention strategy.

43:51.128 --> 43:53.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jason Lloyd is a 41-year-old
gay man in San Francisco.

43:53.464 --> 43:54.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Your first and last name?

43:54.799 --> 43:56.801 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
JASON LLOYD, San
Francisco: Jason Lloyd.

43:56.801 --> 44:01.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: He doesn't
have HIV. And to stay that way,
back in January, he was

44:01.172 --> 44:06.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about to start taking what's
called PrEP, pre-exposure
prophylaxis. It's a daily dose

44:06.177 --> 44:09.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the drug Truvada that will
greatly reduce his chance of
infection if he's exposed to

44:09.747 --> 44:11.716 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
HIV.

44:11.716 --> 44:16.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JASON LLOYD: There is always in
the back of my head when I go to
get tested, is this going

44:16.954 --> 44:20.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be -- is the test going to
come back positive? Because I do
have risky activity, although

44:20.892 --> 44:24.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it might be low-risk,
still risky.

44:24.161 --> 44:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Truvada was
approved as a prevention tool by
the FDA in 2012. Despite

44:29.433 --> 44:34.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its proven ability to prevent
HIV, it's been very
controversial, and it hasn't
been widely

44:34.171 --> 44:38.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
embraced elsewhere. Some fear
those who take it will engage in
riskier behavior, though

44:38.476 --> 44:42.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there's very little
evidence of that occurring.

44:42.346 --> 44:46.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, an estimated 6,000
people in San Francisco are
taking Truvada for HIV
prevention,

44:46.951 --> 44:49.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and Jason Lloyd is
joining their ranks.

44:49.320 --> 44:52.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JASON LLOYD: And so I will start
taking it tonight. So, we will
see.

44:52.356 --> 44:58.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Of course,
Truvada is for those who are
uninfected. Keeping those who

44:58.696 --> 45:05.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are infected healthy and linked
to care is another main thrust
of San Francisco's plan.

45:05.870 --> 45:09.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Max Ruben works for San
Francisco's Public Health
Department. For months, he's
been making

45:09.307 --> 45:13.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
regular visits to see an
HIV-positive man named Barry
Stover.

45:13.344 --> 45:16.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAX RUBEN, San Francisco Public
Health Department: Barry.
Morning, bud. How's it going?

45:16.380 --> 45:22.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARRY STOVER, HIV Patient: I
found out I had HIV. I was ready
to kill myself, but I didn't.

45:22.920 --> 45:27.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Stover was
diagnosed in 2015 after years of
living on the streets,

45:27.925 --> 45:32.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
addicted to drugs. He's still
using today, and the first few
times we met him, he was

45:32.797 --> 45:38.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supposed to be taking his daily
HIV medications, but it wasn't
clear that was happening.

45:38.035 --> 45:44.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARRY STOVER: I try to take 'em,
but I just don't like taking
pills.

45:44.241 --> 45:48.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: After their
visit, Ruben walked Stover to
one of the city's health

45:48.179 --> 45:52.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clinics. With regular visits,
they hope he will be more
consistent with his medications.

45:52.883 --> 45:57.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. DIANE HAVLIR: No one is
proposing that every single
person with HIV gets a daily

45:57.355 --> 46:03.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
visit. However, if we want to
fully control the epidemic, we
are going to need to do that

46:03.761 --> 46:08.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for some people, and it's
completely justified. It's
either pay now or pay later.

46:08.065 --> 46:11.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: A few blocks
away, Kenneth Grosenbach and his
girlfriend Michele Campbell

46:11.369 --> 46:15.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are trying to stay on their
medications as well.

46:15.006 --> 46:20.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's HIV-positive. She isn't.
Because he's taking his meds,
she's far less likely to

46:20.111 --> 46:25.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get infected. She's also taking
PrEP, which gives her even more
protection.

46:25.816 --> 46:30.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's hard to convey just how
brutal Kenny Grosenbach's life
has been so far. Born to

46:30.855 --> 46:36.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a teenage rape victim, he was
abandoned when he was 10. He
says he's been selling sex and

46:36.193 --> 46:41.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
addicted to drugs for the last
20 years Grosenbach admits he's
had trouble in the past staying

46:41.265 --> 46:45.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on his HIV medication, but now
he says he's got a reason to
stay alive.

46:45.970 --> 46:49.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KENNETH GROSENBACH, HIV Patient:
What encouraged me to get my
medicine, and start my medicine,

46:49.240 --> 46:53.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is that I found somebody that I
really care about. I found
somebody that cares about me.

46:53.344 --> 46:57.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHELE CAMPBELL, San Francisco:
Now that we're together and we
want to start a normal

46:57.081 --> 47:00.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
life, we need to start
doing normal things.

47:00.051 --> 47:05.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: To stop the
AIDS epidemic, two years ago,
the U.N. set an ambitious goal,

47:05.189 --> 47:09.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it's one that we're seeing
implemented here in San
Francisco. It's to get 90
percent

47:09.293 --> 47:13.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of HIV-positive people tested,
90 percent of them onto
treatment, and 90 percent of

47:13.364 --> 47:17.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
them to have their virus
fully suppressed.

47:17.334 --> 47:20.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether that's achievable and
whether that'll stem the
epidemic is still an open
question.

47:20.404 --> 47:24.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The challenge of hitting those
targets became clearer when we
returned to the city three

47:24.742 --> 47:26.377 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
months later.

47:26.377 --> 47:29.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: What is the reason to
see the pharmacist tomorrow?

47:29.180 --> 47:33.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KENNETH GROSENBACH: Because I
have zero medicines. Yes, I need
my medicine.

47:33.350 --> 47:36.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Kenny
Grosenbach is now homeless. He'd
just been kicked out of his

47:36.654 --> 47:40.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
place, and he stopped
taking his HIV medication.

47:40.925 --> 47:46.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KENNETH GROSENBACH: I have to
say that these few months have
been hard. I went completely

47:46.897 --> 47:52.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
backwards. I am not really being
too much on the responsible end
for my meds or for

47:52.570 --> 47:58.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
my relationship. I am just
trying to make it day by day.

47:58.476 --> 48:03.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: "Science"
magazine's Jon Cohen, who's
covered HIV/AIDS for more than

48:03.447 --> 48:07.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
25 years, and who helped us
report this series, says Kenny
Grosenbach is a testament to
just

48:07.618 --> 48:10.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how hard it's going to be to
achieve the U.N.'s targets.

48:10.788 --> 48:14.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON COHEN, "Science": Who are
these people who are so hard to
test, who are so hard to

48:14.825 --> 48:22.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
link to care, and who are so
hard to get suppressed? Kenny's
that guy.

48:22.399 --> 48:28.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's really tough on every level
for the health care system. He
knows his status. Linking

48:28.072 --> 48:34.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him to care, he's been linked to
care, but keeping him virally
suppressed? Well, he has

48:34.011 --> 48:38.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a really hard time staying on
his medication. And it ties back
to housing, right? I mean,

48:38.149 --> 48:41.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this is a guy who's
living on the streets.

48:41.519 --> 48:46.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But for most
people, the Getting to Zero
campaign has been working.

48:46.857 --> 48:51.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This summer, six months after we
first met him, Jason Lloyd was
still taking the PrEP

48:51.028 --> 48:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drug, Truvada. He said some of
his friends take it, too. They
help remind him to take

48:56.100 --> 49:00.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his, and it's all becoming very
normal-seeming. We caught up
with him as he was getting made

49:00.204 --> 49:05.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
up for one of his drag
performances. His stage name is
Beyonda, Beyonda Mazing.

49:05.709 --> 49:10.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And contrary to the critics'
fears about taking Truvada, the
pill hadn't turned him into a

49:10.114 --> 49:13.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wild risk-taker. In fact, he'd
been having a bit of a dry
spell.

49:13.951 --> 49:17.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JASON LLOYD: I'm actually having
less sex since I started taking
Truvada than before.

49:17.521 --> 49:22.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes, I feel more like a Truvada
monk than a Truvada whore.

49:22.626 --> 49:25.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Luis Canales
has also been taking his
medication consistently, and
he's

49:25.696 --> 49:27.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
had no side effects.

49:27.631 --> 49:30.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LUIS CANALES: Meds every day.
Whenever any of my doctors need
to see me, I go in and

49:30.868 --> 49:33.337 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
see them.

49:33.337 --> 49:37.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Partly because
of how quickly he was put on
treatment, extensive tests
cannot

49:37.875 --> 49:41.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
find the virus anywhere in his
body. And doctors are now
studying him to see if they can
learn

49:41.645 --> 49:45.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
any clues about how
to cure people.

49:45.616 --> 49:49.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And across town at Barry
Stover's place, more good news.
After struggling to stick with

49:49.153 --> 49:51.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his meds, Stover's
been doing it.

49:51.388 --> 49:53.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BARRY STOVER: I'm
undetectable, so...

49:53.257 --> 49:55.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
You're undetectable?

49:55.025 --> 49:58.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARRY STOVER: Yes. That's what
-- what my doctor said, so...

49:58.262 --> 49:59.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Congratulations.

49:59.029 --> 50:00.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BARRY STOVER: Yes.

50:00.531 --> 50:02.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
That's a big deal.

50:02.299 --> 50:05.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BARRY STOVER: Yes.

50:05.035 --> 50:09.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But things
just keep spiraling down for
Kenny Grosenbach and Michele
Campbell.

50:09.306 --> 50:12.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are both homeless now. She
was kicked out of her place. And
both are completely

50:12.943 --> 50:15.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
off their medications.

50:15.512 --> 50:20.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HIV is likely replicating
rapidly in Kenny's immune cells,
and because Campbell is off

50:20.184 --> 50:22.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Truvada, she's at high
risk of infection.

50:22.820 --> 50:26.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They said the main thing they
focus on now is their addiction.

50:26.757 --> 50:31.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHELE CAMPBELL: It seems like
since we have been out on the
streets. Getting high has

50:31.996 --> 50:34.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been, like, the priority, just
because we just forget about
everything else.

50:34.965 --> 50:36.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KENNETH GROSENBACH: You
don't have to feel at all.

50:36.533 --> 50:40.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHELE CAMPBELL: I really just
want to get off the drugs, and
start taking medication,

50:40.571 --> 50:47.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and start living our life and
actually be happy, because this
is miserable out here.

50:47.044 --> 50:52.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: San Francisco
is still a few years away from
its Getting to Zero target.

50:52.383 --> 50:57.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Despite the struggles they face,
Dr. Diane Havlir remains
optimistic they will get there.

50:57.121 --> 51:00.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. DIANE HAVLIR: The worst
thing that you can do is fail,
but, if you don't try at all,

51:00.891 --> 51:06.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're never going to have the
chance of succeeding. So,
obstacles and barriers for me
are just

51:06.463 --> 51:09.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
part of the journey
and don't deter me.

51:09.767 --> 51:13.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Even as the
city cheers its advances, the
difficulty of bringing the

51:13.404 --> 51:17.241 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
AIDS epidemic to
an end is obvious.

51:17.241 --> 51:22.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Public health officials say,
after nearly 35 years since the
epidemic surfaced, the

51:22.046 --> 51:27.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
world has never had this many
proven tools so close at hand to
fight HIV. But putting

51:27.284 --> 51:31.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those tools to work for everyone
remains the challenge going
forward.

51:31.755 --> 51:34.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham in San
Francisco.

51:34.625 --> 51:39.029 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tough to watch.

51:39.029 --> 51:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We continue our series tomorrow
looking at the challenges in
Atlanta, where black gay

51:43.133 --> 51:46.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
men are among the hardest-hit.

51:46.170 --> 51:52.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The alarm
bells rarely stop in the
inpatient and isolation wards at
Grady

51:52.676 --> 52:00.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Memorial Hospital. Here in
Atlanta, just down the street
from CDC, in 2016, in the age of

52:00.217 --> 52:04.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lifesaving antiretroviral drugs,
hundreds of people are still
dying every year from

52:04.221 --> 52:06.090 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
AIDS.

52:06.090 --> 52:15.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tune in all this
week for our series The End of
AIDS.

52:15.599 --> 52:30.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
online right now: Iconic images
and stories of the Dust

52:30.848 --> 52:35.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bowl have helped shape our
perceptions of that period of
American history, but a new

52:35.853 --> 52:38.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
study challenges our
understanding of all that
followed.

52:38.856 --> 52:42.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:42.359 --> 52:47.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And tune in later
tonight on "Charlie Rose":
columnist Charles Blow on

52:47.831 --> 52:52.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how events in Dallas have
affected the issues of race and
reform.

52:52.569 --> 52:54.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm Judy Woodruff.

52:54.071 --> 52:56.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

52:56.874 --> 53:00.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening. For all of us
here at the "PBS NewsHour,"

53:00.978 --> 53:25.002 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.
