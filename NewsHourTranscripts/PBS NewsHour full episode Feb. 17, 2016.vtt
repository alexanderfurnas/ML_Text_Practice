JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:05.973 --> 00:07.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:07.774 --> 00:11.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
an epic battle on Capitol Hill.
We hear from

00:11.645 --> 00:17.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two high-ranking senators about
the fight
over nominating Justice Antonin
Scalia's successor.

00:17.117 --> 00:23.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead this
Wednesday: Apple
opposes a judge's order to
unlock the iPhone

00:23.357 --> 00:28.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
used by the San Bernardino
shooters, saying
the ruling would undermine
customers' privacy.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And:

00:30.530 --> 00:32.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADRIAAN VLOK, Former South
African Minister
of Law and Order: I am guilty. I
am sorry.

00:32.332 --> 00:34.101 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Will you please forgive me?

00:34.201 --> 00:39.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A story of
reconciliation:
how an apartheid-era police
official is now

00:39.306 --> 00:41.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
helping the people he once
brutalized.

00:41.308 --> 00:46.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DINAH SEKESE, Volunteer Relief
Worker: And
they say, can you believe
Adriaan Vlok can

00:46.246 --> 00:53.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change? I said, I believe what I
saw. What
I see is what I believe, and
then I am ready

00:53.153 --> 00:55.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to tell that Adriaan Vlok has
changed.

00:55.355 --> 00:58.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:58.892 --> 01:03.263 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:03.363 --> 01:17.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Turkey's capital
city is alive
with fear and anger tonight,
after a car bomb

01:17.411 --> 01:20.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
killed at least 28 people and
wounded 61.

01:21.014 --> 01:26.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a report on the blast in
central Ankara,
from Juliet Bremner of
Independent Television

01:26.753 --> 01:28.488 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
News.

01:28.588 --> 01:33.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIET BREMNER: Moments after an
explosion
was heard across the Turkish
capital, flames

01:33.627 --> 01:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leapt into the night sky. The
bomb had hit
a convoy of military buses that
had been taking

01:40.133 --> 01:43.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
soldiers home from their
barracks.

01:43.403 --> 01:50.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the chaos immediately after
the attack,
the governor said that he
believed the bomb

01:50.877 --> 01:57.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had been left in a car. It was
rush hour.
Commuters broke their journey
home to try

01:57.284 --> 02:03.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and help move a parked car that
was blocking
the emergency services. Unable
to access the

02:03.824 --> 02:09.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vehicle, they smashed in through
the window
and drove it away.

02:09.162 --> 02:14.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The buses were targeted close to
the Turkish
Parliament. The prime minister,
president,

02:14.167 --> 02:19.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and security minister were in
the middle of
a security meeting about Syria
when the bomb

02:19.172 --> 02:27.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
went off. This is the fourth
terrorist attack
on Turkey in recent months.

02:28.081 --> 02:34.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last October, more than 100
peace activists
were killed during a rally in
Ankara. On that

02:34.554 --> 02:40.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
occasion, the so-called Islamic
State were
blamed. On this occasion, early
indications

02:40.494 --> 02:45.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suggest it could be the work of
the Kurdish
separatist group the PKK,
striking at the

02:45.999 --> 02:51.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heart of Turkey days after their
army had
hit Kurds across the Syrian
border.

02:51.538 --> 02:56.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in Syria
today, convoys
carrying humanitarian aid made
their way to

02:57.044 --> 03:01.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
besieged parts of the country.
It is part
of an agreement between the
Assad government

03:01.481 --> 03:07.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the U.N. One convoy arrived
in Madaya,
a town west of Damascus that has
been sealed

03:07.788 --> 03:13.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off by government forces for
months. Locals
say dozens of people have
starved to death.

03:13.460 --> 03:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Pope Francis spent
this final
day of his visit to Mexico near
the U.S. border.

03:19.533 --> 03:25.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He journeyed to Ciudad Juarez,
just across
the Rio Grande from El Paso,
Texas, and once

03:25.138 --> 03:28.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a cauldron of violence and drug
trafficking.

03:28.175 --> 03:33.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The pontiff's first stop was at
a prison,
where he embraced inmates and
preached a message

03:33.180 --> 03:34.981 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of redemption.

03:35.082 --> 03:38.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
POPE FRANCIS, Leader of Catholic
Church (through
translator): The one who has
suffered the

03:38.718 --> 03:44.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
greatest pain, and we could say
has experienced
hell, can become a prophet in
society. Work,

03:44.925 --> 03:49.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so that this society, which uses
people and
discards them, will not go on
claiming victims.

03:49.663 --> 03:54.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The final event of
the papal trip
was a huge outdoor mass this
evening.

03:54.634 --> 04:00.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tensions in the
South China
Sea escalated today, as U.S. and
Taiwan officials

04:00.474 --> 04:06.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
confirmed that China has
deployed advanced
surface-to-air missiles on a
disputed island.

04:06.646 --> 04:13.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The batteries are on Woody
Island in the Paracels
claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam,
but controlled

04:13.487 --> 04:15.288 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by Beijing.

04:15.388 --> 04:18.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WANG YI, Chinese Foreign
Minister (through
translator): China's move of
setting up limited,

04:18.125 --> 04:22.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
necessary and self-defense
facilities on the
islands and reefs where Chinese
troops are

04:22.429 --> 04:27.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stationed is in line with the
right of self-defense
endowed by international law to
any sovereign

04:27.701 --> 04:29.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
state. Therefore, there is
nothing wrong about
it.

04:29.836 --> 04:33.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But the United
States sharply
criticized the move.

04:33.940 --> 04:38.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of State John Kerry
spoke in Washington
as he met with Poland's foreign
minister.

04:38.745 --> 04:43.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: When
President Xi was here in
Washington, he stood

04:43.717 --> 04:51.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the Rose Garden with
President Obama and
said China will not militarize
in the South

04:51.258 --> 04:58.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China Sea. But there is every
evidence, every
day, that there has been an
increase of militarization

04:58.632 --> 05:02.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of one kind or another. It's of
serious concern.

05:02.602 --> 05:08.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The news came
just a day after
President Obama called for a
peaceful resolution

05:08.608 --> 05:10.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of disputes in the South China
Sea.

05:10.644 --> 05:15.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Iran pushed back
today against
a proposal to limit supply and
boost prices.

05:16.082 --> 05:21.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela
and Qatar
said yesterday they would cap
oil output at

05:21.688 --> 05:27.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
January levels if other major
producers do
likewise. But Iran said today
that, with international

05:27.827 --> 05:32.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
sanctions easing, it will
increase oil exports.
It called for the other
producers to pump

05:32.966 --> 05:34.768 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
less.

05:34.868 --> 05:38.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Despite Iran's
statement, the
price of oil traded higher
today, and that

05:38.405 --> 05:45.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kept Wall Street's rally alive.
The Dow Jones
industrial average gained 257
points to close

05:45.111 --> 05:52.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
near 16454. The Nasdaq rose 98
points, and
the S&amp;P 500 added 31.

05:52.319 --> 05:58.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And there's a new
top dog in the
land. A German shorthaired
pointer named C.J.

05:58.825 --> 06:04.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
took best in show last night at
the Westminster
Dog Show in New York. The
3-year-old champion

06:04.531 --> 06:11.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beat 2,700 canine competitors
over two days.
He's only been showing for six
months, but

06:11.238 --> 06:16.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he has already won 18 best in
show awards,
culminating at Westminster.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.812 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Go for C.J.

06:18.912 --> 06:23.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
top senators
weigh in on the next Supreme
Court nominee;

06:23.950 --> 06:30.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
should Apple grant law
enforcement access
to iPhone data?; political
charges and countercharges

06:30.357 --> 06:36.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fly in South Carolina; and much
more.

06:36.229 --> 06:50.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The passing of
Justice Antonin
Scalia has unleashed a political
battle of

06:50.644 --> 06:56.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
epic proportions that is
reverberating from
the campaign trail to Capitol
Hill. President

06:56.116 --> 07:01.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama has made it clear he will
nominate someone.
But, in the Senate, most
Republicans say he

07:02.022 --> 07:04.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shouldn't, and, if he does, they
won't confirm.

07:04.891 --> 07:09.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We hear now from two senior
members of the
Senate Judiciary Committee,
which first considers

07:09.863 --> 07:11.665 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
any nominee.

07:11.765 --> 07:17.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First up, Democratic Senator
Dianne Feinstein
of California. She joins us from
San Francisco.

07:17.370 --> 07:19.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome, Senator Feinstein.

07:19.239 --> 07:22.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what is your response to
your Republican
colleagues who say this should
be left to

07:22.842 --> 07:24.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the next president?

07:24.344 --> 07:27.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D),
California: Well,
I would say this, Judy.

07:27.113 --> 07:34.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fourteen nominees have been
confirmed in the
final year of a presidency in
history. And,

07:34.187 --> 07:40.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a matter of fact, Ronald
Reagan presented
Judge Kennedy to become Justice
Kennedy, and

07:40.593 --> 07:45.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he became that and was confirmed
in the last
year of Reagan's administration.

07:45.498 --> 07:53.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it is a well-established
fact that this
can happen. I mean, I remember
back. One of

07:53.473 --> 08:01.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my very first confirmation
hearings was Justice
Ginsburg. And both the chairman
of the committee

08:01.448 --> 08:07.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today, Senator Grassley and
Senator Hatch,
voted for her. And I remember
their statements

08:07.520 --> 08:15.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to this day about a president
being entitled
to his nominees, provided they
were qualified,

08:15.729 --> 08:23.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
provided they had the requisite
skills, the
integrity, the moral compass to
be enacted.

08:23.670 --> 08:30.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they both voted for Justice
Ginsburg.
I wish we could go back to those
days, because

08:30.276 --> 08:34.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what's happening now is very
destructive of
the process.

08:34.381 --> 08:39.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me just
cite quickly
what Senator Hatch has said. And
I'm going

08:39.252 --> 08:43.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be talking to him in just a
minute. He
said the Senate has never
allowed a term-limited

08:43.890 --> 08:47.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president to nominate someone
this late in
his term.

08:47.560 --> 08:54.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Well, the
record reflects
that 14 have been confirmed in
the final year.

08:54.434 --> 08:57.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're well able to do it in the
time that
remains.

08:57.871 --> 09:04.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, why not do it? Because what
is left are
several very important cases,
whereby, if

09:04.944 --> 09:12.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there is a tie vote, the
appellate court decision
takes precedence, therefore,
shorting the

09:12.485 --> 09:18.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
justice system for whoever it
was that was
on the other side of the
appellate court decision.

09:18.958 --> 09:24.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we shouldn't do that. That,
I think, is
destructive to what is, you
know, a very well-put-together

09:25.098 --> 09:27.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
system of justice.

09:27.133 --> 09:30.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just quickly, two
other questions.
Republicans say it was the
Democrats who politicized

09:30.804 --> 09:35.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this process with the way they
went after
Robert Bork, the way they went
after Clarence

09:35.508 --> 09:37.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thomas, that the Democrats
started this.

09:37.510 --> 09:42.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Yes,
well, I wasn't
here then, so I really can't
comment.

09:42.749 --> 09:49.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But whoever it was, it seems to
me the time
has come to end it. And I had
hoped that we

09:49.255 --> 09:57.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were in the process of ending
it. We have
confirmed 11 judges last year.
We have 78

09:57.263 --> 10:03.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pending. And it shouldn't be
that way. And,
you know, Barack Obama has
almost a full year

10:03.803 --> 10:09.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
left. Are you saying then that
his hands could
be -- should be handcuffed and
that he can't

10:09.442 --> 10:13.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
make appointments in that full
year of his
presidency?

10:13.880 --> 10:20.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that's a mistake. And
one thing, one
more thing. What goes around
comes around.

10:20.353 --> 10:26.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I re-read Orrin Hatch's
statement after
the Ginsburg hearing. And
regardless of what

10:26.292 --> 10:30.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has happened since then, I think
he was absolutely
right.

10:30.330 --> 10:37.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the ability to process a
nominee becomes
very important and I think very
significant.

10:37.203 --> 10:40.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would hope that Orrin
would remember
that.

10:40.106 --> 10:45.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, Senator
Feinstein,
how far to the center should the
president

10:45.311 --> 10:51.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lean in choosing a nominee?
Should he try
hard to find somebody who is
going to appeal

10:51.417 --> 10:53.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Republicans, as well as
Democrats?

10:53.720 --> 10:58.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Well, I
think the answer
to that question is yes, if you
want to get

10:58.358 --> 11:04.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
someone confirmed, I think
somebody that has
gone through the confirmation
process -- and

11:04.764 --> 11:11.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there are several who are
well-qualified on
that score -- or somebody that
would be seen

11:11.137 --> 11:14.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as outstanding by both sides of
the aisle.

11:14.807 --> 11:20.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if either one of those were
to happen,
I think the chances of
confirmation would

11:20.446 --> 11:22.115 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be very high.

11:22.215 --> 11:25.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Dianne
Feinstein joining
us from California, we thank
you.

11:25.885 --> 11:28.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Thank
you, Judy.

11:28.121 --> 11:33.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now to a
Republican view,
Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah.
He's also on

11:33.226 --> 11:37.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Judiciary Committee, and he
joins us from
Salt Lake City.

11:37.163 --> 11:42.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Welcome, Senator Hatch. So the
Republicans
are in the majority. The
president has said

11:42.168 --> 11:48.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he is going to nominate someone
to fill the
term or to take the place of
Justice Scalia.

11:48.474 --> 11:50.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is going to happen then?

11:50.376 --> 11:54.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. ORRIN HATCH (R), Utah:
Well, the president
has an absolute right to
nominate whoever

11:54.314 --> 11:57.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he wants to. And I would vote to
protect that
right.

11:57.850 --> 12:03.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the Senate also has an
absolute right
to confirm or not to confirm.
And so I do

12:03.790 --> 12:10.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
support Senator McConnell in
saying, but,
look, let's get it out of this
terrible presidential

12:10.630 --> 12:15.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
brouhaha that is going on, and
let's get it
over to the next year, and be
fair to both

12:15.702 --> 12:19.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sides, because what would happen
is whoever
wins the presidency is going to
be able to

12:19.706 --> 12:21.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
make this nomination.

12:21.608 --> 12:26.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Usually, you never nominate
anyone during
the last year of a president.
And the reason

12:26.646 --> 12:30.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for that is because -- well,
there are many
reasons, but one reason is
because there's

12:30.850 --> 12:40.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
always a very contested Senate
primaries and
also election, and, secondly,
generally, one

12:40.226 --> 12:42.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
side or the other is going to
get very, very
upset about it.

12:42.629 --> 12:45.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would rather get the Supreme
Court out of
that type of a condition.

12:45.365 --> 12:49.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we just
heard Senator
Feinstein say that there are now
14 examples

12:49.435 --> 12:54.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of nominations to the Supreme
Court that took
place during the final year of a
presidency.

12:54.207 --> 12:58.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. ORRIN HATCH: Well, in the
last 80 years,
there haven't been. And I'm
talking about

12:58.544 --> 13:06.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
80 years, and except for --
except for Justice
Kennedy. But Kennedy was
nominated in the

13:06.119 --> 13:14.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prior year. And that was only
after a bruising
set of fights that resulted in
basically a

13:14.527 --> 13:18.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
choice of Kennedy that both
sides went along
with.

13:18.998 --> 13:23.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me just
come back
to you with what not only
Senator Feinstein

13:23.403 --> 13:25.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has said, but so many others,
including the
president.

13:25.972 --> 13:32.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He still has almost a year left
in office,
that it is the duty of the
Senate to consider

13:32.979 --> 13:38.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the nomination. Senator
Feinstein pointed
out that when you supported Ruth
Bader Ginsburg

13:38.918 --> 13:42.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the Senate, who clearly was
someone whose
views were different from yours,
you said

13:42.221 --> 13:42.922 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the president...

13:43.022 --> 13:44.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEN. ORRIN HATCH: That's right.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... should --
choice should
be respected.

13:46.325 --> 13:49.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. ORRIN HATCH: Well, I think
the president's
choice should be respected. That
doesn't mean

13:49.595 --> 13:53.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you have to have -- you have to
accept that
choice.

13:53.132 --> 13:58.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in this situation, just
think about it.
They are already voting in the
primaries.

13:58.971 --> 14:03.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're already in full swing in
the presidential
election, at least the
primaries. It's contentious

14:04.077 --> 14:10.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as can be. It's the most
obnoxious political
system, series of problems that
I have seen

14:10.316 --> 14:12.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the whole time I have been in
the United
States Senate.

14:12.852 --> 14:16.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, are you
saying that
-- then that the majority of
Republican would

14:16.489 --> 14:19.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not hold hearings on the
Judiciary Committee?

14:19.492 --> 14:23.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. ORRIN HATCH: Well, I think
if you are
not going to allow it to come up
in this brouhaha

14:23.796 --> 14:28.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year, where there's all kinds of
infighting
and screaming and shouting, yes,
I don't think

14:28.801 --> 14:31.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
any reason -- there wouldn't be
any real good
reason to have hearings.

14:31.938 --> 14:36.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And is there any
precedent
for that, for the Senate ever
having refused

14:36.275 --> 14:39.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to consider the president's
nominee to the
Supreme Court?

14:39.846 --> 14:43.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. ORRIN HATCH: Well, I don't
know about
that, whether there is any
precedent.

14:43.716 --> 14:47.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I mean, when the
president
himself didn't withdraw the
nomination.

14:47.887 --> 14:52.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. ORRIN HATCH: Well, we're
talking about
Nino Scalia. We're talking about
his successor.

14:52.725 --> 14:58.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're talking about something
that every Republican
-- person, every Republican
revered and many

14:58.397 --> 15:03.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats revered, by the way,
because they
knew what a great jurist he
really was. And

15:03.903 --> 15:08.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're talking about having a
system that doesn't
become the brutalized system
that occurred

15:08.374 --> 15:13.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Bob Bork nomination, one
of the greatest
legal minds in the history of
this country,

15:13.513 --> 15:15.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and they just brutalized him.

15:15.681 --> 15:19.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then look at what they did
to Clarence
Thomas. The fact of the matter
is, I would

15:19.752 --> 15:24.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like to get it out of that type
of brouhaha,
and get it into the next year,
where there

15:24.991 --> 15:29.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should be no brouhaha, and
whoever is president
should be able to pick whoever
that president

15:29.896 --> 15:31.831 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wants.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you are
saying, just to
be clear, Republicans would sit
on this nomination,

15:34.333 --> 15:36.202 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not act on it?

15:36.302 --> 15:41.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. ORRIN HATCH: Well, I'm
saying the Republicans
shouldn't act on it, because the
proper way

15:41.607 --> 15:49.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is to get this done in a way
that cools the
whole process around electing
judges, and

15:49.248 --> 15:53.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in particular justices to the
United States
Supreme Court.

15:53.386 --> 15:59.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just don't want the court
politicized. And
this would be the biggest
politicization the

15:59.592 --> 16:02.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
court in history. And that is
saying something,
because there have been some
other times that

16:02.862 --> 16:05.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
certainly would come close to
matching this.

16:05.565 --> 16:12.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in all honesty, I just
don't want to
see the court denigrated any
further than

16:12.104 --> 16:18.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it would be in this very caustic
election
year with the way things are
going right now.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Even with a
centrist choice?

16:20.046 --> 16:24.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. ORRIN HATCH: Well, who
knows whether
it will be centrist or not. We
will have to

16:24.617 --> 16:26.485 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
see.

16:26.586 --> 16:29.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, the president might pick
somebody that
everybody can agree with. That's
another matter.

16:29.922 --> 16:31.190 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I hope he does.

16:31.290 --> 16:33.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Orrin
Hatch, we thank
you very much.

16:33.659 --> 16:38.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEN. ORRIN HATCH: Well, thank
you.

16:38.764 --> 16:55.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The battle over
privacy vs. security
is back front and center, as
Apple digs in

16:55.348 --> 17:03.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against the FBI and the courts
over the issue
of access to data on its phones.

17:03.556 --> 17:10.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
December 2, 2015, that's the day
Syed Farook
and his wife, Tashfeen Malik,
went on a murderous

17:10.763 --> 17:18.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rampage in San Bernardino,
California, killing
14 people. Hours later, they
were, in turn,

17:18.771 --> 17:25.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
killed by police. Ever since,
the FBI has
been trying to read the contents
of a cell

17:25.111 --> 17:26.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
phone Farook used.

17:26.913 --> 17:29.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY, FBI Director: We
still have one
of those killers' phones that we
have not

17:29.515 --> 17:33.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been able to open. And it's been
over two
months now. We're still working
on it.

17:33.286 --> 17:37.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Last week, FBI
Director James
Comey told a Senate hearing that
the Apple

17:38.090 --> 17:44.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
iPhone's encryption has made it
impossible
for the agency to access its
content.

17:44.430 --> 17:49.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now a federal judge in
California has ordered
the company to create software
that will do

17:49.602 --> 17:55.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just that. But Apple CEO Tim
Cook forcefully
rejected that order early
yesterday, writing

17:56.042 --> 18:01.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a letter addressed to Apple
customers:
"In the wrong hands, this
software, which

18:01.514 --> 18:07.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doesn't exist today, would have
the potential
to unlock any iPhone in
someone's physical

18:07.653 --> 18:09.488 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
possession."

18:09.588 --> 18:14.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House Press Secretary Josh
Earnest disputed
that, saying the government
wants access only

18:14.593 --> 18:17.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the single device associated
with Farook.

18:17.430 --> 18:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
We're not asking Apple to
redesign its products

18:21.701 --> 18:32.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or to create a new back door to
its products.
This is a much more specific
request that

18:32.812 --> 18:34.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Department of Justice has
put forward.

18:34.814 --> 18:40.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Apple stepped up its
protections
after NSA leaker Edward Snowden
exposed government

18:40.453 --> 18:44.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
surveillance of phone traffic in
2013.

18:44.223 --> 18:50.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One feature can even erase the
iPhone's contents
after 10 failed attempts to
unlock it. Prosecutors

18:50.663 --> 18:55.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say they are worried that this
feature could
be on the phone Farook used. And
unless Apple

18:55.668 --> 19:01.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
devises a way to unlock it, they
could lose
all its data. The company now
has five days

19:01.974 --> 19:05.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to make its formal response in
court.

19:05.778 --> 19:11.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now for a look at the wider
stakes surrounding
this case, we turn to Nate
Cardozo, a staff

19:11.350 --> 19:17.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attorney who focuses on digital
civil liberties
for the Electronic Frontier
Foundation. He

19:17.423 --> 19:22.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
joins us from San Francisco. And
Stewart Baker,
former assistant secretary of
homeland security

19:23.062 --> 19:27.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
under George W. Bush
administration and former
general counsel at the National
Security Agency.

19:27.900 --> 19:31.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's now in private practice at
Steptoe &amp; Johnson.

19:31.203 --> 19:36.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stewart Baker, Tim Cook says
that building
this access, this back door
access to the

19:36.308 --> 19:39.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
iPhone, as he describes it,
would permanently
weaken privacy. Is he right?

19:40.012 --> 19:42.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEWART BAKER, Former General
Counsel, National
Security Agency: No, I don't
think he is.

19:42.815 --> 19:51.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The order says you must defeat
this one security
feature, which is the automatic
erasing of

19:51.157 --> 19:57.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all the information on the
phone. And that's
not building a permanent back
door into anything.

19:58.064 --> 20:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's one phone, one order, one
security
feature.

20:01.600 --> 20:05.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, Nate Cardozo, if
it's just
one phone, one order, one
security feature,

20:05.738 --> 20:07.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what is the huzzah all about?

20:07.606 --> 20:10.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NATE CARDOZO, Electronic
Frontier Foundation:
Well, it's not about one phone
and it's not

20:10.342 --> 20:12.211 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about one security feature.

20:12.311 --> 20:18.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The FBI chose this case to get
the precedent,
right? We know who the shooters
were. We know

20:18.818 --> 20:24.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who they were talking to. The
FBI already
has the metadata. They chose
this case because

20:24.423 --> 20:29.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they want precedent that they
can order a
company to design a particular
feature at

20:29.562 --> 20:31.397 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their whim.

20:31.497 --> 20:37.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when you hear Stewart or the
White House
press secretary say it's only
this one phone,

20:37.203 --> 20:38.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that is simply disingenuous.

20:38.704 --> 20:41.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, are we talking
about precedent
here, Stewart Baker?

20:41.574 --> 20:48.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEWART BAKER: Well, there is
longstanding
precedent, 200 years old, that
says that if

20:48.214 --> 20:54.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
someone has an obligation to
help law enforcement
to take action, then the
government can order

20:54.453 --> 20:58.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other people to help that person
carry out
his obligation.

20:58.891 --> 21:04.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If somebody jumps into a cab and
says there
is a bank robber up ahead,
follow that car,

21:04.630 --> 21:09.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the phone -- the cab company has
an obligation
to follow that cab.

21:09.668 --> 21:12.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: What is the
government standing
to make such a request like
this?

21:12.505 --> 21:16.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEWART BAKER: So, there is an
All Writs Act
that has been around for almost
200 years

21:16.375 --> 21:24.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that says that essentially the
government
can ask someone who is in a
uniquely -- unique

21:24.350 --> 21:30.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
position to help to assist in
carrying out
an obligation that law
enforcement has.

21:30.356 --> 21:33.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Nate Cardozo, what
slippery slope
do you envision here?

21:33.659 --> 21:36.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NATE CARDOZO: Well, it is more
than a slippery
slope.

21:36.162 --> 21:41.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stewart, as you well know, no
court in the
United States has ever approved
an order of

21:41.267 --> 21:46.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this breadth under the All Writs
Act. No court
has ever ordered an American
company to compromise

21:46.672 --> 21:50.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the security of all of their
customers. No
court has ever ordered a safe
maker to make

21:51.010 --> 21:53.045 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a master key.

21:53.145 --> 21:57.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the courts that have
addressed it, the
Inray (ph), the company, case
that, I'm sure,

21:57.716 --> 22:03.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stewart, you are aware of, the
court found
that OnStar could not be ordered
to subvert

22:04.056 --> 22:07.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
its emergency phone system and
turn it into
a wiretap act.

22:07.426 --> 22:09.195 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

22:09.295 --> 22:12.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATE CARDOZO: This isn't just --
this isn't
just a slippery slope. If the
FBI is permitted

22:13.065 --> 22:17.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get the order in this case,
that is it.
They will be permitted to get a
back door

22:17.703 --> 22:20.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
order in every case going
forward.

22:20.439 --> 22:25.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And more than that, Apple will
be unable to
resist identical demands from
China, from

22:25.744 --> 22:28.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
India, from Russia. And that is
the end of
secure devices.

22:29.048 --> 22:34.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEWART BAKER: I have to say
that the concern
here that Apple has is, they
have said this

22:34.553 --> 22:39.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
phone cannot be cracked. And now
it turns
out that may not be true. And
they would like

22:39.959 --> 22:45.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to suppress that possibility,
because they're
afraid China or Russia might
order them to

22:45.197 --> 22:47.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
use that capability.

22:47.333 --> 22:51.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China and Russia are perfectly
capable of
ordering Apple to do that
tomorrow, whether

22:51.870 --> 22:54.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have help from a court in
this case or
not.

22:54.440 --> 22:57.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You talk about China
and Russia.
And I want to ask you both this.
How -- since

22:57.810 --> 23:03.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you brought it up -- which is,
how do international
actors see this kind of
discussion that we're

23:03.749 --> 23:06.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
having here? Does it make us
look weak?

23:06.318 --> 23:08.220 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

23:08.320 --> 23:12.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NATE CARDOZO: I think
authoritarian regimes
around the world are salivating
at the prospect

23:12.491 --> 23:14.293 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the FBI winning this order.

23:14.393 --> 23:19.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Apple creates the master key
that the FBI
has demanded that they create,
governments

23:20.099 --> 23:22.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around the world are going to be
demanding
exactly the same access.

23:22.701 --> 23:26.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEWART BAKER: Whether or not
they do that
in response to this order, if
it's possible

23:26.572 --> 23:32.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to build that capability, then
the Russians
and the Chinese are going to
order Apple to

23:32.311 --> 23:38.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do it sooner or later, and
probably sooner,
whether or not the United States
tells Apple

23:38.217 --> 23:40.019 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do this.

23:40.119 --> 23:42.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Can I ask you both
to be -- to
make one thing clear? Do you
both agree that

23:42.554 --> 23:47.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Apple is capable of doing what
they are being
asked to do and they're just
resisting it

23:47.459 --> 23:49.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on principle, Nate Cardozo?

23:49.295 --> 23:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATE CARDOZO: We think that
Apple is capable
of doing it for this generation
of phone.

23:54.433 --> 24:01.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The phone at issue is an iPhone
5c, which
I guess is two generations back
at this point.

24:01.507 --> 24:07.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6s,
it is our
belief that Apple is probably
not capable,

24:07.379 --> 24:11.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at least not capable of using
this exact technique
to unlock.

24:11.116 --> 24:12.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we think they are capable of
unlocking
the 5c.

24:12.951 --> 24:14.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And you think that
is true, Stewart
Baker?

24:14.787 --> 24:18.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEWART BAKER: That is what it
appears from
what Apple has said, that they
think they

24:18.257 --> 24:24.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can do it. They choose not to do
it, notwithstanding
the stakes for terrorism in San
Bernardino.

24:24.930 --> 24:29.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, if you are the
owner of one
of these phones which could be
unlocked if

24:29.401 --> 24:34.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Apple decided to go along with
this, how much
do -- how worried should you be,
Nate Cardozo,

24:34.907 --> 24:37.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that your privacy is about to be
compromised?

24:37.309 --> 24:44.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATE CARDOZO: Well, you know,
every individual
should create, should do their
own threat

24:44.650 --> 24:46.318 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
assessment.

24:46.418 --> 24:50.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If you have particularly
sensitive data, if
you are a human rights worker in
Syria, if

24:51.056 --> 24:56.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you are an LGBT activist in any
country around
the world where you may be
persecuted for

24:56.462 --> 25:02.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your orientation or beliefs,
make sure to
tune up your security in
response to this.

25:03.068 --> 25:04.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Use a pass code longer than four
digits.

25:05.037 --> 25:07.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, I hope that
everyone is
doing that anyway.

25:07.639 --> 25:09.541 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Stewart Baker?

25:09.641 --> 25:12.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEWART BAKER: Yes, I --
certainly there are
times when everyone wants to
worry about security.

25:12.778 --> 25:19.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the idea that the desire for
security
could trump a lawfully obtained
search warrant

25:19.952 --> 25:24.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to find out whether we're at
risk of other
people who conspired with the
San Bernardino

25:24.857 --> 25:29.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shooters right now strikes me as
odd.

25:29.595 --> 25:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for Apple to say well, it
interferes with
our business model and our
consumer trust

25:34.600 --> 25:41.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to help the U.S. government find
out about
this possible additional
attacker doesn't

25:41.373 --> 25:43.342 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
make any sense.

25:43.442 --> 25:46.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: This security vs.
privacy argument,
it sounds to me like it is just
going to continue,

25:46.478 --> 25:48.213 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Nate Cardozo

25:48.313 --> 25:52.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATE CARDOZO: You know, it's not
security
vs. privacy. This is security
vs. surveillance.

25:52.418 --> 25:55.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is security vs. security.

25:55.220 --> 26:00.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before Apple instituted this
level of encryption
on devices, when devices were
stolen, they

26:00.793 --> 26:06.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
were susceptible to any
run-of-the-mill hacker
opening it up. And that is what
the FBI wants

26:06.198 --> 26:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Apple to return to? That's
crazy.

26:08.133 --> 26:10.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: OK. Well, we're
going to have
to leave it there for now.

26:10.436 --> 26:14.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nate Cardozo of the Electronic
Frontier Foundation,
and Stewart Baker, former deputy
assistant

26:14.907 --> 26:21.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
secretary at Department of
Homeland Security,
thank you both.

26:21.947 --> 26:24.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STEWART BAKER: Thanks.

26:25.050 --> 26:29.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NATE CARDOZO: Thank you.

26:29.221 --> 26:34.293 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

26:34.393 --> 26:40.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
notorious apartheid
leader seeks penance for his
wrongs; and the

26:40.833 --> 26:45.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
man who composed the music for
the movie "Carol"
scores his first Oscar
nomination.

26:46.071 --> 26:51.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, in the race for the
White House,
tensions are heating up in South
Carolina.

26:51.844 --> 26:54.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our political director, Lisa
Desjardins, reports.

26:54.746 --> 27:00.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The Republican
2016 race,
already full of twists and
turns, took one

27:01.053 --> 27:06.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more today, when South Carolina
Governor Nikki
Haley announced she is endorsing
Marco Rubio,

27:06.992 --> 27:08.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
four days before the state's
primary.

27:09.094 --> 27:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Otherwise, the contest has
become a blur of
blistering attacks, starting
with the man

27:14.266 --> 27:21.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
at the top, Donald Trump,
target, Ted Cruz.
Cruz has said that Trump is not
truly conservative.

27:21.773 --> 27:25.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cruz has a series of anti-Trump
ads that make
the point.

27:25.110 --> 27:28.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Today, in Bluffton, South
Carolina, Trump
again shot back.

27:28.247 --> 27:31.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
You can't lie about people like
that. It's

27:31.483 --> 27:34.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just incredible. And, again, I
have been in
business and I have dealt with
some pretty

27:34.920 --> 27:39.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rough hombres, much tougher than
Cruz. But
I have never dealt with anybody
that lied

27:39.525 --> 27:41.293 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
so much.

27:41.393 --> 27:45.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As for Cruz,
consider it
the third law of politics. Every
Trump attack

27:45.230 --> 27:46.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gets an equal and opposite
counterattack.

27:46.765 --> 27:48.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
Look, ethics matter.

27:48.901 --> 27:52.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Today, the
Texas senator
went after Trump's attempt to
block his ads.

27:52.871 --> 27:58.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: Mr. Trump has
sent me a legal
cease and desist letter saying,
stop telling

27:58.243 --> 28:04.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the voters my record. Now, that
is, objectively,
legally frivolous.

28:05.050 --> 28:10.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But this is not
a two-man
war, and Cruz is also targeting
fellow Senator

28:10.155 --> 28:12.057 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Marco Rubio.

28:12.157 --> 28:20.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: When you have
Donald Trump
and Marco Rubio repeatedly
putting forth fabrications

28:20.232 --> 28:24.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with no evidence, no basis
whatsoever, just
trying to throw mud and attack.

28:24.836 --> 28:29.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Rubio is more
focused in
his attacks on fellow Senator
Cruz and defense

28:29.708 --> 28:31.476 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
spending.

28:31.577 --> 28:33.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
Some people talk to me, and say,
well, why

28:33.445 --> 28:36.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vote for you and not Ted Cruz?
Well, Ted Cruz
voted for a budget that cut it
even more.

28:37.082 --> 28:39.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not cutting defense spending
when I'm
president.

28:39.251 --> 28:43.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Jeb Bush may
not be in the
top three right now, but he is
not to be left

28:43.388 --> 28:47.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out, firing away in Beaufort
today at Trump,
Rubio and John Kasich.

28:47.759 --> 28:51.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEB BUSH (R), Presidential
Candidate: With
all due respect, Senator Rubio,
your four

28:51.530 --> 28:58.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years or five years or whatever
it is as senator
does not match up to my
capabilities of understanding

28:58.303 --> 28:59.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
how the world works.

28:59.504 --> 29:01.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

29:01.373 --> 29:04.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEB BUSH: Donald Trump says we
don't need
to spend more money on the
military. And John

29:04.476 --> 29:06.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kasich has a similar kind of
view. They're
wrong.

29:06.979 --> 29:11.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Kasich, he kept
his distance
from the scrimmage, hoping a
positive message

29:11.984 --> 29:13.785 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wins.

29:13.885 --> 29:15.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate:
Let's not be negative about the
future of

29:15.354 --> 29:18.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our country or negative about
our country
today. We're doing fine.

29:18.790 --> 29:23.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The Democrats
were less sharp-edged.
But Hillary Clinton, in Chicago,
did seem

29:23.695 --> 29:25.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to dig at her rival, Bernie
Sanders.

29:25.664 --> 29:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
We need a president, yes, who is
passionate

29:28.433 --> 29:34.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about getting, as much as
possible, money
out of politics and reining in
Wall Street,

29:34.773 --> 29:38.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but we need a president who is
passionate
about creating jobs and raising
incomes, like

29:38.510 --> 29:40.278 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I am.

29:40.379 --> 29:43.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Sanders left
the campaign
trail briefly today, returning
to Vermont.

29:43.982 --> 29:50.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Up next? Candidates in both
parties hit national
television for town halls the
next two nights.

29:50.188 --> 29:52.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

29:52.457 --> 29:56.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just three days
away from the
next voting contests, we turn
our attention

29:56.962 --> 30:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Nevada, where Sanders and
Clinton will
face off for the third time, as
well as South

30:02.100 --> 30:04.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Carolina, which we just heard
about.

30:04.369 --> 30:09.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining us tonight from Las
Vegas is Jon Ralston
of "Ralston Live," and from
South Carolina,

30:09.808 --> 30:13.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Randy Covington. He's a
professor of journalism
at the University of South
Carolina. He is

30:14.079 --> 30:18.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also the former news director of
WIS Television
in Columbia.

30:18.316 --> 30:20.185 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Gentlemen, welcome to you both.

30:20.285 --> 30:22.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's start with the Democrats
and Nevada.

30:22.287 --> 30:27.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Jon Ralston, the race has
tightened up there
between Clinton and Sanders.
What has happened?

30:27.259 --> 30:28.927 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

30:29.027 --> 30:32.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON RALSTON, "Ralston Live":
Well, Hillary
Clinton had the state locked up.
She came

30:32.330 --> 30:38.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here early last year, set up an
infrastructure,
hired all these operatives from
2008 who had

30:38.837 --> 30:43.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worked here. She reached out to
the Latino
community. Bernie Sanders was
invisible here.

30:43.442 --> 30:48.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His campaign didn't even arrive
until late
last year, but then slowly the
tide began

30:48.313 --> 30:50.115 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
turning.

30:50.215 --> 30:53.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He started to turn. He raised a
lot of money,
put resources in here, spent
money on TV.

30:53.719 --> 31:00.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then after New Hampshire,
Judy, the tide
completely turned, when she lost
by a landslide

31:00.659 --> 31:04.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in New Hampshire. Her internal
polls showed
she was hemorrhaging. Suddenly,
the Clintons

31:04.763 --> 31:10.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were making New Hampshire and
Iowa seem like
Nevada, when it is nothing like
Nevada. They

31:10.302 --> 31:12.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said it was an all-white state,
essentially.

31:12.904 --> 31:16.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so her campaign essentially
has been in
a freefall here. They have been
trying to

31:16.742 --> 31:21.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stop that. And they're hoping to
have a parachute
before they hit the ground on
Saturday.

31:21.713 --> 31:25.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly,
Jon Ralston,
Hillary Clinton had shown
strength among Latino

31:26.017 --> 31:29.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters. We know she had some
strength among
the labor unions. What has
happened to all

31:30.088 --> 31:31.790 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of that?

31:31.890 --> 31:35.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON RALSTON: Well, she does have
strength
among Latino voters here, Judy.
In fact, she

31:35.460 --> 31:40.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
has had some high-profile
endorsements. She
has Dolores Huerta, the
legendary civil rights

31:40.866 --> 31:43.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
activist, campaigning for her
here today.

31:43.435 --> 31:47.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Henry Cisneros, the former
Cabinet secretary,
mayor of San Antonio, was here.
She has a

31:47.906 --> 31:51.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot of local dreamers, including
maybe the
most famous dreamer in the
country who was

31:51.910 --> 31:55.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on stage with President Obama.
Astrid Silva
has endorsed her.

31:55.680 --> 32:00.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Bernie Sanders has made
inroads. Even
her -- even the Clinton campaign
acknowledges

32:00.318 --> 32:05.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that Sanders' message is
starting to resonate
in the Latino community. So, I
think she will

32:05.891 --> 32:09.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
win Latinos, but will she win by
enough to
win the caucus on Saturday?

32:09.661 --> 32:12.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Randy Covington,
let's turn
to the Democrats in South
Carolina, where

32:13.098 --> 32:17.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton seems to be
holding onto her
lead a little better. What does
it look like?

32:17.302 --> 32:22.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDY COVINGTON, University of
South Carolina:
For the Democrats, there is not
the passion

32:22.574 --> 32:28.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that existed eight years ago
when Barack Obama
was running.

32:28.680 --> 32:36.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most African-American leaders
here are supporting
Clinton. The Sanders message is
fairly alien

32:36.288 --> 32:43.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a conservative state. I think
it's fairly
safe for Hillary Clinton here.
More of the

32:43.795 --> 32:45.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
focus, more of the excitement is
on the other
side.

32:45.664 --> 32:49.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It sure is. And
that's where
all the -- as we saw in that
report from Lisa

32:49.935 --> 32:55.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Desjardins, that is where a lot
of the yelling
and the TV spots are directed.

32:55.640 --> 32:59.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Randy Covington, why is Donald
Trump doing
so well in South Carolina?

33:00.078 --> 33:06.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDY COVINGTON: Well, South
Carolina has
a long history of being
contrarian.

33:06.751 --> 33:13.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Civil War started here. When
the civil
rights legislation passed in the
1960s, we

33:13.692 --> 33:19.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
raised the Confederate Flag on
top of the
statehouse. His message
resonates in a state

33:19.764 --> 33:27.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like this. And at a time in the
nation where
there is frustration over
government, clearly,

33:27.672 --> 33:32.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump has tapped into that. And
in a state
that four years ago in this
primary went for

33:32.911 --> 33:37.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Newt Gingrich, I don't think
there is anything
surprising about Trump's
strength.

33:37.649 --> 33:42.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what about,
though, the
message from Ted Cruz? And we
know that he

33:42.654 --> 33:51.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Trump are in a vicious back
and forth.
Who is listening, who is
responding positively

33:51.229 --> 33:53.064 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Ted Cruz?

33:53.164 --> 34:01.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDY COVINGTON: All right, so,
Judy, if I
could turn the clock back, 16
years, you were

34:01.406 --> 34:05.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
at CNN. I was working in
television at that
time.

34:05.977 --> 34:11.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And John McCain and the Straight
Talk Express
came rolling into South
Carolina. And then

34:11.616 --> 34:20.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things got really interesting.
And I think
we're at this exact same moment
today. You

34:20.525 --> 34:27.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have the apparent front-runners.
However,
it is much more nuanced and
complicated than

34:28.099 --> 34:29.801 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

34:29.901 --> 34:35.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeb Bush, this is his last
stand. And he is
putting enormous strength,
power, resources

34:36.041 --> 34:36.574 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into this.

34:36.675 --> 34:38.310 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

34:38.410 --> 34:40.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, meanwhile,
if I could
interrupt, you -- I was going to
say, you

34:40.312 --> 34:46.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had your governor, Nikki Haley,
today endorsing
Marco Rubio, which is mixing
things...

34:46.851 --> 34:47.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RANDY COVINGTON: Sure.

34:47.852 --> 34:48.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does that help
him a lot?

34:48.586 --> 34:50.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RANDY COVINGTON: Absolutely.

34:50.488 --> 34:59.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you have Bush, who I think
is ascendant,
strong debate performance. You
have Rubio.

34:59.564 --> 35:05.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just a few minutes ago, the
influential State
newspaper here in Columbia
endorsed Kasich.

35:05.804 --> 35:13.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think this field is very
much in play.
Probably, most people expect the
insurgent

35:13.545 --> 35:21.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
message of Trump to win. But
everything else
is very volatile. Where I live,
every day,

35:21.886 --> 35:24.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
my phone rings incessantly with
robo-calls.

35:24.856 --> 35:37.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I brought in my props. This is
from my mailbox
in the last two days, three
pro-Jeb, one anti-Jeb,

35:37.435 --> 35:45.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one anti-Trump, two anti-Rubio,
one pro-Rubio.
Well, I think there is much more
to unfold

35:45.677 --> 35:46.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the next few hours.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It sounds like,
and in the
next few days.

35:48.813 --> 35:51.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, meanwhile, back to Nevada
and Jon Ralston.

35:51.116 --> 35:56.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republicans are competing
there one week
later. How is that shaping up,
or is everything

35:56.688 --> 35:59.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on hold until they see how South
Carolina
goes?

35:59.157 --> 36:03.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON RALSTON: Well, they're
waiting to come
here until after South Carolina,
Judy.

36:03.395 --> 36:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Donald Trump is dominating
here in the
polls. The other campaigns that
are organized

36:08.533 --> 36:13.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here, Cruz, Bush and Rubio, all
privately
acknowledge they're fighting for
second place,

36:13.638 --> 36:17.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but that could be important,
depending on
what happens in South Carolina.

36:17.142 --> 36:21.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think Nevada is going to
mirror what
is happening elsewhere, that as
long as there

36:21.446 --> 36:27.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are three or four candidates
running against
Donald Trump, he will get his
25, 30, 35 percent

36:27.118 --> 36:31.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the rest are going to divide
it up, until
someone decides to get out or a
couple of

36:31.923 --> 36:33.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
them decide to get out.

36:33.825 --> 36:36.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will be interesting to see
what happens
in South Carolina, because I
think that will

36:36.161 --> 36:40.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have an impact on Nevada, but
probably only
on who finishes in second and

JUDY WOODRUFF: One thing is for
sure. It's
not dull.

36:43.635 --> 36:50.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jon Ralston, Randy Covington,
thank you both.

36:50.875 --> 37:08.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A generation has
passed since
South Africa ended apartheid.
And while the

37:08.526 --> 37:14.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
country has made progress
towards reconciling
years of state-sanctioned,
violent oppression,

37:14.566 --> 37:16.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the reckoning continues.

37:16.501 --> 37:21.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, there have
been smaller,
individual efforts to do
penance.

37:21.506 --> 37:26.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, special correspondent
Martin Seemungal
brings us the story of a man who
was once

37:26.644 --> 37:31.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the very symbol of apartheid, as
he tries
to make amends.

37:31.483 --> 37:39.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: It is an
unusual scene in
South Africa, a white man in his
late '70s

37:40.058 --> 37:44.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a black township delivering
free food to
the needy.

37:44.829 --> 37:53.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's not just what the man
is doing. It's
who the man is or, who he was.
His name is

37:53.238 --> 37:59.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Adriaan Vlok, and he was a
cabinet minister
during the harshest years of
apartheid, known

37:59.244 --> 38:03.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as a ruthless defender of white
minority rule
over the black majority.

38:03.548 --> 38:07.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MONDLI MAKHANYA, City Press:
Adriaan Vlok
was the manifestation of the
evil that the

38:08.052 --> 38:12.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
apartheid regime was. And he was
the worst
of the worst.

38:12.257 --> 38:18.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Mondli
Makhanya was an anti-apartheid
activist then. Today, he is an
outspoken editorial

38:18.563 --> 38:20.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
writer for a Johannesburg
newspaper.

38:20.398 --> 38:28.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MONDLI MAKHANYA: From the
mid-1980s, I would
venture to say, other than
President P.W.

38:28.973 --> 38:35.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Botha at the time, he was the
most evil man
in South Africa, and he was the
face of the

38:35.847 --> 38:38.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
evil of the apartheid regime.

38:39.017 --> 38:47.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: As minister of
law and order,
Vlok was responsible for the
police, the shock

38:47.792 --> 38:55.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
troops in the war against black
activists
fighting apartheid. A bloody,
violent fight,

38:55.967 --> 39:02.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thousands were killed. Tens of
thousands were
detained, locked up without
trial, all under

39:02.907 --> 39:04.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the watch of Adriaan Vlok.

39:04.409 --> 39:07.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Adriaan Vlok, Former South
African Minister
of Law and Order: Hello.

39:07.278 --> 39:11.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Three decades
later now,
in the black township of
Olievenhoutbosch,

39:11.683 --> 39:15.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Vlok passes unrecognized as he
does his rounds.

39:15.787 --> 39:21.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vlok visits this township every
week, delivering
food donated by local
supermarkets to three

39:21.359 --> 39:27.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
day care centers and a charity
for the disabled.
He is reaching out to the people
he once helped

39:27.332 --> 39:32.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
oppress to atone for what he
calls the sin
of apartheid.

39:32.136 --> 39:40.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vlok has always been a devout
Christian, but
in the early years, he believed
in white superiority.

39:40.511 --> 39:45.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His transformation began after
the fall of
apartheid and the first all-race
elections.

39:45.683 --> 39:50.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over a period of about 10 years,
he began
to rethink and ultimately
repent.

39:50.421 --> 39:56.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADRIAAN VLOK: I told about my
sins. I submitted
to the lord and said, lord, I
have sinned.

39:56.694 --> 39:59.264 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Here I am. Please forgive me.

39:59.364 --> 40:04.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am not offering any excuses. I
cannot offer
an excuse that this and this
were the reason

40:04.836 --> 40:09.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why I did that. I am -- I am
guilty. I am
sorry. Will you please forgive
me?

40:09.240 --> 40:15.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: So, his
mission today is
about redemption. It's about
reconciliation.

40:15.680 --> 40:21.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Forty-three-year-old Dinah
Sekese runs the
disabled center Vlok is helping.
As an 18-year-old,

40:22.086 --> 40:26.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she joined the protests against
the apartheid
regime. She knew who he was.

40:26.658 --> 40:32.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DINAH SEKESE, Volunteer Relief
Worker: I know
the man was -- that Adriaan
Vlok, for me,

40:32.630 --> 40:34.332 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was a bad man.

40:34.432 --> 40:37.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: In the several
years she
has worked with Vlok, she never
showed him

40:37.101 --> 40:43.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the scars from the rubber
bullets fired by
his police in 1986, but, on this
day, she

40:43.841 --> 40:48.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did. She told him it happened
during a march
on a police station.

40:48.246 --> 40:50.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DINAH SEKESE: Stones go...

40:50.114 --> 40:52.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADRIAAN VLOK: From behind you.

40:52.417 --> 40:58.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DINAH SEKESE: ... over me. And I
was like
-- and then I hear pop, pop,
pop, pop, in

40:58.823 --> 41:07.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the front. And almost eight
rubber bullets
hit me. My arms, or you can see
all over,

41:07.265 --> 41:08.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

41:09.033 --> 41:14.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADRIAAN VLOK: I can't take away
that scar,
but I can love her and I can
help her.

41:15.006 --> 41:22.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Painful
memories for Dinah,
poignantly ironic that Adriaan
Vlok is the

41:22.213 --> 41:26.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
one offering comfort.

41:26.384 --> 41:32.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obviously, they were police
under your ultimate
command.

41:32.156 --> 41:39.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADRIAAN VLOK: Yes. Yes. I feel
bad. I didn't
feel good about that. I feel
sorry that this

41:39.364 --> 41:45.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has happened. And, as I said, I
can't take
away their scars. They are
there. They are

41:45.269 --> 41:48.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there as a witness to what we
did to these
people.

41:48.239 --> 41:53.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: The most
infamous case linked
to Vlok was the attempt to
assassinate Frank

41:53.478 --> 41:56.047 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Chikane.

41:56.147 --> 42:00.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reverend Frank Chikane was a key
member of
the anti-apartheid leadership.
In the late

42:00.885 --> 42:04.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
'80s, the apartheid government
saw him as
a significant threat.

42:04.555 --> 42:10.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Did you give the instruction to
kill Frank
Chikane? Or was that -- how did
that come

42:11.062 --> 42:12.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about? Who made that decision?

42:12.897 --> 42:16.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADRIAAN VLOK: His name was put
before me,
and I said there is an
instruction that you

42:16.934 --> 42:22.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could consider killing him. And
I said, do
it, so I pass it on.

42:23.074 --> 42:29.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Vlok says he
didn't know
how or when it would be done. In
1989, Chikane's

42:29.981 --> 42:33.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clothes were laced with poison.
He barely
survived.

42:33.317 --> 42:40.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2006, Vlok confessed to his
involvement
in and was given a 10-year
suspended sentence.

42:40.224 --> 42:46.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he wanted to do more, an act
to underscore
his sincerity. In a private
meeting with Chikane,

42:46.798 --> 42:50.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he offered to wash his feet.
Vlok admits he
was afraid.

42:50.868 --> 42:58.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADRIAAN VLOK: I have been a guy
in this country
who had power. I was a minister.
And I am

42:58.476 --> 43:07.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Afrikaans-speaking, and I am a
white man.
And here I am going to bow down
on my knees

43:07.585 --> 43:09.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in front of a black man.

43:09.587 --> 43:14.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I stuttered. And I asked him
the question,
"Will you please allow me to
wash your feet?"

43:14.459 --> 43:17.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he was taken aback. He said,
"But why
do you want to do that?"

43:18.029 --> 43:24.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we talk a little bit. I
said, "Frank,
I believe that I have hurt you
through apartheid

43:24.368 --> 43:28.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and through what we did to you
and your family."

43:28.105 --> 43:32.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said to me, "OK, you can wash
my feet."

43:33.010 --> 43:36.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I cried. And I think Frank
cried. And
he prayed, and I prayed.

43:36.681 --> 43:41.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: The people who
work with
Vlok in the township do not
doubt his sincerity.

43:41.152 --> 43:45.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DINAH SEKESE: And they say, can
you believe
Adriaan Vlok can change? I said,
I believe

43:45.823 --> 43:53.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what I saw. What I see is what I
believe,
and then I am ready to tell that
Adriaan Vlok

43:53.564 --> 43:54.765 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has changed.

43:54.866 --> 43:56.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: And they
believe he should
be forgiven.

43:56.701 --> 44:03.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DINAH SEKESE: Here in our
country, the only
thing that we appreciate is when
a person

44:03.241 --> 44:10.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comes out and says, sorry. Can
you please
forgive me? It's what we want.
And I believe

44:10.181 --> 44:13.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's something that builds this
peace that
we have in this country.

44:13.818 --> 44:18.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: But Mondli
Makhanya says
there is still enormous
bitterness among black

44:18.489 --> 44:23.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South Africans because of the
crimes committed
by the apartheid regime. Not
everyone is willing

44:23.961 --> 44:25.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to forgive so easily.

44:25.830 --> 44:31.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MONDLI MAKHANYA: Ideally, people
like Adriaan
Vlok should have gone to prison
for a very

44:31.335 --> 44:36.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
long time. But it was necessary,
in the wisdom
of Mandela, that, actually, we
make those

44:36.207 --> 44:39.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
compromises. But forgiveness
comes hard.

44:39.544 --> 44:45.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADRIAAN VLOK: I think it is of
the utmost
importance, because if you are
not prepared

44:45.216 --> 44:53.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to forgive and to be reconciled,
what is the
-- what is the alternative? It
is hatred,

44:53.424 --> 44:59.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I blame you, they blame me, and
we will not
find each other.

44:59.363 --> 45:06.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: A scene like
this would
have been unimaginable 30 years
ago, South

45:06.671 --> 45:12.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Africa's most feared apartheid
minister embracing
young black children singing the
national

45:12.843 --> 45:14.745 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
anthem.

45:14.845 --> 45:20.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Adriaan Vlok says he will
dedicate his remaining
years to peace and
reconciliation one day

45:20.618 --> 45:23.921 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at a time.

45:24.021 --> 45:28.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Martin Seemungal
in Olievenhoutbosch Township
near Pretoria,

45:29.026 --> 45:30.995 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
South Africa.

45:31.095 --> 45:37.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tomorrow, as part of
our yearlong
series Race Matters: Solutions,
special correspondent

45:37.535 --> 45:48.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Charlayne Hunter-Gault reports
on similar
reconciliation efforts here at
home, in Birmingham,

45:48.613 --> 45:50.748 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Alabama.

45:50.848 --> 46:00.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally: A little
more than
a week away, the Academy Awards
recognize

46:00.891 --> 46:05.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the many elements both seen and
unseen that
go into filmmaking.

46:05.630 --> 46:07.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One of those is the musical
score.

46:07.732 --> 46:12.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown visited
Oscar-nominated film
composer Carter Burwell recently
in his New

46:13.070 --> 46:18.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
York studio to see how he
creates the soundtracks
to the movies.

46:18.976 --> 46:26.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's one of the
elements of
film that often goes unnoticed,
unless it's

46:26.751 --> 46:32.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very bad, or, in the case of
"Carol," very
good, the musical score.

46:32.723 --> 46:37.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARTER BURWELL, Composer: You
know, I think
of that theme as being about the
heart-beating

46:37.728 --> 46:46.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
excitement and mystery of seeing
someone and
feeling that tug.

46:46.170 --> 46:52.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Carter Burwell
has been composing
music for movies for more than
30 years. And

46:52.910 --> 46:57.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the first time, he's been
nominated for
an Oscar for his work on the
film directed

46:57.114 --> 47:01.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by Todd Haynes about two women
falling in
love in postwar America.

47:01.652 --> 47:07.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARTER BURWELL: I don't want
there to be music
in the scene, or in the film,
just because

47:07.158 --> 47:11.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's expected, I want it to be
there to say
something, and ideally to say
something that

47:12.063 --> 47:14.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you wouldn't otherwise -- that
wouldn't otherwise
be said.

47:14.799 --> 47:20.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, "Carol" is a perfect
example of
this, because it's very sparse
for dialogue

47:20.638 --> 47:27.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to begin with, and also it's a
love story
between two women at a time when
that actually

47:27.878 --> 47:29.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
couldn't be spoken of openly.

47:29.280 --> 47:30.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Literally
unspoken.

47:31.082 --> 47:34.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CARTER BURWELL: Literally
unspoken. And the
music is saying a lot that the
characters

47:34.852 --> 47:36.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
either can't or won't say.

47:36.754 --> 47:42.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: A one-time
architecture student
and punk rocker, Burwell has
composed music

47:42.126 --> 47:48.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for more than 80 films,
beginning with the
Coen brothers' "Blood Simple" in
1984.

47:48.432 --> 47:56.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since then, he's done most of
their major
films, including the
just-released "Hail,

47:56.574 --> 48:08.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Caesar!." He's also worked on
commercial giants,
like the "Twilight" saga, and
this year composed

48:08.686 --> 48:20.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
music for the Oscar-nominated
stop-motion
picture "Anomalisa."

48:20.164 --> 48:24.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Burwell often begins by reading
a script to
determine, with the director,
what kind of

48:24.635 --> 48:27.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
music, if any, might be
appropriate.

48:27.505 --> 48:32.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARTER BURWELL: If it is early
in the process,
we can have a conversation that
at least suggests

48:32.676 --> 48:36.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what type of instrumentation
there might be.
In other words, how expensive
might this music

48:36.747 --> 48:39.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be? Is there going to be a
symphony orchestra?
Is it going to be a guy with a
ukulele?

48:39.550 --> 48:42.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Wait a minute. So
that's the
first thing, is how expensive it
is, not the

48:42.720 --> 48:47.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- what are we looking for here,
what kind
of sound, what kind of...

48:47.191 --> 48:52.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARTER BURWELL: Well, you know,
they go hand
in hand, but, early on,
honestly, figuring

48:52.396 --> 48:56.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out the budget is -- especially,
you know,
I work on a lot of low-budget
films, and squeezing

48:56.867 --> 48:59.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
everything and fitting it as
tightly as you
can is important.

49:00.004 --> 49:05.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He doesn't begin
writing music
until he watches early cuts of
the scenes,

49:05.543 --> 49:12.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
using visual cues, the look the
director is
after, to determine his musical
ones.

49:12.550 --> 49:17.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the case of "Carol," he
created individual
instrumental voices, both
woodwinds, for the

49:17.855 --> 49:19.623 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two women.

49:19.723 --> 49:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARTER BURWELL: I thought they
would be capable
of the fluidity that would seem
feminine,

49:29.133 --> 49:33.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and also appropriate to the look
of the film.

49:34.071 --> 49:43.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This is before we
have even
met the two women in the film.
Right?

49:43.113 --> 49:44.281 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARTER BURWELL: Exactly, right.

49:44.381 --> 49:45.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So you have
introduced the
characters.

49:45.950 --> 49:49.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARTER BURWELL: That's right. I
have introduced
-- that's right, exactly.

49:49.887 --> 49:54.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Another example,
this time
with the piano filling in the
dialogue, comes

49:54.325 --> 49:58.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a key scene in which the two
women drive
to "Carol"'s house.

49:58.462 --> 50:04.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARTER BURWELL: The left hand of
the piano
is playing a rhythm, but it goes
into these

50:05.002 --> 50:10.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
echoes that pile up and pile up,
so that you
kind of lose the rhythm. The
right hand of

50:10.975 --> 50:18.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the piano is different. It's
crystal-clear,
and sort of pointillistic, and
very simple.

50:18.649 --> 50:22.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And we're inside
a different
universe now, right, in the car.

50:22.720 --> 50:26.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARTER BURWELL: Exactly, and the
way it's
shot, it gets more and more
subjective. It's

50:26.857 --> 50:33.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just a little fur, a glove,
something like
that.

50:33.230 --> 50:39.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: With "Carol,"
Burwell had eight
weeks to craft the music, but,
in this world,

50:39.670 --> 50:41.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
even that is longer than usual.

50:41.605 --> 50:46.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARTER BURWELL: It's deadline
composing. That's
-- there are a lot of qualities
that maybe

50:46.210 --> 50:52.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make you a film composer, but
dealing with
deadlines and that kind of
stress is certainly

50:52.116 --> 50:53.918 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an essential one.

50:54.018 --> 50:58.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Another key to
this aspect
of filmmaking, Burwell says, is
to think of

50:58.722 --> 51:01.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
music like any other tool of
storytelling.

51:01.191 --> 51:07.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARTER BURWELL: As a viewer and
listener,
I prefer to be a little less
informed. I prefer

51:07.598 --> 51:13.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that feeling of discomfort and
uncertainty
about, I'm not sure what's going
on. I -- what's

51:13.537 --> 51:16.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
happening here in this scene?

51:16.740 --> 51:28.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Music, no matter what specific
thing it's
saying, it does lend a certain
emotional comfort.

51:28.385 --> 51:33.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you withhold that --
like, the perfect
example is the movie "No Country
For Old Men."

51:33.691 --> 51:37.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We realized that whenever we put
anything
that sounded like music in the
movie, the

51:37.761 --> 51:49.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tension evaporated, or lessened
anyway. And
that movie's all tension.

51:49.440 --> 52:11.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You have done
scores for 80
or 90 films.

52:11.595 --> 52:12.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARTER BURWELL: Apparently.

52:13.030 --> 52:15.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Apparently, yes.
Never won
an Oscar.

52:15.899 --> 52:17.701 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARTER BURWELL: Apparently.

52:17.801 --> 52:19.636 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:19.737 --> 52:25.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, are you
anticipating, excited
by, or trying to stay away from
the whole

52:25.509 --> 52:27.211 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thing, or what?

52:27.311 --> 52:31.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARTER BURWELL: You know, I love
this work,
and I have great admiration for
my -- you

52:31.849 --> 52:33.784 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
know, my peers.

52:33.884 --> 52:38.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But it's also not -- the
industry is not -- mainstream
awards are not the most
important thing to

52:38.222 --> 52:41.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me. But I think it's great. No,
keep your
Oscar.

52:41.625 --> 52:43.360 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:43.460 --> 52:44.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARTER BURWELL: No, I'm looking
forward to
it. It will be -- it's going to
be fun.

52:45.095 --> 52:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Carter Burwell,
congratulations,
and good luck, and thank you.

52:49.900 --> 52:51.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CARTER BURWELL: Well, thanks a
lot.
