JUDY WOODRUFF: And now to the
day's other big story, and
that is the collapse of Senate

00:04.866 --> 00:07.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republican efforts to
pass a health care bill.

00:07.733 --> 00:12.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A last-ditch effort
for a partial repeal of
Obamacare failed by a
single vote early today,

00:14.333 --> 00:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
frustrating Republican
leaders and the president.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Lisa Desjardins
begins our coverage.

00:19.400 --> 00:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: President Trump
today showed no sign of backing
down, despite the stunning

00:25.566 --> 00:27.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Senate defeat.

00:27.633 --> 00:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of
the United States: They should
have approved health care last

00:29.400 --> 00:31.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
night, but you can't
have everything.

00:31.700 --> 00:33.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Boy, oh, boy.

00:33.233 --> 00:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have been working on
that one for seven years.

00:35.500 --> 00:36.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Can you believe that?

00:36.500 --> 00:37.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
The swamp.

00:37.500 --> 00:40.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But we will get it done.

00:40.166 --> 00:42.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're going get it done.

00:42.166 --> 00:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: At an event for
police officers in Ronkonkoma,
New York, he was blunt.

00:45.133 --> 00:50.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: You
know, I said from the
beginning, let Obamacare
implode, and then do it.

00:51.933 --> 00:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I turned out to be right.

00:54.366 --> 00:55.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let Obamacare implode.

00:55.666 --> 00:57.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

00:57.200 --> 01:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: All this after
the Senate's overnight drama.

01:03.166 --> 01:04.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Outside the Capitol stood
a crowd of protesters.

01:04.466 --> 01:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Inside, around 10:00 p.m.

01:06.533 --> 01:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last night, Republicans had
just released their bill, and
Democrats like Chris Murphy

01:10.733 --> 01:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were irate that the vote on
it was in just two hours.

01:14.533 --> 01:16.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:16.600 --> 01:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS MURPHY (D), Connecticut:
This is nuclear-grade bonkers,
what is happening here tonight.

01:19.700 --> 01:24.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Hawaii Democrat
Mazie Hirono, now being treated
for kidney cancer, added

01:24.666 --> 01:25.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a personal dimension.

01:25.666 --> 01:27.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:27.700 --> 01:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAZIE HIRONO (D), Hawaii: I
lost a sister to pneumonia
when she was only 2 years old

01:32.633 --> 01:35.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Japan.

01:35.233 --> 01:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She died at home, so I know
how important health care is.

01:39.500 --> 01:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What I don't get is why
every single senator
doesn't know that know that.

01:46.533 --> 01:49.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: A frustrated
Senator Mike Enzi, Republican
of Wyoming, said Democrats

01:49.666 --> 01:50.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
offered only complaints.

01:50.766 --> 01:52.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:52.766 --> 01:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL B. ENZI (R),
Wyoming: And I started
hearing, it's not perfect.

01:55.133 --> 01:57.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not perfect.

01:57.133 --> 02:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, where are the
suggestions for making it
as near perfect as possible?

02:03.266 --> 02:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And so, shortly
after midnight, a first vote
began, with Democrats somber

02:07.466 --> 02:09.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and in their seats.

02:09.333 --> 02:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the opposite side,
slowly arriving Republicans
were more social.

02:13.133 --> 02:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But something notable, Alaska
Senator Lisa Murkowski walked
over to Arizona's John McCain,

02:19.200 --> 02:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and he signaled a thumbs down.

02:21.133 --> 02:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Murkowski, along with Susan
Collins of Maine, were
two expected no votes.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Soon, Vice President Mike Pence
stepped over, shook hands and
then spent a long 20 minutes

02:32.233 --> 02:35.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
apparently trying to
win McCain's vote.

02:35.333 --> 02:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Minutes later, another signal.

02:37.533 --> 02:39.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
McCain walked over to Democrats.

02:39.533 --> 02:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A large group surrounded him.

02:41.600 --> 02:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nearby, GOP Leader Mitch
McConnell walked the other way,
just as McCain was embraced

02:47.800 --> 02:50.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by California's
Dianne Feinstein.

02:50.866 --> 02:55.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The final vote resembled a
great sporting event, Democrats
on their feet as McCain walked

02:56.733 --> 02:58.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up to vote.

02:58.666 --> 03:01.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some, like Massachusetts'
Elizabeth Warren,
leaned to watch him.

03:01.366 --> 03:05.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he signaled his vote
with a simple thumbs down.

03:05.066 --> 03:07.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

03:07.600 --> 03:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Democrats
gasped and clapped,
before their leader waved
them off and stopped

03:11.933 --> 03:13.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the applause.

03:13.566 --> 03:17.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Outside, protesters
did not hold back.

03:17.300 --> 03:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It all marked a seismic shift
in momentum and emotions.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:21.933 --> 03:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: This is, you know,
clearly a disappointing moment.

03:24.366 --> 03:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Republican
Leader McConnell thanked his
side and slammed Democrats.

03:27.933 --> 03:29.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:29.966 --> 03:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL: Now, I imagine
many of our colleagues on the
other side are celebrating.

03:32.400 --> 03:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the American people are
going to regret that we couldn't
find a better way forward.

03:41.333 --> 03:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as I said, we look forward
to our colleagues on the other
side suggesting what they have

03:49.833 --> 03:51.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in mind.

03:51.700 --> 03:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As the
night turned to day,
bipartisan calls grew louder.

03:57.700 --> 03:59.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democratic Minority Leader Chuck
Schumer said his party is ready.

03:59.766 --> 04:01.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:01.966 --> 04:02.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY),
Minority Leader: I hope
we can work together to
make the system better

04:02.766 --> 04:05.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a bipartisan way.

04:05.766 --> 04:09.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I'm optimistic
that that can happen.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Nobody has said
Obamacare is perfect.

04:12.366 --> 04:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nobody has said our health care
system doesn't need fixing.

04:15.566 --> 04:18.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: So,
where does that begin?

04:18.066 --> 04:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Likely with a return to the
traditional committee process.

04:21.400 --> 04:26.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Lisa
joins me now for more,
along with Sarah Kliff.

04:28.266 --> 04:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's a senior policy
correspondent for the Web site
Vox, and she covers health care.

04:31.033 --> 04:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And you were with us last night.

04:32.833 --> 04:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we wanted to have you
both with us again tonight.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, Lisa, what a lot of drama.

04:37.100 --> 04:39.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You were up most of the
night covering that.

04:39.600 --> 04:40.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where do things stand?

04:40.600 --> 04:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where do they go from here?

04:42.700 --> 04:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It seems like
the idea is that perhaps they
can get help from the Health

04:45.800 --> 04:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Committee, which is the
Health, Labor and Pensions
Committee in the Senate.

04:49.833 --> 04:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One reason for that, Judy,
not just because its covers
health care, but because of its

04:52.766 --> 04:54.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
leaders.

04:54.833 --> 04:57.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Senator Lamar Alexander
of Tennessee is the
Republican chairman,
and the ranking Democrat

04:57.400 --> 05:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is Patty Murray, both of them
senior members of their party
who thought are of very highly

05:02.133 --> 05:04.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and who have done
bipartisan deals before.

05:04.800 --> 05:07.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Senator Alexander is
planning hearings.

05:07.033 --> 05:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're hoping that
something comes of this
in the way of legislation.

05:09.766 --> 05:13.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Also, Judy, there were
conversations on and off
the floor last night.

05:13.066 --> 05:17.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Perdue told me already
Republicans and Democrats
speaking with each other.

05:17.266 --> 05:19.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But they all have
one problem still.

05:19.166 --> 05:21.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Unclear what could pass.

05:21.233 --> 05:24.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It seemed like last night's
vote was very close, but the
truth is, Judy, is that McCain

05:24.466 --> 05:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was expressing something
a lot of Republicans felt.

05:27.233 --> 05:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This bill was far short of a
number of people who really
wanted it to become law.

05:31.433 --> 05:33.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what
are the roadblocks?

05:33.933 --> 05:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is it figuring out the policy?

05:35.966 --> 05:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because I have had people
say to me, well, if you could
just put folks in a room and

05:39.133 --> 05:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not worry about politics,
you could get it done.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But you're suggesting
it's not that simple.

05:44.100 --> 05:47.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: It's
complicated because
Republicans have tried
to put a lot of together

05:47.400 --> 05:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
different ideas together here.

05:49.433 --> 05:52.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For one, Planned Parenthood,
defunding Planned Parenthood
has been part of that.

05:52.366 --> 05:55.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That's something that
Susan Collins and Lisa
Murkowski haven't liked.

05:55.400 --> 05:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is an idea that, if they
pared it down and focused on
fixing the Affordable Care

05:59.333 --> 06:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Act, that perhaps, perhaps
they can come up with
some ideas they share.

06:03.200 --> 06:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But this is just less than 24
hours after things fell apart.

06:07.666 --> 06:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But that is the hope right now.

06:09.733 --> 06:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's talk
about what's at stake as they
figure this out, Sarah Kliff,

06:13.933 --> 06:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because, until there is new
legislation, the Affordable
Care Act is in effect.

06:19.533 --> 06:20.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's out there.

06:20.833 --> 06:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's going to happen to it?

06:22.433 --> 06:24.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SARAH KLIFF, Vox: That
is a fantastic question,
and you're right.

06:24.533 --> 06:27.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are millions of
people who get coverage
through the Affordable
Care Act, particularly

06:27.433 --> 06:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
through the marketplaces.

06:29.100 --> 06:32.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
These are people who buy
private insurance, often
with tax subsidies,.

06:32.900 --> 06:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we are expecting some pretty
significant premium increases
unless we have some kind

06:36.433 --> 06:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of changes in policy from
the Trump administration.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have done some things
to increase uncertainty.

06:41.533 --> 06:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when insurance companies
sense uncertainty, they
react by raising prices.

06:45.233 --> 06:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what we're seeing
in the marketplaces right now.

06:47.866 --> 06:51.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What
are insurance companies
- - I know it's only
been not even 24 hours

06:51.733 --> 06:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since this happened, but
what's your understanding,
from having reported on
this for a long time,

06:57.766 --> 06:59.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that insurance
companies need to have?

06:59.833 --> 07:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are they looking for
as Congress works its way
through at this point?

07:02.833 --> 07:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SARAH KLIFF: They're going
to be looking for two things.

07:05.300 --> 07:08.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They want to know that
the individual mandate,
the requirement to
carry health insurance,

07:08.833 --> 07:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that will be enforced by
the Trump administration.

07:11.233 --> 07:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even though the Trump
administration has been
negative on that provision,
they want to know

07:14.533 --> 07:18.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they will tell people, if
you don't buy insurance, there
is a fine because they think

07:18.600 --> 07:21.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that gets healthy people
to sign up for coverage.

07:21.100 --> 07:24.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They also want a guarantee
from President Trump that he
will continue paying threat

07:24.566 --> 07:27.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cost-sharing
reduction subsidies.

07:27.200 --> 07:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's this $8 million --
or $8 billion -- excuse me
-- fund that helps offset
co-pays for low-income

07:32.200 --> 07:33.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Americans.

07:33.700 --> 07:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't know if they're
going to get that money.

07:35.233 --> 07:37.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they want a
guarantee on that.

07:37.300 --> 07:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, meantime,
Lisa, what the president has
said -- in fact, he said it

07:40.233 --> 07:44.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - was tweeting this morning
and last night - - let Obamacare
implode, which sounds like

07:44.966 --> 07:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's not going to be
putting any money out there.

07:47.233 --> 07:50.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right, nor does
it sound like he necessarily
wants to enforce the individual

07:50.766 --> 07:52.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or employer mandates.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So that's a real question
for Congress now.

07:54.833 --> 07:58.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does Congress take action
to force, for example,
those cost-sharing
reductions, that $8 billion,

07:58.966 --> 08:01.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think it's $10
billion next year?

08:01.233 --> 08:03.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Does Congress fund
that on its own?

08:03.200 --> 08:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are many Republicans
would like to do that, but they
know that anything right now

08:07.666 --> 08:11.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in Congress like that
is a heavy lift, but it
is in the conversation.

08:11.033 --> 08:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there --
Sarah, as you talk to folks out
there in the health care world,

08:15.333 --> 08:20.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
whether it's insurance
companies, hospitals,
and the others, are they
coming up with another

08:21.066 --> 08:22.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
approach at all this?

08:22.566 --> 08:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are they standing back
with their fingers crossed?

08:25.633 --> 08:28.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How do they look
at this right now?

08:28.166 --> 08:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH KLIFF: The insurance
companies in particular
have been quite vocal,
really less vocal in

08:32.300 --> 08:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the repeal fight, and much
more vocal on stabilization.

08:35.033 --> 08:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They keep talking about
the cost-sharing reduction
subsidies, about the
individual mandate.

08:41.966 --> 08:44.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even just today, after we saw
repeal fail, we saw this flurry
of letters from insurance

08:44.666 --> 08:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
companies saying, we need
stabilization right now.

08:47.033 --> 08:49.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we are getting
close to the deadline.

08:49.633 --> 08:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Insurance companies
have to decide in about
September if they're going
to sell on healthcare.gov

08:53.566 --> 08:55.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or not.

08:55.633 --> 08:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And these are assurances
they are asking before they
sign those contract letters.

08:58.433 --> 09:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, if they're
on that kind of timeline,
Lisa, it takes Congress a while

09:03.000 --> 09:04.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to get things done.

09:04.466 --> 09:07.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They did have at least some
recess coming in August.

09:07.966 --> 09:11.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What does the timeline
look like there and what
about House members?

09:11.333 --> 09:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have had an even more
conservative position on
this than in the Senate.

09:15.700 --> 09:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The Senate
is in session two more weeks.

09:17.366 --> 09:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's part of the August
recess that they rolled back.

09:19.800 --> 09:24.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I don't expect major action,
but perhaps conversations
can tart happening that give

09:24.100 --> 09:28.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
us an idea of whether
something tangible is
possible in September.

09:28.500 --> 09:32.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As for the House, Speaker Ryan
put out a statement saying he
was disappointed and frustrated.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think the real feelings
of House members were expressed
better by Diane Black of the

09:35.433 --> 09:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Budget Committee, who lashed
out at the Senate, said it was
a slap in the face of what the

09:39.900 --> 09:41.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
House had done.

09:41.966 --> 09:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it seems like that is
going to be a real problem in
the two chambers trusting each

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
other in the future.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is some hope that they
could do something by September,
but I'm not sure what that's

09:50.633 --> 09:52.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
based on, to be honest.

09:52.666 --> 09:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes, I think
people -- a lot of people, it
seems to me, Sarah, are standing

09:54.666 --> 09:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back saying, can the two
parties work together now, when
clearly the Republicans, acting

10:00.400 --> 10:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on their own, it didn't happen?

10:02.500 --> 10:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH KLIFF: And lot of it,
honestly, rests with the Trump
administration at this point.

10:05.333 --> 10:07.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They are creating a
lot of the uncertainty.

10:07.866 --> 10:11.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's been interesting
to watch their Health
and Human Services
Department, which has kind

10:11.000 --> 10:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of acted as an attack shop
on the Affordable Care Act.

10:13.900 --> 10:18.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They send press releases every
time an insurance company quits
the marketplace or raises its

10:18.233 --> 10:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rates and they send
these and say, look, this
is why we need repeal.

10:22.033 --> 10:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am watching to see if they
change their tactics now
that the repeal bill seems to

10:26.033 --> 10:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be dead and say, yes, we won't
repeal, but, in the meantime, we
kind of -- we run healthcare.gov

10:30.733 --> 10:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right now, and we want to make
it work as well as we can.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We don't know if we're
going to see that shift.

10:35.633 --> 10:39.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if we do, it would really
be a 180 from how they have
treated the Affordable Care

10:39.600 --> 10:42.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Act so far.

10:42.200 --> 10:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So much
of the ball is in the
administration's court,
the Trump administration's

10:44.033 --> 10:46.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
court, as we wait to
see what Congress does.

10:46.533 --> 10:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thank you both, an
extraordinary story to follow.

10:49.100 --> 10:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sarah Kliff, our own Lisa
Desjardins, thank you.
