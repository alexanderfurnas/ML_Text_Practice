JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.106 --> 00:11.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: A
Greek island
that has welcomed thousands of
migrants prepares

00:11.578 --> 00:16.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to welcome the pope. But some
question whether
his trip will do any good.

00:16.183 --> 00:19.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PANAYOTIS TSAGARIS, Theologian
(through translator):
We consider that the pope's
visit is little

00:19.853 --> 00:24.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than a public relations
exercise, which
will not provide any real
solution to the

00:24.291 --> 00:29.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
refugee problem facing not only
my island
and country, but also extending
to Europe.

00:29.730 --> 00:35.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.
Mark Shields
and David Brooks are here to
analyze last

00:35.135 --> 00:40.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night's fiery Democratic debate,
as is the
chairman of the Republican
National Committee,

00:40.841 --> 00:46.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reince Priebus, to discuss the
strains in
the GOP.

00:47.047 --> 00:55.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: Violinist Rachel Barton
Pine takes classical
music to unexpected places and
people.

00:55.422 --> 01:00.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHEL BARTON PINE, Violinist:
If we only
played for the converted, we
would be not

01:01.094 --> 01:02.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
honoring our gifts to the
fullest extent.

01:03.063 --> 01:10.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:10.137 --> 01:12.472 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:12.572 --> 01:23.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It is the final
weekend before
the all-important New York
primary, and the

01:24.017 --> 01:29.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
presidential candidates,
Democrats and Republicans
alike, were on the go today.

01:29.456 --> 01:35.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most traveled to towns and
cities across the
Empire State. One traveled
half-a-world away.

01:35.662 --> 01:40.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has the story.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MEN AND WOMEN: Bernie! Bernie!
Bernie!

01:42.002 --> 01:44.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: They cheered Bernie
Sanders in
Rome, but it was Italy, not New
York. His

01:44.871 --> 01:50.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
visit to the Vatican came just
hours after
the most combative Democratic
debate yet.

01:50.344 --> 01:52.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was held in Brooklyn.

01:52.412 --> 01:54.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
I am sure a lot of people are
very surprised

01:54.748 --> 01:57.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to learn that you supported
raising the minimum
wage to 15 bucks an hour.

01:57.985 --> 01:59.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:00.087 --> 02:00.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
You know, wait a minute, wait a
minute. Wait.

02:00.520 --> 02:01.488 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Come on.

02:01.588 --> 02:03.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: That's just
not accurate.

02:03.490 --> 02:07.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I have
stood on the
debate stage with Senator
Sanders eight prior

02:07.828 --> 02:08.195 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
times.

02:08.295 --> 02:10.063 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

02:10.163 --> 02:11.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I have
said the exact
same thing If we can raise it to
$15 in New

02:11.231 --> 02:12.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
York or Los Angeles or Seattle,
let's do it.

02:12.199 --> 02:13.934 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

02:14.034 --> 02:19.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOLF BLITZER, CNN: If you're
both screaming
at each other, the viewers won't
be able to

02:19.906 --> 02:21.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hear either of you.

02:21.775 --> 02:25.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The animosity between
Sanders and
Hillary Clinton was clear, as
they clashed

02:25.579 --> 02:28.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the minimum wage and her
relationship with
Wall Street.

02:28.615 --> 02:34.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I stood
up against
the behaviors of the banks when
I was a senator.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I called them out on their
mortgage behavior.

02:37.424 --> 02:42.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Secretary
Clinton called
them out. Oh, my goodness, they
must have

02:42.562 --> 02:43.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been really crushed by this.

02:44.031 --> 02:45.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:45.966 --> 02:54.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: And was
that before or
after you received huge sums of
money by giving

02:54.241 --> 02:56.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
speaking engagements?

02:56.143 --> 02:59.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Clinton called that a
phony attack
and slammed Sanders for voting
to shield gun

02:59.780 --> 03:01.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
makers from some lawsuits.

03:01.715 --> 03:05.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: We hear
a lot from
Senator Sanders about the greed
and recklessness

03:05.519 --> 03:08.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Wall Street. And I agree. We
have got to
hold Wall Street accountable.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Thank you

03:10.624 --> 03:12.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well,
what about the
greed and recklessness of gun
manufacturers

03:12.459 --> 03:13.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and dealers in America?

03:13.827 --> 03:15.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:15.729 --> 03:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, though, the
two candidates
were 4,000 miles apart, Clinton
visiting a

03:19.966 --> 03:21.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
senior center in Harlem.

03:21.268 --> 03:23.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: It looks
like we're
in Las Vegas.

03:23.603 --> 03:25.472 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

03:25.572 --> 03:29.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And Sanders at a
Vatican conference,
assailing what he called an
economy operated

03:29.309 --> 03:31.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the top 1 percent.

03:31.144 --> 03:35.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Pope
Francis has called
on the world to say -- and I
quote -- and

03:35.816 --> 03:46.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how profound, how important this
is -- "no
to a financial system that rules
rather than

03:46.293 --> 03:48.095 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
serves."

03:48.195 --> 03:51.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Senator Sanders said
his campaign
detour was well worth it. The
high-profile

03:51.898 --> 03:57.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vatican visit came just four
days before the
crucial New York primary, a
high-stakes race

03:57.838 --> 03:59.339 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for both parties.

03:59.439 --> 04:03.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, all three Republican
hopefuls fanned
out across the Empire State.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Good to be with you. Good to be
with you.

04:06.179 --> 04:10.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In Plattsburgh,
front-runner Donald
Trump kept hammering away,
hoping to hold

04:10.584 --> 04:12.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what polls show is a
double-digit lead.

04:12.953 --> 04:17.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I'm not one of
these politicians
that say, it doesn't matter if
you vote for

04:17.724 --> 04:22.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me or my opponent. It's so
important for the
American spirit for you to vote.

04:22.329 --> 04:25.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, let me just give you a
little hint.
If you want to vote for somebody
else, don't

04:25.565 --> 04:27.467 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
vote, OK?

04:27.567 --> 04:30.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In Binghamton, Ted
Cruz knocked
Trump for complaining about the
delegate selection

04:30.670 --> 04:32.539 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
process.

04:32.639 --> 04:34.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
It is not surprising when a
candidate loses

04:34.674 --> 04:40.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
11 elections in a row, he's
unhappy about
it. And so he complains. And
that's fine.

04:40.347 --> 04:43.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, we're focused on winning
elections with
the people.

04:43.250 --> 04:47.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: John Kasich also
campaigned in
New York today, with events in
Watertown and

04:47.220 --> 04:48.121 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Utica.

04:48.221 --> 04:50.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

04:50.790 --> 04:55.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Bernie Sanders
also said at
last night's debate that he's
releasing his

04:55.962 --> 05:03.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
2014 tax returns. Hillary
Clinton says she's
released 30 years of returns,
but she declined

05:03.170 --> 05:09.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to issue transcripts of her paid
speeches
to banks unless other candidates
do likewise.

05:10.043 --> 05:14.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the day's other news,
President and Mrs.
Obama released their federal tax
return for

05:14.314 --> 05:23.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
this past year. They paid
$81,000 in taxes
on income of $436,000. The
couple donated

05:23.590 --> 05:26.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
15 percent of what they made to
charity.

05:26.793 --> 05:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lawmakers in Brazil began debate
today on
whether to impeach President
Dilma Rousseff.

05:32.666 --> 05:38.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's accused of corruption in a
political
drama that's all but paralyzed
the country.

05:38.705 --> 05:43.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Impeachment proponents argued
today that Rousseff's
political maneuvering has led to
Brazil's

05:43.743 --> 05:46.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
high inflation and currency
devaluations.

05:46.279 --> 05:50.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIGUEL REALE JR., Author of
Impeachment Legislation
(through translator): Which is
the most serious

05:50.984 --> 05:56.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crime, a crime where a president
puts in her
pocket a sum of money, on that
president which,

05:56.223 --> 06:01.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
due to the hunger for power, in
search of
maintaining power, sees no
limits in destroying

06:01.294 --> 06:03.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Brazilian economy?

06:03.296 --> 06:07.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The impeachment
charges allege
that Rousseff doctored her
government's financial

06:07.901 --> 06:14.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
accounting to win public
support. But defenders,
including former President Lula
da Silva,

06:14.441 --> 06:16.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
insisted today she has done
nothing wrong.

06:16.710 --> 06:21.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUIZ INACIO LULA DA SILVA,
Former Brazilian
President (through translator):
I am convinced

06:21.581 --> 06:25.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the impeachment will not be
approved.
To topple a government that was
democratically

06:25.952 --> 06:31.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
elected without any proof of any
fiscal crime
is not going to fix anything.
All it will

06:31.691 --> 06:37.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do is make the crisis even
worse. Nobody will
be able to govern a country with
200 million

06:37.330 --> 06:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people without being legitimized
by the popular
vote.

06:40.900 --> 06:46.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The house vote
there is slated
for Sunday. If it passes, the
Brazilian senate

06:46.306 --> 06:50.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would decide whether to hold a
trial of Rousseff.

06:50.143 --> 06:55.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Korea tried today to
launch a mid-range
missile, one with a capacity to
reach U.S.

06:55.415 --> 07:01.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bases in Japan and Guam, but it
blew up. The
Pentagon called it a
catastrophic failure.

07:01.921 --> 07:07.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The missile test came as the
North celebrated
the birthday of the late Kim
Il-Sung, founder

07:07.861 --> 07:14.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the communist state. His
grandson, Kim
Jong-un, is the current leader
of North Korea.

07:14.167 --> 07:19.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A powerful new earthquake has
hit Southern
Japan, on the heels of one that
killed nine

07:19.205 --> 07:25.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people Thursday night. There
were no immediate
reports of casualties this time.
NHK television

07:25.345 --> 07:30.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
showed the moment the shaking
began, early
Saturday morning, and triggered
a tsunami

07:30.850 --> 07:35.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
advisory. The alert was later
lifted, but
the quake did leave collapsed
buildings and

07:36.022 --> 07:38.091 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cracked roads.

07:38.191 --> 07:42.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One hundred and fifty countries
geared up
today for a final push to
eliminate polio

07:43.096 --> 07:48.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around the world. The effort
begins Sunday,
and the World Health
Organization says it

07:48.335 --> 07:54.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is possible to stop all
transmission of the
crippling disease within a year.
To do that,

07:54.341 --> 07:57.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the campaign will target the
last few areas
of risk.

07:57.844 --> 08:00.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHEL ZAFFRAN, World Health
Organization:
The virus travels without any
barrier, so

08:00.480 --> 08:06.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if we do not eradicate the
virus, if we don't
get rid of it, we will quite
rapidly go back

08:06.119 --> 08:10.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the situation we had before
we started
the eradication program. And we
could have

08:10.957 --> 08:15.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hundreds of thousands of cases
of the polio

JUDY WOODRUFF: There have been
only 12 cases
of polio reported worldwide this
year, in

08:20.533 --> 08:27.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Islamist militants
there have attacked immunization

them of being Western spies.

Back in this country, the
governor of Mississippi
signed a law permitting guns in
churches.

President Obama announced today
that he will
support giving cable TV
customers more choices

08:55.268 --> 09:00.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on cable boxes. As it is, most
people lease
the boxes from a cable company.
The Federal

better price.

09:06.846 --> 09:13.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president also today ordered
up a report
on increasing competition in the
industry.

09:13.453 --> 09:21.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Wall Street today, the Dow

09:21.127 --> 09:28.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell seven, and the

10:01.167 --> 10:04.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maybe we should try those in the

Now: a high-profile showdown
between a tech
giant and the U.S. government
over accessing

10:49.482 --> 10:51.184 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
private data.

10:51.284 --> 10:56.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This time, it's Microsoft.
Yesterday, the
company filed a suit against the
Department

10:56.155 --> 11:01.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Justice in federal court.
Microsoft argues
it's unconstitutional for the
government to

11:02.028 --> 11:08.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ask for customers' personal data
or e-mails
in most cases without the
individuals' knowledge.

11:08.768 --> 11:13.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The company says it's received
more than 5,600
requests for such data from the
government

11:14.040 --> 11:19.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the last year-and-a-half,
often from the
cloud or remote servers. And
nearly half of

11:19.746 --> 11:24.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those requests come with a ban
from the government
on alerting customers.

11:24.717 --> 11:30.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brad Smith is the president of
Microsoft.
He joins me from company
headquarters in Redmond,

11:30.490 --> 11:31.357 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Washington.

11:31.457 --> 11:33.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And welcome to the program, Brad
Smith.

11:33.426 --> 11:38.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I do want to point out we
invited the Department
of Justice to join the
interview, but they

11:38.531 --> 11:40.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
declined.

11:40.366 --> 11:43.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, let me begin by asking you,
what is it
that the federal government is
doing that

11:43.536 --> 11:45.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Microsoft doesn't like?

11:45.505 --> 11:48.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BRAD SMITH, President,
Microsoft: Well, what
gives us concern is the fact we
have received

11:49.075 --> 11:56.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
almost 2,600 -- almost 2,600 of
these so-called
gag or secrecy orders over the
last 18 months.

11:56.182 --> 12:02.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over two-thirds of them have no
end date at
all. So it means that we are
permanently prohibited

12:03.089 --> 12:08.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from telling customers that the
government
has accessed, read and obtained
copies of

12:09.062 --> 12:15.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their e-mails. We feel that
infringes on the
constitutional rights of
consumers and businesses

12:15.768 --> 12:19.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be secure from unreasonable
government
searches.

12:19.138 --> 12:24.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It infringes on our First
Amendment right
to speak, to share information
with our customers.

12:25.044 --> 12:29.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we know the
Justice Department
has not responded to the
lawsuit. They have

12:29.816 --> 12:34.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not said anything publicly, but
we know that
in the past they have said these
are investigations

12:34.754 --> 12:40.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that involve criminals, people
who are breaking
the law, that involve -- that
are perhaps

12:40.994 --> 12:44.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
involved in potential terrorist
acts.

12:44.697 --> 12:48.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why not work with the government
when they're
trying to go after the bad guys?

12:48.801 --> 12:52.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRAD SMITH: Well, this is an
issue that we
have discussed with various
officials in government

12:53.072 --> 12:54.907 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for some time.

12:55.008 --> 12:59.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we readily recognize that
there are many
cases where there should be some
kind of secrecy,

12:59.779 --> 13:05.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that there is a real danger if
information
is disclosed. But we feel that
these kinds

13:05.685 --> 13:10.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of secrecy orders have been --
become too
routine. They're being issued in
cases that

13:11.024 --> 13:13.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
involve businesses, as well as
consumers.

13:14.093 --> 13:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it especially concerns us
that there is
no end date. Let's face it.
Forever is a long

13:21.034 --> 13:27.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time. Even military secrets are
declassified
eventually. Why should we have a
country where

13:27.940 --> 13:32.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people will never learn that the
government
has accessed their e-mails?

13:32.612 --> 13:37.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I was
reading today that
some investigators who have
worked on, I guess,

13:38.017 --> 13:42.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this area have said that if
you notify
people who are being
investigated, you run

13:42.922 --> 13:46.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the risk that they are going to
change their
communication pattern, they're
going to tamper

13:46.926 --> 13:50.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with evidence. They may even try
to leave
the country. What about that?

13:50.730 --> 13:56.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRAD SMITH: Well, that really
goes to the
point that, yes, there are times
when a nondisclosure

13:56.335 --> 13:59.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
order is a sensible thing to do.

13:59.806 --> 14:04.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the law in this case does,
in our view,
not require the government to
make the kind

14:04.711 --> 14:09.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of compelling showing that it
should, and,
hence, the government is getting
these kinds

14:09.649 --> 14:16.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of orders in too many cases. And
even in cases
where this kind of secrecy is
needed, eventually,

14:16.155 --> 14:18.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the need for secrecy goes away.

14:18.791 --> 14:23.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet, even then, people will
never learn
that the government accessed
their e-mail.

14:23.963 --> 14:29.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that, as much as anything,
really runs,
we think, right into the
constitutional protections

14:29.535 --> 14:31.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we all should enjoy.

14:31.471 --> 14:35.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Brad Smith, what
do you say
to those who look at this and
say, well, this

14:35.808 --> 14:41.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is just an effort to do what's
good for business,
rather than what's good for the
American people,

14:41.614 --> 14:43.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the American government?

14:43.583 --> 14:47.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRAD SMITH: Well, I think this
is fundamentally
about what is good for people
and their rights.

14:48.087 --> 14:53.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is good for technology. It is
good for
businesses who are customers as
well, whose

14:53.893 --> 14:55.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
e-mails are being read.

14:55.728 --> 15:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, most importantly, I think
it's about
one thing. It's about ensuring
the kinds of

15:00.333 --> 15:07.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
values that we have had in this
country under
the Constitution for 230 years
remain intact

15:07.473 --> 15:13.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even as technology changes, and
information
that we have long stored on
paper is now stored

15:13.980 --> 15:15.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the cloud instead.

15:15.848 --> 15:20.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Did you think
about another
course of action other than
filing suit? Did

15:20.486 --> 15:23.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you try to sit down with the
government and
talk to them about what they're
doing?

15:23.356 --> 15:29.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRAD SMITH: We have had multiple
conversations
about these and similar issues.
And this lawsuit

15:29.996 --> 15:36.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doesn't for an instant mean that
those kinds
of conversations should come to
an end.

15:36.335 --> 15:42.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I definitely believe that,
ultimately, across
the technology sphere, it's
going to take

15:42.141 --> 15:49.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of good discussion to find
new solutions.
But we have found in recent
cases that things

15:49.348 --> 15:53.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were going the wrong way, not
the right way,
and there does come a point when
you just

15:53.753 --> 15:59.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to put a stake in the
ground and say
that these constitutional rights
matter, and

15:59.725 --> 16:01.460 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we need the courts to intervene.

16:01.561 --> 16:05.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there a middle
ground, though?
Is there some -- something, some
level of

16:05.832 --> 16:10.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
information the government could
share with
you that would make you
comfortable turning

16:10.136 --> 16:14.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this individual's e-mails over
to them without
notifying the individual?

16:14.574 --> 16:18.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRAD SMITH: I think we always
have to ask
ourselves at the end of the day,
is there

16:18.611 --> 16:23.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some kind of middle ground that
might emerge?
And I think the answer is
probably yes.

16:23.449 --> 16:29.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we look at other statutes in
other areas
of federal law, there is
typically a right

16:29.488 --> 16:35.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the government in the right
circumstances
to keep something secret for 30
days or 90

16:35.194 --> 16:40.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
days, and, if the need
continues, the government
can go back, and it has to make
its case before

16:40.299 --> 16:42.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a magistrate yet again.

16:42.568 --> 16:48.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that if we could move
this area of
the law to be more like that
kind of area,

16:48.841 --> 16:50.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we'd find a middle ground
emerge.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just finally,
there are
some who are looking at this and
saying, is

16:53.946 --> 17:00.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this some kind of a turning
point in this,
I guess, larger tech industry --
battle with

17:00.786 --> 17:06.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the tech industry -- battle with
the government
on the part of the tech industry
over privacy,

17:06.826 --> 17:09.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over the citizens' privacy?

17:09.295 --> 17:12.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRAD SMITH: Well, I think we're
living in
a time where it feels like there
is a turning

17:12.832 --> 17:14.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
point every other month.

17:14.734 --> 17:21.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I step back from it all, I
think what
we're seeing is this evolution
of technology,

17:21.641 --> 17:26.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people storing things digitally,
storing them
in data centers. And across the
board, whether

17:27.046 --> 17:32.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're in government or you're
in the tech
sector, we're all trying to find
a path, so

17:32.251 --> 17:36.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the traditional values we
have had in
this country, the traditional
rights we have

17:36.555 --> 17:40.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enjoyed, will remain, so that
information
that's stored in the cloud gets
the same kind

17:40.660 --> 17:43.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of protection as information
stored on paper.

17:43.863 --> 17:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That, I think, is what we need
to continue
to seek.

17:46.766 --> 17:53.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Brad Smith, the
president of
Microsoft, we thank you for
talking with us.

17:53.906 --> 17:59.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRAD SMITH: Thank you.

17:59.946 --> 18:08.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Today, Republican
presidential
front-runner Donald Trump
continued to attack

18:08.220 --> 18:14.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his own party's process for
choosing a presidential
nominee, a system he says is
rigged.

18:14.694 --> 18:18.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on that, the chairman
of the Republican
National Committee, Reince
Priebus, joins

18:18.564 --> 18:19.665 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me now.

18:19.765 --> 18:23.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, Reince Priebus, we welcome
you to the
program.

18:23.235 --> 18:27.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you say? Donald Trump
has been saying
this for days. I heard him say
it again in

18:27.840 --> 18:33.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syracuse, New York, just a few
hours ago.
What do you say? I mean, this is
a very serious

18:33.546 --> 18:36.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
charge he's making, that the
process is crooked.

18:36.148 --> 18:39.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REINCE PRIEBUS, Republican
National Committee
Chairman: Well, I don't know how
serious the

18:39.752 --> 18:41.487 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
charge is.

18:41.587 --> 18:45.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm not sure how much is
rhetoric, and
-- but the truth is, is that the
process is

18:45.725 --> 18:51.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the same process it's been for
decades. But
the reality is, no one actually
cared about

18:51.297 --> 18:57.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how delegates were allocated.
Each state has
the opportunity to choose the
method by which

18:57.536 --> 19:00.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they allocate delegates to the
national convention.

19:00.840 --> 19:07.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some states have primaries. Some
states have
caucuses, and some states have
actual conventions

19:07.380 --> 19:12.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where delegates are voted on.
These are things
that have been set in place
since October

19:12.151 --> 19:16.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of 2015. All the candidates have
been briefed.
They have all been aware of the
rules. They're

19:16.722 --> 19:18.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out there for the whole world to
see.

19:18.924 --> 19:24.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is nothing mysterious
about it. And,
by the way, no one complained
either before

19:24.497 --> 19:29.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Colorado, before the result. It
was only after
the results did we get a single
complaint

19:30.069 --> 19:30.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about the process.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

19:32.638 --> 19:34.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, let me read -- you're
familiar with
this, but let me read you what
Donald Trump

19:34.507 --> 19:37.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said about Colorado. He said:
"When I joined
the campaign in June," he said,
"they had

19:37.910 --> 19:43.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a system. He said, "After they
saw I was going
to win in Colorado, they changed
the system."

19:43.416 --> 19:46.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he said the people in
Colorado didn't
know that their votes were going
to be taken

19:46.886 --> 19:48.421 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
away from them.

19:48.521 --> 19:53.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REINCE PRIEBUS: Well, and that
statement has
been debunked by many people.

19:53.959 --> 19:58.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Colorado had a convention the
last time. Colorado
used to have what we call beauty
contests.

19:58.798 --> 20:03.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In other words, there weren't
elections. It
was a straw poll that didn't
award any delegates

20:04.003 --> 20:08.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to anyone, and so it had no
value, no use
of a straw poll, so they dumped
the straw

20:08.874 --> 20:10.709 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
poll.

20:10.810 --> 20:16.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they went to the straight-up
convention.
So -- and, By the way, 60,000
people competed

20:16.849 --> 20:23.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Colorado in the precinct
level contest.
Then those people moved to a
county contest.

20:23.489 --> 20:28.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then those people moved to a
congressional
district contest. And then they
moved to a

20:28.627 --> 20:32.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
state convention contest, where
all the candidates
participated.

20:32.665 --> 20:36.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They had surrogates speaking. No
one along
the way said, hey, I don't
really like the

20:36.769 --> 20:39.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way this is going. I don't
really like this
kind of system.

20:39.538 --> 20:40.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it is...

20:40.606 --> 20:42.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REINCE PRIEBUS: And now, all of
a sudden...

20:42.508 --> 20:44.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I was just going
to say, but
it is the case, if you look at
state after

20:44.910 --> 20:50.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state after state, the process
is different
in virtually every one of the 50
states. It's

20:50.716 --> 20:52.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not a simple thing.

20:52.718 --> 20:59.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have to be some kind of an
expert to understand
all this. Is it really
democratic anymore?

20:59.358 --> 21:01.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I mean with a small D.

21:01.227 --> 21:04.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REINCE PRIEBUS: Of course it is.

21:04.497 --> 21:10.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the same method that we
have been using,
and the Democrats use the same
delegate method.

21:10.436 --> 21:17.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're not a public entity. We're
an organization
that is made up of members
across this country

21:17.243 --> 21:22.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and state parties. State parties
have a right
to determine how each of their
delegates get

21:22.948 --> 21:25.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to go to the national
convention.

21:25.151 --> 21:30.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You know, 150 years ago,
delegates ran in
the states, and they just went
to the convention

21:30.156 --> 21:34.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they voted, and they set
rules and they
vote for officers. It's a real
convention.

21:34.927 --> 21:39.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not a four-day party. It's
just that
no one ever watches what happens
during the

21:39.765 --> 21:44.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
day at these conventions, when
rules are voted
on and there is actual business
that goes

21:44.603 --> 21:45.938 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's no different than when the
Boy Scouts
have a convention...

21:47.940 --> 21:49.808 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But when...

21:49.909 --> 21:50.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REINCE PRIEBUS: ... or when the
Kiwanis have
an election. They get together,
and they vote

21:50.843 --> 21:52.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on officers and they have an
election.

21:52.978 --> 21:56.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But when -- I
think what Mr.
Trump is -- and others have made
this point

21:56.649 --> 22:02.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- that when the person who gets
the most
votes in a primary or a caucus
doesn't end

22:02.254 --> 22:06.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the most delegates, or at
least not a
proportional percentage of those
delegates,

22:06.392 --> 22:07.860 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
something smells.

22:07.960 --> 22:12.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REINCE PRIEBUS: Yes, but they do
end up with
the most delegates. They do.

22:12.965 --> 22:17.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the case of Florida, Donald
Trump won about
-- in the mid-50s percentage of
the vote.

22:17.636 --> 22:23.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He won 100 percent of the
delegates. I didn't
hear a lot of complaining about
that. The

22:23.242 --> 22:29.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reality is, is that the bound
delegates that
are awarded to the candidates
are absolutely

22:29.315 --> 22:32.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bound to those candidates. They
don't lose
that support.

22:32.751 --> 22:36.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are bound to the candidate,
no matter
what. Even if they don't like
the candidate,

22:36.355 --> 22:40.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have to vote for that
candidate. What
the problem comes in that you're
hearing complaining

22:40.826 --> 22:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about is the unbound delegates,
who's getting
the unbound delegates. And that
is a separate

22:47.166 --> 22:48.934 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issue.

22:49.034 --> 22:52.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That is an issue of each
campaign going into
each of these states and
competing for those

22:52.838 --> 22:58.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unbound delegates. But they're
not losing
anything, unbound delegates to
the national

22:58.143 --> 22:59.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
convention, not one thing.

22:59.945 --> 23:01.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I think not
everybody
understands the difference
between bound and

23:01.847 --> 23:03.582 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
unbound.

23:03.682 --> 23:06.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do want to move on and ask
you this.
Donald Trump's central argument
seems to be

23:06.452 --> 23:11.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the American -- I mean, is
-- that the
American system is -- political
system, is

23:11.724 --> 23:16.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rigged. He talks about, it's the
consultants,
it's the pollsters, it's the
party, what he

23:16.161 --> 23:19.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
calls the party bosses who are
running things.

23:19.231 --> 23:25.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says the politicians have
grown rich and
powerful; ordinary people are
left behind.

23:25.471 --> 23:29.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you agree with his really
central thesis
here?

23:29.842 --> 23:34.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REINCE PRIEBUS: Well, sure, I
think a lot
of people agree with -- I think
all -- I think

23:34.680 --> 23:38.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the actual -- all the
candidates. I mean,
I think those are themes that I
think everyone

23:38.717 --> 23:41.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can relate to. So I don't
quarrel with that.

23:41.820 --> 23:51.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in regard to whether or not
a national
party has a right to set the
rules as to how

23:51.330 --> 23:57.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a nominee is chosen from a party
is unquestionable.
I mean, these candidates, what
are they doing?

23:57.436 --> 24:04.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are competing to see which
one of these
people are going to be chosen by
the voters

24:04.410 --> 24:06.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the delegates of our party.

24:06.612 --> 24:11.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of them is going to be
chosen. I'm not
competing for one of them.
They're competing

24:11.417 --> 24:17.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to join the Republican Party.
They can compete
to join whatever party they want
to join,

24:17.489 --> 24:21.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but if they want to join the
Republican Party,
then they have to play by the
rules of the

24:21.560 --> 24:25.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Party, and I can't
imagine any
controversy about that
whatsoever.

24:25.998 --> 24:30.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, just quickly,
then, are
you ruling out somebody being
chosen, nominated

24:30.502 --> 24:33.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at the convention who didn't run
in the primaries?

24:33.672 --> 24:38.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REINCE PRIEBUS: They would be
chosen -- if
any -- if a majority of the
delegates at the

24:38.644 --> 24:43.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
convention choose a person to be
the nominee
of our party, they will be the
nominee of

24:43.582 --> 24:45.417 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our party.

24:45.517 --> 24:49.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, I find that to be highly,
highly unlikely.
I have said that many times.
Certainly, Donald

24:50.055 --> 24:55.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump and Ted Cruz have great
advantages.
But, ultimately, they have to or
John Kasich

24:55.527 --> 24:59.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or whoever has to be able to get
the majority
of delegates on the floor of the
convention

24:59.665 --> 25:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be the nominee of our party.

25:01.166 --> 25:05.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will support that nominee
at the Republican
National Committee.

25:05.604 --> 25:09.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Reince Priebus,
the chairman
of the Republican National
Committee, thank

25:09.475 --> 25:10.409 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you very much.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
REINCE PRIEBUS: You bet.

25:12.611 --> 25:17.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now we turn
to the analysis
of Shields and Brooks. That is
syndicated

25:17.149 --> 25:20.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
columnist Mark Shields and New
York Times
columnist David Brooks.

25:20.719 --> 25:25.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Mark, what did you make of
Mr. Priebus'
comment about Donald Trump's
complaint?

25:25.357 --> 25:31.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Reince Priebus is
right. The
parties, state parties, choose
the rules,

25:31.163 --> 25:37.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
establish them. Those rules have
been set
since last August. They're not
particularly

25:37.169 --> 25:42.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
appealing rules in Colorado.
Fewer than 1
percent of the 900,000
registered Republicans

25:42.474 --> 25:47.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the state even were able to
participate
in the choice.

25:47.646 --> 25:52.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But those rules have been
available. I mean,
the irony of this whole thing to
me, Judy,

25:52.818 --> 25:59.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that Donald Trump has run as
the guy who's
going to be the tough,
no-nonsense negotiator.

25:59.758 --> 26:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His election sends nervous knees
in Beijing
and Tokyo. And here he is
getting rolled by

26:08.200 --> 26:12.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Colorado State Republican
Party, which,
in the last 42 years, has
managed to win the

26:12.671 --> 26:17.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
governorship with one candidate
in 42 years,
and twice lost the state to
Barack Obama.

26:17.876 --> 26:22.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you can't and negotiate and
outnegotiate
and outwit, and if you're going
to get flummoxed

26:22.247 --> 26:25.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
by dealing with the state
Republican Party
of Colorado, I don't know how
you're going

26:25.617 --> 26:29.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to negotiate these tough trade
deals with
China and Japan.

26:29.121 --> 26:33.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
it, David? Donald
Trump just keeps hammering away
at this argument

26:33.826 --> 26:36.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the process is -- it's
rigged, it's crooked.

26:36.228 --> 26:39.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. Well, as
others pointed
out, as a businessman, he was
perfectly willing

26:40.065 --> 26:43.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to use the amoral bankruptcy
laws to his own
advantage. And now he's just
getting outfoxed

26:44.002 --> 26:46.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm the amoral delegate laws. I
think that
they're...

26:46.271 --> 26:48.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Did you say
amoral delegate
laws?

26:48.106 --> 26:50.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, they're just
-- the laws
are the way they are.

26:50.609 --> 26:54.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think, A, they're in touch
with the
American tradition. We do not
live in a straight-up

26:54.680 --> 26:59.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Athenian democracy. We live in a
republic.
We have an Electoral College. We
have a United

26:59.151 --> 27:03.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States Senate where the two
senators from
Wyoming have the same power as
the two senators

27:03.121 --> 27:04.923 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from California.

27:05.023 --> 27:07.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have, in that tradition
and that spirit,
we have a delegate selection
process where

27:07.893 --> 27:12.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's just not a straight-up
democracy, where,
as Reince said, it's -- every
big organization,

27:12.598 --> 27:16.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether it's General Motors or
the Boy Scouts,
they have an organizational
structure in which

27:16.535 --> 27:18.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they make decisions.

27:18.470 --> 27:21.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the people who are more
invested in the
organization, are more senior in
the organization

27:21.240 --> 27:24.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have more power than the people
who are not.
And that's for very good reason.
It's because

27:24.843 --> 27:29.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
you want a party to have
consistency over
time. You want it to have a
structure where

27:29.481 --> 27:31.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people have to compromise with
each other.

27:31.350 --> 27:34.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And basically you want it to
have a series
of stability, so you don't get
carried away

27:35.020 --> 27:40.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by momentary fads and crazy
demagogues. So,
by some logic, this structure
exists to prevent

27:40.459 --> 27:42.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump and people like
Donald Trump,
who are of the moment.

27:42.794 --> 27:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But is it smart,
Mark, for
Donald Trump to keep talking
about this process?

27:48.166 --> 27:50.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Because he's not giving up on
this line of...

27:50.369 --> 27:51.169 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

27:51.270 --> 27:52.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I don't think it
is.

27:53.038 --> 27:57.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it obviously gets a
great response
from the crowd that it's rigged,
and this

27:58.076 --> 28:04.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been obviously a theme of
his, that the
whole system is rigged, the
economic system,

28:04.149 --> 28:05.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the political system.

28:06.018 --> 28:09.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I don't think Donald Trump
does well as
a victim. I mean, he's the guy
that's going

28:09.521 --> 28:14.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be, you know, the new sheriff
in town.
He's going to come in and kick
tail and take

28:14.927 --> 28:19.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
names. And this is where he
looks a little
bit victimized. And I just don't
-- I don't

28:19.765 --> 28:21.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
think it works.

28:21.667 --> 28:25.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The rules of the parties, Judy,
do have -- I
think there is a public interest
in how they

28:25.504 --> 28:32.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do it. I mean, the Democratic
Party changed
after 1968, when it was
determined -- a major

28:32.244 --> 28:37.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anti-war movement emerged in
that year to
challenge President Johnson's
reelection and

28:37.115 --> 28:41.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
renomination, and it turned out
that more
than half the delegation --
delegates had

28:41.320 --> 28:43.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been chosen two years earlier.

28:43.355 --> 28:47.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the process wasn't open and
not available.
And they made the process more
open and available.

28:47.459 --> 28:52.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it is still autonomous to
each state how
to set the rules. Colorado did a
lousy job

28:52.431 --> 28:57.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of setting the rules. And
there's no question
that both South Carolina and
Georgia Republicans,

28:57.302 --> 29:02.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where Trump won convincing
victories, they're
already -- the delegates are
conspiring to

29:02.341 --> 29:06.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dump him as soon as they can on
the second
ballot.

29:07.079 --> 29:12.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there is a legitimate point
of view, I
think, he's raised. I don't
think it works

29:12.517 --> 29:13.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for him politically.

29:13.852 --> 29:15.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You agree he
doesn't gain anything
by this?

29:15.754 --> 29:17.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, it's the
only argument
he has, so he might as well use
it. It's an

29:17.489 --> 29:19.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
effective argument.

29:19.424 --> 29:21.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not like -- if he was
winning, he wouldn't
be complaining. But it's the
argument that

29:21.326 --> 29:25.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the situation presented. So, I
would point
out that, as we have gotten more
open in our

29:25.163 --> 29:28.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
selection process, I'm not sure
the candidates
are any better. Abraham Lincoln
was pretty

29:28.567 --> 29:29.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
good. He was very...

29:29.735 --> 29:30.502 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

29:30.602 --> 29:31.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Franklin
Roosevelt.

29:31.770 --> 29:32.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's the old
smoke-filled
rooms.

29:32.871 --> 29:34.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: I like
smoke-filled rooms.

29:34.172 --> 29:34.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

29:36.775 --> 29:39.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you were saying it's the
only argument
he can make at this point,
meaning he's behind

29:39.711 --> 29:43.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the delegate -- and figuring
out how to
pick up delegates, and this is
all he can

29:43.615 --> 29:45.450 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do right now.

29:45.550 --> 29:47.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: He has got two
million more
votes than anybody else. He's
won more primaries

29:47.753 --> 29:49.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and more delegates.

29:49.588 --> 29:54.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wouldn't -- I don't think this
is a time
we pass the hat and hold a
benefit for Donald

29:54.259 --> 29:56.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump. He's about to win New
York convincingly.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

29:57.963 --> 30:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: He's been ahead in
Pennsylvania.
I think the people who have been
endorsing

30:02.200 --> 30:06.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidates have been moving in
his direction.
He's stronger than he certainly
was when he

30:06.371 --> 30:07.039 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lost Wisconsin.

30:07.139 --> 30:08.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

30:09.007 --> 30:11.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To me, it's a confusing moment,
because in
the delegate process, Ted Cruz
has a clear

30:11.977 --> 30:16.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- has not a clear path, but a
path where
if he can deny Trump the
majority on the first

30:16.882 --> 30:20.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ballot, and Cruz is looking
pretty good -- the
delegates keep racking up for
him.

30:20.585 --> 30:23.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the public votes, though,
Trump is rising
in the national polls. He's
going to have

30:23.855 --> 30:27.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a whole series of wins. Cruz is
dropping in
national polls. He could come in
third in

30:27.659 --> 30:31.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New York and a lot of other
places. And so
you really have a bifurcation.
The delegate

30:31.830 --> 30:36.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
race really does look like it's
leaning a
little Cruz's way, but not the
vote. So, in

30:36.635 --> 30:37.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that sense, it's disjointed.

30:37.836 --> 30:41.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: His argument is a
plausible
argument.

30:41.139 --> 30:44.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the people are choosing
one way, and
the delegates are going the
other.

30:44.342 --> 30:46.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's talk
about the
Democrats.

30:46.344 --> 30:52.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a pretty wild debate,
Mark, last
night between Hillary Clinton
and Bernie Sanders.

30:52.584 --> 30:56.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What did you make of it? It was
-- it got
hot at several moments.

30:56.655 --> 30:58.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: It did.

30:58.557 --> 31:04.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gone is the cordiality and
mutual respect
of the earlier debates. I mean,
this may very

31:04.162 --> 31:10.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well have been the last time the
two candidates
are on the same stage together,
and they -- it

31:10.235 --> 31:16.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
couldn't be over quick enough. I
think that
there was an intensity in the
evening.

31:16.541 --> 31:21.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If I could make one suggestion
to both parties,
is that you don't have crowds at
the debates,

31:22.013 --> 31:26.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pep rally crowds. I think it
brings out the
worst in candidates, and they
start playing

31:26.752 --> 31:31.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the room, and getting cheers
and hoops
and huzzahs and all the rest of
it.

31:31.356 --> 31:37.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, no, it was a -- Hillary
Clinton, Bernie
Sanders, neither one of them
came upon it

31:37.929 --> 31:43.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as particularly warm or likable.
I think that's
fair to stay. I think Bernie
Sanders may be

31:43.635 --> 31:48.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the most disciplined candidate I
have ever
seen. I mean, he stays on
message very well.

31:48.774 --> 31:54.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Secretary Clinton showed
herself -- could
take a punch and keep standing.
I mean, she

31:55.046 --> 32:00.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
certainly is -- there's a
toughness about
her. But she doesn't have an
answer for the

32:00.285 --> 32:00.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Goldman Sachs and the
transcripts...

32:01.052 --> 32:02.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The speeches.

32:02.220 --> 32:04.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: ... and speeches
and so forth.

32:04.356 --> 32:09.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, she said let others
reveal their transcripts.
I don't know any other
candidates for president

32:09.561 --> 32:11.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who get a quarter-of-a-million
dollars for
speaking to Goldman Sachs.

32:12.063 --> 32:15.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: The Goldman Sachs
thing is so
typical of Hillary Clinton.

32:15.267 --> 32:19.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remember the Rose Law Firm
papers that showed
up, like, mysteriously in the
middle of the

32:19.704 --> 32:24.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House on the table after
years? She
will delay and delay and delay
until it maximally

32:24.242 --> 32:29.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hurts her, and then she will
release. And
she just has this pattern of
secrecy.

32:29.981 --> 32:33.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do not think the Goldman Sachs
thing is
going to hurt her in a general
election. Democratic

32:33.518 --> 32:38.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters care about that stuff.
Donald Trump
would love to be partners with
Goldman Sachs.

32:38.190 --> 32:41.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Most independent general
election voters want
their kids to go work at Goldman
Sachs. I

32:41.793 --> 32:43.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't think that's going to hurt
her.

32:43.795 --> 32:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think -- I'm sort of struck
by the way
Sanders has not really widened
his critique.

32:48.033 --> 32:52.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought one -- a pivotal
moment early in
the campaign is when he didn't
go after the

32:52.370 --> 32:55.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
e-mails, which he -- at that
moment, he left
-- shut off an avenue.

32:56.074 --> 32:57.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

32:57.943 --> 32:59.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And, secondly, he
could really
go on a class critique of her,
that she's

33:00.011 --> 33:03.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
living in a fancy house, she's
eating in fancy
restaurants, she's of the --
she's not only

33:03.949 --> 33:06.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the establishment. She's of
the 1 percent.

33:06.618 --> 33:10.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he -- that could be a very
big social,
but not on discreet issues like
the Goldman

33:10.822 --> 33:15.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sachs speech, on her whole life.
And he really
has not widened it out and,
frankly, been

33:15.527 --> 33:16.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as aggressive as he might be.

33:17.095 --> 33:19.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That would be
taking it to
a personal level, wouldn't it?

33:19.331 --> 33:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I will say this.

33:20.966 --> 33:24.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bernie Sanders has been urged to
do that on
the e-mails. And...

33:24.302 --> 33:25.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: To go after the
e-mails.

33:26.037 --> 33:29.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Go out for that.
And he made
the decision not to. That wasn't
what his

33:29.608 --> 33:32.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
candidacy and his campaign was
about, is what
he said.

33:33.011 --> 33:39.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he -- to his credit, he's --
what everyone
says, he has dominated the
conversation, I

33:39.351 --> 33:45.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mean, that the movement by
candidates in this
race has been toward Bernie
Sanders' positions,

33:45.523 --> 33:51.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not toward anybody else's. So, I
mean, in
that sense, it was a disciplined
decision.

33:51.763 --> 33:54.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was a -- and it obviously
makes it
easier.

33:54.699 --> 34:00.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I agree with David that the
Goldman Sachs
transcripts are not of great
interest to Republican

34:01.039 --> 34:06.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters who -- on such things.
But he could
have just belted her on that. He
could have

34:06.878 --> 34:11.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
run TV spots on that, and he
hasn't. He's
chosen not to go at a personal
level.

34:11.683 --> 34:14.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: It may be
admirable, but the
point that Mark said I would
like to underline

34:14.853 --> 34:17.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is the way movement of the
debate is.

34:17.155 --> 34:20.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, you look at these
issues. And the
big one this time was with
minimum wage...

34:20.525 --> 34:21.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Minimum wage.

34:21.192 --> 34:22.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

34:22.460 --> 34:24.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: ... where she
suddenly flowed
to $15.

34:24.429 --> 34:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I personally think a $15 minimum
wage makes
total sense in San Francisco,
but it's completely

34:27.966 --> 34:32.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crazy in large parts of the
country. And she
has made that point. She was for
$12 minimum

34:32.771 --> 34:36.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wage. Going up to $15 is way
above anything
we have ever done historically.
I think it

34:36.875 --> 34:40.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would really lead to historic
job losses for
the least educated and least
skilled.

34:40.545 --> 34:43.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, nonetheless, that's where
the debate
is going, and she's sort of
being dragged

34:43.515 --> 34:45.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
along on issue after issue.

34:45.417 --> 34:49.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you think
either one of
them, Mark, helped themselves
materially or

34:49.788 --> 34:52.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hurt themselves materially last
night?

34:52.223 --> 34:54.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I don't know.

34:54.192 --> 34:58.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Sanders played very well
in the room.
I don't how much he played. I
don't he's cracked

34:58.797 --> 35:07.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into her non-white support in
New York or
anyplace else. I think his
decision to go

35:07.238 --> 35:11.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Rome probably made sense to
-- because
it plays to his issue.

35:11.676 --> 35:12.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meeting at the
Vatican.

35:13.011 --> 35:14.779 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: To the Vatican.

35:14.879 --> 35:18.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the pope is the most --
according
to the most recent Gallup of 64
nations, the

35:19.050 --> 35:24.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most admired, most popular
figure in the world,
and is most popular among
Catholics, Jews.

35:24.756 --> 35:28.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's got a majority approval
among agnostics
and atheists. You put those four
groups together,

35:29.027 --> 35:31.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you ought to win a New York
Democratic primary.

35:31.863 --> 35:36.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if the pope is not going to
endorse you,
you endorse the pope. And you
could say this

35:36.968 --> 35:43.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been a Pope Francis primary,
in the sense
of economic inequality and
economic justice

35:43.408 --> 35:43.775 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
being central.

35:43.875 --> 35:45.710 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

35:45.810 --> 35:46.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... you mention
that, because
some people criticize Sanders
for being off

35:47.012 --> 35:48.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the trail just a few days before
the New York
primary.

35:48.880 --> 35:53.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, very quickly, David, does
all of this
lead to something for Bernie
Sanders? Does

35:53.184 --> 35:57.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
it help him move toward
unthroning -- dethroning
Hillary Clinton?

35:57.722 --> 35:58.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: He would have to
win in New
York, I think.

35:58.590 --> 35:59.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

35:59.190 --> 36:00.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

36:00.658 --> 36:02.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And it's very hard
to see, given
where the polls are.

36:02.460 --> 36:05.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it does make her look bad. I
think, if
you're in your home state and
you're being

36:05.430 --> 36:10.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pummeled in this way, it just
seeps even more
of the little glow out of her
campaign. It's

36:10.769 --> 36:13.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just a dogged, dogged race for
her.

36:13.905 --> 36:34.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Brooks,
Mark Shields,
thank you both.

36:34.359 --> 36:38.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Speaking of the pope, he is due
to head to
the Greek island of Lesbos
tomorrow to see

36:38.329 --> 36:41.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for himself the extent of the
refugee crisis.

36:41.599 --> 36:46.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He plans to visit a detention
camp where some
of the migrants are being held,
pending possible

36:46.738 --> 36:51.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deportation. That's according to
terms of
a deal signed last month between
the European

36:51.876 --> 36:53.144 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Union and Turkey.

36:53.244 --> 36:56.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, just how important is this
visit?

36:56.181 --> 36:59.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant reports
from Lesbos.

36:59.684 --> 37:04.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Another day of
uncertainty
begins on an island that once
offered hope

37:04.823 --> 37:08.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to hundreds of thousands seeking
security,
protection or prosperity.

37:08.660 --> 37:14.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the estimated 4,000 migrants
currently
stranded on Lesbos worry that
their foothold

37:14.132 --> 37:19.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Europe is more tenuous than
ever. This
island is now a place of
despair. Human rights

37:19.637 --> 37:24.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
groups regard it as an open
prison for people
desperate to avoid being sent
back across

37:24.642 --> 37:27.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the stretch of water that
claimed so many
lives.

37:27.946 --> 37:29.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
George Kosmopoulos of Amnesty
International:

37:29.981 --> 37:31.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE KOSMOPOULOS, Director,
Amnesty International
Greece: We hope that the visit
of the pope

37:31.983 --> 37:36.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
will highlight both the
solidarity, the great
solidarity shown by the Greek
people and people

37:36.654 --> 37:41.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from all over the world to
refugees in Lesbos,
in Mytilini, but also will shed
some light

37:41.993 --> 37:47.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
additionally to the problems, to
the big problems
with regards the implementation
of the E.U.-Turkey

37:47.465 --> 37:54.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deal, in the rushed attempt of
Greece to proceed
with a deal that is both
dangerous and illegal,

37:54.405 --> 37:56.241 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in our view.

37:56.341 --> 38:00.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: In preparation
for the pope's
visit, they were whitewashing
the walls of

38:00.411 --> 38:05.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the detention camp and covering
up graffiti
expressing support for the
migrants.

38:05.984 --> 38:10.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whenever dignitaries come to
look at the refugee
crisis for themselves, the Greek
authorities

38:10.488 --> 38:16.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do what they can to sanitize the
situation.
When actress and U.N. Refugee
Agency special

38:16.227 --> 38:21.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
envoy Angelina Jolie visited,
the razor wire
for the detention center was
conveniently

38:21.499 --> 38:25.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
taken down and put straight up
as soon as
she left.

38:25.336 --> 38:30.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the run-up to the pope's
visit, all deportations
to Turkey have stopped. But I'm
told by sources

38:30.508 --> 38:36.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the E.U.'s border agency,
Frontex, that
they will resume early next
week.

38:36.314 --> 38:40.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Human rights advocates are
highly critical
of conditions in this so-called
hot spot,

38:40.685 --> 38:45.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
where asylum-seekers are
supposed to be processed.
The police weren't keen on us
getting too

38:45.423 --> 38:45.957 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
close.

38:46.057 --> 38:47.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: It's not allowed.

38:47.692 --> 38:49.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Why not?

38:49.494 --> 38:51.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Stop the shooting.

38:51.729 --> 38:52.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Why not?

38:52.864 --> 38:54.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Sir, it's not allowed.

38:54.232 --> 38:55.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Why not?

38:55.333 --> 38:56.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Problem. Close. Close.
Close.

38:56.734 --> 38:58.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: OK. All right.

38:58.636 --> 39:01.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Eva Cosse of
Human Rights
Watch was also prevented from
entering, but

39:02.006 --> 39:03.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interviewed people through the
fence.

39:04.042 --> 39:08.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her organization and others
believe the detentions
are arbitrary and unjust.

39:08.379 --> 39:12.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVA COSSE, Human Rights Watch:
What's wrong?
First, there are large, large
numbers of vulnerable

39:13.051 --> 39:14.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
groups being detained there.

39:14.953 --> 39:20.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We interviewed families with
young children,
people with disabilities, people
with mental

39:20.758 --> 39:25.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health problems, pregnant women
who are really
suffering inside there, because
there are

39:26.030 --> 39:33.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
no services. Since the
implementation of the
E.U.-Turkey deal, NGOs withdrew
from the detention

39:33.638 --> 39:39.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
facilities, in line with their
policies not
to work in closed facilities. So
there is

39:39.110 --> 39:43.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a big lack of services for those
people.

39:43.214 --> 39:49.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: An alarm goes
off at the
phone recharging center at
another, more relaxed

39:49.687 --> 39:54.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and better-equipped refugee
camp. It's the
Muslim call to prayer.

39:54.158 --> 39:59.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Sitting nearby is Murteza
Hasainzada, a tailor
from Kabul. Having spent
$10,000, he arrived

40:00.031 --> 40:04.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Lesbos after Europe made it
clear through
the deal with Turkey that it was
no longer

40:04.969 --> 40:09.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wide-open to all comers. He's
not too sure
what the pope can do, but he
will take any

40:09.540 --> 40:12.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
help that will stop him from
being deported.

40:12.210 --> 40:22.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MURTEZA HASAINZADA, Refugee: I
don't want
to go back. I say, until they
open the borders,

40:22.186 --> 40:23.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am -- stay here, and I don't
want to go
back.

40:24.088 --> 40:29.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The same
unwillingness to
accept the new reality is
evident in a conversation

40:29.260 --> 40:33.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
between a visiting Danish
politician and a
Palestinian asylum-seeker,
Yousef Hammad,

40:33.998 --> 40:40.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who fled Gaza after being jailed
for six months
by the radical Hamas government.
He also arrived

40:40.204 --> 40:42.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Lesbos after Europe pulled
down the shutters.

40:42.907 --> 40:48.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YOUSEF HAMMAD, Refugee: I don't
like to think
about the situation about going
back, maybe,

40:48.880 --> 40:50.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like, stay here just good.

40:50.915 --> 40:54.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The Danish
politician, former
center-left Interior Minister
Morten Ostergaard,

40:54.886 --> 41:00.425 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
is concerned that
asylum-seekers' rights under
international law are possibly
being breached,

41:00.525 --> 41:03.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but doubts whether Pope Francis
is the catalyst
for change.

41:03.494 --> 41:05.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MORTEN OSTERGAARD, Former Danish
Interior
Minister: At least what I think
that the pope

41:05.897 --> 41:12.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can do is perhaps shed a bit of
hope in the
people who are desperate. But,
politically,

41:12.570 --> 41:16.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's up to people like me and
the political
leaders in the European Union to
make a difference.

41:16.574 --> 41:18.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We can't let -- leave that to
the pope.

41:18.710 --> 41:23.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: And this is
Spyros Galinos,
the mayor of Lesbos, who was
instrumental

41:23.915 --> 41:28.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in inviting the pope to draw
attention to
the plight of the refugees and
the islanders'

41:28.486 --> 41:30.254 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
burden.

41:30.355 --> 41:32.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SPYROS GALINOS, Mayor of Lesbos,
Greece: It
is a visit of enormous symbolic
importance.

41:32.990 --> 41:36.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we hope that all governments
will follow
the pope's lead and finally move
in the right

41:37.095 --> 41:39.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
direction for all the peoples of
Europe.

41:39.263 --> 41:44.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: On a religious
level, the
pope's visit is fraught with
difficulties.

41:44.802 --> 41:51.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Catholic and Orthodox
churches split cataclysmically
1,000 years ago, and are still
unable to resolve

41:51.976 --> 41:53.878 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
differences.

41:53.978 --> 41:58.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are some forces within
orthodoxy that
are seeking reconciliation, but
leading theologian

41:58.549 --> 42:01.219 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Panayotis Tsagaris is skeptical.

42:01.319 --> 42:08.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PANAYOTIS TSAGARIS, Theologian
(through translator):
We consider that the pope's
visit is little

42:08.693 --> 42:13.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than a public relations
exercise which
will not provide any real
solution to the

42:13.164 --> 42:18.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
refugee problem facing not only
my island
and country, but also extending
to Europe.

42:18.703 --> 42:23.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The fraught
history between
the two churches has even led
some ultra-conservative

42:23.775 --> 42:28.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
religious leaders to call the
papal mission
a stab in the back. One
archbishop expressed

42:28.746 --> 42:33.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concern that hiding among the
migrants are
Islamic extremists on a mission
to undermine

42:34.018 --> 42:36.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Europe and its traditions.

42:36.521 --> 42:42.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But on the waterfront in
Greece's main port,
Piraeus, their Orthodox Church
is demonstrating

42:42.760 --> 42:51.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its willingness to reach across
the religious
divide. Every day, the church's
charity, Apostoli,

42:51.502 --> 42:55.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
distributes 1,000 meals to
asylum-seekers
living rough on the harbor.

42:55.339 --> 43:00.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Spokeswoman Despina Katsivelaki
rejects the
Islamophobic wing of orthodoxy.

43:00.311 --> 43:05.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DESPINA KATSIVELAKI, Apostoli
(through translator):
We help human beings, regardless
of their

43:05.550 --> 43:11.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
race, religion, color,
nationality. That's
what we do. That's our role and
aim, and that's

43:11.322 --> 43:13.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what we try to succeed in doing.

43:13.858 --> 43:18.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Although the
islanders are
desperate for the human tide to
diminish,

43:19.030 --> 43:23.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's profound empathy for
people escaping
conflict and trying to improve
themselves,

43:23.935 --> 43:27.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because Greeks have a similar
history.

43:27.605 --> 43:31.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Father Athanasios Giousmas is
the chief priest
at the Exquisite Church in
Mytilini, Lesbos'

43:31.909 --> 43:33.678 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
main town.

43:33.778 --> 43:35.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FATHER ATHANASIOS GIOUSMAS,
Exquisite Church
(through translator): This is
why we have

43:35.980 --> 43:41.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
such mixed feelings within
ourselves, not
only pain for these refugees,
but also agony

43:41.752 --> 43:46.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about what is likely to happen
generally,
and in this country, together
with disgust

43:46.424 --> 43:51.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- and forgive me for saying so
-- but disgust,
not only for the world leaders,
but also those

43:51.796 --> 43:53.564 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
here in Greece.

43:53.664 --> 43:59.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Despite
misgivings about
the E.U.-Turkey accord, it seems
to be working

43:59.871 --> 44:05.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as its deal-makers intended. The
numbers of
arrivals are substantially down.

44:05.810 --> 44:10.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Spanish lifeguards have returned
from patrols
empty-handed for nearly two
weeks. The Turks

44:10.781 --> 44:14.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are either upholding their end
of the bargain,
or the boats are being
intercepted by the

44:14.919 --> 44:16.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
E.U. border agency.

44:16.888 --> 44:21.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The big question is, will the
despair on Lesbos
filter back down the migrant
trail and deter

44:22.093 --> 44:26.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the throng, or will they find
new routes to
reach their goal?

44:26.564 --> 44:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Lesbos.

44:29.700 --> 44:35.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And there will be
more on the
pope's visit to Lesbos on "PBS
NewsHour Weekend,"

44:35.606 --> 44:41.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right here on most of these PBS
stations.

44:41.512 --> 44:57.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Next: music with a purpose, a
story about
a violinist charting her own
musical path.

44:57.862 --> 45:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown tells us exactly
how her music
is hitting the spirit.

45:02.633 --> 45:09.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: It was an
unlikely setting
for a classical music
performance: a homeless

45:09.540 --> 45:18.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shelter, the Community for
Creative Non-Violence,
in the shadow of the nation's
capital, where

45:18.549 --> 45:28.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concert violinist Rachel Barton
Pine played
a special engagement for the
residents.

45:28.326 --> 45:38.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was music from many eras
and styles.
Along the way, Pine offered bits
of musical

45:38.803 --> 45:40.438 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
history.

45:40.538 --> 45:42.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHEL BARTON PINE, Violinist:
So, Mozart
was from Germany from the late
1700s.

45:42.239 --> 45:44.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And told them a
bit about herself.

45:44.442 --> 45:48.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHEL BARTON PINE: And we were
often one
missed payment away from losing
the roof over

45:48.579 --> 45:51.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
our heads, which was the
scariest thing of
all when I was a little kid.

45:51.515 --> 45:55.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Pine, in fact,
knows something
of the plight of her audience.
Her father

45:56.053 --> 45:59.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was mostly unemployed, and the
family had
to scrape by.

45:59.223 --> 46:05.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHEL BARTON PINE: So, We had
these three
sort of grocery crates rescued
from the garbage

46:05.429 --> 46:09.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and this one little electric
heater. And I
would rotate it every 10
minutes, so that,

46:09.567 --> 46:13.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as part of me was warming up and
thawing,
another part would be starting
to freeze.

46:13.704 --> 46:19.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we had to do unusual things,
like get
my concert clothes from a thrift
store and

46:19.810 --> 46:23.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
try to fix them up to be
something presentable
for stage.

46:23.681 --> 46:27.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: These days, Pine
tours the
world a good part of the year,
traveling with

46:27.952 --> 46:33.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her husband, Greg, who serves as
her manager,
and their 4-year-old daughter.

46:33.124 --> 46:35.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But she feels a pull to give
back wherever
she goes.

46:36.093 --> 46:40.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHEL BARTON PINE: Sometimes, I
go to hospitals.
I have even been to prisons, and
just wherever

46:40.831 --> 46:44.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
music can uplift people's
spirits. That's
the meaning of being a musician.

46:44.735 --> 46:48.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But you have a
life on the
road that is different, in the
sort of traditional

46:48.339 --> 46:50.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
performing and then playing in
places like
this.

46:51.075 --> 46:52.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RACHEL BARTON PINE: Absolutely.

46:52.877 --> 46:56.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, yes, I think more and more
artists,
especially with the younger
generation, are

46:56.614 --> 47:02.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really understanding the value
of community
engagement. If we only played
for the converted,

47:03.054 --> 47:06.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we would be not honoring our
gifts to the
fullest extent.

47:06.557 --> 47:12.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One spirit lifted
today, Ray
Simmons, who told us of falling
on hard times

47:12.730 --> 47:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and finding hope in Pine's music
and his own.

47:15.900 --> 47:18.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do you have to hold onto
something?

47:18.135 --> 47:19.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAY SIMMONS, The Community for
Creative Non-Violence:
You have to hold onto something.
You have

47:19.403 --> 47:20.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to hold onto your sanity.

47:20.705 --> 47:21.205 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:21.305 --> 47:21.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

47:21.839 --> 47:23.240 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
RAY SIMMONS: Yes.

47:23.340 --> 47:25.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For you, it
sounds like you
hold onto your music too.

47:25.242 --> 47:27.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAY SIMMONS: I hold onto my
music quite often.
That's what gets me through,
knowing that

47:27.578 --> 47:30.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm going to -- yes, I'm going
to play my
way out and sing my way out of
this place,

47:30.648 --> 47:32.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for sure, for sure.

47:32.717 --> 47:41.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Pine started
young. She gave
her first recital at age 5,
played with a

47:41.625 --> 47:45.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
professional orchestra at 7, and
with one
of the great ones, the Chicago
Symphony, in

47:45.229 --> 47:47.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a concert of young performers at
age 10.

47:47.798 --> 47:54.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: And now super-duper Rachel
Barton makes
her debut with the Chicago
Symphony Orchestra.

47:54.605 --> 47:56.874 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

47:56.974 --> 48:08.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In recent years,
she formed
a foundation to help what she
calls poor prodigies

48:08.519 --> 48:15.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with things not covered by
traditional scholarships:
accompaniment fees, sheet music,
transportation

48:15.126 --> 48:17.027 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to competitions.

48:17.128 --> 48:23.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To date, she's helped 70 young
people. Another
project, Global HeartStrings,
supports aspiring

48:23.834 --> 48:26.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
musicians in developing
countries such as
Haiti.

48:26.370 --> 48:30.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RACHEL BARTON PINE: Music
programs here in
America, we kind of take for
granted, like

48:30.441 --> 48:37.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rosin to put on your bow hair,
or, you know,
a shoulder rest, so that your
violin will

48:37.481 --> 48:39.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sit on your body properly.

48:39.383 --> 48:44.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: At 21, on the
brink of a major
career, the doors of a Chicago
commuter train

48:44.655 --> 48:51.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
closed on the straps of her
violin case, trapping
Pine. The train dragged her 200
feet, severing

48:51.896 --> 48:57.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her left leg and mangling her
right foot.
Fifty surgeries later, she walks
on a prosthetic

48:57.701 --> 48:59.470 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
leg.

48:59.570 --> 49:01.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHEL BARTON PINE: Really, of
course, it
was a case of corporate
negligence, because

49:01.806 --> 49:07.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there had been many, many prior
instances
before the day that I happened
to get hurt.

49:07.111 --> 49:10.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, thankfully, they have
changed their safety
procedures. Everybody has
something they have

49:10.848 --> 49:13.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to deal with, and this just
happens to be
mine.

49:14.018 --> 49:19.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And the concert
violinist is
also a heavy metal lover and
performer, a

49:19.723 --> 49:23.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regular headbanger, here playing
Metallica's
"One."

49:23.327 --> 49:30.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHEL BARTON PINE: So, at
first, it was like
the mainstream bands, but then I
started to

49:30.568 --> 49:38.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get into the classic thrash
groups like Anthrax,
Megadeth, Slayer, early
Metallica, Pantera

49:38.509 --> 49:42.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
(INAUDIBLE). Like, this music
just grabbed
me. It was so intense.

49:43.047 --> 49:46.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But you were
playing classical
music, playing Bach during the
day, and then

49:46.784 --> 49:47.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at 10:00, you're listening to...

49:47.718 --> 49:48.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RACHEL BARTON PINE: Anthrax.

49:48.452 --> 49:50.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Anthrax.

49:50.354 --> 49:52.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHEL BARTON PINE: So, it
sounds silly to
say I relaxed to this like
headbanging metal,

49:53.023 --> 49:56.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but, yes, I could just turn off
my brain and
rock out.

49:56.927 --> 49:59.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I started playing these things
on my instrument
and realized, wait a sec, this
is actually

50:00.097 --> 50:01.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
very sophisticated music.

50:01.498 --> 50:05.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For us, she
played Ozzy Osbourne's
"Crazy Train."

50:05.703 --> 50:15.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maybe, Pine says, she can help

52:09.626 --> 52:15.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
delegate math, why clinching a

On "PBS NewsHour Weekend": how
