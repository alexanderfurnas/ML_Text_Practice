ABOUT IT.

SOMETHING NO OTHER TOWN IN

08:59.406 --> 09:00.039

HAPPENS HERE IN THIS ROOM, WHERE

09:16.489 --> 09:17.357
YOU CAN GET ADVICE ABOUT THINGS

09:33.339 --> 09:34.874
THE FIRST TOWN IN THE ENTIRE

09:34.874 --> 09:36.476
COUNTRY TO COMPLETELY BAN THE

TOBACCO, CIGARS, VAPORIZERS.

YOU'D STILL BE ABLE TO SMOKE OR

USE TOBACCO IN TOWN, JUST NOT

10:03.102 --> 10:05.071

10:07.106 --> 10:10.243
FROM HAVING ACCESS AND EXPOSURE

10:10.243 --> 10:13.279
TO NICOTINE AND TOBACCO PRODUCTS

10:13.279 --> 10:14.481
AND REDUCE THE CHANCES OF THEM

10:14.481 --> 10:15.515
SMOKING OR USING THEM, THEN

10:15.515 --> 10:17.016
WE'VE ESSENTIALLY SAVED LIVES.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.586
ILLEGAL FOR KIDS TO BUY TOBACCO,

THE HEALTH BOARD SAYS THE

10:21.187 --> 10:22.489
TOBACCO INDUSTRY MAKES PRODUCTS

10:22.489 --> 10:23.923
LIKE THESE SHINY, FRUIT FLAVORED

10:23.923 --> 10:26.960
CIGARS AND TOBACCO PRODUCTS IN

10:26.960 --> 10:27.894
ORDER TO LURE KIDS INTO A

10:27.894 --> 10:28.495
LIFETIME HABIT.

10:28.495 --> 10:29.762
THE INDUSTRY DENIES TARGETING

10:29.762 --> 10:33.066
KIDS.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.834
THE EFFORT BEGAN WHEN ONE OF THE

10:34.834 --> 10:36.069
THREE HEALTH BOARD MEMBERS

10:36.069 --> 10:37.170
SUGGESTED THE TOBACCO BAN,

10:37.170 --> 10:38.071
FOLLOWING THE LEAD OF OTHER

10:38.071 --> 10:39.272
HEALTH BOARDS IN OTHER

10:39.272 --> 10:40.507
MASSACHUSETTS TOWNS THAT HAD

10:40.507 --> 10:41.407
LIMITED WHERE RESIDENTS COULD

10:41.407 --> 10:43.109
SMOKE OR WHAT KIND OF TOBACCO

10:43.109 --> 10:44.811
PRODUCTS THEY COULD BUY.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.513
WESTMINSTER'S VOLUNTEER BOARD

10:46.513 --> 10:47.780
CONSULTED A SPECIALIST TO

10:47.780 --> 10:49.616
EXAMINE THE PROS AND CONS

10:49.616 --> 10:50.984
OF A TOTAL BAN.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.352
THEY TALKED WITH THIS MAN.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.319
D.J. WILSON IS THE TOBACCO

10:53.319 --> 10:54.554
CONTROL DIRECTOR FOR THE

MASSACHUSETTS MUNICIPAL

10:55.922 --> 10:58.291
ASSOCIATION, A POLICY GROUP

10:58.291 --> 10:59.526

10:59.526 --> 11:01.227
>> WE WOULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED

11:01.227 --> 11:03.696
TEN-YEARS-AGO THAT THERE

11:03.696 --> 11:05.298
WOULD'VE BEEN 49-CENT GRAPE

11:05.298 --> 11:07.166
CIGARS AVAILABLE TO KIDS, OR

11:07.166 --> 11:08.701
THAT ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES

11:08.701 --> 11:10.403
WOULD'VE COME IN-- OR IF THEY

11:10.403 --> 11:11.771
EXISTED AT ALL, WOULD COME IN

11:11.771 --> 11:13.139
COTTON CANDY FLAVORS.

11:13.139 --> 11:16.776
I DON'T SPEAK FOR THE BOARD OF

11:16.776 --> 11:18.478
HEALTH, BUT I THINK THEIR GOALS-

11:18.478 --> 11:20.380
- THEY ARE TIRED OF HAVING

11:20.380 --> 11:22.982
DIFFERENT PRODUCTS POP UP THAT

11:22.982 --> 11:24.450
ARE VERY KID FRIENDLY.

11:24.450 --> 11:26.119
>> Reporter: THE BIGGEST

11:26.119 --> 11:28.087
OPPONENTS OF THE PROPOSAL ARE

11:28.087 --> 11:29.756
THE SEVEN LOCAL STORES IN

11:29.756 --> 11:30.723
WESTMINSTER WHO'RE LICENSED TO

11:30.723 --> 11:31.991
SELL TOBACCO.

11:31.991 --> 11:33.359
MOST ARE OPPOSED.

11:33.359 --> 11:34.260
>> THANKS EVERYBODY FOR COMING

11:34.260 --> 11:36.329
TODAY--

11:36.329 --> 11:38.865
>> Reporter: STORE OWNER BRIAN

11:38.865 --> 11:39.799
VINCENT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST

11:39.799 --> 11:40.567
VOCAL.

11:40.567 --> 11:41.434
HE OWNS VINCENT'S COUNTRY STORE

11:41.434 --> 11:42.268
ON MAIN STREET IN TOWN.

11:42.268 --> 11:43.202
IT'S A MEDIUM-SIZED GROCERY

11:43.202 --> 11:44.370
STORE THAT VINCENT'S DAD STARTED

11:44.370 --> 11:45.305
AND RAN FOR 18 YEARS.

11:45.305 --> 11:46.239
HE SAYS NO STORE IN WESTMINSTER

11:46.239 --> 11:47.206
HAS EVER BEEN CITED FOR SELLING

11:47.206 --> 11:48.207
TOBACCO TO KIDS, AND BANNING IT

11:48.207 --> 11:49.375
WOULD COST MORE THAN JUST

11:49.375 --> 11:52.679
TOBACCO SALES.

11:52.679 --> 11:54.314
>> MOST PEOPLE THAT BUY TOBACCO,

11:54.314 --> 11:56.082
WILL GRAB A COLD DRINK FOR THE

11:56.082 --> 11:57.350
ROAD, MAYBE SCRATCH TICKETS, A

11:57.350 --> 11:58.785
BAG OF CHIPS.

11:58.785 --> 11:59.986
SO IT'S NOT JUST AN EIGHT DOLLAR

11:59.986 --> 12:02.188
SALE, IT'S A $20, $30 SALE.

12:02.188 --> 12:03.890
>> Reporter: VINCENT POINTS OUT

12:03.890 --> 12:05.692
THERE ARE SEVERAL NEIGHBORING

12:05.692 --> 12:07.260
TOWNS AROUND WESTMINSTER FULL OF

12:07.260 --> 12:09.228
STORES THAT SELL TOBACCO, SO HE

12:09.228 --> 12:10.697
SAYS THE BAN WOULD JUST DRIVE

12:10.697 --> 12:11.698
CUSTOMERS AND THEIR MONEY,

12:11.698 --> 12:14.734
ELSEWHERE.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.370
>> WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE

12:17.370 --> 12:19.138
SENDING ALL THESE SALES FIVE

12:19.138 --> 12:23.176
MINUTES DOWN THE ROAD TO

12:23.176 --> 12:24.444
ANOTHER TOWN WHERE THESE

12:24.444 --> 12:25.378
CUSTOMERS WILL SPEND MONEY ON

12:25.378 --> 12:26.613
GAS OUT OF TOWN, FOOD OUT OF

12:26.613 --> 12:27.947
TOWN, AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT THE

12:27.947 --> 12:29.015
GAS STATION HERE GOING UNDER IN

12:29.015 --> 12:30.450
WESTMINSTER AND OTHER

12:30.450 --> 12:32.085
BUSINESSES.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.152
>> Reporter: ANOTHER CONCERN

12:33.152 --> 12:34.187
THAT'S BEEN RAISED IS THE

12:34.187 --> 12:35.722
POTENTIAL IMPACT ON JOBS.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.624
MOST MORNINGS AT THE DEPOT

12:37.624 --> 12:38.625
GENERAL STORE, YOU'LL FIND A FEW

12:38.625 --> 12:39.292
REGULARS HANGING OUT, HAVING

12:39.292 --> 12:40.960
COFFEE BEFORE WORK.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.328
>> THIS BETTER BE A WINNER,

12:42.328 --> 12:43.262
BECAUSE WOULDN'T THAT BE GREAT?

12:43.262 --> 12:44.030
>> Reporter: CHRIS BJURLING HAS

12:44.030 --> 12:44.697
OWNED THIS SMALL CONVENIENCE

12:44.697 --> 12:45.398
STORE FOR 22 YEARS.

12:45.398 --> 12:46.232
LIKE A LOT OF BUSINESSES, HE

12:46.232 --> 12:47.266
SUPPORTS THE LOCAL POLICE AND

12:47.266 --> 12:48.701
KIDS' SPORTING TEAMS.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.837
HE ALSO EMPLOYS SEVEN PEOPLE,

12:50.837 --> 12:51.704
SEVERAL OF THEM FULL TIME.

12:51.704 --> 12:53.139
HE'S CALCULATED THAT LOSING THE

12:53.139 --> 12:55.842
TOBACCO AND RELATED RETAIL SALES

12:55.842 --> 12:56.843
WOULD COST HIM ROUGHLY TWO

12:56.843 --> 12:57.810
THIRDS OF THE MONEY HE USES TO

12:57.810 --> 13:00.013
PAY THOSE EMPLOYEES.

13:00.013 --> 13:01.147
AND FOR SOME OF THEM, THESE ARE

13:01.147 --> 13:03.049
CRUCIAL JOBS.

13:03.049 --> 13:04.817
>> IT BECOMES VERY PERSONAL,

13:04.817 --> 13:06.185
THESE PEOPLE ARE IMPORTANT TO

13:06.185 --> 13:07.787
ME.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.222
LISA HAS BEEN WITH ME FOR 18

13:09.222 --> 13:10.356
YEARS.

13:10.356 --> 13:11.658
DENISE HAS BEEN, I'D HAVE TO ASK

13:11.658 --> 13:12.558
HER BUT I'M GONNA SAY 12 TO 13

13:12.558 --> 13:14.060
YEARS.

13:14.060 --> 13:15.028
FOR LISA, I AM HER ENTIRE

13:15.028 --> 13:18.564
INCOME.

13:18.564 --> 13:19.966
SHE IN FACT WILL LOSE HER HOUSE

13:19.966 --> 13:20.700
IF--

13:20.700 --> 13:21.601
>> Reporter: IF THIS JOB DOESN'T

13:21.601 --> 13:22.835
EXIST.

13:22.835 --> 13:24.203
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

13:24.203 --> 13:25.672
>> Reporter: WE'VE HEARD FROM

13:25.672 --> 13:27.573
SEVERAL LOCAL BUSINESSES THAT IF

13:27.573 --> 13:28.875
TOBACCO IS NOT ALLOWED TO BE

13:28.875 --> 13:30.243
SOLD HERE THAT'S GONNA REALLY

13:30.243 --> 13:31.844
HURT BUSINESS HERE AND COULD

13:31.844 --> 13:34.280
JEOPARDIZE LOCAL JOBS.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.682
IF THAT'S TRUE, DO YOU THINK

13:35.682 --> 13:36.749
THAT THAT ECONOMIC PAIN IS WORTH

13:36.749 --> 13:39.385
THE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFIT?

13:39.385 --> 13:43.056
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I MEAN, THERE

13:43.056 --> 13:44.490
HAS BEEN A LOT OF QUANTIFYING

13:44.490 --> 13:46.693
THAT A LOT OF THE DISEASES THAT

13:46.693 --> 13:48.461
ARE CAUSED FROM SMOKING HAVE

13:48.461 --> 13:49.729
COST US IN THE STATE TENS OF

13:49.729 --> 13:50.997
MILLIONS AND NATIONALLY

13:50.997 --> 13:52.565
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

13:52.565 --> 13:53.700
IT IS A HUGE COST-- TAX BURDEN

13:53.700 --> 13:55.101
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, TO THE

13:55.101 --> 13:56.469
AMERICAN WORKFORCE TO HAVE

13:56.469 --> 13:59.772
PEOPLE ON DISABILITY AND HAVING

13:59.772 --> 14:01.274
TO RETIRE EARLIER BECAUSE THEY

14:01.274 --> 14:05.411
SMOKED FOR A LIFETIME.

14:05.411 --> 14:06.779
SO, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU

14:06.779 --> 14:08.147
HAVE TO WEIGH AGAINST THE LOSS

14:08.147 --> 14:09.649
OF PROFIT FROM SELLING TOBACCO

UNEXPECTED RELEASE OF

17:28.547 --> 17:29.582
KENNETH BAE AND MATTHEW TODD

17:29.582 --> 17:30.750
MILLER, TWO AMERICANS WHO HAD

17:30.750 --> 17:31.751
BEEN DETAINED AND THEN SENTENCED

17:31.751 --> 17:32.718
TO LENGTHY PRISON TERMS IN

17:32.718 --> 17:33.719
NORTH KOREA.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.254
THE DEAL THAT LED TO THEIR

17:35.254 --> 17:36.088
RELEASE WAS NEGOTIATED BY JAMES

CLAPPER, THE U.S. NATIONAL

17:37.490 --> 17:38.557
INTELLIGENCE DIRECTOR.

17:38.557 --> 17:39.692
FOR MORE ABOUT HOW THE DEAL

17:39.692 --> 17:40.626
HAPPENED THAT, WE ARE JOINED NOW

17:40.626 --> 17:41.928
FROM WASHINGTON BY ADAM ENTOUS.

17:41.928 --> 17:42.962
EARLIER THIS WEEK, HE CO-

17:42.962 --> 17:44.230
AUTHORED AN ARTICLE DESCRIBING

17:44.230 --> 17:45.965
THE SECRET TALKS THAT ULTIMATELY

17:45.965 --> 17:47.667
LED TO FREEDOM FOR BAE AND

17:47.667 --> 17:52.138
MILLER.

17:52.138 --> 17:54.073
>> SO HOW DID THIS COME TOGETHER

17:54.073 --> 17:57.143
AND WHY DNI CLAPPER?

17:57.143 --> 18:00.646
>> THE NORTH DECIDED IT WANTED A

18:00.646 --> 18:04.016
CABINET LEVEL EMISSARY, SENT TO

18:04.016 --> 18:05.618
COME PICK THE TWO AMERICANS.

18:05.618 --> 18:09.855
AND WHEN THE CABINET, WHEN THE

18:09.855 --> 18:12.258
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISORS TO

18:12.258 --> 18:15.027
THE PRESIDENT, CLAPPER WAS A

18:15.027 --> 18:17.830
STANDOUT, IS HE AN EXPERT ON THE

18:17.830 --> 18:19.565
NORTH AND HAS FOR THE NORTH AND

18:19.565 --> 18:21.701
SPENT TIME IN THE SOUTH OF KOREA

18:21.701 --> 18:22.702
EARLIER IN HIS CAREER.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.136
SO IT WAS A NATURAL PICK.

18:24.136 --> 18:26.772
AND HE FLEW IN, IT WAS KIND OF A

18:26.772 --> 18:29.408
VERY BIZARRE SCENARIO WHERE HE

18:29.408 --> 18:31.110
LITERALLY FLEW IN, WASN'T SURE

18:31.110 --> 18:32.411
HE WAS GOING TO BE BRINGING THEM

18:32.411 --> 18:33.412
HOME.

18:33.412 --> 18:34.680
WASN'T EVEN SURE WHAT WOULD BE

18:34.680 --> 18:35.815
ON THE AGENDA FOR HIS MEETINGS

18:35.815 --> 18:36.616
THERE.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.517
>> AND YOU SAID THEY ACTUALLY

18:38.517 --> 18:47.560
HAD A DOSSIER ON HIM.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.463
>> THEY KNEW HOW MANY FLIGHTS HE

18:50.463 --> 18:53.366
WAS ON WHEN HE WAS IN THE SOUTH

18:53.366 --> 18:55.067
FOR EXAMPLE.

18:55.067 --> 18:58.604
I THINK CLAPPER WAS SURPRISED

18:58.604 --> 19:01.040
BY, THAT THAT THEY HAD THAT MUCH

19:01.040 --> 19:03.075
INFORMATION AND THEY WERE TRYING

19:03.075 --> 19:04.610
TO IMPRESS HIM BY HOW MUCH THEY

19:04.610 --> 19:05.611
KNEW ABOUT HIM.

19:05.611 --> 19:07.847
THE NORTH WANTED HIM TO BE

19:07.847 --> 19:09.715
CARRYING SOME SORT OF BROADER

19:09.715 --> 19:11.317
PEACE OVERTURE, SOME SORT OF

19:11.317 --> 19:13.185
BREAK THROUGH, INSTEAD OF JUST

19:13.185 --> 19:14.620
TO COME TO PICK UP THE TWO

19:14.620 --> 19:16.689
AMERICANS AND THEY WERE VERY

19:16.689 --> 19:17.423
DISAPPOINTED BY THAT.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.191
AND HE WAS STRUCK BY WHAT HE SAW

19:19.191 --> 19:20.860
AS A GENERATIONAL GAP BETWEEN

19:20.860 --> 19:22.461
THE YOUNGER GENERATION AND THE

19:22.461 --> 19:24.497
OLDER GENERATION, THE YOUNGER

19:24.497 --> 19:26.032
BEING MORE WILLING TO DEAL WITH

19:26.032 --> 19:26.532
THE REST.

19:26.532 --> 19:28.667
>> WALK US THRUST THROUGH THE

19:28.667 --> 19:29.568
NEGOTIATION IF YOU WOULD.

19:29.568 --> 19:32.038
>> I WOULDN'T CALL IT A

19:32.038 --> 19:32.671
NEGOTIATION.

19:32.671 --> 19:33.839
SPECIFICALLY THEY CHOSE CLAPPER

19:33.839 --> 19:35.474
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE

19:35.474 --> 19:36.909
THE NORTH AN IMPRESSION THIS WAS

19:36.909 --> 19:39.912
A NEGOTIATION NEGOTIATION.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.047
NEGOTIATION.

19:41.047 --> 19:42.181
HE WAS THERE TO RECEIVE THE TWO

19:42.181 --> 19:43.149
AMERICANS.

19:43.149 --> 19:44.884
HE ARRIVES, GETS IN THE

19:44.884 --> 19:47.053
LIMOUSINE, HE ARRIVES AT A GUEST

19:47.053 --> 19:49.121
HOUSE WHERE THEY'RE PUTTING HIM

19:49.121 --> 19:52.491
UP, HE HAS A TENSE DINNER LASTED

19:52.491 --> 19:53.526
FOR MANY HOURS.

19:53.526 --> 19:57.930
HE HAD THE BEST KIMCHEE OF HIS

19:57.930 --> 19:59.899
ENTIRE LIFE, BUT IT WAS A TENSE

19:59.899 --> 20:00.833
ENCOUNTER.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.268
HE GOES BACK TO THE GUEST HOUSE

20:02.268 --> 20:04.103
AFTER THE MEAL, ISN'T SURE WHAT

20:04.103 --> 20:06.072
IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

20:06.072 --> 20:08.541
DURING THE MEETING, HE GIVERS A

20:08.541 --> 20:11.110
LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT TO HIS

20:11.110 --> 20:17.983
INTERLOCUTOR.

20:17.983 --> 20:20.319
RELEASE OF THE AMERICANS AS A

20:20.319 --> 20:22.121

20:26.192 --> 20:27.460
TO PACK HIS BAGS.

20:27.460 --> 20:32.298
HE HAD NO IDEA THAT THE --

20:32.298 --> 20:33.532
WHETHER THE MISSION WAS A

20:33.532 --> 20:34.333
FAILURE.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.402
HE PICKED UP THE TWO AMERICANS

20:36.402 --> 20:37.103
AND WENT BACK TO THE

20:37.103 --> 20:37.736
CONVERSATION.

20:37.736 --> 20:38.871
>> ANY FURTHER CONVERSATIONS?

20:38.871 --> 20:40.606
>> THERE WAS A SUGGESTION WHICH

20:40.606 --> 20:42.308
HE SEEMED OPEN TO FOR A RETURN

20:42.308 --> 20:44.844
VISIT AND YOU KNOW HE DEFINITELY

20:44.844 --> 20:46.979
CAME AWAY WITH A SENSE THAT ARE

20:46.979 --> 20:48.114
WAS IN ADDITION TO THIS

20:48.114 --> 20:49.648
GENERATIONAL GAP THERE WAS THIS

20:49.648 --> 20:50.816
HUNGER ON THE PART OF THE NORTH

20:50.816 --> 20:52.852
TO TRY TO BRING THE U.S. INTO

20:52.852 --> 20:53.452
SOME SORT OF DIALOGUE.

20:53.452 --> 20:56.655
>> SO WHAT ROLE DOES CHINA PLAY

20:56.655 --> 20:59.358
IN ALL THIS AND HAS NORTH KOREAN

20:59.358 --> 21:00.392
BEHAVIOR CHANGED OVER THE LAST

21:00.392 --> 21:01.127
COUPLE OF MONTHS?

21:01.127 --> 21:03.863
>> RIGHT, SO YEAH, I SPOKE ON

21:03.863 --> 21:06.432
LAST WEEK TO SENIOR DEFENSE

21:06.432 --> 21:08.868
OFFICIALS WHO HAVE BEEN TRACKING

21:08.868 --> 21:09.401

21:09.401 --> 21:12.037
AND OVER THE LAST TWO TO THREE

21:12.037 --> 21:15.007
MONTHS THERE'S BEEN A NOTICEABLE

21:15.007 --> 21:16.509
LACK OF AGGRESSIVENESS ON THE

21:16.509 --> 21:18.377
PART OF THE NORTH WHICH

21:18.377 --> 21:19.645
CONTRASTS WITH WHERE THE NORTH

21:19.645 --> 21:21.814
HAS BEEN DURING PREVIOUS CYCLES

21:21.814 --> 21:22.715
IN THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

21:22.715 --> 21:24.283
UNITED STATES.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.985

AGGRESSIVENESS OF THE NORTH

THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

21:50.809 --> 22:01.253
>> IT WAS A PLEASURE.

22:01.253 --> 22:02.154
>> Sreenivasan: TODAY ON CBS'S

22:02.154 --> 22:03.022
FACE THE NATION, CLAPPER SAID

22:03.022 --> 22:03.856
HE WASN'T SURE WHAT IMPACT HIS

22:03.856 --> 22:04.723
RECENT TRIP TO NORTH KOREA OR

22:04.723 --> 22:05.624
THE RELEASE OF THE PRISONERS

22:05.624 --> 22:06.492
WOULD HAVE.

22:06.492 --> 22:07.259
>> DO YOU THINK THIS HAS CHANGED

22:07.259 --> 22:07.793
ANYTHING?

22:07.793 --> 22:08.527
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

22:08.527 --> 22:09.295
I THINK THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN

22:09.295 --> 22:10.162
AS TO WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.297
WILL THIS PERHAPS SERVE AS A

22:11.297 --> 22:12.264
CATALYST OR STIMULUS FOR MORE

22:12.264 --> 22:14.800
DIALOGUE?

22:14.800 --> 22:23.342
I HOPE SO, BUT I DON'T KNOW.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.877
>> Sreenivasan: BRITAIN, LIKE

22:24.877 --> 22:26.045
THE UNITED STATES, IS FACING A

22:26.045 --> 22:27.213
GROWING OBESITY PROBLEM.

22:27.213 --> 22:28.013
AND IT MAY HAVE TO DO WITH WHAT

22:28.013 --> 22:28.781
PEOPLE DRINK AS WELL AS WHAT

22:28.781 --> 22:30.049
THEY EAT.

22:30.049 --> 22:31.116
NOW THE ROYAL SOCIETY FOR PUBLIC

22:31.116 --> 22:32.218
HEALTH IS ASKING THE E.U. TO

22:32.218 --> 22:33.352
SUPPORT ITS EFFORTS TO GET

22:33.352 --> 22:34.720
ALCOHOL MANUFACTURERS TO DISPLAY

22:34.720 --> 22:36.222
THE CALORIE COUNT ON BOTTLES OF

22:36.222 --> 22:39.458
BEER, WINE AND HARD LIQUOR.

22:39.458 --> 22:40.626
IT'S AN IDEA THE BRITISH BEER

22:40.626 --> 22:41.827
AND PUB ASSOCIATION SAYS IS

22:41.827 --> 22:43.862
UNWORKABLE, ONE THAT WILL LEAD

22:43.862 --> 22:45.397
TO CONFUSION AMONG DRINKERS.

22:45.397 --> 22:51.570
CHRIS CHOI OF ITV REPORTS.

22:51.570 --> 22:52.671
>> THIS IS NOT WHAT IT SEEMS.

22:52.671 --> 22:54.974
TWO GROUPS OF DRINKERS, EACH

22:54.974 --> 22:57.476
UNKNOWINGLY PARTICIPATING IN A

22:57.476 --> 23:00.246
SMALL-SCALE EXPERIMENT INTO

23:00.246 --> 23:01.680
NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION AND

23:01.680 --> 23:02.448
ALCOHOL.

23:02.448 --> 23:04.583
ONE GROUP HAS A DRINKS MENU WITH

23:04.583 --> 23:05.584
CALORIES.

23:05.584 --> 23:07.319
THE OTHER GROUP DOESN'T GET THAT

23:07.319 --> 23:07.786
INFORMATION.

23:07.786 --> 23:09.588
AND THE GROUP THAT HAVE THOSE

23:09.588 --> 23:11.957
DETAILS ON AVERAGE DRANK 400

23:11.957 --> 23:12.458
CALORIES LEST.

23:12.458 --> 23:14.727
>> FOR MYSELF BECAUSE I'M TRYING

23:14.727 --> 23:17.196
TO BE MORE LIKE STRICT ON IT I

23:17.196 --> 23:18.497
THINK HAVING THEM LABELED

23:18.497 --> 23:19.231
DEFINITELY HELPS.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.899
>> I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW THE

23:20.899 --> 23:21.900
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BEERS

23:21.900 --> 23:24.303
THAT WERE ON THE MENU SO I CHOSE

23:24.303 --> 23:25.404
BASED ON THE CALORIES.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.940
>> OUR THEORY IS THAT IF IT DID

23:27.940 --> 23:29.775
INFLUENCE THE AMOUNT PEOPLE

23:29.775 --> 23:30.909
DRINK, BECAUSE THEY BECOME AWARE

23:30.909 --> 23:32.611
OF THE NUMBER OF CALORIES IN

23:32.611 --> 23:35.914
THEIR DRINKS, THAT IT MIGHT JUST

23:35.914 --> 23:40.586
HELP TO THE BIG BATTLE OF

23:40.586 --> 23:41.487
OBESITY EPIDEMIC.

23:41.487 --> 23:44.323
>> MANY IN THE, BUT SAY DRINKS

23:44.323 --> 23:46.925
SUCH AS A LATTE COFFEE CAN HAVE

23:46.925 --> 23:48.460
JUST AS MANY CALORIES.

23:48.460 --> 23:50.429
>> HAVE YOU GOT ROOM TO PUT ALL

23:50.429 --> 23:51.530
THESE THINGS ON THE BACK OF A

23:51.530 --> 23:52.364
BOTTLE?

23:52.364 --> 23:53.532
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE

23:53.532 --> 23:55.267
HAVEN'T BEEN DOING IT SO FAR.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.202
WE ALSO HAVE THE CHIEF MEDICAL

23:57.202 --> 23:57.870
OFFICER'S GUIDANCE.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.138
WE HAVE THE STRENGTH OF THE

23:59.138 --> 24:00.472
PRODUCT AND WE HAVE PREGNANCY

24:00.472 --> 24:01.607
WARNINGS.

24:01.607 --> 24:04.576
>> THE DECISION ON NUTRITIONAL

24:04.576 --> 24:08.714
LABELING ON BOOZE REACHES THE EU

24:08.714 --> 24:11.450
IN DECEMBER.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.987
FOR YEARS NUTRITIONISTS HAVE

24:14.987 --> 24:17.056
OPENED UP ISSUES ON CALORIE

24:17.056 --> 24:23.962
LINES, NEW BATTLE LINES.

24:23.962 --> 24:24.663
>> Sreenivasan: SOME MORE NEWS

24:24.663 --> 24:25.898
BEFORE WE LEAVE YOU TONIGHT.

24:25.898 --> 24:26.865
THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS SHUT

24:26.865 --> 24:28.567
DOWN ITS UNCLASSIFIED EMAIL

24:28.567 --> 24:30.102
SYSTEM FOLLOWING AN SUSPECTED

24:30.102 --> 24:31.870
ATTACK BY HACKERS.

24:31.870 --> 24:33.572
THE MOVE WAS MADE LATE FRIDAY

24:33.572 --> 24:34.673
ACCORDING TO A SENIOR OFFICIAL

24:34.673 --> 24:36.075
WHO SAID NO CLASSIFIED

24:40.479 --> 24:42.581
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES

24:42.581 --> 24:44.483
IMPROPERLY APPROVED DISABILITY

24:44.483 --> 24:46.352
PAYMENTS TO NEARLY 25,000

24:46.352 --> 24:48.821
PEOPLE WHO DID NOT QUALIFY, THE

24:48.821 --> 24:51.623
COST OF $2 BILLION.

24:51.623 --> 24:52.791
THAT'S IT FOR THIS EDITION OF

24:52.791 --> 24:54.026
