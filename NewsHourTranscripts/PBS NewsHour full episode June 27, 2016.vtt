GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill.
Judy Woodruff is away.

00:09.109 --> 00:13.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: a
major decision
at the Supreme Court. Justices
reject abortion

00:13.280 --> 00:19.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
restrictions in Texas, the
biggest win for
abortion rights advocates in 25
years.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Also ahead this Monday:

00:21.221 --> 00:24.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: I'm Hari
Sreenivasan in
London. As the clouds of
uncertainty roll

00:24.424 --> 00:29.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by after the vote to leave the
European Union,
we explore the many
uncertainties that still

00:29.630 --> 00:31.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
remain for the future of the
United Kingdom.

00:31.899 --> 00:36.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And what books to
pack for the
beach? We kick off Jeffrey
Brown's summer

00:36.803 --> 00:42.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reading week. Tonight, "The
Girls," a debut
novel that's already a
bestseller.

00:42.075 --> 00:47.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:47.948 --> 00:50.284 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:50.317 --> 01:01.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's the Supreme
Court's biggest
abortion case in nearly a
quarter-century.

01:01.295 --> 01:07.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By 5-3, the justices struck down
a Texas law
that forced many abortion
clinics to close

01:07.301 --> 01:13.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by requiring doctors to have
admitting privileges
at nearby hospitals. It had
since been widely

01:13.340 --> 01:15.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
copied in other states.

01:15.242 --> 01:19.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Opponents of the law celebrated,
but both
sides vowed the fight will go
on.

01:19.079 --> 01:22.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY NORTHUP, President, Center
For Reproductive
Rights: Today's Supreme Court
decision is

01:22.849 --> 01:29.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a game-changer in the
unrelenting assault
on women's health and rights
that has been

01:29.256 --> 01:36.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going on in state legislatures
for years.
This is a tremendous victory,
and we will

01:36.396 --> 01:42.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go forward in making sure that
all of the
laws that are blocking women's
access to the

01:42.269 --> 01:45.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
constitutional rights will be
overturned.

01:45.105 --> 01:52.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PENNY YOUNG NANCE, President,
Concerned Women
for America: Unfortunately, the
Supreme Court

01:52.346 --> 01:54.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sided with big abortion. So we
stand here
as members of the pro-life
movement saying

01:54.114 --> 01:58.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we will not give up. If
anything, we're
more resolute. This next
election is about

01:58.852 --> 02:06.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between one and four Supreme
Court justices,
hundreds of lower court
justices, and 5,000

02:06.126 --> 02:12.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
appointees for our government.
We as a pro-life
community must vote. This is a
call to action.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We will not give up.

02:13.834 --> 02:17.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also today, the
court overturned
the bribery conviction of former
Virginia

02:17.637 --> 02:22.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Governor Bob McDonnell. The
unanimous decision
is likely to make it harder to
prosecute elected

02:22.809 --> 02:27.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officials for corruption. We
will explore
today's court action after the
news summary.

02:27.814 --> 02:33.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the day's other news:
Britain's vote to
quit the European Union weighed
on world markets

02:33.920 --> 02:40.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
again and on Wall Street. The
Dow Jones industrial
average lost 260 points on top
of the 600

02:40.293 --> 02:47.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
points it lost Friday. It closed
today at
17140. The Nasdaq fell 113
points, and the

02:47.267 --> 02:49.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
S&amp;P 500 dropped nearly 37.

02:50.003 --> 02:55.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, two debt rating
agencies, Standard
&amp; Poor's and Fitch, stripped
Britain of its

02:55.475 --> 02:57.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
top credit rating.

02:57.310 --> 03:02.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A new round of storms rolled
over West Virginia
today, as more than 20 counties
braced for

03:02.783 --> 03:07.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new flooding. Since last week,
floods across
the state have killed nearly two
dozen people

03:07.921 --> 03:12.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and destroyed scores of homes.
and police
warned today of looting in some
of the hardest-hit

03:12.859 --> 03:14.594 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
towns.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAPT. JIM SIZEMORE, Fayette
County Sheriff's
Department: We will be stepping
up patrols

03:16.363 --> 03:21.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in that area now that we're able
to get in
there easily. And the citizens
have armed

03:21.068 --> 03:26.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
themselves. If you decide to
loot and steal
from people who have already
been ravaged

03:26.840 --> 03:30.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by these floodwaters, you will
be lucky if
we're the ones that catch you.

03:30.110 --> 03:35.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: There's no damage
estimate yet,
but it could be the state's
worst in 30 years.

03:35.449 --> 03:41.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A wildfire in Central California
has now destroyed
250 homes and other buildings,
and killed

03:41.555 --> 03:48.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two people. The blaze has burned
across 45,000
acres in Kern County, about 110
miles north

03:48.795 --> 03:54.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Los Angeles. The fire is
about 40 percent
contained. It was stoked by
record-breaking

03:54.167 --> 03:57.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
heat and the state's ongoing
drought.

03:57.471 --> 04:02.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another 165 pages of e-mails
have emerged
from Hillary Clinton's tenure as
secretary

04:02.976 --> 04:08.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of state. They include 34 that
the Democratic
presidential hopeful had not
turned over to

04:08.248 --> 04:12.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the State Department. Instead,
the department
obtained them from Huma Abedin,
Clinton's

04:12.586 --> 04:18.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deputy chief of staff. A federal
court ordered
them made public in a lawsuit by
a conservative

04:18.625 --> 04:20.460 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
group.

04:20.494 --> 04:24.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The governments of Israel and
Turkey agreed
today to normalize relations,
ending a bitter

04:24.598 --> 04:31.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
six-year diplomatic rift. Turkey
severed ties
with Israel in 2010 after 10
Turkish activists

04:31.471 --> 04:36.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were killed trying to run the
Israeli naval
blockade of Gaza. Even today,
the two sides

04:36.877 --> 04:39.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
appeared at odds over future
access to Gaza.

04:39.513 --> 04:42.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, Israeli
Prime Minister:
I'm sure this is an agreement
that is good

04:42.382 --> 04:48.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for both sides, so I don't want
to start quibbling
on that, but I will say this:
The security

04:48.255 --> 04:51.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
naval blockade remains in place.

04:51.091 --> 04:53.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BINALI YILDIRIM, Turkish Prime
Minister (through
translator): Our first ship
carrying 10,000

04:53.660 --> 04:58.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tons of humanitarian aid will
set sail. Therefore,
the blockade there in Gaza will
have been

04:58.131 --> 05:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lifted with Turkey's leadership.

05:00.267 --> 05:06.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The agreement does
call for delivery
of relief supplies to Gaza, plus
an exchange

05:06.606 --> 05:12.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of ambassadors. And Israel will
pay compensation
for the deaths of the Turkish
activists.

05:12.612 --> 05:17.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey also moved today to
improve relations
with Russia. The Turkish
government announced

05:17.117 --> 05:21.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it will prosecute a man who
allegedly killed
a Russian military pilot shot
down at the

05:22.022 --> 05:27.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syrian border. In a letter to
Russian leader
Vladimir Putin, Turkish
President Recep Tayyip

05:27.961 --> 05:31.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Erdogan also apologized for
downing the jet.

05:31.531 --> 05:36.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the Supreme
Court's momentous ruling on
abortion access;

05:36.803 --> 05:43.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're on the ground in London
and in Scotland
as the reality of Brexit remains
foggy; Politics

05:43.376 --> 05:53.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Monday -- Elizabeth Warren goes
to bat against
Donald Trump; and much more.

05:53.420 --> 05:59.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Monday -- Elizabeth Warren goes
to bat against
Donald Trump; and much more.

05:59.326 --> 06:02.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We return to the historic day at
the Supreme
Court.

06:02.696 --> 06:08.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Abortion rights advocates
claimed a huge victory
as the eight-member court came
down 5-3 against

06:08.668 --> 06:11.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a restrictive Texas
anti-abortion law.

06:11.538 --> 06:16.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For more on end-of-term
decision, we turn
to "NewsHour" regular Marcia
Coyle, chief

06:16.209 --> 06:18.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Washington correspondent of "The
National
Law Journal."

06:18.878 --> 06:23.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marcia, just to be clear, we're
talking about
two different restrictive --
anti, restrictive

06:23.350 --> 06:24.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
laws that were returned today.

06:24.651 --> 06:25.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, "The National Law
Journal":
Right.

06:25.752 --> 06:27.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: How did this court
-- take us
back.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: OK.

06:28.154 --> 06:29.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: How did this case
get to the court?

06:29.489 --> 06:31.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: OK.

06:31.191 --> 06:35.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The abortion clinics in Texas, a
group of
them, challenged the two Texas
regulations

06:35.829 --> 06:42.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that were contained in a law
that is now known
as HB-2. It was enacted back in
2013. The

06:42.769 --> 06:49.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two regulations, one required
clinic doctors
to have admitting privileges at
hospitals

06:49.142 --> 06:51.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
within 30 miles of the clinic.

06:51.211 --> 06:57.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second regulation required
the clinics
to meet the building safety and
other standards

06:57.450 --> 07:01.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of ambulatory surgical centers
that are almost
hospital-like.

07:01.855 --> 07:05.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: What was the
practical effect
of the law as it stood before
the court waited?

07:05.759 --> 07:11.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Well, when the
admitting privileges
requirement went into effect,
roughly 20 of

07:11.498 --> 07:18.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the 40 existing Texas abortion
clinics closed.
The clinics estimated that when
the ambulatory

07:18.938 --> 07:24.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
surgical center requirement
would go into
effect, which it hadn't, that
the 20 remaining

07:24.744 --> 07:27.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
clinics would go down to seven
or eight.

07:27.447 --> 07:31.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Was this something
that -- we
have seen this happen with other
cases that

07:31.217 --> 07:35.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have made it to court, where
there was actually
a group that was looking for a
challenge?

07:35.455 --> 07:41.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: No, I mean, this
was actually
a reaction to what Texas had
enacted.

07:41.328 --> 07:46.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Texas claimed that these
regulations were
designed to protect the health
of women. The

07:47.000 --> 07:52.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
clinics claimed that the
regulations were
designed to stop abortions. So
the clinics

07:52.205 --> 07:58.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
challenged them. They lost in
the lower federal
appellate court, but won in the
trial court,

07:58.178 --> 08:02.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but because they lost in the
lower federal
appellate court, they had to go
to the Supreme

08:02.315 --> 08:04.117 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Court.

08:04.150 --> 08:08.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the Supreme Court, they
claimed that
these regulations were
unconstitutional under

08:08.054 --> 08:15.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the court's 1992 test that asks
whether the
regulations or restrictions
impose an undue

08:15.261 --> 08:18.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
burden on a woman's access to
abortion.

08:18.531 --> 08:24.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you know, what is an undue
burden? This
is why this case attracted so
much attention

08:24.237 --> 08:29.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and concern. What was the court
going to say?
How was it going to apply that
test? Well,

08:29.342 --> 08:36.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the court in '92 did say that
unnecessary
regulations that have the
purpose or effect

08:36.082 --> 08:44.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of imposing a substantial
obstacle in the
path of the woman constituted an
undue, unconstitutional

08:44.190 --> 08:46.025 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
burden.

08:46.059 --> 08:50.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's what five justices
found today
the way the two restrictions
were implemented.

08:50.430 --> 08:52.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's the effect of those.

08:52.198 --> 08:55.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now, we talk all the
time about
how there are normally nine
justice, but in

08:55.468 --> 08:56.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this case, there were eight
justices.

08:56.236 --> 08:57.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Yes.

08:58.004 --> 09:00.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the affirmative
action last
week, there was an outcome
because one of

09:00.507 --> 09:02.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the justices recused herself.

09:02.409 --> 09:07.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this case, a 5-3 decision on
something
this important, something this
hot-button,

09:07.380 --> 09:10.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how did that happen, how did it
come about,
and what was the reasoning that
the court

09:10.950 --> 09:11.418 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
put out?

09:11.451 --> 09:13.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: OK.

09:13.286 --> 09:16.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, I don't think that
Justice Scalia's
presence on the court, had he
lived, would

09:16.923 --> 09:20.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have made a difference in the
outcome. I think
he would have been in the
dissent, and it

09:21.027 --> 09:22.295 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
would have been a 5-4 decision.

09:22.328 --> 09:24.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Right.

09:24.164 --> 09:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Justice Breyer
wrote the majority
opinion, and he took the two
requirements

09:27.100 --> 09:30.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one by one, the admitting
privileges requirement.

09:30.170 --> 09:36.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Abortions, he said, have very
rare complications.
You don't really need the
hospital at hand

09:36.910 --> 09:43.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
within 30 miles. He also said
that clinic
doctors already had working
arrangements with

09:43.116 --> 09:47.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other physicians who did have
admitting privileges
in case it was needed.

09:47.921 --> 09:53.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then he looked at the effect
here. When the
privileges requirement went into
effect, 20

09:53.359 --> 10:01.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of 40 clinics closed, the
result, fewer doctors,
increased crowding, longer
waits, longer drive

10:01.768 --> 10:07.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
distances, and he said there was
just no health
problem that this law was
seeking to cure.

10:07.607 --> 10:15.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On the surgical centers
requirement, there,
he looked and he said, OK,
abortion has fewer

10:15.281 --> 10:22.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
complications than many of the
procedures
that Texas law allows to be done
outside of

10:22.155 --> 10:29.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
surgical centers, in homes, in
offices. And
the risks there, he said,
ordinary birth,

10:29.295 --> 10:32.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
childbirth, is 14 times the
risk.

10:32.432 --> 10:38.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what's the impact then of
that requirement?
He looked at that. The 20
remaining clinics

10:38.104 --> 10:39.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
would go down to seven or eight.

10:39.939 --> 10:44.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But the surprise, at
least for
we novices, was that Justice
Kennedy ended

10:44.077 --> 10:47.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up on the same side as -- more
or less as
Justice Breyer.

10:47.080 --> 10:52.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Well, Justice
Kennedy was in
that 1992 decision that
reaffirmed Roe v.

10:52.952 --> 10:54.754 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Wade.

10:54.787 --> 11:00.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He had expressed some
unhappiness with how
the court had applied the 1992
position when

11:00.059 --> 11:07.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it took up some of Nebraska's
partial-birth
abortion act. But he -- as
Justice Breyer

11:07.567 --> 11:13.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said in his opinion, as long as
the court
continued to follow Roe v. Wade
and that 1992

11:13.973 --> 11:19.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Casey decision, this was the way
they should
interpret the undue burden.

11:19.145 --> 11:24.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gwen, Justice Kennedy was the
senior justice
in the majority in this case, so
he had the

11:24.684 --> 11:28.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right to assign the opinion to
anyone who
was in the majority.

11:28.254 --> 11:30.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: By assigning it to
Justice Breyer,
he knew what he was getting.

11:30.857 --> 11:35.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: He did. And he got
a very fact-laden,
straightforward opinion from
Justice Breyer.

11:35.728 --> 11:38.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Marcia Coyle of
"National Law
Journal," thank you very much.
And thank you

11:38.731 --> 11:40.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the whole term. This has
been exciting.

11:40.233 --> 11:43.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Oh, it's been an
unusual term.
Thanks, Gwen. My pleasure.

11:43.736 --> 11:49.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We are now joined by
advocates
on both sides of the court's
abortion decision.

11:49.709 --> 11:53.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nancy Northup is president of
the Center for
Reproductive Rights, which
helped bring the

11:53.646 --> 11:58.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
challenge against the Texas law
to the courts.
And favoring the Texas law,
Steven Aden, he's

11:58.885 --> 12:02.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
senior counsel for Alliance
Defending Freedom.

12:02.155 --> 12:05.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nancy Northup, since you had the
big victory
today, we will start with you.

12:05.558 --> 12:09.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tell us what the effect is of
this ruling
in a small sense, what happens
in Texas, and

12:10.029 --> 12:11.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a broader sense, what happens
around the
country?

12:11.931 --> 12:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY NORTHUP, President, Center
for Reproductive
Rights: This was a tremendous
victory today.

12:14.033 --> 12:16.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was just a clear-out win.

12:16.569 --> 12:21.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what that means for Texas
is that the
clinics that are currently open
in Texas can

12:21.441 --> 12:26.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
stay open -- they were
threatened to be closed
by this underhanded law -- and
also that other

12:26.079 --> 12:30.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clinics would be able to reopen.
You know,
one of the things that happened
with HB-2

12:31.017 --> 12:35.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was that it devastated abortion
access in
Texas, closing half of the laws,
under which

12:35.989 --> 12:40.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Supreme Court said today was
unconstitutional,
because they weren't justified
on medical

12:40.226 --> 12:41.961 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
grounds at all.

12:41.995 --> 12:44.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, Steven Aden,
what worked and
what didn't in your argument to
keep those

12:44.764 --> 12:48.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- or try to limit the scope of
the abortion
clinics?

12:48.935 --> 12:50.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN ADEN, Alliance Defending
Freedom: Well,
we believe, of course, that it's
a very big

12:50.937 --> 12:54.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
disappointment and a big loss
for women's
health and safety.

12:54.540 --> 12:59.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All Texas was trying to do was
regulate abortion
in the same way and same manner
as other similar

12:59.612 --> 13:04.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outpatient abortion procedures.
If you or
I go in for a colonoscopy or a
laparoscopy,

13:04.584 --> 13:09.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chances are very good that our
doctor will
have admitting privileges,
because once in

13:09.122 --> 13:13.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a while, something goes wrong.
And when something
goes wrong, you want the best
standard of

13:13.426 --> 13:15.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
health care available to help
you.

13:15.428 --> 13:19.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's all that Texas was
trying to do.
And the fact that the Supreme
Court would

13:19.065 --> 13:24.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strike this law down by one
vote, which it
did, doesn't augur well,
unfortunately, for

13:24.137 --> 13:25.772 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
women's health.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Weren't you hoping
more for a
4-4 let it stand ruling, rather
than...

13:27.874 --> 13:31.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN ADEN: That would have
been the result,
that's right, Gwen. If Justice
Kennedy had

13:31.244 --> 13:35.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come along, it would have been a
4-4 split,
and the good Fifth Circuit
decision affirming

13:35.548 --> 13:38.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the laws would have been upheld.
But, alas,
that didn't happen today.

13:38.217 --> 13:41.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Nancy Northup, what
about this
argument that this was something
affecting

13:41.387 --> 13:44.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women's health and in fact that
the law was
designed to protect women's
health?

13:44.624 --> 13:49.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY NORTHUP: Well, I think the
Supreme Court
made clear today that this was a
pretext,

13:49.762 --> 13:54.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the idea that it was about
women's health,
because, as the American Medical
Association

13:54.934 --> 13:56.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and others saw, it didn't
advance women's
health.

13:56.903 --> 14:01.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in fact it hurt it by
putting so many
women out of reach of being able
to get abortion

14:01.941 --> 14:06.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
services. It's a game-changer,
the decision
from the Supreme Court today,
which is why

14:06.045 --> 14:10.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're excited about it, because
we have been
fighting these kind of sham laws
for years.

14:10.717 --> 14:15.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Supreme Court has really
made clear
that you have got to have a
justification

14:15.655 --> 14:19.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you're going to regulate
abortion, and
that you have to make sure that
the burden

14:19.325 --> 14:24.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
doesn't overwhelm the
justification that the
law has, or it can't stand.

14:24.363 --> 14:28.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Steven Aden, was
this a game-changer?
Is this landmark, historical,
all those big

14:28.334 --> 14:30.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
words we have been using today?

14:30.236 --> 14:33.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN ADEN: It remains to be
seen whether
this is a one-off. As I said,
this was basically

14:33.272 --> 14:36.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the decision of one justice who
went the other
way.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Isn't that how most
things get
decided in the court?

14:39.011 --> 14:40.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEVEN ADEN: Unfortunately, yes.

14:40.813 --> 14:45.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what we will find out in
years to come
with I'm sure many cases like
this coming

14:45.051 --> 14:50.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before the court is whether the
Supreme Court
is in earnest in making it more
difficult

14:50.757 --> 14:56.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for states to regulate abortion,
the same
way they do similar outpatient
medical providers.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's all Texas was really
trying to do.

14:58.264 --> 15:05.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the fact that it in fact
closed a number
of clinics says two things.
First, as the

15:05.304 --> 15:09.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lead plaintiff in one of the
cases, Amy Hagstrom
Miller, said twice to The Wall
Street Journal,

15:09.575 --> 15:14.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she's more concerned about
Planned Parenthood
closing her down, because
Planned Parenthood

15:14.046 --> 15:18.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is cornering the market for
abortion in Texas,
than about regulation itself.

15:18.551 --> 15:23.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we don't know why those
clinics closed,
many of them. We just know that
they did.

15:23.723 --> 15:27.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that was the argument that
Texas made.
But, unfortunately, again, the
Supreme Court

15:27.460 --> 15:29.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by one vote didn't accept that
argument.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I want you to
respond to that.
And then I want to ask you about
that single-vote

15:31.664 --> 15:33.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
majority.

15:33.299 --> 15:35.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NANCY NORTHUP: Well, I think
really the decision
today is the response to that.

15:35.168 --> 15:39.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The court could not have been
clearer that
was no justification for these
laws. And this

15:39.438 --> 15:45.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is what we have been facing in
scores of laws
passed around the country. And
court after

15:45.244 --> 15:48.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
court after court in general
have blocked
them because they're not
justified. They see

15:48.881 --> 15:53.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them for what they are, which is
an attempt
to do by the back door what you
can't by the

15:53.286 --> 15:56.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
front, which is ban abortion.

15:56.255 --> 16:01.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Supreme Court reiterated
today, as it
has for 40 years, women have a
right to make

16:01.227 --> 16:06.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the important personal decisions
for their
lives. And with this decision
today, the reason

16:06.299 --> 16:11.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's so monumental is that it
protects for
the next generation of American
women the

16:11.337 --> 16:13.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right to make these decisions
for themselves.

16:13.172 --> 16:16.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk about how
the decision
got made. You have mentioned a
couple of times,

16:16.909 --> 16:21.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Steven Aden, that Justice
Kennedy, is who
you're speaking of in this case,
decided basically

16:21.848 --> 16:23.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to tip the balance. Were you
surprised by
that?

16:23.850 --> 16:25.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEVEN ADEN: A little bit.

16:25.651 --> 16:29.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has made no secret of his
antipathy for
abortion. He spoke strongly
against it the

16:29.889 --> 16:35.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last time the Supreme Court made
a pronouncement
on the practice back in Gonzales
v. Carhart.

16:35.828 --> 16:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is interesting to note
about this is,
when you talk about women making
decisions,

16:40.600 --> 16:46.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this law was upheld twice by two
Fifth Circuit
panels. Open those Fifth Circuit
panels were

16:46.906 --> 16:53.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
five different women, and I
think that says
a lot for how women view this
law.

16:53.112 --> 16:55.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By and large, when they get a
chance to look
at the facts, they uphold it.
But in this

16:55.915 --> 17:02.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
case, one man, Justice Breyer,
writing for
the court, decided that law was
a no-go, imposed

17:02.321 --> 17:04.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an undue burden, which is a
shame.

17:04.090 --> 17:07.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: What about that, the
idea that
one man writing for the court
turned this

17:07.727 --> 17:12.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
upside down, against the
interests of women?

17:12.198 --> 17:17.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY NORTHUP: The Supreme Court
obviously
is -- five justices ruled today
in our favor.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the issue is not whether
it's men or women
sitting on the court.

17:19.872 --> 17:24.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Americans differ in their views
about abortion.
What's important and the courts
recognize

17:24.377 --> 17:30.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, while people of good faith
can disagree
about abortion, the Constitution
protects

17:30.416 --> 17:34.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our decisions that we make about
whether or
not to end a pregnancy, the
decisions about

17:34.687 --> 17:36.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our family and our lives and our
health.

17:36.722 --> 17:42.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's what matters. So
people can make
their own decisions, but what
the court protects

17:42.395 --> 17:47.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and the rule of law was
vindicated today was
that it is for women to make
these decisions.

17:47.767 --> 17:51.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's been true for over 40
years, and it
was reaffirmed again today in
this important

17:51.470 --> 17:52.939 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
case.

17:52.972 --> 17:54.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That said, were you
surprised
by Justice Kennedy's decision?

17:54.774 --> 17:58.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY NORTHUP: Justice Kennedy
was in the
majority in the Planned
Parenthood vs. Casey

17:58.978 --> 18:04.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
case, which was the last huge
abortion case
that set the standard that the
court interpreted

18:04.083 --> 18:05.885 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

18:05.918 --> 18:09.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So Justice Kennedy was
consistent with the
decision, as the court was in
what they ruled

18:09.188 --> 18:10.923 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on 24 years ago.

18:10.957 --> 18:14.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let me ask you both
briefly, is
this it? Is this over, or does
this fight

18:15.027 --> 18:16.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
continue in another way?

18:16.796 --> 18:19.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEVEN ADEN: I think it
continues in many
ways. The pro-life movement has
been winning

18:20.032 --> 18:25.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on all fronts. It lost today in
this one court,
but it's been winning in the
court of public

18:25.071 --> 18:30.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opinion. It's been winning the
First Amendment
questions about access to
sidewalks in front

18:30.576 --> 18:32.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of abortion clinics.

18:32.445 --> 18:38.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By and large, the -- in fact,
the abortion
rate today is the same as it was
in 1973,

18:38.050 --> 18:42.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the year Roe vs. Wade was
decided, which tells
me that the pro-life movement is
winning.

18:42.722 --> 18:45.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we will continue to
win, regardless
of what the courts say, although
the fight

18:45.624 --> 18:46.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will continue in the courts.

18:46.926 --> 18:49.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NANCY NORTHUP: We have a lot of
work ahead
of us.

18:49.061 --> 18:53.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are state laws that we're
going to get
overturned in the light of this
decision.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the momentum is on our side.
In fact,
seven in 10 Americans do support
that women

18:58.771 --> 19:02.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should be able to make the
decision about
terminating a pregnancy.

19:02.308 --> 19:06.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, as we see the fight is
going to go
ahead, we are going to see the
momentum be

19:06.145 --> 19:11.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the side. And the Supreme
Court's overwhelming
rejection of underhanded tactics
that they

19:11.684 --> 19:13.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
did today is a really good sign
for the future.

19:14.020 --> 19:17.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Nancy Northup,
president of the
Center for Reproductive Rights,
and Steven

19:17.490 --> 19:21.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Aden, senior counsel for
Alliance Defending
Freedom, thank you both very
much.

19:21.260 --> 19:24.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NANCY NORTHUP: Thank you.

19:24.930 --> 19:29.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEVEN ADEN: Thank you, Gwen.

19:29.535 --> 19:37.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We turn now to
Britain, and the
hangover from last week's
historic vote.

19:37.543 --> 19:39.245 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan is in London.

19:39.278 --> 19:43.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There is
confusion with
a touch of remorse here in
England as the

19:43.349 --> 19:48.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reality of their vote to leave
the E.U. settles
in. Key promises that were made
are being

19:48.621 --> 19:52.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
walked back, and Parliament is
met with the
task of picking a new prime
minister.

19:52.925 --> 19:56.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CAMERON, British Prime
Minister: The
decision must be accepted, and
the process

19:56.128 --> 19:59.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of implementing the decision in
the best possible
way must now begin.

19:59.932 --> 20:03.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It was his
first appearance
in the House of Commons since
the fateful

20:03.636 --> 20:07.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vote, and Prime Minister David
Cameron sought
to reassure a jittery country.

20:07.640 --> 20:11.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CAMERON: We know that this
is going
to be far from plain sailing.
However, we

20:11.143 --> 20:15.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should take confidence from the
fact that
Britain is ready to confront
what the future

20:15.514 --> 20:18.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
holds for us from a position of
strength.

20:18.417 --> 20:22.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Cameron
himself will not
be a part of that effort. He
opposed leaving

20:22.488 --> 20:28.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the E.U., and plans to step down
by fall.
His Labor Party counterpart,
Jeremy Corbyn,

20:28.360 --> 20:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also opposed Brexit and is also
under pressure
to quit. Nearly 30 members of
his inner circle

20:33.599 --> 20:37.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have resigned since Sunday to
protest Corbyn's
leadership.

20:37.536 --> 20:42.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those who championed taking
Britain out of
the E.U. face criticism as well
amid claims

20:42.208 --> 20:47.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have no concrete plans for
what to do
next. One urgent question,
exactly when and

20:47.580 --> 20:53.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how the United Kingdom will
formally depart
the E.U. First, London must
invoke Article

20:53.919 --> 20:59.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
50 of the E.U. treaty, which
governs exiting
the union. That, in turn, will
start negotiations

20:59.592 --> 21:01.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that could take two years.

21:01.994 --> 21:05.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Prime Minister Cameron said
today the government
is in no rush to take that step.

21:05.865 --> 21:10.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CAMERON: The British
government will
not be triggering Article 50 at
this stage.

21:10.636 --> 21:14.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before we do that, we need to
determine the
kind of relationship we want
with the E.U.,

21:15.007 --> 21:18.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that is rightly something
for the next
prime minister and their Cabinet
to decide.

21:18.744 --> 21:23.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: European
leaders also met
today in Berlin and agreed no
formal or informal

21:23.849 --> 21:29.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exit talks will begin before
Britain officially
invokes Article 50. German
Chancellor Angela

21:29.221 --> 21:32.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Merkel acknowledged they don't
expect that
to happen overnight.

21:32.158 --> 21:36.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA MERKEL, German Chancellor
(through
translator): We can't afford
long-term uncertainty.

21:36.295 --> 21:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It wouldn't be in either side's
economic interest.
But I have a certain
understanding that Great

21:41.233 --> 21:44.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Britain needs a certain amount
of time to
analyze things.

21:44.637 --> 21:49.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Meanwhile,
efforts are under
way to calm other members of the
E.U.

21:49.108 --> 21:53.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. Secretary of State John
Kerry was in
Brussels today, meeting with the
E.U.'s federal

21:53.345 --> 21:55.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
policy chief, Federica
Mogherini.

21:55.147 --> 21:58.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: Oh, I
think it is absolutely essential
that we stay

21:58.918 --> 22:05.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
focused on how, in this
transitional period,
nobody loses their head, nobody
goes off half-cocked,

22:05.724 --> 22:15.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people don't start ginning up
scatterbrained
or revengeful premises, but we
look for ways

22:16.001 --> 22:21.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to maintain the strength that
will serve the
interests and The values that
brought us together

22:21.373 --> 22:23.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the first place.

22:23.175 --> 22:26.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Kerry traveled
on to London
to meet with his British
counterpart, Philip

22:26.679 --> 22:30.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hammond, and said the U.S.
relationship with
the U.K. will stay strong.

22:30.916 --> 22:35.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But global markets are another
matter, and
they fell again today, despite
attempts at

22:35.387 --> 22:38.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reassurance by the British
treasury chief,
George Osborne.

22:38.090 --> 22:41.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GEORGE OSBORNE, British
Chancellor of the
Exchequer: We were prepared for
the unexpected,

22:41.260 --> 22:46.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and we are equipped for whatever
happens.
And we are determined that,
unlike eight years

22:46.866 --> 22:53.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago, Britain's financial system
will help
our country deal with any shocks
and dampen

22:53.405 --> 22:57.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them, not contribute to those
shocks or make
them worse.

22:57.643 --> 23:02.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Former London
Mayor Boris
Johnson, one of the most
prominent leave campaigners,

23:02.081 --> 23:04.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
welcomed Osborne's efforts to
allay concerns.

23:04.383 --> 23:07.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BORIS JOHNSON, Former Mayor of
London: It's
clear now that project fear is
over. There

23:07.620 --> 23:12.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not going to be an emergency
budget, people's
pensions are safe, the pound is
stable, the

23:12.725 --> 23:15.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
markets are stable, and I think
that's all
very good news.

23:15.794 --> 23:19.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Still, a
leading British
business group said 20 percent
of its 1,000

23:19.898 --> 23:25.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
members now plan to move some of
their operations
outside the U.K.

23:25.104 --> 23:29.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We head to Scotland now, where
Malcolm Brabant
reports on the mood among
citizens where a

23:29.041 --> 23:31.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
majority of voters had wanted to
stay.

23:31.610 --> 23:36.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Stung by the
Brexit vote
in England and Wales, Scotland
now appears

23:36.315 --> 23:42.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be racing along the road to
independence.
Two years ago, Scots voted in a
referendum

23:42.121 --> 23:47.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against leaving the United
Kingdom, above
all because it guaranteed
continued membership

23:47.626 --> 23:50.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the European Union.

23:50.396 --> 23:55.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to independence
activist Stuart
Bremner, Brexit feels like
betrayal.

23:55.067 --> 23:58.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART BREMNER, Independence
Activist: The
Scottish referendum was a bit
like the final

23:58.871 --> 24:02.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cracks opening in the British
Empire, and
what we're seeing in this in the
last couple

24:02.508 --> 24:06.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of days could be not just
cracks, but the
final heart of the British
Empire splintering

24:06.945 --> 24:10.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
completely. People are unable to
say what
they feel because they're so
emotional. There's

24:10.683 --> 24:12.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tears. There's anger.

24:12.418 --> 24:16.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was in a march and a rally
just in this
very square on Friday night, and
there were

24:16.722 --> 24:20.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people speaking, there were
people crying.
And people are upset, deeply
upset by this.

24:20.626 --> 24:26.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's almost beyond words,
just because
it's too enormous. What's
happening is beyond

24:26.865 --> 24:28.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anything we have ever known in
this country
in our lifetimes.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: On Edinburgh's
Royal Mile,
an upbeat tune swirled from the
pipes of Thomas

24:30.269 --> 24:34.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Wilson, but in his heart was a
lament.

24:34.606 --> 24:41.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS WILSON, Musician: I'm
incredibly disappointed,
actually. I never -- obviously,
I never wanted

24:41.747 --> 24:46.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to leave the E.U. I'm incredibly
worried.
I think, well, for starters, I'm
a big supporter

24:46.618 --> 24:51.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of free movement around Europe.
I enjoy going
around Europe, and busking and
traveling to

24:51.857 --> 24:54.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all the different kind of
cities, you know?

24:54.760 --> 24:57.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I find it very disappointing
that I will
not be able to do that as easily
anymore.

24:57.963 --> 25:02.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we should go for another
-- our own
independence referendum again,
which I hope

25:02.334 --> 25:07.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will happen in the next two
years, because
that's when the U.K. are
planning on leaving

25:07.639 --> 25:09.608 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Europe.

25:09.641 --> 25:14.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: With an opinion
poll estimating
that nearly 60 percent of Scots
now want independence,

25:14.413 --> 25:19.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon
has taken the
nation's pulse and put the
wheels in motion.

25:19.318 --> 25:24.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLA STURGEON, Scottish First
Minister:
A second independence referendum
is clearly

25:24.656 --> 25:32.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an option that requires to be on
the table
and it is very much on the
table. And to ensure

25:32.064 --> 25:40.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that that option is a
deliverable one in the
required timetable, steps will
be taken now

25:40.239 --> 25:44.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to ensure that the necessary
legislation is
in place.

25:44.343 --> 25:49.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: That's music to
the ears
of hard-core Scottish
nationalists, who've

25:49.882 --> 25:55.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
never abandoned hope of what
they regard as
liberation, especially at the
permanent vigil

25:55.387 --> 26:00.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Edinburgh, where campaigners
display the
Arbroath Declaration of
Independence, written

26:01.026 --> 26:05.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the 14th century by the
legendary Scottish
King Robert the Bruce.

26:05.864 --> 26:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Unemployed bricklayer's laborer
Dean Halliday.

26:08.100 --> 26:13.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEAN HALLIDAY, Scotland: They
made their decision
about their country. We made our
decision

26:13.138 --> 26:19.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about ours. There's no
difference. We don't
not like the English people. The
English people

26:19.278 --> 26:26.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are lovely people. It's their
government that
we don't want to be tied to. We
can't keep

26:27.019 --> 26:33.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
being subservient to a
government that's not
working in our best interests,
and that's

26:34.026 --> 26:35.894 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Westminster.

26:35.928 --> 26:40.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Outside
Scotland's idiosyncratic
Parliament Building,
Holyroodhouse, the Brexit

26:40.199 --> 26:46.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vote has reaffirmed history
lecturer Lesley
Orr's desire for independence.
She believes

26:46.271 --> 26:48.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Scotland is sufficiently mature
to flourish.

26:48.774 --> 26:54.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESLEY ORR, Professor: Scotland
is not just
part of the state of the United
Kingdom, but

26:54.746 --> 27:02.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's a nation which has its own
longstanding,
centuries-old traditions,
relationships, legal

27:02.921 --> 27:11.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
framework, educational system,
religious tradition,
all of which are different from
that of England

27:11.230 --> 27:13.131 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and of Wales.

27:13.165 --> 27:16.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The leader of
the main opposition
Scottish Conservative Party,
Ruth Davidson,

27:16.568 --> 27:20.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is vehemently opposed to a
second independence
vote north of the border.

27:20.506 --> 27:23.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RUTH DAVIDSON, Scottish
Parliament Member:
The U.K. market is worth four
times as much

27:23.876 --> 27:28.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Scotland's in the E.U.
market. I cannot
support even further instability
by having

27:28.480 --> 27:33.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a second independence
referendum. We voted
on that in Scotland. We had a
clear vote with

27:33.051 --> 27:35.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a clear mandate to stay within
the United
Kingdom.

27:35.454 --> 27:39.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we all now have to work
together, Scottish
government and U.K. government,
to get the

27:39.124 --> 27:41.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
best deal for Scotland's
businesses going
forward.

27:41.326 --> 27:45.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Scotland's
first minister,
Nicola Sturgeon, is advising
Parliament here

27:45.297 --> 27:50.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to vote against Britain leaving
the European
Union. Some people are hoping
that her words

27:50.569 --> 27:55.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mean that Scotland has the power
of veto.
But constitutional experts say
that is not

27:55.607 --> 28:00.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the case. All the Parliament can
do is to
advise Westminster.

28:00.712 --> 28:05.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Christine O'Neill, one of
Scotland's top constitutional
lawyers, believes the country
should be in

28:05.250 --> 28:10.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
line for fast-track membership
of the E.U.,
if it becomes independent.

28:10.155 --> 28:13.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHRISTINE O'NEILL,
Constitutional Lawyer:
Well, the first point is the
E.U. normally

28:13.625 --> 28:18.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deals with states, rather than
sub-state entities.
So it would be quite difficult
for Scotland

28:18.263 --> 28:23.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be a member of the E.U.
without being a
state in its own right.

28:23.035 --> 28:28.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Scotland was to become
independent, then
it could negotiate its way into
the E.U. in

28:28.740 --> 28:33.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the way other states have done
in the past.
And we would expect Scotland to
be in a strong

28:33.345 --> 28:36.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
position to negotiate
membership, given that
it's in the E.U. at the moment.

28:36.982 --> 28:41.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But what about
business?
Edinburgh was the birthplace of
Adam Smith,

28:41.954 --> 28:47.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the economist who espoused the
virtues of
the free market. Whiskey is a
pillar of the

28:47.192 --> 28:53.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scottish economy, providing 10
percent of
the nation's exports to the
E.U., and generating

28:54.032 --> 28:55.901 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
40,000 jobs.

28:55.934 --> 28:59.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to industry spokesman
David Williamson,
the producers aren't sure which
way to jump

28:59.605 --> 29:01.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over independence.

29:01.506 --> 29:03.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WILLIAMSON, Whiskey
Industry Spokesman:
Scotch whiskey has been around
for 500 years.

29:03.275 --> 29:07.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will still be selling Scotch
whiskey to
markets around Europe. But what
our members

29:07.579 --> 29:13.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are telling us is that there's
uncertainty,
for example, access to and
influence within

29:13.452 --> 29:15.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the single market, our biggest
market.

29:15.287 --> 29:20.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And also for us as an export
industry, how
do we keep benefiting from the
trade deals

29:20.192 --> 29:22.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the E.U. has negotiated
with countries
around the world?

29:22.894 --> 29:27.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: At Arthur's
Seat, the volcanic
crag dominating Edinburgh,
business leader

29:27.532 --> 29:33.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jill Murphy insisted that
Scotland had nothing
to fear from Great Britain
becoming the dis-United

29:33.271 --> 29:34.973 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Kingdom.

29:35.007 --> 29:37.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JILL MURPHY, Business Leader: We
polled our
members, and 82 percent of them
were clear

29:37.976 --> 29:42.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they wanted to remain
within the European
Union, and that's because we're
a net exporter.

29:42.848 --> 29:50.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want to keep that single
market open. We
want to keep that area of trade
open. It benefits

29:50.255 --> 29:55.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scottish business, but it also
benefits our
-- it benefits our youth in
studying future

29:55.661 --> 29:58.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
innovators and future investors
in the Scottish
economy.

29:58.630 --> 30:02.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But there were
cautionary
words from Frances and Ioannis
(ph) Lalos.

30:02.701 --> 30:07.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's Scottish. He's Greek. They
moved to
Scotland from Athens six years
ago to escape

30:07.506 --> 30:12.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Greek financial crisis. They
have worked
hard to become financially
secure, are about

30:12.944 --> 30:17.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to buy a house, but are worried
about the
currency of a future independent
Scotland.

30:17.816 --> 30:21.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRANCES LALOS, Teaching
Assistant: If Scotland
was to become independent from
the U.K., they

30:21.787 --> 30:25.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would, I presume, have to enter
the Eurozone
like the rest of the countries
entering the

30:25.957 --> 30:30.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
euro when they join the European
Union. And
that would be a concern for me.
We experienced

30:30.529 --> 30:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that living in Greece. And it
was a disaster
for Greece. I wouldn't want that
to happen

30:35.133 --> 30:41.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Scotland. It's a small
country in a big
pond, and I have concerns that
might not work

30:41.440 --> 30:43.241 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out well.

30:43.275 --> 30:48.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Four days after
the referendum,
and warnings of Armageddon,
Britain is still

30:48.413 --> 30:52.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
floating along, although her
foundations seem
to have vanished.

30:52.050 --> 30:56.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But here in Edinburgh, as in the
rest of the
United Kingdom, no one seems to
know what

30:56.221 --> 31:02.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the future will bring, except it
will be like
Scotland's national symbol,
prickly.

31:02.294 --> 31:07.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Edinburgh.

31:07.299 --> 31:19.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

31:19.344 --> 31:24.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Jeff Brown kicks
off our summer reading series
with a highly

31:24.116 --> 31:29.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anticipated novel, one loosely
based on the
women in Charles Manson's cult.

31:29.054 --> 31:34.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: Democrats Hillary
Clinton and
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth
Warren hit

31:34.426 --> 31:40.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the trail today in Ohio,
focusing their energy
on presumptive Republican
nominee Donald Trump.

31:40.432 --> 31:45.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The candidates are squaring off
over trade,
Brexit, and which one of them is
more qualified.

31:45.937 --> 31:50.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For that, we turn to Politics
Monday with
Amy Walter of The Cook Political
Report and

31:50.475 --> 31:52.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tamara Keith of NPR.

31:52.911 --> 31:57.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Let's start by the big
Cincinnati standoff
today -- I don't think it was a
standoff -- between

31:57.916 --> 32:03.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Elizabeth Warren, an apparently
very exciting
rally, and Hillary Clinton in
which we saw

32:03.054 --> 32:07.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the two of them basically take
turns taking
shots at Donald Trump.

32:07.592 --> 32:09.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's take a listen.

32:09.995 --> 32:11.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D),
Massachusetts:
What kind of man roots for
people to lose

32:11.997 --> 32:17.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their jobs, to lose their homes,
to lose their
life savings? I will tell you
what kind of

32:17.702 --> 32:23.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a man, a small, insecure
money-grubber who
fights for no one but himself.

32:23.642 --> 32:25.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

32:25.677 --> 32:30.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
This is a man who plays coy with
white supremacists

32:30.081 --> 32:37.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and mocks people with
disabilities, who talks
about banning an entire religion
from entering

32:37.722 --> 32:45.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our country, who advocates
getting rid of
gun-free zones in school,
letting more countries

32:45.797 --> 32:54.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have nuclear weapons, defaulting
on our national
debt, turning back the clock on
marriage equality.

32:55.006 --> 32:58.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And just like Elizabeth, I could
go on and
on.

32:58.243 --> 33:02.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Go on and on, but
she didn't have
to, because before they etch got
on stage

33:02.347 --> 33:07.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at about 6:00 this morning,
Donald Trump tweeted
this: "Crooked Hillary is
wheeling out one

33:07.185 --> 33:12.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the least productive senators
in the U.S.
Senate, goofy Elizabeth Warren,
who lied on

33:12.224 --> 33:13.358 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
heritage."

33:13.391 --> 33:14.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where to begin, Tam? OK.

33:14.759 --> 33:16.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Yes.

33:16.728 --> 33:18.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Just go.

33:18.496 --> 33:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Well,
and then Donald Trump, after the
speech was

33:21.700 --> 33:28.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over, called a correspondent for
NBC News
and doubled down on the
Elizabeth Warren lied

33:28.340 --> 33:34.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about her heritage thing and
said that, absolutely,
he should call her Pocahontas.

33:34.279 --> 33:39.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is an issue that dates back
to the 2012
Senate race that Elizabeth
Warren ultimately

33:39.517 --> 33:45.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
won. And one of the issues was,
at some point,
did she check a box that said
she was Native

33:45.423 --> 33:47.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
American, and did that help her
get preference
in hiring?

33:47.959 --> 33:55.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, then the Republican Party
held a call
to respond to the Clinton-Warren
speech. And

33:55.600 --> 34:00.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scott Brown, Senator Scott
Brown, former Senator
Scott Brown, who had run against
Elizabeth

34:00.138 --> 34:02.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Warren in 2012, was on the call.

34:02.374 --> 34:07.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was asked, hey, does it make
sense that
your candidate is going after a
surrogate

34:07.345 --> 34:12.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and not the person he's running
against? And
Scott Brown's response was,
well, maybe Elizabeth

34:13.018 --> 34:16.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Warren could get a DNA test and
solve this
for everybody. He said that with
a little

34:16.922 --> 34:23.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bit of a chuckle, but the point
is that, very
quickly, they were not talking
about Hillary

34:23.728 --> 34:25.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton. They were talking about
Elizabeth
Warren.

34:25.730 --> 34:28.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, this is my
question. It
seems that there are many things
they could

34:28.967 --> 34:30.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be talking about.

34:30.802 --> 34:33.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They could be talking about
Brexit. They could
be talking about trade. Instead,
everybody

34:33.471 --> 34:35.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seems to be trying to get under
everybody
else's skin.

34:35.974 --> 34:37.409 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Right. Exactly.

34:37.442 --> 34:38.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is the "I know you are
but what am
I?" election, which is...

34:38.877 --> 34:41.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Is that a strategy?

34:41.346 --> 34:48.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: The actual speech
today with Hillary
Clinton and Elizabeth Warren,
you picked out

34:48.553 --> 34:51.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the parts where they definitely
were digging
at Donald Trump.

34:51.289 --> 34:56.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there was also a broader
economic message
in there, right? And you could
see it in the

34:56.094 --> 34:59.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
display they had on the front of
the podium
that said, we're better
together.

34:59.431 --> 35:00.298 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

35:00.332 --> 35:01.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: It's stronger
together.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And just the point
about we're
going to be bringing...

35:04.970 --> 35:05.904 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

35:05.937 --> 35:07.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes, we know what
this means.

35:07.772 --> 35:10.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, but we're be bringing
people along based
on X, Y, Z policies, and Hillary
Clinton went

35:10.141 --> 35:14.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through her policy positions.
But, of course,
that's not particularly
interesting. What's

35:14.446 --> 35:21.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much more interesting and buzzy
is the debate
over this "I know you are but
what am I?"

35:21.653 --> 35:23.254 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
piece.

35:23.288 --> 35:26.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In part because they
seem to be
successful in getting him to
respond.

35:26.825 --> 35:32.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw just a few days ago a
huge kind of
global upheaval, and we saw the
way that Donald

35:32.931 --> 35:37.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump responded to it. We saw
the kind of
careful way Hillary Clinton
responded to it.

35:37.302 --> 35:42.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How did Hillary Clinton's
response and how
did Donald Trump's response fit
into a larger

35:42.273 --> 35:45.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strategy that may or may not be
working for
either of them?

35:45.477 --> 35:48.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, they're
playing the part,
that's for sure.

35:48.179 --> 35:53.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump was at his golf
course in Scotland,
grand opening of the golf course
that his

35:53.518 --> 35:59.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
son had worked on. He was there
to promote
the golf course. Along one of
the holes, he

35:59.691 --> 36:07.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talked about Brexit and said,
hey, the pound
falling may be bad for people,
but it could

36:07.732 --> 36:10.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be good. People might come to my
golf course.

36:10.535 --> 36:16.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is completely in line with
what Donald
Trump has said about various
things. He is

36:16.141 --> 36:20.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doing what he did in the primary
that was
wildly successful for him. He's
not running

36:20.712 --> 36:26.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ads on television in key swing
states. Hillary
Clinton is. He thinks he has a
strategy that's

36:26.351 --> 36:28.186 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going to work.

36:28.219 --> 36:34.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton and her campaign
are now running
ads, on cable at least,
attacking Donald Trump

36:34.059 --> 36:39.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on his reaction to Brexit. And,
you know,
she responds with sort of the
wonky world

36:39.130 --> 36:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leader kind of thing. They're
doing themselves.

36:41.299 --> 36:43.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: They're playing to
type.

36:43.101 --> 36:45.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, and they're
also playing
to what the major theme in this
campaign is,

36:45.703 --> 36:48.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right, and what it was in
Britain, which is,
do you want to stay the course,
stick with

36:48.840 --> 36:53.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the status quo, even though it
has not brought
the success that you hoped it
would, or do

36:53.745 --> 36:57.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you make a change, even though
it's a very
unpredictable change?

36:57.649 --> 37:00.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the thing that we're seeing
in this country
-- you have to be very careful
about making

37:00.185 --> 37:05.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parallels. It's obviously two
different countries,
et cetera, et cetera. But in the
last -- this

37:05.256 --> 37:09.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was in the early June poll in
The Wall Street
Journal. They asked the
question, I think

37:09.828 --> 37:14.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
correctly, which is -- of voters
-- would
you like to see change even if
it's unpredictable

37:14.732 --> 37:18.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or sort of a more steady, stay
the course,
even though it's not going to
bring much change?

37:18.603 --> 37:23.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A majority of voters, 53
percent, say they
want to see change. And that is
what Donald

37:23.274 --> 37:27.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump is hoping he is going to
be able to
project forward, which, again,
yes, there

37:27.545 --> 37:31.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is some danger in making a
change, but aren't
things the way they are now so
terrible that

37:31.683 --> 37:33.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you're willing to try something
different?

37:33.785 --> 37:37.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I read today that
some -- that
when asked about whether it
bothered them

37:37.355 --> 37:41.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Donald Trump didn't appear
to know what
Brexit was a week or so ago,
folks said that's

37:42.026 --> 37:46.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OK because they didn't know
either. They didn't
know at the time either.

37:46.164 --> 37:50.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are other polls we're
kind of following.
So, let's throw them all into a
pot. We have

37:50.535 --> 37:56.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Washington Post/ABC poll that
shows Hillary
Clinton ahead by double digits.
We have another

37:56.040 --> 38:01.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one that shows -- a Wall Street
Journal/NBC
News poll that shows her ahead
by five.

38:01.146 --> 38:04.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I wonder, as we begin to add
them all
up together, whether they mean
anything at

38:04.983 --> 38:06.718 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this stage.

38:06.751 --> 38:11.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, we can
average them and
say Hillary Clinton is ahead at
this point,

38:11.122 --> 38:15.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at this moment in time, in the
snapshot, but
then we also get these swing
state polls that

38:15.226 --> 38:17.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
show it much tighter in those
swing states.

38:17.061 --> 38:18.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Which he cites, by
the way, when
he's behind.

38:18.897 --> 38:22.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Which, of course,
he does cite.
And he has concerns about the
methodology

38:22.667 --> 38:29.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in some of the polls, which he
liked those
polls earlier. But whatever the
case may be,

38:29.040 --> 38:33.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these are polls. The broad trend
is that he
is not ahead.

38:33.311 --> 38:36.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And I'm going to
wait. I think
they are important, and I think
that trend

38:36.347 --> 38:38.116 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is correct.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think after the convention is
going to be
an important time to clue in.
And we know,

38:40.451 --> 38:45.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
historically, once the
conventions are over,
we start to hit that August,
September, and

38:45.423 --> 38:49.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when the numbers start to lock
in then, they're
harder to change, unless there
is some big,

38:49.194 --> 38:50.929 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
major event.

38:50.962 --> 38:53.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think we may still see some
volatility
going on. The other thing that I
thought was

38:53.164 --> 38:57.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really interesting, especially
in the NBC
poll that came out today, for
all the talk

38:57.035 --> 39:02.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the collapse for Donald
Trump, how he's
losing, what I found, the
congressional ballot

39:02.874 --> 39:08.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
test, which asks, would you vote
for a Democrat
or a Republican in the House of
Representatives,

39:08.413 --> 39:10.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that's evenly divided?

39:10.181 --> 39:14.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In other words, what's happening
is, there
is not that downward pull, not
yet at least

39:14.252 --> 39:19.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- it may happen -- of Donald
Trump on candidates
underneath him. So Senate and
House members

39:19.457 --> 39:23.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are Republicans who are very
fearful right
now of a Donald Trump effect,
it's not showing

39:23.561 --> 39:24.762 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

39:24.796 --> 39:26.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: One more question
about this Brexit
issue.

39:26.731 --> 39:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have noticed at the end of
Hillary Clinton's
speech today, she said let's
take our country,

39:28.499 --> 39:32.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I thought, where's she
going? And she
said in the right direction,
which is not

39:32.637 --> 39:34.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back again or whatever it is
that Trump says.

39:34.806 --> 39:40.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do wonder whether a Brexit
vote gets
people's attention enough or
whether we really

39:40.278 --> 39:43.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't make these kinds of
judgments based
on issues that happen abroad.

39:43.881 --> 39:48.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: I would argue that
people are
not really closely following
what's happening

39:48.519 --> 39:54.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
abroad. But I think that the
broad themes
of the Brexit vote are something
that should

39:54.359 --> 39:56.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
give Hillary Clinton and her
campaign great
pause.

39:56.194 --> 39:59.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, I agree with
that, but there
has been an immediate effect.

39:59.230 --> 40:03.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is, if you have a
401(k) or if you
have any -- at all in the stock
market, that

40:03.635 --> 40:09.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was an immediate impact. And
does it continue?
It's one thing if it was one bad
day and it

40:09.607 --> 40:14.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comes back. If it doesn't come
back, then
we're going to start to have a
real discussion

40:14.779 --> 40:17.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about how Brexit impacted all of
us.

40:17.181 --> 40:18.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Oh, boy.

40:18.449 --> 40:20.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, it's one more thing to add
to the loop.
That's great.

40:20.852 --> 40:24.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Amy Walter, Tamara Keith, thank
you both very
much.

40:24.889 --> 40:33.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

40:33.131 --> 40:40.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now to one of
summer's great pleasures,
tackling that book you have been
meaning to

40:40.872 --> 40:42.807 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
get to.

40:42.840 --> 40:46.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we begin a week's worth
of suggestions,
beginning with one of the most
eagerly anticipated

40:46.778 --> 40:50.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
debut novels of the year. In the
first of
a three-book deal with Random
House author

40:50.982 --> 40:56.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Emma Cline writes "The Girls,"
the story of
a charismatic Charles
Manson-like figure,

40:56.254 --> 40:58.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the young women who were
under his control.

40:58.990 --> 41:03.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown spoke with Cline
at the recent
BookExpo America in Chicago.

41:03.661 --> 41:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Tell us first --
tell me first,
where did the idea come from?
Was it something

41:08.666 --> 41:10.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
always in your head?

41:10.368 --> 41:12.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA CLINE, Author, "The Girls":
I'm from
Northern California, where the
book is set.

41:12.470 --> 41:16.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I sort of grew up hearing
all about the
California mythology, sort of
all the Manson

41:16.841 --> 41:23.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stories, the communes and cults
that are very
endemic to that state. And so I
really wanted

41:23.348 --> 41:28.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some way to engage with it in a
new way that
wasn't like the stories I had
heard, which

41:28.486 --> 41:32.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
focused on the men. I was always
more curious
about the women involved.

41:32.156 --> 41:34.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There is a lot in
just what
you said.

41:34.225 --> 41:35.593 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:35.626 --> 41:37.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, let me go
back first. The
California mythology.

41:37.595 --> 41:38.930 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
EMMA CLINE: Yes.

41:38.963 --> 41:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You're young,
but, for you,
these were myths.

41:42.734 --> 41:44.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EMMA CLINE: Right.

41:44.469 --> 41:50.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Both of my parents are
Californians. They
were the same age as my main
character in

41:50.108 --> 41:55.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the '60s. Both lived in
California. So I think,
for them, these events were
really cultural

41:55.480 --> 41:57.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
touchstones. So, growing up, I
heard a lot
about them.

41:57.949 --> 42:01.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, how much
did you know?
In detail or just sort of out
there?

42:01.919 --> 42:06.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EMMA CLINE: First just
generally, and then
in detail. I think everyone that
I know, anyway,

42:06.958 --> 42:10.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of had that experience of
reading "Helter
Skelter" as like a teenager.

42:10.795 --> 42:12.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The Manson story.

42:12.597 --> 42:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA CLINE: Yes, and sort of
feeling that
it was a sordid, exciting thing
that you were

42:15.433 --> 42:16.401 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
just drawn to.

42:16.434 --> 42:17.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

42:17.802 --> 42:20.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EMMA CLINE: So, maybe when I was
a teenager,
I got more into it.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And when did you
actually start
writing it?

42:22.440 --> 42:28.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA CLINE: I started writing it
maybe four
years ago now, but I was always
sort of circling

42:28.146 --> 42:33.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around the same ideas, always
interested in
communes and sort of extreme
living situations

42:33.985 --> 42:35.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and extreme moments.

42:35.219 --> 42:36.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Why?

42:36.988 --> 42:40.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA CLINE: I think it's what I
like most
reading about in fiction, sort
of the edge

42:41.025 --> 42:45.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of human experience, and I think
communes
sort of bring out the best and
worst in people.

42:45.463 --> 42:50.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So what kind of
research did
you do then? Did you go live on
one?

42:50.334 --> 42:50.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EMMA CLINE: Sort of.

42:50.868 --> 42:52.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

42:52.403 --> 42:57.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
EMMA CLINE: I lived in a
collective in college.
It was very mild. Very nice.

42:57.208 --> 43:01.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, no, I mean, I did research
before I even
knew it was research, just
because it was

43:01.612 --> 43:06.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something I -- I was always
interested in
that era and sort of memoirs
from that time.

43:06.984 --> 43:12.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is so much of the '60s
still left
over in California. We never
quite recovered

43:12.657 --> 43:15.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from the '60s, so it's lots of
leftovers.

43:15.593 --> 43:18.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: When you start
writing, do
you set all the research aside,
or do you

43:18.896 --> 43:20.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
keep it sitting there to use
details?

43:20.731 --> 43:25.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA CLINE: Yes, definitely,
it's like taking
in so much information and then
trying -- just

43:25.102 --> 43:28.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forgetting about that and trying
to get at
some tone that feels truthful.

43:28.739 --> 43:32.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not so much interested in
factual truth.
This is not a Manson novel.

43:32.877 --> 43:34.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

43:34.679 --> 43:37.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA CLINE: It's sort of taking
a germ from
the Manson -- and then really
transposing

43:37.548 --> 43:39.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that into something else.

43:39.383 --> 43:45.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I hope this story is --
stands on its
own enough that it's not seen as
Manson novel,

43:45.523 --> 43:51.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because, to me, it's really the
cult and the
crime at the center, it's not
what the novel's

43:51.696 --> 43:53.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about. To me, it's more about
relationships.

43:53.431 --> 43:57.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right, and it's
about the girls,
the name, right, which is what
you...

43:57.735 --> 43:59.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EMMA CLINE: Right.

43:59.070 --> 43:59.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I want to come
back to what
you said earlier.

43:59.704 --> 44:01.539 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
EMMA CLINE: Yes.

44:01.572 --> 44:05.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That you were not
so interested
in the ways these stories are
normally told,

44:05.142 --> 44:09.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is through like the madman
or the charismatic
man.

44:09.347 --> 44:11.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EMMA CLINE: Right. Right. Yes.
Exactly, which
is such a familiar story.

44:11.282 --> 44:16.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, oh, he's a charismatic
sociopath, so
like everyone is drawn to him.
And to me,

44:16.354 --> 44:20.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Charles Manson and people like
him are actually
pretty one-note, especially as
characters

44:21.025 --> 44:24.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a novel. They're sort of
everyday psychopaths.

44:24.795 --> 44:30.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm not -- there is no
ambiguity there
for me. But the women, many of
whom were homecoming

44:30.768 --> 44:35.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
queens and straight-A students,
who end up
following someone like that, to
me, that's

44:35.373 --> 44:37.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
where the story was.

44:37.208 --> 44:42.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Because that goes
to your -- what
you were saying about kind of
the good and

44:42.280 --> 44:47.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bad, or the extremes, that
somehow people
get thrown into it in a way they
never would

44:47.351 --> 44:48.019 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have expected.

44:48.052 --> 44:49.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMMA CLINE: Right. Right. Yes.

44:49.820 --> 44:54.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I was thinking about it
recently, because
I had read a story about the
sort of teenage

44:54.258 --> 44:56.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
girls in Europe who run away and
join ISIS.

44:56.427 --> 44:58.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

44:58.229 --> 45:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA CLINE: And it's something
that's still
-- it's still happening in these
other ways.

45:02.300 --> 45:08.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's this strange combination of
innocence,
you know, teenage girls, and
then this extremely,

45:08.539 --> 45:13.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like, horrifying realm that you
can't understand
what the draw is. And I wanted
to sort of

45:13.911 --> 45:20.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really get down to a granular
psychological
level of what is drawing girls
to this sort

45:20.751 --> 45:22.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of dangerous group.

45:22.486 --> 45:27.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So then how did
you create
these characters? I mean, given
that, you

45:27.124 --> 45:30.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were trying to give them sort of
a normal
upbringing, right? Yes.

45:30.461 --> 45:32.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EMMA CLINE: Right.

45:32.296 --> 45:37.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's sort of trying to figure
out what could
be the milieu that someone is
coming from

45:37.902 --> 45:42.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where this other group starts to
seem magnetic?
And that's like maybe there is
trouble at

45:42.940 --> 45:49.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
home or -- and I think all
teenagers have
that desire to be seen and
known. And if you

45:49.246 --> 45:55.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feel like you aren't being seen,
and then
there is someone who does see
you or feels

45:55.052 --> 45:58.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- you know, you feel yourself
reflected back,
I think that's...

45:58.456 --> 46:00.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. Yes. Yes.

46:00.424 --> 46:04.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, because this is your first
novel, I mean,
you are clearly -- you were
clearly learning

46:04.595 --> 46:06.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as you wrote it, right? Is that
fair to say?

46:06.430 --> 46:08.165 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
EMMA CLINE: Yes.

46:08.199 --> 46:11.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, what was the
-- I think
people would be interested in
what was the

46:11.268 --> 46:15.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hardest part of -- was it
plotting, was it
character? Was it -- what was
it?

46:15.106 --> 46:19.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA CLINE: I mean, the whole
thing was a
struggle, and only, like, in the
last week

46:19.910 --> 46:25.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was I, like, oh, this is a book.
but up until
that last week, I was, like,
this is a mess.

46:25.349 --> 46:29.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Really? You had a
moment where
you said, finally, this is a
book?

46:29.320 --> 46:31.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EMMA CLINE: Yes, there was a
moment when it
felt like a book to me.

46:31.656 --> 46:33.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And what did that
mean?

46:33.457 --> 46:37.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA CLINE: I don't know. I
could see it.
Sort of it, it had a
completeness, whereas

46:37.161 --> 46:40.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
before it was sort of, you know,
loose.

46:40.297 --> 46:43.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, finally,
what's next?
Are you working on...

46:43.567 --> 46:47.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA CLINE: I'm working on a
novel. I'm still
in the early days of it, but I'm
very happy

46:48.005 --> 46:49.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be on to something new.

46:49.240 --> 46:50.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: You are?

46:50.274 --> 46:51.475 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
EMMA CLINE: Yes.

46:51.509 --> 46:53.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Is it coming
easier this time
or is any...

46:53.277 --> 46:53.744 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
EMMA CLINE: No.

46:53.778 --> 46:55.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: No.

46:55.613 --> 46:56.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA CLINE: That's what I
thought. I thought,
if you it did once, then you
sort of knew

46:56.447 --> 46:57.281 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
how to do it.

46:57.314 --> 46:59.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now I know how to
do it.

46:59.216 --> 47:02.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA CLINE: But I feel like,
every new book,
you know, you're struggling
anew, which -- yes.

47:02.053 --> 47:03.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, well,
happy struggle.

47:03.454 --> 47:04.288 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:04.321 --> 47:04.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The book is "The
Girls."

47:05.022 --> 47:06.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Emma Cline, thank you so much.

47:06.924 --> 47:08.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EMMA CLINE: Thank you.

47:08.759 --> 47:13.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You can watch many
more of Jeff's
author interviews from BookExpo
America and

47:14.031 --> 47:23.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other book festivals. You will
find those
at the Web site,
PBS.org/book-view-now.

47:23.808 --> 47:34.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Finally tonight, our
"NewsHour"
Shares, something that caught
our eye that

47:34.318 --> 47:36.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
might be of interest to you,
too.

47:36.353 --> 47:41.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2012, a "NewsHour" colleague
suggested
historian Michael Beschloss
create a Twitter

47:41.726 --> 47:46.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
profile to share what interested
him most.
Since then, Beschloss has
provided a unique

47:46.664 --> 47:53.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
perspective on American history
often through
photos to his more than 140,000
followers.

47:53.237 --> 47:55.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He spoke with us recently about
some of favorite
posts.

47:55.406 --> 47:59.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS, Presidential
Historian:
I do a lot of historical
photographs, but

47:59.643 --> 48:05.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a relevance to today, try
to find things
people have not seen before, but
also things

48:05.916 --> 48:11.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that remind us that there is a
history to
some of the events in people
we're seeing

48:11.255 --> 48:13.090 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

48:13.124 --> 48:17.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is John Kennedy, 1954, with
wife, Jackie,
sister-in-law Ethel taking an
early version

48:17.261 --> 48:20.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of what we now call selfies, in
this case
in a mirror.

48:20.564 --> 48:26.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Louis Armstrong in 1961 was
playing in Egypt,
and a photographer got the
wonderful idea

48:26.504 --> 48:30.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of talking him and his wife to
the Pyramids
and the Sphinx.

48:30.374 --> 48:34.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is really eerie. These are
the contents
of Abraham Lincoln's pockets on
the night

48:34.979 --> 48:39.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he was murdered. The most
amazing thing
here is that among the things
that Lincoln

48:39.116 --> 48:45.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was holding the night he died
was a $5 Confederate
bill, and sort of amazing when
you think about

48:45.990 --> 48:52.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fact that nowadays the
United States $5
bill has a picture of Abraham
Lincoln.

Babe Ruth was knocked out
unconscious during
a game in 1924, was out for
about five minutes,

49:15.686 --> 49:20.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and this was a very different
time. He went
back into the game and played.
It was a doubleheader.

49:20.057 --> 49:23.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He played another game that day.
Wouldn't
happen today.

This is a report card that John
Lennon got
when he was 16 years old, and
what his principal

49:29.600 --> 49:36.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said of him was, "He has too
many of the wrong
ambitions and his energy is
often misplaced."

Marilyn Monroe went to Korea in
1954 to perform
for troops. She had a Pentagon
I.D., which

49:42.479 --> 49:46.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shows her married name at the
time, which
was Norma Jean DiMaggio.

1865, New York, Abraham
Lincoln's funeral
parade through the city of New
York, and up

49:52.923 --> 49:59.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the window, upper left in
that circle,
is a 6-year-old Theodore
Roosevelt looking

49:59.196 --> 50:03.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down. For the rest of his life,
he was affected
by this. When he was president,
he said, "I

50:03.801 --> 50:07.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
used to ask myself, what would
Lincoln do?"

50:07.104 --> 50:13.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is Harry Truman in the late
1930s having
a gun pulled on him by Vice
President John

Nance Garner. They thought it
was a joke in
those days. Take a look at this
image nowadays.

50:18.449 --> 50:22.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A vice president doing this
these days wouldn't
be so funny.

50:22.987 --> 50:28.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I began doing this, I
thought I would
be on Twitter for about a week,
because I

50:28.759 --> 50:31.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thought there would be about
three people
who would be interested in
looking at old

50:31.128 --> 50:35.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pictures. And the amazing thing
was that,
within a week, the number of
followers really

50:35.099 --> 50:36.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
went up very steeply.

50:36.867 --> 50:41.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And since then, I have found
that there are
a lot more people interested in
history in

50:41.705 --> 50:46.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
America in general and
particularly our visual
history than I realized.

On the "NewsHour" online right
now: A national
study by the Pew Research Center
suggests

50:58.355 --> 51:04.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that our perceptions of progress
toward racial
equality remain splintered. Four
out of 10

51:04.228 --> 51:08.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
African-Americans said they
doubt the nation
will ever achieve racial
equality, while as

51:08.399 --> 51:13.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many white Americans believe
racial equality
has been achieved. A deeper look
at that data
