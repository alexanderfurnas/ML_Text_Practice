00:55.033 --> 00:55.567
ADVANCE IN IRAQ BY ISLAMIC

00:59.000 --> 01:02.933
DURING THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS

01:02.933 --> 01:06.467
THE MILL ASSISTANTS, ISIS, HAV

01:06.467 --> 01:07.600
OVERRUN IRAQI GOVERNMENT FORCE

01:07.600 --> 01:09.233
AND CAPTURED MILITARY EQUIPMEN

01:09.233 --> 01:10.100
DURING THEIR OFFENSIVE

01:10.100 --> 01:11.167
TODAY, IRAQ MILITARY OFFICIALS

01:11.167 --> 01:12.767
SAID THAT THE OFFENSIVE BY SUNNI

01:12.767 --> 01:14.367
MUSLIM JIHADISTS HAD SLOWED AN

THAT THEY ARE TAKING SOME OF THE

TERRITORY BACK WITH THE HELP O

01:17.567 --> 01:21.067
VOLUNTARY SHI'ITE MILITIAS

01:24.700 --> 01:25.633
OFFICIAL INSISTED THE CAPITAL IS

01:25.633 --> 01:26.167
COMPLETELY SAFE.

01:26.167 --> 01:28.000
IRANIAN PRESIDENT HASSAN ROUHANI

01:28.000 --> 01:29.067
SAID SATURDAY THAT IRAN WOULD BE

01:29.067 --> 01:31.167
PREPARED TO HELP THE IRAQI

01:31.167 --> 01:32.767
GOVERNMENT IF ASKED, BUT IT HA

01:32.767 --> 01:37.100
NOT RECEIVED ANY REQUESTS.

01:37.100 --> 01:38.767
WHAT ARE AMERICA'S MILITAR

01:38.767 --> 01:38.900
OPTIONS?

01:38.900 --> 01:41.067
FOR MORE ABOUT THAT, WE'RE

01:41.067 --> 01:43.167
JOINED BY JANINE DAVIDSON, A

01:43.167 --> 01:44.267
SENIOR FELLOW AT THE COUNCIL O

01:44.267 --> 01:45.000
FOREIGN RELATIONS.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.900
SO THE PRESIDENT HAS SAI

01:46.900 --> 01:47.400
REPEATEDLY, NO BOOTS ON TH

01:47.400 --> 01:47.867
GROUND

01:47.867 --> 01:48.400
HERE WE HAVE AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER

01:48.400 --> 01:48.933
OFF THE COAST.

01:48.933 --> 01:50.000
DOES THAT MEAN DRONES AR

01:50.000 --> 01:51.067
LIKELY, OR AIRCRAFT LAUNCHED

01:51.067 --> 01:52.133
FROM THESE CARRIERS?

01:52.133 --> 01:55.900
>> IT MEANS OPTIONS.

01:55.900 --> 01:58.067
AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER CAN DO A

01:58.067 --> 02:00.533
ARRAY OF THINGS FROM

02:00.533 --> 02:01.167
INTELLIGENCE TO AIR STRIKES.

02:01.167 --> 02:02.767
>> IN THESE SORT OF DENSEL

02:02.767 --> 02:06.100
POPULATED AREAS, ARE WE LIKELY

02:06.100 --> 02:08.033
TO INCUR GREATER CIVILIA

02:08.033 --> 02:09.500
CASUALTIES IF WE DON'T HAV

02:09.500 --> 02:10.667
PEOPLE ON THE GROUND

02:10.667 --> 02:13.933
>> THAT IS THE GREATEST RISK O

02:13.933 --> 02:15.233
AIR STRIKES AND WHY SOME PEOPL

02:15.233 --> 02:15.800
THINK THEY'RE NOT A VIABLE

02:15.800 --> 02:16.000
OPTION

02:16.000 --> 02:17.233
YOU NEED PEOPLE ON THE GROUN

02:17.233 --> 02:18.300
CALLING IN WHERE THOSE THING

02:18.300 --> 02:18.833
ARE GOING TO HAPPEN, ESPECIALL

02:18.833 --> 02:21.500
IN AN URBAN ENVIRONMENT.

02:21.500 --> 02:23.600
NOW, IF THERE ARE AREAS WHER

02:23.600 --> 02:25.733
THE ENEMY IS IN AN OPEN SPAC

02:25.733 --> 02:26.800
AND YOU CAN CONFIRM, THEN IT MAY

02:26.800 --> 02:29.433
BE MORE VIABLE

02:29.433 --> 02:31.033
>> SO IN THESE OPEN SPACES, IF

02:31.033 --> 02:35.733
I'M MARCHING DOWN THAT MAJOR

02:35.733 --> 02:38.833
HIGHWAY TOWARDS BAGHDAD, DOE

02:38.833 --> 02:40.367
THAT MAKE THEM MORE VISIBLE TO

02:40.367 --> 02:41.133
THESE DRONES

02:41.133 --> 02:44.133
>> SURE, IF I WAS A MILITARY

02:44.133 --> 02:47.300
PLANNER FOR ISIS, I WOULD THIN

02:47.300 --> 02:49.400
THAT'S A RISKY WAY TO GO, BUT IT

02:49.400 --> 02:50.033
MAY BE THEIR ONLY OPTION

02:50.033 --> 02:50.567
>> SO WHAT ARE THE DIREC

02:50.567 --> 02:51.100
MILITARY OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE?

02:51.100 --> 02:52.167
>> THE BEST OPTION OF ALL BA

02:52.167 --> 02:52.700
OPTIONS, IS REALLY TO BE

02:52.700 --> 02:53.767
ASSISTING TO GET THE IRAQI ARM

02:53.767 --> 02:54.833
AND IRAQI SECURITY FORCES IN A

02:54.833 --> 02:55.900
PLACE WHERE THEY CAN REGROUP AND

02:55.900 --> 02:56.933
RESIST THIS.

02:56.933 --> 02:58.533
AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT, YOU

02:58.533 --> 03:00.200
HAVE GOT TO PUT PRESSURE O

03:00.200 --> 03:01.267
MALACHI.

03:01.267 --> 03:04.700
OTHERWISE THE UNDERLYING

03:04.700 --> 03:06.633
PROBLEMS ARE NOT GOING TO GO

03:06.633 --> 03:06.767
AWAY

03:06.767 --> 03:08.533
IN FACT, I THINK THE PRESIDENT

03:08.533 --> 03:10.267
IS RIGHT TO SAY, UNLESS HE HAS A

03:10.267 --> 03:12.400
PLAN TO REFORM HIS POLITICAL

03:12.400 --> 03:13.300
WAYS, IT IS FOLLY FOR US TO AD

03:13.300 --> 03:13.833
FUEL TO THE FIRE

03:13.833 --> 03:15.500
>> THERE WILL BE HUNDREDS OF

03:15.500 --> 03:16.033
THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS SAYING,

03:16.033 --> 03:17.100
WE TRIED TO GET THE IRAQ

03:17.100 --> 03:17.633
MILITARY TO STAND UP, BUT WHEN

03:17.633 --> 03:19.200
THEY WERE FACED WITH A FIGHT

03:19.200 --> 03:20.267
LIKE THIS, THEY LAID DOWN THEI

03:20.267 --> 03:21.867
ARMS AND RAN

03:21.867 --> 03:23.467
SO EVEN IF WE TRY TO DO THIS

03:23.467 --> 03:25.067
NOW, WHAT'S TO SAY IT WILL WORK?

03:25.067 --> 03:25.600
>> THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE RIGHT

03:25.600 --> 03:29.167
ABOUT THAT

03:29.167 --> 03:30.667
IF WE TRY TO DO THIS NOW WITHOUT

03:30.667 --> 03:31.733
PRESSURING MALACHI TO MAKE SUR

03:31.733 --> 03:33.300
HE DOESN'T DO THE KINDS OF

03:33.300 --> 03:35.433
THINGS THAT HE DID BEFORE, WHICH

03:35.433 --> 03:37.567
IS TO FIRE THE GOOD LEADERSHIP

03:37.567 --> 03:38.633
THAT WE HELPED LEAD AND TRAI

03:38.633 --> 03:41.800
AND PUT IN PLACE, AND PU

03:41.800 --> 03:44.500
UNTRAINED LEADERS ACROSS THE

03:44.500 --> 03:45.533
SPECTRUM OF THE MILITARY, THAT'S

03:45.533 --> 03:46.067
PART OF -- THAT'S PROBABLY ONE

03:46.067 --> 03:47.133
OF THE MAIN REASONS WHY THE ARMY

03:47.133 --> 03:48.667
FELL APART

03:48.667 --> 03:50.267
THEY HAVE TERRIBLE LEADERSHIP,

03:50.267 --> 03:51.300
AND THEY HAVE NOT SUSTAINED TH

03:51.300 --> 03:51.833
TRAJECTORY THAT WAS SET FO

03:51.833 --> 03:52.400
THEM

03:52.400 --> 03:53.933
AND THAT'S ON MALACHI.

03:53.933 --> 03:58.067
>> DOESN'T SEEM TO BE MANY OTHER

03:58.067 --> 03:59.100
WESTERN COUNTRIES LINING UP TO

03:59.100 --> 04:00.233
VOLUNTEER TO GO BACK IN, EITHE

04:00.233 --> 04:00.767
WITH BOOTS ON THE GROUND, OR ANY

04:00.767 --> 04:04.567
OTHER MILITARY RESOURCES

04:04.567 --> 04:06.300
>> FRANKLY, THE EUROPEANS HAVE A

04:06.300 --> 04:06.667
LOT AT STAKE HERE.

04:06.667 --> 04:09.333
REGARDLESS OF HOW THIS THING

04:09.333 --> 04:11.467
STARTED, GO BACK TO THE INITIA

04:11.467 --> 04:12.500
INVASION, OR ALL THE WAY TO WHAT

04:12.500 --> 04:15.700
MALACHI HAS DONE SINCE

04:15.700 --> 04:19.400
THE FACT IS ISIS HAS MORPHED

04:19.400 --> 04:20.467
INTO A VIRULENT THREAT TO TH

04:20.467 --> 04:21.000
REGION THAT THREATENS TO SPILL

04:21.000 --> 04:24.033
BEYOND THE REGION.

04:24.033 --> 04:27.233
THERE ARE FIGHTERS COMING FROM

04:27.233 --> 04:28.233
EUROPEAN AND AMERICA WIT

04:28.233 --> 04:29.800
WESTERN PASSPORTS TO JOIN THAT

04:29.800 --> 04:30.400
IN SYRIA

04:30.400 --> 04:32.267
WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO GO

04:32.267 --> 04:32.800
AFTER?

04:32.800 --> 04:33.333
ARE THEY GOING TO BRING THAT

04:33.333 --> 04:34.400
FIGHT HOME

04:34.400 --> 04:34.933
SO IT IS IN THE EUROPEANS'

04:34.933 --> 04:35.433
INTEREST TO PAY ATTENTION TO

04:35.433 --> 04:36.500
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

04:36.500 --> 04:37.533
>> SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT

04:37.533 --> 04:38.600
REGIONAL, KIND OF, CONNECTIONS

04:38.600 --> 04:40.733
INVOLVED HERE.

04:40.733 --> 04:42.833
THE SAUDIS, WHO ARE OUR ALLIES

04:42.833 --> 04:43.367
HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING THE SUNNI

04:43.367 --> 04:46.633
REBELS AGAINST SYRIA

04:46.633 --> 04:49.133
THE IRANIANS, WHO ARE NOT OU

04:49.133 --> 04:49.667
ALLIES, COULD BE IN THIS

04:49.667 --> 04:50.067
PARTICULAR CASE.

04:50.067 --> 04:50.967
>> RIGHT

04:50.967 --> 04:52.033
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THI

04:52.033 --> 04:54.700
REGION FROM A WESTER

04:54.700 --> 04:56.300
NATION-STATE PERSPECTIVE, IT

04:56.300 --> 04:59.467
LOOKS REALLY COMPLEX, AND IT IS.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.133
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT WITH A

05:01.133 --> 05:02.733
ETHNIC, RELIGIOUS, TRIBA

05:02.733 --> 05:03.233
PERSPECTIVE, IT STARTS TO MAKE A

05:03.233 --> 05:05.900
LOT MORE SENSE

05:05.900 --> 05:09.600
SO THE BEHAVIOR OF THE IRANIANS,

05:09.600 --> 05:14.200
THEY ARE HELPING HEZBOLLAH AND

05:14.200 --> 05:14.900
ASSAD'S FORCES AGAINST SUNNI

05:14.900 --> 05:17.533
UPRISING IN SYRIA.

05:17.533 --> 05:18.600
TO THEM, THEY'RE GOING TO BE

05:18.600 --> 05:20.700
DOING THE SAME THING IN IRAQ

05:20.700 --> 05:23.333
AGAINST THE SAME GUYS, YOU KNOW,

05:23.333 --> 05:24.400
THE BORDER IS LESS RELEVANT TO

05:24.400 --> 05:24.933
THE FACT THAT THESE GUYS ARE

05:24.933 --> 05:26.533
THEIR ENEMY.

05:26.533 --> 05:27.033
>> JANINE DAVIDSON, FROM THE

05:27.033 --> 05:27.567
COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS

05:27.567 --> 05:28.633
THANKS SO MUCH

INCIDENT, ANTI-RUSSIAN
