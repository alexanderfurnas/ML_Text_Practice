A PRIORITY.

07:04.566 --> 07:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE SAID WHAT HAPPENED UNDER THE

THIS, DEPORTED A LOT OF PEOPLE

07:26.900 --> 07:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO HAD NEVER COMMITTED A CRIME,

07:29.100 --> 07:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOT A LOT OF CRITICISM FOR DOING

07:30.800 --> 07:33.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT AND OVER TIME, THE OBAMA

07:33.000 --> 07:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION ISSUED MEMOS THAT

07:34.966 --> 07:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

07:41.066 --> 07:44.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN 2014, LATE 2014, THAT

07:44.366 --> 07:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY TOOK AFFECT.

07:45.200 --> 07:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

FOR FEAR THAT THEY WILL BE

08:02.233 --> 08:04.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEPORTED IN THE PROCESS?

08:04.300 --> 08:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, AT LEAST TWO CITIES,

BEING REPORTED BY LATINOS.

08:13.266 --> 08:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

08:15.300 --> 08:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

PRIORITY, THAT THERE ARE STILL

08:26.266 --> 08:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTECTIONS IN PLACE FOR THEM

08:28.466 --> 08:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IF THEY'RE LAWBREAKERS OR

08:31.100 --> 08:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE HAD AN ISSUE IN THE PAST,

08:33.233 --> 08:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VICTIMS AND WITNESSES COULD ALSO

08:34.566 --> 08:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE DETAINED.

08:35.366 --> 08:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: SO THERE ARE

08:36.033 --> 08:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TWO STEPS.

08:36.833 --> 08:38.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS THE DETENTION PART AND

08:38.466 --> 08:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DEPORTATION PART.

08:39.233 --> 08:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS EVERYBODY GETTING DETAINED

08:40.600 --> 08:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEING DEPORTED.

08:41.366 --> 08:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE THE COUNTRIES AGREEING TO

08:42.633 --> 08:43.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKE THEM BACK?

08:43.800 --> 08:45.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO ONE REALLY IMPORTANT

08:45.833 --> 08:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DETAIL HERE IS THE DIFFERENCE

08:47.133 --> 08:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETWEEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM AND

08:48.033 --> 08:50.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CRIMINAL SYSTEM, IN THE

08:50.266 --> 08:52.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRIMINAL SYSTEM WE KNOW WHO GETS

08:52.266 --> 08:52.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARRESTED.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN SOMEONE IS ARRESTED, THE

08:54.900 --> 08:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEXT THING YOU SEE IS THEIR NAME

08:56.433 --> 08:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND A LITTLE BACKGROUND ABOUT

08:57.433 --> 08:58.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEM.

08:58.066 --> 08:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM HAS NOT

08:59.566 --> 09:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORKED THAT WAY.

09:00.300 --> 09:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE DON'T KNOW WHO IS GETTING

09:02.233 --> 09:02.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARRESTED.

09:02.866 --> 09:04.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE CAN'T LOOK AT THEIR FILES.

09:04.866 --> 09:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN'T READ THE REPORTS, AND THE

09:06.433 --> 09:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHARGES AGAINST THEM EVEN THOUGH

09:07.633 --> 09:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE CHARGES.

09:08.733 --> 09:10.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE OFTEN HELD IN THE SAME

09:10.566 --> 09:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TYPES OF JAILS AS CRIMINALS.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THEY'RE VERY LITTLE PUBLIC

09:14.400 --> 09:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE

09:15.200 --> 09:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SOME HOSPITALS ARE CHOOSING TO

10:05.400 --> 10:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REDUCE PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES, FOR

10:07.566 --> 10:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXAMPLE.

10:08.100 --> 10:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LOT OF HOSPITALS ARE CUTTING

10:34.833 --> 10:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CUTS IN ALL OF THOSE COMMUNITIES

10:36.800 --> 10:38.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SMALL, RURAL OR URBAN.

10:40.566 --> 10:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK THE PEOPLE IN THOSE

10:41.800 --> 10:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO SEE

10:42.833 --> 10:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THROUGH A REDUCTION IN SOME

10:44.400 --> 10:46.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE MEDICAL SERVICES THAT ARE

10:46.200 --> 10:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AVAILABLE.

10:46.833 --> 10:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: BUT WHY NOW?

10:48.133 --> 10:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THIS

10:50.000 --> 10:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISN'T JUST SORT OF A BUSINESS

10:51.533 --> 10:52.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

CORRECTING FOR ERRORS THAT THEY

10:57.700 --> 10:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIGHT HAVE MADE OR JUST BAD

ACCOUNTING.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> NO, THESE ARE STRUCTURAL

11:01.900 --> 11:03.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FINANCIAL PROBLEMS IN THE

11:03.366 --> 11:03.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEALTH-CARE BUSINESS.

11:03.966 --> 11:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS IS THAT

11:05.966 --> 11:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF

11:07.933 --> 11:09.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICANS EVERY DAY WHO ARE

11:09.366 --> 11:10.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGING INTO MEDICARE.

11:10.866 --> 11:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BABY BOOMER POPULATION IS

11:12.333 --> 11:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGING INTO MEDICARE AT A RATE OF

11:14.300 --> 11:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
10,000 PEOPLE A DAY.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT CAUSES PROBLEMS FOR

11:17.266 --> 11:18.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOSPITALS BECAUSE MEDICARE PAYS

11:18.966 --> 11:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LESS THAN COMMERCIAL INSURANCE

11:20.866 --> 11:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOES FOR MEDICAL SERVICES.

11:23.033 --> 11:24.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WHERE

11:24.566 --> 11:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOSPITALS CAN'T MAKE MONEY ON

11:25.800 --> 11:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR LARGEST POPULATION OF

11:27.633 --> 11:29.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TO GET THINNER AND AS THOSE

11:31.366 --> 11:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARGINS GET THINNER THEY HAVE

11:32.966 --> 11:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LESS LEEWAY TO DEAL WITH SOME OF

11:34.166 --> 11:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE EVER-RISING COSTS.

DOLLARWISE, THEY WOULD MAYBE GET

11:45.500 --> 11:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LESS PREFER RECOMMENDATION
