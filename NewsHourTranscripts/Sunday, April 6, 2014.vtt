CREATED EQUAL.

05:35.967 --> 05:36.967
ACTUALLY, IT IS AN IMPORTANT

05:38.967 --> 05:39.967
THAT DOESN'T TELL THE WHOL

05:39.967 --> 05:40.967
STORY.

05:40.967 --> 05:41.967
THE QUALITY OF JOBS THAT HAV

BEEN CREATED IN THE PAST FIV

05:42.967 --> 05:44.967
YEARS SINCE THE GREAT RECESSIO

NUMBER OF JOBS CREATED EVERY

05:56.967 --> 05:58.967
AND WHAT SORT OF JOBS DID WE

05:58.967 --> 05:59.967
RECOVER?

05:59.967 --> 06:01.033
>> SURE.

06:01.033 --> 06:03.033
WELL, THE BLF ALSO PUT OUT

06:03.033 --> 06:05.033
ANOTHER SET OF ANALYSES THAT

06:05.033 --> 06:09.033
SAID OF THE TOP TEN JOBS, TE

06:09.033 --> 06:11.033
OCCUPATIONS CREATED IN MARCH

06:11.033 --> 06:13.033
NINE OF THEM ACTUALLY HA

06:13.033 --> 06:16.033
AVERAGE WAGES BELOW WHAT THE

06:16.033 --> 06:17.033
ANNUAL AVERAGE IS FO

06:17.033 --> 06:18.033
OCCUPATIONAL JOBS.

06:18.033 --> 06:20.033
ONLY REGISTERED NURSES MADE MORE

06:20.033 --> 06:21.033
THAN THE AVERAGE

06:21.033 --> 06:23.033
THE OTHERS WERE IN LOW-PAY JOB

06:23.033 --> 06:26.033
LIKE CASHIERS OR SECRETARIAL

06:26.033 --> 06:29.033
SERVICES, RANGING FROM ABOUT

06:29.033 --> 06:31.033
$18,000 TO $34,000 ANNUAL, A

06:31.033 --> 06:32.533
YEAR, WHEN THE AVERAGE IS ABOU

06:32.533 --> 06:33.067
$44,000.

06:33.067 --> 06:35.967

PAY JOBS IN OUR BIGGEST SECTOR

06:38.967 --> 06:40.067
THAN WERE LOST IN THE GREA

06:40.067 --> 06:40.567
RECESSION.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.967
>> ARE THESE JOBS OR THESE PAY

06:42.967 --> 06:43.967
GRADES OR PAY SCALES KEEPING U

06:43.967 --> 06:46.967
WITH INFLATION

06:46.967 --> 06:48.967
>> WELL, THEY'RE BASICALLY

06:48.967 --> 06:50.967
TREADING WATER RIGHT NOW

06:50.967 --> 06:52.967
JANET YELLIN IN A RECENT SPEEC

06:52.967 --> 06:55.967
SAID THAT, AT BEST, JOB WAGE

06:55.967 --> 06:57.167
GROWTH HAS GROWN BY 2.25

06:57.167 --> 06:58.100
PERCENTAGE POINTS.

06:58.100 --> 07:01.033
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT LOW-WAGE

07:01.033 --> 07:02.033
WORKERS SPEND THEIR MONEY ON

07:02.033 --> 07:04.033
FOOD AND ENERGY, THAT'S NO

07:04.033 --> 07:05.033
KEEPING UP WITH THE BULK O

07:05.033 --> 07:06.033
THEIR BUDGET

07:06.033 --> 07:08.033
ENERGY PRICES HAVE GONE UP OVE

07:08.033 --> 07:09.033
100% SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION

07:09.033 --> 07:12.033
WE ARE LOOKING AT FOOD PRICE

07:12.033 --> 07:14.033
THAT HAVE GONE UP ON AVERAGE

07:14.033 --> 07:15.033
OVER 47%

07:15.033 --> 07:19.033
SO A 2.25 YEARLY ANNUAL INCREASE

07:19.033 --> 07:20.033
IN WAGES SIMPLY WON'T CUT IT FOR

07:20.033 --> 07:22.033
A LOT OF AMERICANS

07:22.033 --> 07:23.033
>> MOST PEOPLE LOOK AT THE STOCK

07:23.033 --> 07:24.033
MARKET AND THE INCREDIBL

07:24.033 --> 07:25.367
SUCCESS IT'S HAD IN THE LAST FEW

07:25.367 --> 07:25.767
YEARS.

07:25.767 --> 07:28.033
HOW COME THAT'S NOT TRANSLATIN

07:28.033 --> 07:29.033
INTO GOOD PAYING JOBS?

07:29.033 --> 07:31.033
>> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION

07:31.033 --> 07:33.033
IT IS A HARD QUESTION TO ANSWER.

07:33.033 --> 07:34.967
RIGHT NOW COMPANIES ARE SITTIN

07:34.967 --> 07:36.967
ON A LOT OF CASH, SO THE CASH IS

07:36.967 --> 07:38.967
AVAILABLE TO CREATE NEW JOBS

07:38.967 --> 07:40.967
THE QUESTION IS, IT IS THE

07:40.967 --> 07:41.967
INCENTIVE.

07:41.967 --> 07:42.967
ARE COMPANIES STILL FEARING RISK

07:42.967 --> 07:43.967
COMING DOWN THE ROAD

07:43.967 --> 07:45.967
IS IT A LACK OF DEMAND

07:45.967 --> 07:46.967
THIS IS A QUESTION THAT NEEDS TO

07:46.967 --> 07:49.967
BE ANSWERED BECAUSE WE ARE NOT

07:49.967 --> 07:50.967
GETTING THESE GOOD QUALITY JOB

07:50.967 --> 07:52.967
THAT THE MARKET NEEDS.

07:52.967 --> 07:53.900
IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT T

07:53.900 --> 07:55.033
UNDERSTAND THAT THE GOVERNMENT

07:55.033 --> 07:56.967
ISN'T ADDING JOBS.

PRESENCE OF WATER ON ONE O

18:42.333 --> 18:43.200
SATURN'S MOONS

18:43.200 --> 18:45.967
IT ONCE AGAIN STIRRED TALK ABOUT

18:45.967 --> 18:46.967
THE POSSIBILITY OF LIF

18:46.967 --> 18:48.967
ELSEWHERE IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM.

18:48.967 --> 18:50.967
FOR MORE WE ARE JOINED FROM LO

18:50.967 --> 18:51.967
ANGELES BY DAVID STEPHENSON OF

18:51.967 --> 18:53.100
THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE O

18:53.100 --> 18:53.667
TECHNOLOGY

18:53.667 --> 18:55.967
HE CO-AUTHORED THE ARTICLE

18:55.967 --> 18:58.967
SO TELL US ABOUT THIS MOON

18:58.967 --> 19:01.033
YOU KNEW ABOUT IT QUITE A BI

19:01.033 --> 19:03.033
ABOUT IT BEFORE BUT WHAT DID YOU

19:03.033 --> 19:05.033
FIND AND HOW DID YOU FIND IT

19:05.033 --> 19:11.033
>> SO WE KNEW ALREADY THAT

19:11.033 --> 19:12.033
INCELLIDUS HAS GUISERS, WATE

19:12.033 --> 19:14.033
COMING OUT OF CRACKS NEAR TH

19:14.033 --> 19:15.033
SOUTH POLE BUT WE DIDN'T KNO

19:15.033 --> 19:17.033
WHAT WAS BENEATH THE SURFACE

19:17.033 --> 19:22.033
WHAT WE HAVE NOW DONE BY

19:22.033 --> 19:27.033
TRACKING THE CASSINI SPACECRAFT,

19:27.033 --> 19:28.033
AN ORBIT AROUND SATURN, WE

19:28.033 --> 19:30.033
FIGURED OUT THERE MUST BE EXCESS

19:30.033 --> 19:31.633
MASS UNDERNEATH THE ICE AT THE

19:31.633 --> 19:32.367
SOUTH POLE

19:32.367 --> 19:34.967
AND WATER WILL DO THAT BECAUSE

19:34.967 --> 19:35.967
THIS IS AN OCEAN

19:35.967 --> 19:37.967
IT IS ABOUT THE SIZE OF LAKE

19:37.967 --> 19:40.967
SUPERIOR, PERHAPS EVEN LARGER.

19:40.967 --> 19:42.267
AND IT IS ABOUT TEN KILOMETERS

19:42.267 --> 19:42.700
THICK.

19:42.700 --> 19:44.967
SO IT IS A LOT OF WATER.

19:44.967 --> 19:45.967
>> SO WHY IS THIS EXCITING

19:45.967 --> 19:47.967
FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS MAYBE

19:47.967 --> 19:49.967
BASIC SCIENCE QUESTION

19:49.967 --> 19:50.967
IF THIS PLANET IS FURTHER FROM

19:50.967 --> 19:52.967
THE SUN THAN WE ARE AND IT I

19:52.967 --> 19:55.967
INCREDIBLY COLD, A FEW HUNDRED

19:55.967 --> 19:57.967
DEGREES BELOW ZERO, HOW IS I

19:57.967 --> 19:59.967
EVEN POSSIBLE THAT WATER EXIST

19:59.967 --> 20:00.967
THERE?

20:00.967 --> 20:03.967
>> THE WAY WATER IS PRODUCED

20:03.967 --> 20:07.967
THERE IS BY TIDES.

20:07.967 --> 20:10.033
INCELLIDUS IS IN ORBIT AROUN

20:10.033 --> 20:10.733
SATURN

20:10.733 --> 20:14.967
ORBIT IS NOT CIRCULAR SO AS TH

20:14.967 --> 20:16.967
ORBITER GOES AROUND SATURN I

20:16.967 --> 20:17.967
GETS FLEXED, THIS HEATS THE IC

20:17.967 --> 20:21.967
AND ALLOWS IT TO MELT, IN PART

20:21.967 --> 20:25.967
A SIMILAR EFFECT HOPES I

20:25.967 --> 20:27.033
EUROPA, WHICH IS A MOON OF

20:27.033 --> 20:27.500
JUPITER.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.967
>> SO IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THIS TO

20:29.967 --> 20:30.967
MEAN THAT THERE IS LIFE THERE?

20:30.967 --> 20:31.967
WATER WAS ONE OF THOSE THING

20:31.967 --> 20:32.967
THAT WE ALWAYS LOOK FOR TO SEE

20:32.967 --> 20:35.900
IF LIFE CAN EXIST.

20:35.900 --> 20:36.900
RIGHT?

20:36.900 --> 20:37.900
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

20:37.900 --> 20:39.900
ACTUALLY, I THINK WATER IS QUITE

20:39.900 --> 20:40.900
COMMON

20:40.900 --> 20:42.900
LIQUID -- WATER IS PRESENT I

20:42.900 --> 20:45.900
MANY OF THE ICY BODIES IN TH

20:45.900 --> 20:46.900
OUT-OF-SOLAR SYSTEM.

20:46.900 --> 20:48.900
I SUSPECT -- WE DON'T KNOW FOR

20:48.900 --> 20:49.900
SURE

20:49.900 --> 20:50.900
I THINK ONE OF THE INTERESTING

20:50.900 --> 20:54.900
THINGS ABOUT INCELLIDUS AND ALSO

20:54.900 --> 20:56.900
EUROPA IS THAT THAT WATER IS

20:56.900 --> 20:57.900
LIKELY TO BE IN CONTACT WITH

20:57.900 --> 20:59.900
ROCK UNDERNEATH THE OCEAN.

20:59.900 --> 21:01.967
WHEN YOU HAVE WATER AND ROCK AND

21:01.967 --> 21:03.967
ENERGY SOURCES, YOU HAVE

21:03.967 --> 21:04.967
CHEMISTRY.

21:04.967 --> 21:07.967
SO INDEED IT SEEMS TO CREATE A

21:07.967 --> 21:09.967
LOT OF THE CONDITIONS THAT W

21:09.967 --> 21:10.967
THINK ARE SUITABLE FOR LIFE.

21:10.967 --> 21:11.967
>> ALL RIGHT

21:11.967 --> 21:12.967
SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

21:12.967 --> 21:14.967
THE CASSINI SPACECRAFT IS GOIN

21:14.967 --> 21:15.967
TO CONTINUE ON FOR A COUPLE OF

21:15.967 --> 21:16.300
YEARS.

21:16.300 --> 21:17.967
IT WILL DO A COUPLE OF MOR

21:17.967 --> 21:18.967
FLY-BYS OF THIS MOON

21:18.967 --> 21:22.967
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR

21:22.967 --> 21:24.967
>> WELL, CERTAINLY IT WOULD BE

21:24.967 --> 21:26.400
NICE TO GET A LITTLE BIT MOR

21:26.400 --> 21:27.133
INFORMATION.

21:27.133 --> 21:29.967
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET MOR

21:29.967 --> 21:30.967
INFORMATION ABOUT THE GRAVITY,

21:30.967 --> 21:33.967
WHICH IS THE METHOD THAT WE USED

21:33.967 --> 21:34.967
TO REACH THIS RESULT

21:34.967 --> 21:37.967
THE CASSINI MISSION WILL END B

21:37.967 --> 21:39.967
COMING IN VERY CLOSE TO SATURN

21:39.967 --> 21:41.833
GETTING INSIDE THE RINGS O

21:41.833 --> 21:42.533
SATURN

21:42.533 --> 21:43.633
AND THAT WILL BE REALL

21:43.633 --> 21:44.167
EXCITING

21:44.167 --> 21:46.967
IN 2017 WE'LL BE ABLE TO COLLECT

21:46.967 --> 21:50.967
ADDITIONAL DATA ABOUT SATURN

21:50.967 --> 21:56.967
AS FOR ENCELIDUS, WE HAVE TO

21:56.967 --> 21:58.967
TALK ABOUT A MISSION SOME TIME

21:58.967 --> 22:01.033
IN THE FUTURE, A DECADE OR SO,

22:01.033 --> 22:03.033
AS INDEED WE SHOULD FOR EUROPA

22:03.033 --> 22:04.033
