02:08.333 --> 02:10.233
THIS ITALIAN MAN WHO'S VERY MUCH

02:10.233 --> 02:13.633
ALIVE WAS ON THE PASSENGER LIST.

02:13.633 --> 02:18.233
HIS PASSPORT WAS STOLEN IN

LOOKING CLOSELY AT THEIR

02:28.233 --> 02:28.500
BACKGROUNDS.

02:28.500 --> 02:29.800
>> THERE'S A LOT O

02:29.800 --> 02:30.800
POSSIBILITIES HERE

02:30.800 --> 02:32.700
ONE OF THEM IS THAT IT'S PUREL

02:32.700 --> 02:35.000
A CRIMINAL MATTER, THE

02:35.000 --> 02:36.200
PASSPORTS, WHICH IS UNCONNECTE

02:36.200 --> 02:38.367
TO THE DISAPPEARANCE OF TH

02:38.367 --> 02:38.900
AIRCRAFT

02:38.900 --> 02:40.467
THAT IS STILL A POSSIBILITY.

02:40.467 --> 02:41.733
THE OTHER POSSIBILITY IS, IS

02:41.733 --> 02:44.467
THAT IT'S MORE SINISTER THAN

02:44.467 --> 02:44.733
THAT

02:44.733 --> 02:46.133
>> Reporter: THAT UNCERTAINT

02:46.133 --> 02:48.367
MAKES FINDING THE WRECKAGE O

02:48.367 --> 02:50.933
THE PLANE VITAL IN EXPLAININ

02:50.933 --> 02:51.967
WHAT'S HAPPENED.

02:51.967 --> 02:54.067
MORE THAN 70 RESCUE TEAMS AR

02:54.067 --> 02:55.600
NOW INVOLVED IN THAT SEARCH.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.600
FOR THE FAMILY, THE FATE O

02:57.600 --> 03:00.333
THEIR LOVED ONES REMAINS A

03:00.333 --> 03:01.833
INTOLERABLE MYSTERY.

03:01.833 --> 03:05.000
THEY ARE STILL PRAYING FOR GOO

03:05.000 --> 03:07.900
NEWS NO MATTER HOW FAINT THA

03:07.900 --> 03:09.733
HOPE MAY BE.

03:09.733 --> 03:11.700
>> FOR MORE ON WHETHER THE FAT

03:11.700 --> 03:13.767
OF THE AIRLINER WAS AN ACT O

03:13.767 --> 03:17.333
TERRORISM WE'RE JOINED BY

03:17.333 --> 03:18.500
SECURITY EXPERT.

03:18.500 --> 03:20.867
SO MR. RON, WHAT WE DO KNOW, W

03:20.867 --> 03:22.800
HAVE A FEW THINGS CONFIRMED.

03:22.800 --> 03:28.833
WE HAD GOOD WEATHER, EXPERIENCED

03:28.833 --> 03:35.267
PILOTS, SOLID SAFETY RECORDS, NO

03:35.267 --> 03:37.133
DISTRESS SIGNAL AND THE ISSUE OF

03:37.133 --> 03:38.567
THE STOLEN PASSPORTS

03:38.567 --> 03:39.800
>> THERE'S NO QUESTION THA

03:39.800 --> 03:41.800
THERE IS A SECURITY FAILURE BY

03:41.800 --> 03:43.400
THE FACT THAT THE TWO PEOPLE

03:43.400 --> 03:45.900
WERE ALLOWED TO BOARD THE FLIGHT

03:45.900 --> 03:49.633
WITH THE IDENTITIES THAT DO NO

03:49.633 --> 03:49.933
BELONG TO THEM

03:49.933 --> 03:51.600
BUT WHETHER THIS SECURIT

03:51.600 --> 03:53.667
FAILURE IS CONNECTED IN ANY WA

03:53.667 --> 03:56.067
TO THE DESTRUCTION OF TH

03:56.067 --> 03:57.800
AIRCRAFT OR THE DISAPPEARANCE OF

03:57.800 --> 04:01.200
THE AIRCRAFT, IT IS STILL A, YET

04:01.200 --> 04:05.333
TO BE DETERMINED

04:05.333 --> 04:07.300
AT THIS TIME, THERE'S NO DIREC

04:07.300 --> 04:09.500
EVIDENCE TO TIE UP THE TWO

04:09.500 --> 04:09.767
EVENTS

04:09.767 --> 04:11.800
>> WHAT ABOUT THESE STOLEN

04:11.800 --> 04:12.100
PASSPORTS?

04:12.100 --> 04:13.967
HOW OFTEN IS IF THAT PEOPLE AR

04:13.967 --> 04:17.100
ABLE TO GET ON A PLANE WIT

04:17.100 --> 04:18.133
FALSE IDENTITIES

04:18.133 --> 04:21.633
>> WELL, THAT IS SOMETHING THA

04:21.633 --> 04:24.467
THE EXPOSES ONE OF THE

04:24.467 --> 04:25.767
WEAKNESSES IN THE GLOBAL

04:25.767 --> 04:27.800
AVIATION SECURITY SYSTEM

04:27.800 --> 04:30.300
FOR A VERY LONG TIME, WE'VE BEEN

04:30.300 --> 04:33.367
IDENTIFYING PEOPLE BY USE OF

04:33.367 --> 04:35.533
DOCUMENTS RATHER THAN BY ANY

04:35.533 --> 04:39.033
KIND OF BIOMETRIC SIGNATURE.

04:39.033 --> 04:40.933
WHEN WE LOOK AT DOCUMENTS, IT IS

04:40.933 --> 04:43.067
VERY MUCH IN THE EYE OF TH

04:43.067 --> 04:46.433
BEHOLDER OR THE EYE OF THE

04:46.433 --> 04:49.700
CHECKER TO IDENTIFY THE ISSUES

04:49.700 --> 04:50.800
WITH THE PASSPORT.

04:50.800 --> 04:52.933
BEYOND ALL THAT, THERE'S ONE

04:52.933 --> 04:56.800
THING THAT IS AVAILABLE, AND THE

04:56.800 --> 05:00.967
CLUES IN THIS CASE AND IN OTHE

05:00.967 --> 05:02.367
CASES WERE WIDE.

05:02.367 --> 05:04.367
THEY DID NOT RECEIVE ENOUG

05:04.367 --> 05:04.467
ATTENTION.

05:04.467 --> 05:07.967
THAT IS THE FACT THAT THOSE TW

05:07.967 --> 05:10.567
NAMES ON THE STOLEN PASSPORT

05:10.567 --> 05:12.300
APPEARED ON THE LIST THAT WA

05:12.300 --> 05:15.200
SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKED INTO

05:15.200 --> 05:17.567
BEFORE THE PASSENGERS WERE

05:17.567 --> 05:21.567
ALLOWED TO BOARD

05:21.567 --> 05:24.100
AND IF THAT HAD APPEARED,

05:24.100 --> 05:25.967
WOULD HAVE EXPECTED THAT THESE

05:25.967 --> 05:28.100
TWO GUYS OR THESE TWO PEOPLE

05:28.100 --> 05:30.667
WOULD HAVE BEEN PICKED UP AN

05:30.667 --> 05:32.267
NOT ALLOWED ON THE FLIGHT.

05:32.267 --> 05:34.733
>> AS A TRAVELER, I FEEL LIK

05:34.733 --> 05:35.933
THE COST OF ME WAITING IN LINE

05:35.933 --> 05:37.900
AND HAVING ALL THE PASSPORTING

05:37.900 --> 05:39.400
CHECKED IS THAT THE PASSPORTIN

05:39.400 --> 05:42.000
ARE RUNNING THROUGH SOME SORT OF

05:42.000 --> 05:45.967
INTERNATIONAL DATABASE, WHETHE

05:45.967 --> 05:49.100
IT'S INTERPOL OR THE FBI

05:49.100 --> 05:49.967
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN

05:49.967 --> 05:51.667
>> A LOT OF THAT OCCURRING

05:51.667 --> 05:53.167
BEFORE YOU END UP AT THE

05:53.167 --> 05:53.667
AIRPORT.

05:53.667 --> 05:55.967
WHEN YOU STAND UP IN LINE AN

05:55.967 --> 06:01.100
STAND IN FRONT OF THE SECURITY

06:01.100 --> 06:03.067
AGENT, WHO LOOKING AT YOUR I.D.,

06:03.067 --> 06:09.100
WHETHER IT IS A PASSPORT O

06:09.100 --> 06:10.000
DIFFERENT I.D.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.400
AND COMPARE IT IS TO YOU

06:11.400 --> 06:12.600
BOARDING CARD, THIS IS SOMETHING

06:12.600 --> 06:14.100
THAT GOING VERY FAST AND HAS

06:14.100 --> 06:15.900
NOTHING TO DO WITH CHECKIN

06:15.900 --> 06:16.800
NAMES AGAINST THE LIST

06:16.800 --> 06:18.300
THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE

06:18.300 --> 06:18.567
EARLIER.

06:18.567 --> 06:21.133
ONCE YOU BOOK THE FLIGHT, YOUR

06:21.133 --> 06:26.200
NAME SHOULD GO INTO A SYSTEM AND

06:26.200 --> 06:29.567
BE CHECKED AGAINST ONE OF THOS

06:29.567 --> 06:32.200
WATCH LISTS OR WANTED LISTS.

06:32.200 --> 06:33.800
>> SO HOW WILL THEY DETERMINE IF

06:33.800 --> 06:35.600
IT WAS A BOMB?

06:35.600 --> 06:38.333
>> I THINK UNLESS THERE WILL B

06:38.333 --> 06:39.533
VERY SPECIFIC INTELLIGENCE

06:39.533 --> 06:43.367
COMING IN, WE WILL HAVE TO B

06:43.367 --> 06:45.067
PATIENT UNTIL THE AIRCRAFT, OR

06:45.067 --> 06:50.167
THE REMAINS OF THE AIRCRAF

06:50.167 --> 06:57.800
WOULD BE FOUND TO LOGBOOKS

06:57.800 --> 06:59.167
HOPEFULLY WILL BE FOUND AN

06:59.167 --> 07:00.600
CONTAIN INFORMATION AND TH

07:00.600 --> 07:03.633
REMAINS OF THE AIRCRAFT ITSELF

07:03.633 --> 07:05.633
COULD GIVE US GOOD INDICATION AS

07:05.633 --> 07:08.700
TO WHAT HAPPENED TO IT, JUST

07:08.700 --> 07:11.533
LIKE THE CASE IN PREVIOU

07:11.533 --> 07:12.967
INCIDENTS LIKE THE AIR FRANC

07:12.967 --> 07:15.400
FLIGHT THAT DISAPPEARED OVER THE

07:15.400 --> 07:18.567
ATLANTIC A COUPLE YEARS AGO AN

07:18.567 --> 07:22.533
WAY BACK A TWA 800 AFTER TAKIN

07:22.533 --> 07:24.833
OFF FROM KENNEDY AIRPORT

07:24.833 --> 07:28.100
>> SO HOW SOPHISTICATED ARE OU

07:28.100 --> 07:29.633
BOMB DETECTION SYSTEMS TODAY I

07:29.633 --> 07:31.700
THE SENSE THAT THERE'S ALMOST AN

07:31.700 --> 07:32.333
ARMS RACE.

07:32.333 --> 07:34.100
BOMB MAKERS TRY TO FIGURE OU

07:34.100 --> 07:35.967
WAYS TO GET IN THROUGH THE

07:35.967 --> 07:36.200
SYSTEMS.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.033
WE MAKE SYSTEMS STRONGER AND I

07:38.033 --> 07:39.100
KEEPS GOING UP

07:39.100 --> 07:40.833
ARE WE KEEPING UP WITH THE BAD

07:40.833 --> 07:41.333
GUYS

07:41.333 --> 07:44.833
>> WHENEVER THERE'S A DEFENS

07:44.833 --> 07:46.567
SYSTEM, THERE'S ALWAYS LOOPHOLES

07:46.567 --> 07:48.633
OR CRACKS OR ALTERNATIVES THAT

07:48.633 --> 07:50.700
CAN BE USED AS WE HAVE WITNESSED

07:50.700 --> 07:52.667
IN THE CASE OF THE LIQUI

07:52.667 --> 07:54.333
BOMBERS IN LONDON SOME YEARS

07:54.333 --> 07:55.867
AGO.

07:55.867 --> 07:57.533
LATER ON WITH THE UNDERWEA

07:57.533 --> 07:59.833
BOMBER WHO MANAGED TO TAKE HIS

07:59.833 --> 08:01.367
BOMB ON BOARD.

08:01.367 --> 08:04.500
SO I WOULDN'T SAY THAT WE HAVE

08:04.500 --> 08:07.000
COVERED THE, EVERY POSSIBL

08:07.000 --> 08:08.933
ALTERNATIVE.

08:08.933 --> 08:10.433
BUT WE CERTAINLY, THEY HAV

08:10.433 --> 08:12.300
COVERED MOST OF IT

08:12.300 --> 08:17.000
AND THEY'RE WORKING VERY HARD TO

08:17.000 --> 08:19.433
COVER MORE, AND TO KEEP IT

08:19.433 --> 08:22.333
UNKNOWN TO THE BAD GUYS AS T

08:22.333 --> 08:24.600
WHERE THE LOOPHOLES ARE.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.700
>> ALL RIGHT

08:26.700 --> 08:27.500
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.267
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

08:29.267 --> 08:32.533
>>> TURNING NOW TO THE CRISIS IN
