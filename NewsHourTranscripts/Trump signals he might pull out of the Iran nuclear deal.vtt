JUDY WOODRUFF: It has been just
over two years since the Iran
nuclear agreement was signed

00:04.700 --> 00:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
under the Obama administration.

00:06.900 --> 00:11.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But President Trump may very
well be on the way toward
pulling the United States out of

00:12.500 --> 00:13.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the deal.

00:13.300 --> 00:15.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has that.

00:15.333 --> 00:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Candidate Donald
Trump ran against the agreement,
but President Trump has twice

00:18.866 --> 00:23.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
followed the State Department's
advice, and certified that
Iran is complying with it.

00:23.666 --> 00:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But now, in a Wall Street
Journal interview published
today, Mr. Trump indicates he's

00:27.666 --> 00:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
willing to overrule the State
Department when the next
certification is due in October.

00:32.533 --> 00:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: We have given
them the benefit of every doubt.

00:33.933 --> 00:35.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're doing very
detailed studies.

00:35.433 --> 00:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, personally, I have
great respect for my people.

00:37.433 --> 00:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it was up to me,
I would have had them
noncompliant 180 days ago.

00:39.133 --> 00:40.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
QUESTION: Do you expect
them to be declared
noncompliant next time?

00:40.100 --> 00:44.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Personally, I do.

00:46.600 --> 00:50.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: What would it
mean if Mr. Trump said
Iran is not complying?

00:50.933 --> 00:52.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's at stake here?

00:52.100 --> 00:53.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We get two views.

00:53.700 --> 00:55.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
First, Rob Malley is
here in the studio.

00:55.700 --> 01:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As special assistant to
President Obama, he was the lead
senior White House negotiator

01:01.366 --> 01:02.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the agreement.

01:02.866 --> 01:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is now a vice president of
the International Crisis Group.

01:06.133 --> 01:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And joining us from
Toronto is Mark Dubowitz.

01:08.266 --> 01:12.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He is chief executive
of the Foundation for
Defense of Democracies,
a Washington, D.C.-based

01:12.666 --> 01:14.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
think tank.

01:14.200 --> 01:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has been advising the Trump
administration on Iran policy.

01:17.200 --> 01:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Rob, let me start with you.

01:19.300 --> 01:22.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What's your response to
what the president said?

01:22.200 --> 01:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I should point out that, in that
interview, he went on to say
that he thinks Iran is taking

01:28.066 --> 01:30.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
advantage of this country.

01:30.600 --> 01:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said: "They have taken
advantage of a president
named Barack Obama who
didn't know what the

01:33.833 --> 01:35.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hell he was doing."

01:35.833 --> 01:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT MALLEY, Middle East
Program Director, International
Crisis Group: I'll respond to

01:37.100 --> 01:39.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that, but let's get
the facts straight.

01:39.066 --> 01:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have now, since President
Trump has been in office, twice,
they -- the administration

01:44.600 --> 01:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
certified that Iran was
in compliance of the deal.

01:47.633 --> 01:52.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Twice, the administration waived
the sanctions, which is a way
of indicating that it's mutually

01:53.600 --> 01:55.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
reciprocal.

01:55.733 --> 01:58.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the administration's
response to the fact that Iran
is doing its share, we do our

01:58.866 --> 02:01.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
share.

02:01.333 --> 02:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Twice, the agency, the
international agency
that's responsible for
deciding whether -- decides

02:04.433 --> 02:08.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on compliance -- whether Iran is
in compliance with its nuclear
restrictions, the International

02:08.566 --> 02:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Atomic Energy Agency, twice
since Trump has been in office,
it has said that Iran is living

02:14.166 --> 02:16.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up to its deal.

02:16.300 --> 02:19.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, twice, the joint
commission, which is a
commission formed by all
of the member countries

02:19.566 --> 02:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that negotiated the deal,
including the United
States, twice, including
recently, they have

02:24.333 --> 02:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
said that Iran is in compliance.

02:26.533 --> 02:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So maybe the president has
information that he hasn't
shared with anyone else.

02:29.066 --> 02:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, at this point, it's clear
that for almost every objective
observer, every objective

02:33.233 --> 02:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
observer -- the subjective
observers may have another view
-- but every objective observer

02:37.133 --> 02:39.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has said Iran is in compliance.

02:39.166 --> 02:43.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I don't know where he
comes up with saying that he
knows, but others don't know.

02:45.533 --> 02:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even his Cabinet disagrees,
apparently, but he knows that
Iran is not in compliance.

02:47.633 --> 02:52.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, that really would
be breaking our own
obligations under the
deal, but also breaking

02:53.533 --> 02:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with our allies, which would put
us in a very difficult position.

02:55.066 --> 02:58.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mark Dubowitz, you
are advising the administration.

02:58.800 --> 03:02.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I presume you wouldn't want
to talk about that advice,
make that advice public.

03:02.866 --> 03:06.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But what should the
president should do?

03:06.566 --> 03:10.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you think the
president should do when this
next certification comes up?

03:10.466 --> 03:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK DUBOWITZ, Foundation for
the Defense of Democracies:
So, the president should make

03:13.833 --> 03:17.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it very clear that Iran is not
in compliance with the deal.

03:17.266 --> 03:19.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's been very clear.

03:19.366 --> 03:22.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Secretary Tillerson's letter
to Congress again made it very
clear that there are incremental

03:22.966 --> 03:25.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
violations of the deal.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president actually didn't
certify that Iran is in full
compliance with the deal.

03:29.566 --> 03:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He merely said that Iran
meets certain conditions
that were laid by Congress,
which didn't require

03:34.200 --> 03:36.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
full compliance.

03:36.200 --> 03:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, my advice to the president
would be state the facts,
which is, Iran is incrementally

03:39.966 --> 03:44.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
violating the deal, but unless
there's a material breach of the
JCPOA, the nuclear deal, don't

03:47.266 --> 03:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go to the joint commission,
don't snap back the
U.N. sanctions, but
use that noncompliance

03:50.033 --> 03:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a predicate to roll out
a much more comprehensive
Iran policy that deals
with all forms of Iranian

03:57.033 --> 04:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
malign behavior, not only
nuclear misbehavior, but Iran's
malign behavior across multiple

04:02.733 --> 04:04.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fronts.

04:04.800 --> 04:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a full, comprehensive
policy, and it gets us away
from this myopic focus on the

04:08.200 --> 04:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nuclear deal, which I think
paralyzed U.S.-Iran policy
under President Obama.

04:12.766 --> 04:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Rob Malley, myopic
focus on the nuclear deal?

04:16.933 --> 04:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or should there be consideration
of things, a broader
consideration, as he says?

04:23.900 --> 04:25.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROB MALLEY: There should,
there has been, and there
will continue to be.

04:25.966 --> 04:29.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, what the Obama
administration, what
President Obama did was
take one issue, which

04:29.433 --> 04:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was a critical issue, not only
our national security experts,
but Israeli and other experts

04:33.966 --> 04:38.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said, if Iran were to rush
to a bomb, we would be in
a very difficult situation.

04:38.500 --> 04:39.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let's look at the
case of North Korea.

04:39.933 --> 04:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We wouldn't want to see a North
Korea in the Persian Gulf.

04:43.333 --> 04:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that was a priority at
that point wasn't not to
give up on the other issues.

04:49.966 --> 04:52.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Let's at least make sure
that Iran is not in a
position to get a bomb.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At the same time, let's
push back on their
regional activities,
let's see what we can

04:54.900 --> 04:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do about their ballistic
missiles, but the deal itself --
and deliberately -- was about

04:59.500 --> 05:00.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this issue.

05:00.533 --> 05:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It wasn't a case of myopia.

05:02.333 --> 05:04.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was a case of, we're
going to deal with the issue.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We solved it, at least
for the time being.

05:06.533 --> 05:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And let's work on the other
issues at the same time.

05:08.466 --> 05:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is nothing in the nuclear
deal that would prevent us
from taking action against

05:12.000 --> 05:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iran if it engaged in
terrorism, ballistic missiles,
human rights violations.

05:16.533 --> 05:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question at the heart
of what the president
said is whether we are
going to continue to

05:19.866 --> 05:24.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
honor our part of the deal,
to make sure that Iran also
honors its part and doesn't rush

05:26.466 --> 05:28.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to a nuclear bomb, so
that we don't have what
we now in North Korea.

05:28.733 --> 05:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
North Korea, we have a country
that has a nuclear bomb,
and we have no visibility on

05:32.333 --> 05:34.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what they're doing.

05:34.300 --> 05:37.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Iran, we have a country that
doesn't have a nuclear bomb,
and we have almost maximum

05:37.000 --> 05:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
visibility as a result of
the deal in every aspect
of their nuclear program.

05:40.666 --> 05:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mark Dubowitz,
what about that, the idea that
it's better to know what is

05:44.533 --> 05:48.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
going on, to work within
this agreement and know
what Iran is doing?

05:48.633 --> 05:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK DUBOWITZ: Well, I'm glad
Rob brought up the fatally
flawed North Korea nuclear

05:55.633 --> 05:58.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agreement, because the
Iran nuclear agreement is
similarly fatally flawed.

05:58.200 --> 06:02.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It contains within it
sunset provisions, where
the restrictions of
Iran's nuclear program

06:02.866 --> 06:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually go away over time, and
Iran can emerge, by actually
faithfully complying with the

06:07.600 --> 06:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deal, with an industrial sized
nuclear program, with near zero
nuclear breakout capability,

06:15.066 --> 06:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a much easier covert
sneak-out capability
with an ICBM, with a
powerful economy fortified

06:20.233 --> 06:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against our ability to
use sanctions, and with
increased regional hegemony.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, Rob is right.

06:25.333 --> 06:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The deal temporarily pushed the
Iranians further in terms of
breakout, but over the medium

06:31.733 --> 06:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
term, Iran is going to emerge
with everything it wants by
faithfully complying with the

06:35.333 --> 06:37.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
deal.

06:37.333 --> 06:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we don't want another
fatally flawed nuclear agreement
like we had with North Korea.

06:39.966 --> 06:43.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What we need to start dealing
with is this flawed agreement.

06:43.066 --> 06:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the president has
already made it very clear that
he thinks this is a terrible

06:47.933 --> 06:50.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
deal, he thinks it's
a fatally flawed deal.

06:50.466 --> 06:55.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think my advice to him
is don't certify compliance
and begin to lay the predicate

06:57.366 --> 07:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a massive pressure campaign
and get the Iranians back
to the table to negotiate a

07:00.500 --> 07:05.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nuclear deal number two that
addresses some of these fatally
flawed elements of the deal,

07:07.333 --> 07:09.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, by the way, give us
inspection rights into military
sites, which, right now, we

07:09.800 --> 07:13.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have in theory, but, in
practice, the Iranians
aren't letting us into
their military sites,

07:13.766 --> 07:17.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where they're likely to engage
in nuclear weaponization
activities like they have in

07:17.566 --> 07:19.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the past.

07:19.600 --> 07:22.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we better rectify this
fatally flawed deal, or the
Iranians are going to a nuke,

07:22.366 --> 07:27.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ICBMs, and they're going to have
the ability to dominate like
nothing we have seen before.

07:28.800 --> 07:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Rob Malley, what
would be the consequences?

07:29.600 --> 07:31.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is at stake here?

07:31.733 --> 07:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What would be the consequences
if the president did say Iran
is not living up to this deal?

07:35.266 --> 07:38.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROB MALLEY: Well, first, I
have to say, I'm a little bit
confused about argument that

07:38.066 --> 07:40.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mark was making.

07:40.066 --> 07:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is the argument that the deal is
fatally flawed and, therefore,
we shouldn't accept it, we

07:42.700 --> 07:45.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
should walk away, we
should renegotiate it,
which would be one path?

07:45.533 --> 07:46.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Very dangerous.

07:46.533 --> 07:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I won't get into that.

07:48.600 --> 07:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or is his view, the deal is
OK for now, but in 12, 13, 14,
15 years, as some provisions

07:54.633 --> 07:58.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are going to expire, and
so we should think of
whether we can negotiate
what happens afterwards,

07:58.033 --> 08:00.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
but in which case we're
going to give something
to Iranians in return.

08:00.133 --> 08:03.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nobody is going to -- the
Iranians are not going to accept
to negotiate more restrictions

08:03.166 --> 08:04.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in exchange for nothing.

08:04.166 --> 08:06.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I think we need to clarify.

08:06.166 --> 08:10.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, we're in a much
better position than we were at
the time President Obama took

08:10.166 --> 08:12.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
office, because we have
these restrictions.

08:12.533 --> 08:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And according to every
inspection that has been done,
every report by the IAEA, Iran

08:18.400 --> 08:20.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is in compliance.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, if tomorrow, the president
were to decide to announce
that Iran is not in compliance,

08:22.700 --> 08:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first of all, I think we
would have a little bit of
deja vu in terms of Iraq.

08:26.600 --> 08:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think most people in the
international community
would believe that
we're just fabricating

08:30.933 --> 08:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
evidence, because we
haven't shared it, because,
right now, we're the only
ones who are claiming

08:34.466 --> 08:37.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that Iran is not in --
or we would be the only
ones claiming that.

08:37.466 --> 08:39.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That would not put us
in a strong position.

08:39.500 --> 08:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we were to do that, and
that is it, and continue to
honor the deal, it would be a

08:43.333 --> 08:45.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hiccup.

08:45.366 --> 08:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would once again signal
to the world that we have a
rather erratic administration.

08:48.200 --> 08:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he were then to impose
sanctions, to reimpose
the sanctions that were
lifted, reimpose sanctions

08:52.433 --> 08:55.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on Iran's nuclear program,
then we would be in breach.

08:55.466 --> 09:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And either Iran would itself
say we're not only bound by
our own commitments, and we

09:02.400 --> 09:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a possibility of Iran
trying to acquire a nuclear
bomb, or we would be isolated in

09:06.933 --> 09:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the international
community, because the
Europeans, the Russians,
the Chinese, everyone would

09:09.900 --> 09:11.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
say, it's on you.

09:11.266 --> 09:12.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not on Iran.

09:12.266 --> 09:13.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why would we want that?

09:13.766 --> 09:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mark Dubowitz, let
me -- I want you to respond.

09:16.200 --> 09:18.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What would happen?

09:18.166 --> 09:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What practically would
happen if the president
said they weren't complying?

09:23.366 --> 09:25.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And then what should
the next step be?

09:25.433 --> 09:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK DUBOWITZ: Well, actually,
practically speaking, what
Rob's not telling you is that,

09:28.733 --> 09:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if the president says they're
not complying, but he doesn't
say that they're in material

09:32.033 --> 09:34.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
breach, then actually
nothing happens.

09:34.833 --> 09:36.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Then we don't go to
the joint commission.

09:36.533 --> 09:38.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We don't snap back U.N.
and U.S. sanctions.

09:38.966 --> 09:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We merely say Iran is engaging
in incremental violations.

09:42.333 --> 09:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we know that the Iranians
violate incrementally,
not egregiously, even
though, over time, the

09:46.833 --> 09:50.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sum total of the incremental
violations is always egregious.

09:50.266 --> 09:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What Rob's not telling
you is that he knows and
we know that the Iranians
have been incrementally

09:54.633 --> 09:55.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
violating this deal.

09:55.900 --> 09:57.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have exceeded
heavy water caps.

09:57.866 --> 10:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Heavy water is the
essential ingredient you
need for a plutonium bomb.

10:02.066 --> 10:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're testing more advanced
centrifuges than they are
permitted under the nuclear

10:05.400 --> 10:07.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agreement.

10:07.366 --> 10:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have been illicitly
procuring nuclear and ballistic
missile technology in Germany,

10:10.266 --> 10:12.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
according to German
intelligence services.

10:12.900 --> 10:14.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they have exceeded
their enrichment cap.

10:14.666 --> 10:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, the fact of the matter
is, there are violations.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're not material breaches.

10:18.333 --> 10:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're incremental violations.

10:20.300 --> 10:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president should state
that, certify that, and say
Iran is not in full compliance.

10:23.933 --> 10:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, the second step is to say
whether it's a material breach.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it's.

10:28.400 --> 10:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not a material breach.

10:29.933 --> 10:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he should move ahead with
the maximum pressure campaign.

10:31.366 --> 10:32.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Mark
Dubowitz, I'm sorry.

10:32.400 --> 10:33.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're out of time.

10:33.933 --> 10:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mark Dubowitz, Rob Malley, we're
going to have to leave it there.

10:35.133 --> 10:36.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you, gentlemen.

10:36.133 --> 10:37.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROB MALLEY: Thank you.

10:37.133 --> 10:37.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK DUBOWITZ: Thanks so much.
