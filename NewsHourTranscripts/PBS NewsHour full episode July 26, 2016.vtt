JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:06.006 --> 00:06.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:08.909 --> 00:11.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We bring you the
"NewsHour"
tonight from the Wells Fargo
Center in Philadelphia,

00:11.678 --> 00:14.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
site of this week's Democratic
National Convention.

00:14.948 --> 00:17.184 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's day two here.

00:17.217 --> 00:22.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Delegates are set to make
history by nominating
a woman for the first time to
top a major

00:22.789 --> 00:24.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
party's presidential ticket.

00:24.658 --> 00:29.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And with
President Bill Clinton
speaking tonight, we look back
at a different

00:29.796 --> 00:36.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of first lady, in part two
of our Hillary
biography series: the ups and
downs of her

00:36.470 --> 00:38.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
eight years in the White House.

00:38.238 --> 00:40.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID GERGEN, Former White House
Aide: She
knows the issues better than
anybody I know,

00:40.607 --> 00:42.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
including her husband.

00:42.175 --> 00:45.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was threatening to some
people, to some
voters.

00:45.746 --> 00:47.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan
in Washington.

00:47.614 --> 00:52.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We will have all the
non-convention news of
the day, including polluted
water, corruption,

00:52.219 --> 00:56.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a crumbling economy -- why
Venezuela's
oil problem is crippling the
country.

00:56.490 --> 00:59.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE GREGORIO GARCIA, Fisherman
(through translator):
The oil goes to the bottom of
the lake.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's where the crab is.

01:01.161 --> 01:03.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It migrates, or dies, or gets
covered with
petroleum, and when it's stained
like that,

01:03.797 --> 01:05.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
no one will buy it.

01:05.999 --> 01:14.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:14.408 --> 01:17.311 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:17.344 --> 01:27.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Hillary Clinton once
called it
the highest, hardest glass
ceiling, the barrier

01:27.688 --> 01:30.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to a woman becoming president of
the United
States.

01:30.924 --> 01:35.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, she's being named the
Democratic
presidential nominee, after
turning away a

01:35.362 --> 01:40.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vigorous primary challenge from
Bernie Sanders
that extended this week onto the
streets of

01:40.467 --> 01:42.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Philadelphia and the floor of
the convention.

01:42.836 --> 01:46.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, behind us now, the
delegates have
begun to cast their votes.

01:46.840 --> 01:51.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will come back to that a
little later,
but, first, correspondent Lisa
Desjardins

01:51.645 --> 01:53.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
begins our coverage.

01:53.146 --> 01:54.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Bernie Sanders!

01:54.614 --> 01:56.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:56.383 --> 02:00.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This is Hillary
Clinton's
nomination night, but Bernie
Sanders still

02:00.821 --> 02:05.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got a standing ovation from New
York delegates
this morning as he pushed again
for uniting

02:05.892 --> 02:06.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
against Donald Trump.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.762 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:08.795 --> 02:12.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
We must defeat the worst
Republican candidate

02:12.132 --> 02:14.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in modern history of this
country.

02:14.468 --> 02:15.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:15.669 --> 02:18.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But it's not
all unity yet.

02:18.238 --> 02:23.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A Sanders backer touched off a
shouting match
at a Texas delegation breakfast.

02:23.410 --> 02:24.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: We want to be clear.

02:24.978 --> 02:31.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are currently condemning our
current presumptive
nominee.

02:31.618 --> 02:32.819 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BOOING)

02:32.853 --> 02:35.889 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: You folks need to grow up.

02:35.922 --> 02:38.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You need to grow up.

02:38.625 --> 02:41.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Get out of here.

02:41.361 --> 02:43.130 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
She won.

02:43.163 --> 02:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Vice President
Biden played
down the divisions as he walked
through the

02:46.566 --> 02:51.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
convention floor, chatting with
delegates
and saying that he thinks
Sanders supporters

02:51.238 --> 02:53.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will rally behind Clinton in the
end.

02:53.473 --> 02:55.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN, Vice President of
the United
States: We have to be a little
graceful here.

02:55.642 --> 03:00.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, the senator, the
delegates worked
their tail off.

03:00.947 --> 03:03.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they're here in large
numbers.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They get a chance, man.

03:05.852 --> 03:07.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Give them a chance.

03:07.454 --> 03:09.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I promise you they're going to
be fine.

03:09.489 --> 03:14.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: After this
evening's state-by-state
roll call vote, the focus shifts
to Hillary

03:14.061 --> 03:18.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton's experience, and the
delegates hear
from top Democrats, past and
present.

03:18.365 --> 03:22.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Democratic women of the U.S.
House, led
by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi,
will take

03:22.936 --> 03:24.638 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the stage early.

03:24.671 --> 03:29.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former Attorney General Eric
Holder will speak
to Clinton's stand on social
justice.

03:29.209 --> 03:35.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And former President Bill
Clinton will round
out the night, making the case
for his wife.

03:35.449 --> 03:40.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Donald Trump had a
decidedly different
take at the Veterans of Foreign
Wars Convention

03:40.087 --> 03:42.022 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in Charlotte, North Carolina.

03:42.055 --> 03:46.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He roundly criticized Clinton
and the Democrats
gathered in Philadelphia for
making no mention

03:46.860 --> 03:49.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the Islamic State or threat
of terrorism
so far.

03:49.796 --> 03:54.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
We need to change our foreign
policy to focus

03:54.367 --> 04:00.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on defeating and destroying
ISIS, a word you
didn't hear last night at the
Democrat Convention.

04:00.607 --> 04:02.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You didn't hear about it.

04:02.409 --> 04:09.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They don't want to talk about
it, because
in a very true way they really
established

04:09.716 --> 04:11.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISIS because of weakness.

04:11.518 --> 04:16.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Meanwhile, at
an economic
summit in Laos, Secretary of
State John Kerry

04:16.389 --> 04:21.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
raised Moscow's alleged
involvement in hacking
the Democratic National
Committee's e-mails.

04:21.194 --> 04:25.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Russian Foreign Minister
Sergei Lavrov
dismissed the issue.

04:25.365 --> 04:29.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: What do you say of
U.S. accusations
that Russia hacked the
Democratic Party's

04:29.469 --> 04:31.171 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
e-mails?

04:31.204 --> 04:34.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SERGEI LAVROV, Russian Foreign
Minister: Well,
I don't want to use four-letter
words.

04:34.708 --> 04:39.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The Clinton
campaign said
today there's no evidence that
its e-mail

04:39.079 --> 04:40.547 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
system has been breached.

04:40.580 --> 04:44.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

04:44.351 --> 04:50.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next, we head
down to the convention
floor, where NPR's "Weekend
Edition Sunday"

04:50.323 --> 04:52.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
host Rachel Martin is standing
by.

04:52.192 --> 04:57.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rachel is joining us every night
this week
as part of our joint "PBS
NewsHour"/NPR convention

04:57.697 --> 04:58.798 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coverage.

04:58.832 --> 04:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Rachel, what should are you
looking for
tonight?

04:59.900 --> 05:01.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RACHEL MARTIN: Hi, Judy.

05:01.801 --> 05:06.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, yes, as you can hear
behind me, the
roll call is still going on,
and, as was mentioned

05:06.540 --> 05:10.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in that piece that just preceded
me, history
is happening here tonight.

05:10.844 --> 05:15.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Democratic Party is
hoping that history
can help heal the divisions that
still exist

05:15.448 --> 05:19.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
between Bernie Sanders
supporters and those
in this arena who are supporting
Hillary Clinton.

05:19.986 --> 05:24.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There will be a whole slew of
speaks on this
stage tonight who will be making
the case

05:24.457 --> 05:26.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for Hillary Clinton.

05:26.326 --> 05:31.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The theme of the campaign
tonight is supposed
to focus on Hillary Clinton's
experience,

05:31.498 --> 05:34.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sticking up for children and
families over
her career.

05:34.701 --> 05:38.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To that end, we're going to hear
from the
so-called mothers of the
movement.

05:38.872 --> 05:43.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are the mothers of Eric
Garner, Trayvon
Martin, Sandra Bland and others,
who will

05:43.910 --> 05:49.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be addressing the issue of
police brutality
in this country, race relations.

05:49.082 --> 05:54.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will also be hearing an
important speech
tonight from former President
Bill Clinton.

05:54.955 --> 06:00.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By our count, it will be the
eighth time that
President Clinton has addressed
the Democratic

06:00.160 --> 06:01.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
National Convention.

06:01.895 --> 06:07.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This will be, perhaps, the most
important
speech he has ever given in this
arena, as

06:07.100 --> 06:13.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he endorses his own wife for
president of
the United States -- back to
you, Judy and

06:13.039 --> 06:14.007 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Gwen.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Making history,
Rachel.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will be glued to all of it.

06:16.176 --> 06:17.143 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Thanks.

06:17.177 --> 06:19.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Thank you, Rachel.

06:19.045 --> 06:23.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our next guest shattered her own
glass ceiling
in 2007, when she was elected
the first woman

06:23.783 --> 06:26.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
speaker of the House of
Representatives.

06:26.186 --> 06:29.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi
joins us
now.

06:29.189 --> 06:30.156 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Welcome.

06:30.190 --> 06:31.324 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

06:31.358 --> 06:33.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), House
Minority Leader:
Pleasure.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's so good to see
you here,
but I'm wondering, as you watch
this roll

06:35.028 --> 06:41.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
call play out, where the Bernie
Sanders supporters
are still getting their final
cry in, whether

06:41.801 --> 06:44.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you think that you're signaling
unity with
this.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.205 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI: We're signaling
strength.

06:47.874 --> 06:52.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we disagree with each other,
we learn more
about each other, and more and
more people

06:52.379 --> 06:53.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are coming together.

06:53.780 --> 06:55.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Some may never get there.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They just may not get there.

06:57.951 --> 07:01.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, largely, this convention is
coming together.

07:01.688 --> 07:07.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everybody understands that,
whatever our differences,
they're vastly small compared to
the vast

07:07.527 --> 07:11.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
difference between the Democrats
and the Republicans,
between Hillary Clinton and the
Republican

07:11.464 --> 07:12.799 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
nominee.

07:12.832 --> 07:16.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm curious about
your own
delegation, Madam Leader.

07:16.536 --> 07:21.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
California, 300-some delegates
for Hillary
Clinton, but over 200 delegates
for Bernie

07:21.474 --> 07:25.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders, how is the California
-- they're
the best, the biggest, most
populous state

07:25.578 --> 07:26.546 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the country.

07:26.579 --> 07:27.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How are they coming together?

07:27.614 --> 07:28.581 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI: They will come
together.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will have the biggest vote in
the country,
of course, for Hillary Clinton.

07:31.951 --> 07:37.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our Governor Brown just said
that he thinks
we can win by 20 points for
Hillary Clinton

07:37.090 --> 07:38.058 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in California.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.059 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We will see.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it's going to be big.

07:40.894 --> 07:45.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, Donald Trump is,
what, making
things up when he says he's
going to compete

07:45.498 --> 07:46.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in California?

07:46.499 --> 07:47.467 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

07:47.500 --> 07:48.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI: Let him think
that.

07:48.501 --> 07:49.536 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

07:49.569 --> 07:50.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: OK, let me ask you,
how you do
win?

07:51.004 --> 07:54.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is key going forward,
leaving Philadelphia,
for your nominee?

07:54.607 --> 07:56.376 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

07:56.409 --> 07:58.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI: Well, what is key
for winning
the election is to be able to
put forth a

07:58.778 --> 08:05.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vision for our future and how
this election
affects people's lives.

08:05.151 --> 08:10.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We're about rejecting
trickle-down economics,
instead an economy that works
for everyone,

08:10.190 --> 08:11.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not just the privileged few.

08:11.858 --> 08:16.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In terms of winning the
election, it's all
about turnout and how we connect
with the

08:16.463 --> 08:23.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voter as to what it means in
their lives to
turn out to vote, to win the
House, the Senate,

08:23.470 --> 08:26.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
statehouses, state governorships
and the rest.

08:27.006 --> 08:28.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, turnout is everything.

08:28.341 --> 08:33.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And turnout really runs on the
fuel of inspiration.

08:33.313 --> 08:39.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I believe Hillary Clinton's
vision, based
on her experience, based on her
knowledge

08:39.953 --> 08:45.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and judgment, as well as her
connection with
the American people, after a
lifetime of service

08:45.525 --> 08:48.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and leadership for America's
families and
children.

08:48.495 --> 08:52.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I don't think
anyone is closer
to the voters in Washington than
members of

08:52.432 --> 08:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the House of Representatives.

08:53.433 --> 08:54.401 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

08:54.434 --> 08:55.402 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI: That's right.

08:55.435 --> 08:57.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You know that
place very well.

08:57.137 --> 09:00.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, Donald Trump is doing
much better
than Hillary Clinton among white
men, and

09:00.774 --> 09:04.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
particularly white men who have
not attended
college.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How does Hillary Clinton counter
that?

09:06.346 --> 09:08.181 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

09:08.214 --> 09:13.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI: With an economic
agenda to create
jobs, good-paying jobs,
increasing paychecks.

09:13.720 --> 09:17.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The economic agenda is what is
really -- it's
about the economy.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You know that statement.

09:19.526 --> 09:20.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not a cliche.

09:20.527 --> 09:22.662 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's a fact.

09:22.695 --> 09:29.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that, so many times,
white -- non-college-education
-- educated white males have
voted Republican.

09:29.469 --> 09:35.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They voted against their own
economic interests
because of guns, because of
gays, and because

09:35.809 --> 09:40.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of God, the three G's, God being
the woman's
right to choose.

09:40.380 --> 09:41.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is softening.

09:41.848 --> 09:45.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some of those people were never
going to be
voting Democratic anyway.

09:45.785 --> 09:52.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I believe that, with the
turnout that
we expect to have, we will draw
some of them

09:52.158 --> 09:56.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in with our message, and enough
other people
to win the election.

09:56.729 --> 09:59.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Leader Pelosi, how
do you compare
what we're going to be seeing
here tonight

09:59.833 --> 10:04.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the nomination of Hillary
Clinton to
Geraldine Ferraro in 1984?

10:04.671 --> 10:05.638 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You were there.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You saw that glass ceiling
break.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.108 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

10:09.142 --> 10:13.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI: 1984, I was chair
of the host
committee at the San Francisco
convention.

10:13.746 --> 10:21.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I can tell you -- I can just
drum it up
immediately -- the thunderous
response that

10:21.287 --> 10:24.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that convention had to her
nomination.

10:24.057 --> 10:27.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mind you, the convention was
very split between
Mondale and Gary Hart.

10:27.594 --> 10:31.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So it had a similar feeling to
this.

10:31.664 --> 10:38.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, nonetheless, in the
nomination of the
first woman as vice president of
a major party,

10:38.438 --> 10:40.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it was thunderous.

10:40.306 --> 10:43.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's what will happen with
Hillary Clinton,
even beyond, because she's going
to be nominated

10:43.610 --> 10:47.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for president, the most powerful
person in
the world.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's very exciting.

10:49.048 --> 10:51.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it will be
historic, as
we have been saying.

10:51.751 --> 10:57.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But should it be a factor in how
people vote,
the fact that she would be the
first woman

10:57.390 --> 10:58.825 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president, the fact that she is
a woman?

10:58.858 --> 11:00.593 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

11:00.627 --> 11:02.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI: I don't think -- I
think that
people want to know what the
election of a

11:02.428 --> 11:05.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
particular person means in their
lives.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is your vision?

11:07.200 --> 11:10.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What is your plan to get
something done that
affects me?

11:10.837 --> 11:15.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have always said, in my
own rise in
the leadership, please don't
ever ask anybody

11:15.575 --> 11:17.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to vote for me because I'm a
woman.

11:17.877 --> 11:22.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That happens to be, in my view,
an enhancement,
but, nonetheless, it's all about
who is the

11:22.215 --> 11:23.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
best person for the job.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton is the best
person for the
job.

11:26.452 --> 11:30.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She will go into the Oval Office
before prepared
even than President Obama.

11:30.490 --> 11:31.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He has said that himself.

11:31.925 --> 11:34.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Better prepared than President
Bush, George
W. Bush.

11:34.260 --> 11:35.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Better prepared than her own
husband.

11:35.995 --> 11:41.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, she has a vision, she has
knowledge
and judgment.

11:41.100 --> 11:45.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She is a strategic thinker,
based on her experience
and her connection.

11:45.071 --> 11:50.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know something about power,
being the first
woman speaker of the House.

11:50.209 --> 11:56.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Actually, the legislative branch
is the first
article of the Constitution, and
so president,

11:56.416 --> 11:59.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vice president, speaker of the
House, third
highest.

11:59.118 --> 12:07.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, for me, it's particularly
almost emotional
to think that she will have that
much power

12:07.760 --> 12:12.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to help develop a consensus in
our country
and be the leader of the free
world.

12:12.865 --> 12:15.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Power is the word.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nancy Pelosi, minority leader of
the House
of Representatives, thank you so
much for

12:18.738 --> 12:19.706 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
joining us.

12:19.739 --> 12:20.707 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

12:20.740 --> 12:21.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI: My pleasure.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.610 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

12:23.643 --> 12:23.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Who has already
made history
herself by being the first woman
in that position.

12:24.010 --> 12:24.711 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.379 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI: But I'm happy to
relinquish
the title of the highest elected
woman in

12:27.380 --> 12:28.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the history of our country.

12:28.781 --> 12:30.550 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

12:30.583 --> 12:34.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we turn to
the second part
of our series exploring Hillary
Clinton's

12:34.621 --> 12:38.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
life -- tonight, the eight years
she spent
in the White House.

12:38.391 --> 12:43.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her tenure as first lady can be
categorized
as atypical, and even
controversial at times.

12:43.563 --> 12:48.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She logged many firsts, first
presidential
spouse with a graduate degree,
first to testify

12:48.968 --> 12:56.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before a grand jury, and the
first to have
an office in the West Wing of
the White House.

12:56.075 --> 13:01.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before the Clintons ever stepped
foot into
the White House in 1993, and she
was given

13:01.581 --> 13:06.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her own West Wing office, there
were hints
Hillary Clinton would be a
different kind

13:06.586 --> 13:08.521 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of first lady.

13:08.554 --> 13:10.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I suppose I could have stayed
home and baked

13:10.056 --> 13:13.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cookies and had teas, but what I
decided to
do was to fulfill my profession.

13:13.259 --> 13:19.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That candid
comment early in
the '92 campaign didn't go over
well with

13:19.098 --> 13:23.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voters, so she shifted to a more
traditional
role until Election Day.

13:23.670 --> 13:28.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But as soon as her husband was
elected, she
was again a public player.

13:28.107 --> 13:29.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Hello.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is Hillary Clinton.

13:31.044 --> 13:34.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to thank you for letting
me speak with
you about an issue that is
central to our

13:34.747 --> 13:36.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
children's future.

13:36.516 --> 13:41.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Early on,
President Clinton
tapped his wife to steer a major
initiative,

13:41.387 --> 13:45.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
running the Task Force on
National Health
Care Reform.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Gergen was an aide to the
president
at the time.

13:47.860 --> 13:50.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID GERGEN, Former White House
Aide: She's
an extraordinarily competent
woman.

13:50.096 --> 13:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is very much on -- she knows
the issues
better than anybody I know,
including her

13:53.866 --> 13:54.967 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
husband.

13:55.001 --> 13:59.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was threatening to some
people, to some
voters.

13:59.372 --> 14:05.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Men would -- of the older
generation would
say, I would be really proud if
my daughter

14:05.311 --> 14:11.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grew up to be like Hillary
Clinton, to be
the kind of pathbreaker she is,
but I sure

14:11.784 --> 14:13.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as hell am glad that my wife
isn't.

HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Thank
you very much,
Mr. Chairman.

JUDY WOODRUFF: In the beginning,
the health
care effort looked promising,
says author

14:20.626 --> 14:22.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Rebecca Traister.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBECCA TRAISTER, Author, "All
The Single
Ladies: Unmarried Women and the
Rise of an

14:24.230 --> 14:26.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Independent Nation": When she
first took on
the project, and initially
testified in front

14:26.666 --> 14:32.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congress about health care
reform, it actually
looked like it might go well.

14:32.705 --> 14:35.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She was already a very divisive
figure.

14:35.308 --> 14:36.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People hated her.

14:36.309 --> 14:37.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People loved her.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She was so clearly smart,
competent.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Her approval ratings went way
up.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.849 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
People liked it.

14:42.882 --> 14:46.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But as weeks
passed, Clinton's
health care plan was attacked by
the right

14:46.185 --> 14:47.687 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and the left.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Conservatives called it a
government takeover.

14:50.757 --> 14:56.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even with a Democratic majority
in Congress,
the bill never made it out of
committee.

14:56.329 --> 15:01.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary had recruited dozens of
experts to
help craft an elaborate plan for
universal

15:01.901 --> 15:07.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coverage, but she had insisted
most of the
work be done in secret.

15:07.140 --> 15:12.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Gergen says it was that
and the lack
of political outreach that led
to failure.

15:12.245 --> 15:15.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID GERGEN: She hadn't learned
yet to play
the Washington game.

15:15.982 --> 15:20.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The collapse of
the health
care initiative was one of the
major factors

15:20.119 --> 15:24.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in the GOP's takeover of
Congress the following
year.

15:24.323 --> 15:30.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During Bill Clinton's second
term, Hillary
was successful in her push for a
program that

15:30.396 --> 15:36.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enabled Washington to partner
with states
to ensure health coverage for
uninsured children.

15:36.903 --> 15:42.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, unlike the first four
years, she spent
less time in the West Wing, and
more time

15:42.708 --> 15:45.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
traveling abroad, much of it
promoting women's
rights.

15:45.978 --> 15:51.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: It is no
longer acceptable
to discuss women's rights as
separate from

15:51.818 --> 15:53.519 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
human rights.

15:53.553 --> 15:57.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Traister
describes it as a
retreat into a more traditional
first lady

15:57.790 --> 15:59.325 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
role.

15:59.358 --> 16:01.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REBECCA TRAISTER: She and
Chelsea did a lot
of traveling around the world.

16:01.394 --> 16:05.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She wrote a book called, "Dear
Socks, Dear
Buddy," notes to the White House
pets.

16:05.998 --> 16:12.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She was blamed so
enthusiastically for what
happened with health care
reform, and she

16:12.071 --> 16:21.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was really attacked so
forcefully, that it
precipitated a real retreat by
Hillary from

16:21.781 --> 16:25.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this divisive public role that
she had held
within the administration.

16:25.351 --> 16:29.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hillary was also
at the center
of a string of controversies.

16:29.822 --> 16:35.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Clintons' involvement in a
failed Arkansas
land deal known as Whitewater
would follow

16:35.361 --> 16:37.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
both of them through his
presidency.

16:37.396 --> 16:43.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID GERGEN: I think one of the
most troubling
moments for me at the White
House came over

16:43.836 --> 16:44.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Whitewater issue.

16:44.971 --> 16:47.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Former White
House aide David
Gergen:

16:47.573 --> 16:52.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID GERGEN: I had a
conversation with the
president, and we got his assent
to give over

16:52.912 --> 16:54.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the documents to The Washington
Post.

16:54.447 --> 16:58.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But then the president said:
"Before we do
this, you got to remember this.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Both Hillary and I were involved
in this.

17:00.319 --> 17:03.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We can't release the documents
without her
blessing as well.

17:03.756 --> 17:06.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, by the way, David, you
ought to go get
it."

17:06.626 --> 17:12.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I made the effort to see her,
and try to persuade
her to give over the documents,
and I was

17:12.498 --> 17:15.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ultimately very, very
unsuccessful.

17:15.067 --> 17:20.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For years,
Hillary Clinton
resisted calls to release
documents related

17:20.740 --> 17:22.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to Whitewater and other
controversies.

17:22.875 --> 17:28.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That, in turn, drew more
attention from the
news media and ultimately led to
the appointment

17:28.848 --> 17:30.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of a special prosecutor.

17:30.783 --> 17:34.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID GERGEN: If you stick to
secrecy too
much in the White House -- and
there's a temptation

17:34.487 --> 17:38.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for every White House to do that
-- but if
you stick too closely to
temptation, you can

17:38.758 --> 17:40.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
pay a big, big price.

17:40.326 --> 17:42.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And she paid a price for it.

17:42.194 --> 17:45.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: The
conventional wisdom
about Whitewater always is, take
any straw

17:45.798 --> 17:47.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you can to go on.

17:47.466 --> 17:50.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I don't have any doubt that
there are
those who will say this should
go on.

17:50.169 --> 17:52.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just would like to tell them,
go on where?

17:52.738 --> 17:54.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have been going on for four
years.

17:54.640 --> 17:59.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The investigation
ended after
it was declared there was
insufficient evidence

17:59.312 --> 18:01.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to prove any wrongdoing.

18:01.747 --> 18:07.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the prolonged struggle led
to a far more
damaging controversy, brought to
light by

18:07.586 --> 18:09.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
independent counsel Kenneth
Starr.

18:09.722 --> 18:12.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID GERGEN: Had it not been
for Kenneth
Starr, we would have never heard
of Monica

18:12.858 --> 18:14.593 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Lewinsky.

18:14.627 --> 18:17.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if we had never heard of
Monica Lewinsky,
Bill Clinton would have not been
impeached.

18:17.663 --> 18:22.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL CLINTON, Former President
of the United
States: I didn't have sexual
relations with

18:22.301 --> 18:24.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that woman, Ms. Lewinsky.

18:24.236 --> 18:29.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As the story of
the president's
involvement with a young White
House intern

18:29.175 --> 18:35.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unfolded, it set off a firestorm
of headlines
about the state of the Clinton
marriage.

18:35.514 --> 18:39.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Gergen describes their
relationship as being
a bit like a seesaw.

18:39.385 --> 18:44.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID GERGEN: As long as the
seesaw was in
equilibrium, they worked well
together.

18:44.423 --> 18:48.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When Hillary sort of got hurt
and lost a couple
of things, lost the Congress,
and the seesaw

18:48.594 --> 18:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tipped like this, and Bill was
up sort of
on top, that's when I think he
allowed himself

18:54.133 --> 18:57.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to get -- to succumb to some of
the temptations.

18:57.670 --> 19:00.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was a lot of volatility in
that relationship.

19:00.172 --> 19:02.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How did she -- how well did she
handle it?

19:02.208 --> 19:04.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Well, she stuck by her man.

19:04.043 --> 19:08.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As the end of
Bill Clinton's
presidency approached, sympathy
for the first

19:08.814 --> 19:11.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lady helped boost her image.

19:11.150 --> 19:14.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She began openly planning her
own political
career.

19:14.120 --> 19:22.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Bill and
I are closing
one chapter of our lives, and
soon we will

19:22.294 --> 19:24.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be starting a new one.

19:24.397 --> 19:30.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For me, it will be up to the
people of New
York to decide whether I will
have the privilege

19:30.803 --> 19:35.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of serving them in the United
States Senate.

19:35.307 --> 19:37.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

19:37.143 --> 19:40.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One year later,
Hillary Clinton
added yet another first to her
resume, the

19:40.413 --> 19:44.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first presidential spouse to run
for elected
office.

19:44.483 --> 19:50.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: We mark this
historic night with
two women who have been
trailblazers in their

19:50.189 --> 19:51.590 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
own right.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kamala Harris is attorney
general of California.

19:53.759 --> 19:58.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is the first woman and first
African-American
and first Indian-American to
hold that office,

19:58.264 --> 20:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and she is running this year for
the U.S.
Senate.

20:01.033 --> 20:05.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Representative Cheri Bustos
of Illinois
was the first woman elected to
Congress from

20:05.137 --> 20:06.138 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
her district.

20:06.172 --> 20:08.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She now works to elect other
woman candidates.

20:08.607 --> 20:09.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

20:09.608 --> 20:10.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Welcome.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I want to ask you
both to think
back to 1984.

20:12.745 --> 20:17.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were just asking Nancy Pelosi
about this
idea, the big breakthrough, when
Geraldine

20:17.483 --> 20:21.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Ferraro became the vice
presidential candidate
for the first time.

20:21.320 --> 20:25.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cheri Bustos, how different is
it to be a
woman candidate now than it was
in 1984?

20:25.191 --> 20:26.559 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

20:26.592 --> 20:28.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHERI BUSTOS (D), Illinois: I
still think
there are challenges.

20:28.294 --> 20:31.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I'm vice chairman of the
Recruiting Committee
for the Democratic Congressional
Campaign

20:31.697 --> 20:32.698 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Committee.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I recruit candidates all
over the country.

20:34.433 --> 20:38.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now I'm vice chair of what
is called the
Red to Blue Committee.

20:38.270 --> 20:43.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have 38 people who are on
that list of
seats where we think we have an
opportunity

20:44.009 --> 20:45.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to pick those up for Democrats.

20:45.211 --> 20:47.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Half of those are women.

20:47.746 --> 20:50.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are still challenges when
we're looking
at women running for office.

20:50.449 --> 20:54.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think how we're going to
correct that
is what's going on right here.

20:54.253 --> 20:57.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we get a woman in the White
House, I
think that it is going to be
easier to get

20:57.890 --> 21:00.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
women to run for office.

21:00.626 --> 21:02.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I hope that we make some
tremendous gains
over the years.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAMALA HARRIS, California
Attorney General:
I agree.

21:04.930 --> 21:10.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that -- and, also,
there's a significance
to the nomination of Hillary
Clinton that

21:10.736 --> 21:14.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually relates to advice my
mother gave
us when we were growing up, my
sister and

21:14.740 --> 21:16.075 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she would say, "Kamala, you
may be the
first to do many things.

21:17.810 --> 21:20.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Make sure you're not the last."

21:20.679 --> 21:24.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so there is that thing about
the way that
Hillary Clinton has actually
lived her professional

21:24.950 --> 21:28.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
life that is also about
mentorship.

21:28.053 --> 21:33.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's about encouraging other
women to actually
go forward and do it, knowing
that they can

21:33.826 --> 21:35.528 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
succeed.

21:35.561 --> 21:38.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Equally important is what
Michelle Obama said
last night.

21:38.130 --> 21:43.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The significance of Hillary
Clinton breaking
the ceiling is the significance
of telling

21:43.369 --> 21:49.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
our sons, as well as our
daughters, you can
do anything, unburdened by who
has done it

21:49.175 --> 21:51.076 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
before.

21:51.110 --> 21:55.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's an important point to
make to everybody,
not just girls, not just women,
not just people

21:55.514 --> 21:57.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of a certain race.

21:57.249 --> 22:00.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's telling everyone, anyone
can do whatever
they want.

22:00.286 --> 22:02.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is all possible if you work
hard.

22:02.354 --> 22:05.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congresswoman
Bustos, as you
were saying, there are still
obstacles after

22:05.991 --> 22:06.959 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all this time.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.661 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What are they?

22:08.694 --> 22:11.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, is just a matter of
confidence and
seeing that woman in the White
House?

22:11.730 --> 22:16.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because we have had women
elected to the Senate,
a women -- a few women elected
governors.

22:16.502 --> 22:19.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is it, 17 percent of the
House of Representatives
are women.

22:19.738 --> 22:21.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is it a matter of confidence?

22:21.373 --> 22:22.341 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is it money?

22:22.374 --> 22:23.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is holding women back?

22:23.375 --> 22:25.144 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHERI BUSTOS: It is very, very
different when
we're recruiting a woman vs.
recruiting a

22:27.846 --> 22:29.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
man, the questions that we get.

22:29.181 --> 22:32.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A man typically will say right
off the bat,
can I win?

22:32.751 --> 22:33.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That will be question number
one.

22:33.752 --> 22:37.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And if you say yes, then we're
all in.

22:37.456 --> 22:43.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With a woman, it is, how does a
campaign impact
your children, your family?

22:43.262 --> 22:45.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you take it when these
attack ads are
running?

22:45.631 --> 22:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How does your family take that?

22:47.399 --> 22:53.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, if I am elected, how is it
when I have
to go back and forth to
Washington, D.C.?

22:53.672 --> 22:59.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when I'm involved with
recruiting women,
I have got a very close-knit
group of girlfriends.

22:59.745 --> 23:02.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were all elected right around
the same
time.

23:02.214 --> 23:06.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we take a woman candidate
who were looking
at out to dinner.

23:06.252 --> 23:11.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we talk about all those
challenges, whether
it be -- if they have young
children, I will

23:11.357 --> 23:15.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
call my good friend
Congresswoman Grace Meng
out of New York, who has two
young boys, and

23:15.761 --> 23:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say, Grace, can you talk with
this woman about
what it is like to have two
young boys and

23:20.499 --> 23:24.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how you Skype when you're
walking over to
the House floor to vote and do
your homework

23:24.069 --> 23:26.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by Skype with them, and just how
you manage
that.

23:26.372 --> 23:32.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But very, very different sets of
questions
that you get, and perceived
obstacles as well.

23:32.177 --> 23:36.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Kamala Harris,
today, John Podesta,
the -- Hillary Clinton's
campaign manager,

23:36.882 --> 23:41.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said he believed the double
standard applied
to women, that that is not the
only thing

23:41.186 --> 23:46.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
driving some of the kind of
historic unfavorable
numbers for her, but that he
thinks it's very

23:46.925 --> 23:47.893 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
real.

23:47.926 --> 23:48.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you think?

23:48.927 --> 23:50.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAMALA HARRIS: I think that, to
be sure.

23:50.529 --> 23:52.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm a career prosecutor.

23:52.398 --> 23:57.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was elected as the first
district attorney
of San Francisco and the first
attorney general

23:57.169 --> 24:00.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of California, which means I'm
the top law
enforcement officer of the state
of California.

24:00.773 --> 24:05.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there were a lot of people
who doubted
that I would be elected for that
reason.

24:05.377 --> 24:10.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said, well-meaning people,
that, no one
like you has done this before,
and that is

24:10.349 --> 24:13.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be a challenge, and
people aren't
prepared for someone like you
holding that

24:13.686 --> 24:15.587 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
position.

24:15.621 --> 24:18.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there are challenges, but
equally important
-- and I think the congresswoman
is absolutely

24:18.390 --> 24:23.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
correct -- when we understand
that, and then,
through your leadership and
women and men

24:23.362 --> 24:29.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like you, pulling together an
infrastructure
to encourage those women to have
faith that

24:29.234 --> 24:32.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they actually can do it and
building the infrastructure
around them.

24:32.638 --> 24:34.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Anything can be done.

24:34.473 --> 24:38.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think also the point that
you were asking
about, fund-raising is a very
real one for

24:38.377 --> 24:39.411 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
women.

24:39.445 --> 24:44.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Women -- most women are taught
to be independent.

24:44.083 --> 24:47.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to be independent means
don't ask anyone
for money.

24:47.186 --> 24:50.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then you run for office and
you have to
ask everybody for money.

24:50.856 --> 24:54.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's a real psychological
burden that
associates with that.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.294 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

24:55.327 --> 24:57.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Right.

24:57.129 --> 24:58.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAMALA HARRIS: And so what I
mention to women
who are running for office, I
say, listen,

24:58.697 --> 24:59.832 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
just be clear.

24:59.865 --> 25:02.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're not asking someone to buy
you a pair
of shoes.

25:02.301 --> 25:06.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's about having them invest in
what they
believe is in the best interest
of their community,

25:06.672 --> 25:08.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their family, and the issues.

25:08.507 --> 25:12.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congresswoman
Bustos, right
now, the polls show that Donald
Trump is doing

25:12.478 --> 25:16.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
better with men than Hillary
Clinton is with
women.

25:16.048 --> 25:17.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why do you think that is?

25:17.216 --> 25:19.051 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

25:19.084 --> 25:22.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHERI BUSTOS: I believe that, as
we get closer
and closer to November and the
policies that

25:22.755 --> 25:28.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
both Hillary Clinton stands for
and the Democratic
members of Congress and what we
want to support

25:28.794 --> 25:33.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after she's in the White House,
and we talk
about that on the campaign trail
and among

25:33.298 --> 25:37.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all of the states in our nation,
I think those
number numbers will change.

25:37.202 --> 25:45.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, what we stand for are
currently back-burner
issues, equal pay for equal
work, paid family

25:45.210 --> 25:51.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leave, making sure that seniors
will have
their Social Security and
Medicare there as

25:51.083 --> 25:54.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they age, because that affects
women disproportionately.

25:54.586 --> 25:59.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, as we talk about this, and
what we want
to do, not just for women, but
for our families,

25:59.525 --> 26:03.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and you take a look at what
Hillary Clinton
stands for and what the
Democrats stand for,

26:03.996 --> 26:05.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think we will see some shift
in those numbers.

26:05.431 --> 26:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I feel confident of that.

26:07.299 --> 26:11.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: After all is said
and done, what
difference does it make if it's
a woman sitting

26:11.136 --> 26:15.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in either the highest office in
the land or
on a school board?

26:15.441 --> 26:18.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What does it -- I'm not saying
that you're
running only as women, because,
obviously,

26:18.444 --> 26:20.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you're not, but what difference
does it make?

26:20.746 --> 26:25.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAMALA HARRIS: We all -- the
difference is
the importance of diversity.

26:25.884 --> 26:31.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And diversity is important
because we all
have different life experiences.

26:32.024 --> 26:36.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when decisions are being
made that are
going to impact so many people,
it's important

26:36.995 --> 26:43.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we have considered all the
ramifications
based on how it will roll out.

26:43.235 --> 26:47.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The more diverse the group of
people are who
are making the decision, the
better the decision

26:47.539 --> 26:51.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will be, especially when you're
talking about
the decisions that are being
made by the president

26:51.143 --> 26:52.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the United States.

26:53.011 --> 26:57.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, certainly we
know, also, in
terms of demographics, women
disproportionately

26:57.950 --> 27:03.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are responsible for caring for
children and
caring for elder relatives.

27:03.322 --> 27:08.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Women are disproportionately
responsible for
dealing with household issues,
whatever they

27:08.360 --> 27:10.062 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
may be.

27:10.095 --> 27:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Women are increasingly equal, or
even in greater
numbers, the breadwinner in the
family.

27:14.766 --> 27:17.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so women have a certain life
experience.

27:17.236 --> 27:20.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know girls have a certain
life experience.

27:20.239 --> 27:24.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those people who are making
the decisions
should understand the
ramifications of their

27:24.409 --> 27:25.611 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
decisions.

27:25.644 --> 27:26.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: California
Attorney General
Kamala Harris.

27:26.945 --> 27:28.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAMALA HARRIS: Thank you.

27:28.780 --> 27:33.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
Representative Bustos from
the state of Illinois, we thank
both of you

27:33.519 --> 27:34.486 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for being here.

27:34.520 --> 27:35.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

CHERI BUSTOS: Thank you.

27:38.524 --> 27:39.491 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

27:41.293 --> 27:43.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as you can hear, that
state-by-state
roll call vote is happening
right here in

27:43.428 --> 27:45.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the arena in Philadelphia behind
us.

27:45.497 --> 27:49.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we expect that Hillary
Clinton will be
officially nominated by the time
our broadcast

27:49.868 --> 27:51.637 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is over.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are going to right now,
though, throw back
to Hari in Washington now, and
return for

27:54.506 --> 27:56.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more on that development in a
few minutes
-- Hari.

27:56.875 --> 27:58.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thank you.

In the day's other news: The
Islamic State
group claimed responsibility for
the brutal

28:01.914 --> 28:04.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
killing of a Catholic priest in
France.

28:04.383 --> 28:07.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It happened in a small town
outside Rouen,
in the country's Normandy
region.

28:07.719 --> 28:12.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

The Catholics were the ones who
were hit,
but this targets all the French.

28:28.874 --> 28:33.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is why we must stand in
cohesion,
together, in a bloc that no one
can break.

28:33.779 --> 28:38.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, we must be aware that the
terrorists
will stop at nothing, unless we
stop them.

HARI SREENIVASAN: A nun who
witnessed the
attack said the militants gave a
sermon in

28:42.154 --> 28:45.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Arabic, and filmed the murder of
the priest.

The people of Japan awoke today
to -- after
the country's worst mass killing
since World

28:50.495 --> 28:52.230 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
War II.

28:52.264 --> 28:56.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A man with a knife killed 19
people as they
slept, and wounded 25 others at
a home for

28:56.101 --> 28:57.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the mentally disabled west of
Tokyo.

28:58.003 --> 29:02.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The suspect had worked at the
facility before
being let go, and news accounts
said he'd

29:02.174 --> 29:07.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
written to parliament, warning
of his plans
and demanding that all disabled
people be

29:07.112 --> 29:08.146 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
put to death.

29:08.180 --> 29:11.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He gave himself up after the
killings.

The prime minister of Australia
has ordered
an investigation of alleged
abuse at a juvenile

youths being tear-gassed and
stripped naked.

29:21.460 --> 29:25.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Human rights activists accused
the government
of ignoring the issue for years,
but Prime

29:25.230 --> 29:29.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Minister Malcolm Turnbull denied
that and
insisted there's been a
cover-up.

29:29.101 --> 29:32.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM TURNBULL, Australian
Prime Minister:
The real challenge now is to get
to the bottom

29:32.070 --> 29:33.705 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of what has happened.

29:33.739 --> 29:38.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We need to know what has
happened, why it
happened, why it was able to
happen, what

29:38.710 --> 29:43.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the culture that enabled this
to occur,
what lessons we learn from it,
and how we

29:43.482 --> 29:46.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can ensure it never, ever
happens again.

29:46.518 --> 29:49.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The abuse was
detailed in
a documentary by the Australian
Broadcasting

29:49.821 --> 29:50.989 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Corporation.

29:51.023 --> 29:54.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was filmed largely in Darwin,
between 2010
and 2015.

Back in this country, a federal
judge has
given initial approval to a $15
billion settlement

29:58.664 --> 30:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over Volkswagen's emissions
cheating.

30:01.066 --> 30:04.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The deal gives owners the option
to have the
company buy back their cars.

30:04.770 --> 30:07.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they can also opt out and
pursue their
own lawsuits.

30:07.706 --> 30:12.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Volkswagen still faces billions
in fines and
penalties, and possible criminal
charges.

On Wall Street, stocks struggled
to make headway
for a second day.

30:15.714 --> 30:20.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 19 points
to close at 18473.

30:20.152 --> 30:24.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 12 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added a fraction.

And the first solar-powered
round-the-world
flight finished today where it
began.

30:29.761 --> 30:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Solar Impulse 2 landed in the
early morning
hours in Abu Dhabi, 16 months
after it first

30:35.434 --> 30:37.202 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
took off.

30:37.235 --> 30:42.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It made 16 stops along the way,
and flew some
25,000 miles all without using
any fuel.

30:42.674 --> 30:52.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The plane weighs roughly as much
as a minivan,
and is powered by more than
17,000 solar cells.

We return now to a Venezuela in
crisis.

31:01.893 --> 31:05.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We recently brought you a report
from Caracas
on the collapse of the economy
and the health

31:05.831 --> 31:09.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care system and the lawlessness
run rampant
there.

Tonight, again in partnership

Nadja Drost and videographer
Bruno Federico
report from western Venezuela on
Lake Maracaibo.

31:20.078 --> 31:24.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is the hub of Venezuela's oil
industry,
the country's lifeblood, which
is now a trade

31:24.716 --> 31:26.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in serious trouble.

31:26.418 --> 31:31.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: The drop in oil
prices has not
just devastated the Venezuelan
economy.

31:31.723 --> 31:34.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's causing an environmental
crisis as well.

31:34.626 --> 31:38.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An oil spill that happened in
May still covers
the shoreline of Lake Maracaibo.

31:38.497 --> 31:44.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE GREGORIO GARCIA, Fisherman
(through translator):
Lately, we have been seeing a
lot of oil spills.

31:44.035 --> 31:45.771 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It wasn't like this before.

31:45.804 --> 31:50.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Jose Gregorio
Garcia is part
of the Anu indigenous group, who
live in the

31:50.075 --> 31:51.576 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lake area.

31:51.610 --> 31:55.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Anu means people of the shore,
and fishing
has long been their sustenance.

31:55.147 --> 32:01.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But leaking oil is damaging
their livelihood;
15,000 barrels of oil have
spilled into the

32:01.153 --> 32:04.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lake in the last two months,
according to
the state oil company.

32:04.556 --> 32:08.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE GREGORIO GARCIA (through
translator):
There were species that we don't
see now.

32:08.994 --> 32:10.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We think it's because of the
contamination.

32:10.796 --> 32:15.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Shrimp are gone
completely, and
the lake's once-thriving blue
crab fishery

32:15.400 --> 32:17.135 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is also disappearing.

32:17.169 --> 32:20.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE GREGORIO GARCIA (through
translator):
The oil goes to the bottom of
the lake.

32:20.539 --> 32:22.274 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's where the crab is.

32:22.307 --> 32:26.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It migrates, or dies, or gets
covered with
petroleum, and when it's stained
like that,

32:26.311 --> 32:28.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
no one will buy it.

32:28.079 --> 32:33.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Oil wells have been
abandoned,
and production has slowed to a
13-year low.

32:33.051 --> 32:37.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That means money that was
supposed to be set
aside to stop oil spills has
dried up.

32:37.823 --> 32:42.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alfredo Dominguez, who checks
oil platforms
for the state company which
operates all the

32:42.861 --> 32:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
oil fields, says there's a lack
of everything,
equipment and the parts to fix
it and oversight

32:49.034 --> 32:50.101 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by management.

32:50.135 --> 32:52.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Plus, thieves have also wrecked
the infrastructure.

32:52.604 --> 32:57.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALFREDO DOMINGUEZ, Inspector
(through translator):
They rob cables from the oil
stations, bulbs,

32:57.609 --> 32:58.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
everything that can be melted
down.

32:58.877 --> 33:00.645 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They take apart the tubes.

33:00.679 --> 33:04.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The wells keep pumping and
sending the oil
to the station, but the cables
and tubes have

33:04.649 --> 33:07.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been cut, so the oil ruptures
and spills into
the lake.

33:07.419 --> 33:12.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: For decades, Lake
Maracaibo has
been a symbol of Venezuela's oil
wealth, but,

33:12.591 --> 33:14.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
today, it's in a state of decay.

33:15.026 --> 33:20.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Beneath us, there is a massive
network of
interlaced tubes transporting
oil and gas.

33:20.632 --> 33:23.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Locals refer to it as a bowl of
spaghetti.

33:23.201 --> 33:28.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But many of these tubes are old
and face a
lack of maintenance, and they
are leaking

33:28.707 --> 33:32.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
constantly small quantities of
both oil or
gas.

33:32.444 --> 33:38.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And the result is this.

33:38.250 --> 33:43.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back when oil was selling at
record prices
throughout the tenure of the
late President

33:43.288 --> 33:48.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and icon here Hugo Chavez, the
government
used oil revenues to try to
transform the

33:48.526 --> 33:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country and lift the poor out of
poverty,
says Carlos Munos Potella, a
petroleum economist

33:54.399 --> 33:56.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and an adviser to the nation's
central bank.

33:56.768 --> 34:00.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARLOS MUNOS POTELLA, Petroleum
Economist
(through translator): It started
a policy

34:00.972 --> 34:05.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that wasn't very productive in
economic terms,
but it was the payment of a
social debt.

34:05.777 --> 34:11.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Under Chavez, oil
revenues went
increasingly to funding social
programs, subsidizing

34:11.917 --> 34:13.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
food and building homes for the
poor.

34:13.919 --> 34:18.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARLOS MUNOS POTELLA (through
translator):
It was a revolution financed
with oil.

34:18.490 --> 34:23.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: But critics say the
government
didn't use any of the windfall
to maintain

34:23.461 --> 34:24.429 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
oil production.

34:24.462 --> 34:26.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It keeps dropping.

34:26.398 --> 34:32.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, with oil prices down, the
country has
racked up billions in unpaid
bills to contractors.

34:32.470 --> 34:35.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Billions more have gone missing
in corruption
schemes.

34:35.907 --> 34:42.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the oil industry is also
bleeding profits
to illegal gasoline smuggling
rackets.

34:42.180 --> 34:47.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nowhere is that more evident
than a few hours'
drive west to the border with
Colombia.

34:47.852 --> 34:53.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Old American cars are about all
you see in
the border towns of what is like
Venezuela's

34:53.658 --> 34:55.527 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Wild West.

34:55.560 --> 35:00.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shunned for being expensive
gas-guzzlers anywhere
else, here, their huge tanks are
in demand

35:00.899 --> 35:04.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to fill up with cheap gasoline
to smuggle
across the border.

35:04.302 --> 35:09.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is so heavily subsidized, a
gallon costs
a mere 3 cents.

35:09.140 --> 35:14.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But across the border, in
Colombia, a gallon
sells for 90 times that.

35:14.279 --> 35:18.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's in that margin of
profit that contraband
gasoline thrives.

35:18.450 --> 35:22.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The government estimates 100,000
barrels a
day are smuggled out.

35:22.887 --> 35:28.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That means smugglers are sucking
dry at least
$2 billion a year from the
country's coffers.

35:28.460 --> 35:33.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In order to help prevent that,
the border
between Venezuela and Colombia
closed last

35:33.264 --> 35:35.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

35:35.133 --> 35:39.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But smugglers are creating new
routes, using
unofficial border crossings, and
it's on remote

35:39.170 --> 35:46.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back roads like this one that
the flow of
gasoline continues.

35:46.711 --> 35:49.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It starts behind the high
concrete walls in
the town of

35:49.814 --> 35:54.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Paraguaipoa, where smugglers
pool gasoline
from various sources, including
the tanks

35:54.519 --> 35:56.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of those big American cars.

35:56.921 --> 36:01.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A smuggler agrees to take us on
the first
leg of his smuggling route, as
long as we

36:01.993 --> 36:03.962 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
don't reveal his identity.

36:03.995 --> 36:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is big business, very
lucrative, and
highly illegal.

36:07.799 --> 36:10.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He tells us we can't film
outside the truck.

36:10.268 --> 36:13.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If anyone notices us, it can put
everyone
at risk.

36:13.471 --> 36:18.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This area is filled with armed
groups, all
of whom have a stake in the
racket.

36:18.743 --> 36:25.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
Sometimes, drivers
will be tied up and killed.

36:25.950 --> 36:27.752 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It happens to helpers, too.

36:27.786 --> 36:30.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Soldiers get shot down, and
whoever falls,
falls.

36:30.422 --> 36:35.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NADJA DROST: In order to
traverse this frontier
land with their contraband
goods, smugglers

36:35.427 --> 36:40.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to pay off everyone, from
authorities
to rebels and other armed groups
from the

36:40.065 --> 36:41.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Colombian side.

36:42.000 --> 36:46.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): You
pay the military,
the national guard, the police,
the intelligence

36:46.137 --> 36:47.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
agency, military intelligence.

36:47.539 --> 36:50.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You even pay the Colombian
guerrillas.

36:50.308 --> 36:51.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everyone eats from this.

36:51.443 --> 36:52.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NADJA DROST: Colombian
paramilitaries, too,
he says.

36:52.944 --> 36:58.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): If you
don't pay,
you will get shot, at the least.

36:58.183 --> 37:02.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: We arrive at a
lake, where workers
line up empty barrels to tow
across, where

37:02.987 --> 37:07.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they will get filled at a
rudimentary gas
station, loaded onto trucks and
continue their

37:07.659 --> 37:10.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
journey to the other side of the
border.

37:10.261 --> 37:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many people live off this trade,
including
the military's national guard,
who we see

37:15.233 --> 37:20.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inspecting every vehicle, except
for trucks
with contraband gasoline, at a
checkpoint

37:20.839 --> 37:24.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a mere 10 miles before a closed
border crossing.

37:24.576 --> 37:29.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we peer out from behind our
tinted windows,
a local accompanying us explains
how contraband

37:29.948 --> 37:31.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
gets across here.

37:31.182 --> 37:33.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Those
civilians
are the moscas.

37:33.384 --> 37:38.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Moscas, flies, the
name given
to civilians buzzing around on
motorbikes

37:38.923 --> 37:43.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who act as a link between
smugglers and whichever
group they have to pay off.

37:43.361 --> 37:45.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here, it's the military.

37:45.396 --> 37:49.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): One of
them already
arranged everything and paid the
military,

37:49.968 --> 37:51.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so that these trucks can pass
through.

37:51.936 --> 37:58.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Truckload after
truckload, contraband
gasoline is waved on through by
the military.

37:58.343 --> 38:00.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Smuggling rackets keep draining
oil profits.

38:00.979 --> 38:03.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Oil wells in Lake Maracaibo
continue to decline.

38:03.781 --> 38:09.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the oil economy tumbles, and
pulls Venezuela
deeper into crisis, it draws
attention to

38:09.787 --> 38:14.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the perils of over-relying on
oil revenues
to prop up an economy.

38:14.425 --> 38:22.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Back on Lake Maracaibo,
fisherman Jose Gregorio
Garcia has benefited from oil's
bonanza years,

38:22.167 --> 38:27.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as well as suffered from too
much oil, contaminating
his fish supply.

38:27.205 --> 38:32.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Living shoreside of the
once-booming oil industry,
Garcia knows it has to change.

38:32.243 --> 38:36.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE GREGORIO GARCIA (through
translator):
We have seen what happens with
petroleum.

38:36.614 --> 38:38.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The price of oil rises, and it
falls.

38:38.917 --> 38:41.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have always lived off this,
the good price
of oil.

38:41.753 --> 38:43.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But we have to find an
alternative.

38:43.655 --> 38:48.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: For the "PBS
NewsHour," reporting
with Bruno Federico, I'm Nadja
Drost on Lake

38:48.393 --> 38:50.128 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Maracaibo.

38:50.161 --> 38:53.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: To hear more

story and our reporting from
Venezuela, check

conversation with
special correspondent Nadja
Drost.

38:57.335 --> 39:00.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's on our Facebook page,
Facebook.com/NewsHour.

39:00.772 --> 39:04.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now we go back to Gwen and Judy
in Philadelphia.

39:04.075 --> 39:07.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you, Hari.

39:07.879 --> 39:12.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are here at the convention
hall in Philadelphia,
as the roll call continues.

39:12.517 --> 39:18.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South Dakota has just put
Hillary Clinton
over the top, meaning that she
has won more

39:18.823 --> 39:24.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than the 2,382 delegate votes
she needed to
wrap up the nomination.

39:24.329 --> 39:30.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What started as a Twitter
hashtag in 2013
after the acquittal of George
Zimmerman for

39:30.335 --> 39:38.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the murder of Trayvon Martin has
grown into
an activist protest
organization, with increasing

39:38.309 --> 39:39.477 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
influence.

39:39.510 --> 39:41.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang has our report.

39:41.412 --> 39:49.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Less than 10 miles
from the Democratic
Convention, demonstrators remind
delegates,

39:49.320 --> 39:50.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
black lives matter.

39:50.622 --> 39:52.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WOMAN: They need to pay
attention to the will
of the people.

39:52.924 --> 39:56.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: We need a radical new
system, because
the one we have is broken, and
it's not working

39:56.060 --> 39:57.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for any of us here in America.

39:57.829 --> 40:02.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The issue of race
relations looms
over this presidential campaign,
driven by

40:02.400 --> 40:08.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the high-profile deaths of black
men and women
at the hands of police, which
triggered demonstrations

40:08.439 --> 40:10.608 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like this one.

40:10.642 --> 40:14.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just last week, Hillary Clinton
stressed her
commitment to the
African-American community

40:14.879 --> 40:17.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after police shootings in
Louisiana and Minnesota.

40:17.315 --> 40:21.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
We white Americans need to do a
better job

40:21.252 --> 40:28.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of listening when
African-Americans talk about
the seen and unseen barriers you
face every

40:28.893 --> 40:30.628 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
day.

40:30.662 --> 40:34.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: During the primaries,
Black Lives
Matter protesters confronted
both Clinton

40:34.299 --> 40:38.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and her rival, Vermont Senator
Bernie Sanders.

40:38.336 --> 40:40.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Representative Barbara Lee
understands their
demands.

40:40.672 --> 40:42.407 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

40:42.440 --> 40:43.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARBARA LEE (D), California:
Young people
involved in the Black Lives
Matter movement,

40:43.975 --> 40:48.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
they're holding us all
accountable to an agenda
to make this country better.

40:48.112 --> 40:51.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Shaun Harper is
director of the
Center for the Study of Race and
Equity in

40:51.783 --> 40:53.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Education at the University of
Pennsylvania.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SHAUN HARPER, Executive
Director, Center for
the Study of Race and Equity in
Education,

40:55.586 --> 40:58.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
University of Pennsylvania: I
think that,
from that moment onward, that
both Senator

40:58.456 --> 41:05.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders and Secretary Clinton
understood this
is a movement to be taken
seriously.

41:05.096 --> 41:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Retaliation against
the police
has created a tension between
supporting the

41:09.434 --> 41:13.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
victims of police shootings and
supporting
law enforcement.

41:13.204 --> 41:16.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang in Philadelphia.

41:16.774 --> 41:23.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Jordan Davis was 17
years old
when he was shot and killed in
2012.

41:23.381 --> 41:27.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His assailant claimed Davis and
his friends
were playing their music too
loud.

41:27.919 --> 41:32.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His mother, Lucia McBath, and
six other mothers
who have lost children to gun
violence will

41:32.390 --> 41:36.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
appear together on the
convention stage tonight.

41:36.194 --> 41:38.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We spoke with her a short time
ago.

41:38.496 --> 41:41.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lucia McBath, thank you so much
for joining
us.

41:41.466 --> 41:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LUCIA MCBATH, Mother of Shooting
Victim: Thank
you for having me.

41:42.467 --> 41:43.701 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Talk about your son.

41:43.735 --> 41:45.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And talk about your reason for
being on the
stage tonight.

41:45.670 --> 41:51.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have been -- our country has
been so caught
up in a discussion about law
enforcement vs.

41:51.142 --> 41:52.944 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
police abuse.

41:52.977 --> 41:56.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even though your son wasn't
a victim,
wasn't quite in that mix, what
-- how have

41:56.881 --> 41:58.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you been watching this unfold?

41:58.249 --> 42:01.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LUCIA MCBATH: Oh, well, it's
been disheartening,
of course.

42:01.719 --> 42:07.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we're beginning to
recognize is that,
you know, gun violence is in
many, many forms,

42:07.825 --> 42:13.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, whether it's law
enforcement on
individual citizens, or if it's
individual

42:13.197 --> 42:17.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
citizens that are gunning down
law enforcement,
or if it's just, you know,
black-on-black

42:17.935 --> 42:18.870 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
crime.

42:18.903 --> 42:20.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It comes in all forms.

42:20.605 --> 42:25.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's very disheartening to
continue to
watch this evolve and erupt over
and over

42:25.276 --> 42:29.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and over again, because I know
firsthand,
as a victim of gun violence,
what this does,

42:29.947 --> 42:33.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not only to the victims, but to
the families
and their communities at large.

42:33.751 --> 42:37.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You have chosen
to endorse
Hillary Clinton.

42:37.255 --> 42:39.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're here to support Hillary
Clinton.

42:39.791 --> 42:41.559 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She's running for president.

42:41.592 --> 42:46.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So much of criminal justice,
though, occurs
-- these decisions occur at the
local level.

42:46.230 --> 42:47.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What difference can a president
make?

42:47.732 --> 42:51.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LUCIA MCBATH: Well, absolutely,
a president
has the heart of the people.

42:51.469 --> 42:53.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the president -- we follow
the lead of
the president.

42:53.805 --> 42:57.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the president has a heart for
what's happening
in the nation, a heart for
people, wanting

42:57.842 --> 43:03.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to create and stimulate change
for the better,
preserving human life, then I
believe policy

43:03.748 --> 43:08.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will fall right in under the
heels of the
changes that the president puts
in place for

43:08.853 --> 43:10.321 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the nation.

43:10.354 --> 43:11.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You talk about the
-- what the
president can put in place.

43:11.956 --> 43:16.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You are also involved in my
Brother's Keeper
Initiative at the White House.

43:16.360 --> 43:20.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I guess we who cover
Washington sometimes
see a lot of talk, and not a
whole lot of

43:20.998 --> 43:22.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
action.

43:22.233 --> 43:24.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just wonder why you think
this might
be different.

43:24.469 --> 43:29.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUCIA MCBATH: Well, I know this
will be different,
because I know Secretary Clinton
has been

43:29.373 --> 43:35.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doing this work, championing for
human and
civil right within the
communities and the

43:35.046 --> 43:36.280 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nation at large.

43:36.314 --> 43:38.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's been doing this even
before she became
first lady.

43:38.816 --> 43:40.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's been doing it as Senator
Clinton.

43:40.785 --> 43:42.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's been doing it as secretary
of state.

43:42.753 --> 43:44.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So her record is firm.

43:44.555 --> 43:48.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it stands to reason that she
would continue
to serve and do what she's been
doing all

43:48.926 --> 43:49.894 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
along.

43:49.927 --> 43:51.028 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, I have hope.

43:51.062 --> 43:53.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I know that she has -- she's a
great visionary.

43:53.865 --> 43:58.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I understand that she really
is putting
in place some good measures,
solid measures

43:59.003 --> 44:01.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that will really be of the best
interests
of the nation.

44:01.305 --> 44:06.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Gwen mentioned
that this is
more than just about the role of
law enforcement,

44:06.410 --> 44:08.112 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
police.

44:08.145 --> 44:12.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republican Convention, a big
part of their
message was they need to respect
the role

44:12.116 --> 44:13.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of police officers.

44:13.985 --> 44:19.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you strike that balance
between saying
police need to not discriminate
when it comes

44:19.156 --> 44:23.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to dealing with black men and
women, but,
on the other hand, making sure
there's a respect

44:23.928 --> 44:25.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the role of police?

44:25.630 --> 44:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUCIA MCBATH: Well, I think it's
a matter
of retraining and reeducating on
both sides,

44:29.467 --> 44:33.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
citizens within the community
learning to
respect -- have a healthy
respect and regard

44:33.604 --> 44:35.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for police officers as our
protectors.

44:36.007 --> 44:42.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at the same -- the same
measures, making
sure that our police are
reeducated, so that

44:42.513 --> 44:47.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're able to understand
different cultures
and races and ethnicities.

44:47.118 --> 44:50.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And also, I think, too, that we
should have
police officers that actually
live within

44:50.988 --> 44:53.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those various communities that
are serving
those individuals.

44:53.558 --> 44:59.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that sets up a
better environment
for relation-building --
relationship-building,

44:59.463 --> 45:01.265 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bridge-building.

45:01.299 --> 45:04.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's going to take a
lot of effort
within the community,
constituents within

45:04.335 --> 45:09.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the community, as well as the
police enforcement,
to really build those bridges.

45:09.106 --> 45:11.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's going to be a work on both
ends.

45:11.542 --> 45:13.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We saw Michael
Jordan, the retired
basketball player, trying...

45:14.011 --> 45:15.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LUCIA MCBATH: Yes.

45:15.880 --> 45:17.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: ... to strike that
balance yesterday
with the million-dollar gift to
the NAACP

45:17.281 --> 45:20.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Legal Defense Fund and a
million-dollar gift
to the chiefs of police.

45:20.718 --> 45:22.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it seems like that is the
middle ground.

45:22.253 --> 45:24.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LUCIA MCBATH: Absolutely.

45:24.188 --> 45:27.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I want to end here
by asking you
to tell us a little bit about
your son, Jordan,

45:27.291 --> 45:30.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and what he would think about
you being such
a public figure now.

45:30.294 --> 45:33.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUCIA MCBATH: Thank you for
giving me the
opportunity to talk about
Jordan, because

45:33.931 --> 45:37.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just -- it helps me to keep
him alive.

45:37.468 --> 45:39.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jordan was a child of inclusion.

45:40.004 --> 45:41.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He loved everybody.

45:41.539 --> 45:43.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He used to bring children
together.

45:43.274 --> 45:49.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I always say that the jock, the
nerdy kid,
the athlete, he brought them all
together.

45:49.647 --> 45:54.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jordan wanted to make sure that
everyone had
the same rights, the same
abilities to do

45:54.819 --> 45:57.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and to live the way he was
living.

45:57.154 --> 46:00.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was always the kind of child
that wanted
to include everyone.

46:00.224 --> 46:06.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I say that, as a single mother
for 13 years,
I had an SUV full of kids all
the time.

46:06.964 --> 46:11.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Jordan wanted to make sure
that everybody
was loved, accepted and
forgiven.

46:11.902 --> 46:16.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think he would be proud of
me, because
I'm getting to walk out the very
things I

46:16.974 --> 46:18.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was trying to teach him.

46:18.876 --> 46:22.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally,
Lucia McBath,
it seems important to you to
keep this connection

46:22.313 --> 46:23.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with the other mothers.

46:23.314 --> 46:25.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LUCIA MCBATH: Absolutely, yes.

46:25.116 --> 46:28.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I guess be
stronger as
a group than you can be as one
individual.

46:28.552 --> 46:30.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LUCIA MCBATH: Absolutely.

46:30.454 --> 46:33.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Secretary Clinton did say to
us -- I specifically
asked her in that very first
meeting that

46:33.624 --> 46:35.126 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we had with her.

46:35.159 --> 46:37.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I said: "I think you know that
you have the
support of all the mothers here.

46:37.895 --> 46:39.830 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is it we can do for you?

46:39.864 --> 46:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is it you would like us to
do?

46:42.933 --> 46:44.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you see for us?"

46:44.769 --> 46:47.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she said: "Individually, all
of you are
so strong, and you're all
working within your

46:48.005 --> 46:49.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
communities and across the
nation.

46:49.774 --> 46:55.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would be so powerful if you
would come
together as one united force for
the movement

46:55.446 --> 46:56.681 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this nation."

46:56.714 --> 47:01.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the campaign has deemed us
the mothers
of the movement.

47:01.419 --> 47:06.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're very, very grateful to
be able to
act on her behalf for the
nation.

47:06.190 --> 47:09.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Lucia McBath, one of
the mothers

47:14.865 --> 47:18.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it looks like the states are
just about
finished with the roll call.

47:18.803 --> 47:21.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to down to the floor
