JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:05.873 --> 00:07.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
The GOP wrestles with Donald
Trump -- a look

00:11.812 --> 00:17.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
at the divisions among
Republicans, as the
presumptive nominee prepares to
sit down with

00:17.184 --> 00:19.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Speaker Paul Ryan tomorrow.

00:19.052 --> 00:23.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Wednesday:
instability in Afghanistan, as
the fight rages

00:23.924 --> 00:26.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on against the Taliban in
Helmand Province.

00:26.293 --> 00:32.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And testing
transportation
that may be in our future. Miles
O'Brien explores

00:32.366 --> 00:37.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Hyperloop and visits the
people working
to make high-speed tube rides a
reality.

00:38.005 --> 00:42.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROGAN BAMBROGAN, Hyperloop One:
We're talking
grandma-friendly, dog-friendly,
child-friendly.

00:42.075 --> 00:47.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's absolutely just a simple
elevator ride
away. You get in, and you arrive
at your destination.

00:47.681 --> 00:49.016 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Ding.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:50.817 --> 00:55.088 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:55.122 --> 01:07.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Baghdad was
rocked today
by the worst violence this year.
Three car

01:07.467 --> 01:13.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bombings killed at least 93
people and wounded
165 more. All of the attacks
were claimed

01:13.740 --> 01:17.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by the Islamic State group.

01:17.110 --> 01:21.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sirens blared throughout much of
a long and
bloody day in the Iraqi capital.
The first

01:21.848 --> 01:27.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attack was the worst. A truck
bomb exploded
at a busy market in Sadr City, a
mainly Shiite

01:27.554 --> 01:32.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
district. The blast left
burned-out cars,
charred wreckage and smoldering
shops and

01:32.993 --> 01:35.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
crews washing down the streets.

01:35.195 --> 01:39.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): You
can see blood
everywhere. They were poor
people who were

01:39.433 --> 01:43.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here to earn their living and
were killed
in cold blood.

01:43.136 --> 01:48.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Witnesses say
the victims
included brides and grooms-to-be
at a beauty

01:48.075 --> 01:51.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
salon and barber shop getting
ready for their
weddings.

01:51.712 --> 01:56.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And hours later, two more
bombings, one at
a police station in the north
and another

01:56.416 --> 02:02.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the western side of the city,
all of this
on a day when Iraqi officials
announced ISIS

02:02.622 --> 02:09.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now controls 14 percent of the
country, down
from 40 percent in 2014.

02:09.596 --> 02:14.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The commander of U.S. ground
forces in the
anti-ISIS campaign said the
group is clearly

02:14.534 --> 02:16.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the defensive.

02:16.370 --> 02:19.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAJ. GEN. GARY VOLESKY, U.S.
Army: As the
enemy loses more and more
terrain, they resort

02:19.239 --> 02:24.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to some of these desperate acts.
The security
forces in Baghdad have the
situation under

02:24.277 --> 02:26.079 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
control.

02:26.113 --> 02:28.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But for many
in Baghdad,
the bombings are in fact proof
that security

02:28.281 --> 02:31.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
forces do not have things under
control.

02:31.051 --> 02:36.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): They
say that they
have metal detectors to detect
explosives.

02:36.089 --> 02:38.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where are they? How can such car
bombs go
though checkpoints?

02:38.825 --> 02:43.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It's all
fueling deep resentment
of the Iraqi government, as
political leaders

02:43.230 --> 02:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
remain distracted by a struggle
over fighting
corruption.

02:46.633 --> 02:52.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Islamic State
fighters in Syria
are also advancing again on the
ancient city

02:52.506 --> 02:58.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Palmyra. Activists report
ISIS seized a
deserted rocket-launching site
about 40 miles

02:58.879 --> 03:05.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
away, cutting a highway to Homs,
the provincial
capital. The militants destroyed
temples and

03:05.085 --> 03:12.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other treasures dating back
1,800 years during
a 10-month occupation.
Government troops recaptured

03:12.392 --> 03:14.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Palmyra in March.

03:14.161 --> 03:17.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: ISIS is losing
its allure
for Americans, according to the
head of the

03:17.964 --> 03:22.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FBI. James Comey said today the
number trying
to join the group has fallen to
about one

03:22.335 --> 03:26.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a month. That's down from six to
10 a month
in the previous year-and-a-half.

03:26.173 --> 03:32.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Brazil,
senators debated
today whether to suspend
President Dilma Rousseff

03:32.112 --> 03:38.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on charges she violated budget
laws. A simple
majority of the 81 lawmakers
could remove

03:38.552 --> 03:42.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rousseff for up to six months,
pending a trial
that might make it permanent.

03:42.889 --> 03:48.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANA AMELIA, Brazilian Senator
(through translator):
This event and this moment in
history show

03:48.428 --> 03:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
once again that no one, not even
a president
of the republic, is above the
law. The law

03:53.133 --> 03:57.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is for all, and we have the
obligation and
duty of respecting it. And that
is exactly

03:57.304 --> 03:59.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
why I will give my vote for the
impeachment.

03:59.339 --> 04:04.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Brazil is facing
its worst
economic downturn in decades and
a sweeping

04:04.978 --> 04:10.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
corruption scandal. Members of
Rousseff's
ruling party argued today she's
being made

04:10.117 --> 04:12.052 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the scapegoat.

04:12.085 --> 04:15.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAULO PAIM, Brazilian Senator
(through translator):
Let's say that she is removed
permanently.

04:15.455 --> 04:19.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What will happen? It will not
solve the crisis.
The crisis will only be solved
by elections.

04:19.993 --> 04:23.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why I say that the ideal
for Brazil
would be to call for elections,
together with

04:23.797 --> 04:25.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the mayoral elections on October
2.

04:25.632 --> 04:30.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: If the Senate
votes tonight
to suspend Rousseff, the
country's vice president

04:30.036 --> 04:31.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will become acting president.

04:31.872 --> 04:35.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Back in this
country, a
Colorado judge ruled today that
the man accused

04:35.375 --> 04:39.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of attacking a Planned
Parenthood clinic in
Colorado is not mentally fit to
stand trial.

04:39.679 --> 04:44.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, Robert Lewis Dear will
undergo treatment
at a state psychiatric hospital
until he's

04:45.018 --> 04:49.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deemed competent. Dear allegedly
killed three
people and wounded nine others
at a clinic

04:49.656 --> 04:53.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in Colorado Springs last
November. He's charged
with murder and attempted
murder.

04:53.994 --> 04:58.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A former police
officer in
South Carolina, Michael Slager,
now faces

04:58.732 --> 05:03.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
federal civil rights charges, in
addition
to state murder charges, for a
shooting that

05:03.870 --> 05:08.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
left an unarmed black man dead.
The indictment
was unsealed today in
Charleston.

05:08.742 --> 05:14.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Slager allegedly fired eight
times as Walter
Scott ran from a traffic stop
last year. Cell

05:14.981 --> 05:19.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
phone video captured the
incident. Slager
remains free on bail.

05:19.252 --> 05:24.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There'll be no
more payday
lending ads on Google starting
in July. The

05:24.758 --> 05:28.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Internet giant says it's banning
the ads because
the industry is -- quote --
"deceptive and

05:28.695 --> 05:33.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
harmful," often charging
triple-digit interest.
Google dominates Internet
searches and controls

05:33.533 --> 05:35.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Internet's largest
advertising platforms.

05:35.569 --> 05:40.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It was easy come,
easy go on
Wall Street today. Retail stocks
dragged the

05:40.874 --> 05:46.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rest of the market down, erasing
almost all
of yesterday's gains, the most
in two months.

05:47.013 --> 05:54.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 217
points to close at 17711. The
Nasdaq fell

05:54.454 --> 05:57.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
49 points, and the S&amp;P 500
dropped nearly
20.

05:57.824 --> 06:02.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And a small
painting that
turned up in a basement and
turned out to

06:02.062 --> 06:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be a Rembrandt went on display
today at the
Getty Museum in Los Angeles.
It's titled "The

06:06.766 --> 06:11.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unconscious Patient," and it's
one of the
Dutch master's earliest works.
Two people

06:11.871 --> 06:16.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
found it last summer as they
cleaned out their
family's home in New Jersey. No
word on how

06:16.076 --> 06:17.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the painting got there.

06:18.011 --> 06:21.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Donald Trump
prepares to meet with Speaker
Paul Ryan. Can

06:21.915 --> 06:28.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they find common ground?;
Taliban gains in
Afghanistan's largest
opium-producing region;

06:28.455 --> 06:36.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
public transportation that goes
up to 800
miles per hour; and much more.

06:37.030 --> 06:48.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now the latest
from the presidential
campaign:

06:48.074 --> 06:53.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Republicans showed some
tentative signs today
of trying to unify, ahead of a
closely watched

06:53.179 --> 06:54.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sit-down in Washington.

06:54.714 --> 06:57.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House:
Anyone have any questions?

06:57.617 --> 06:59.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUESTION: Mr. Speaker?

06:59.452 --> 07:02.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For the speaker
of the House,
Paul Ryan, the questions at the
Capitol this

07:02.455 --> 07:09.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
morning were all about Donald
Trump. The party's
presumptive presidential nominee
meets tomorrow

07:09.496 --> 07:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the nation's most powerful
elected Republican.

07:13.667 --> 07:19.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, Ryan said he wasn't
ready to support
Trump. Today, he said he's
trying to be -- quote

07:19.739 --> 07:21.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
-- "as constructive as
possible."

07:21.875 --> 07:26.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN: We come from
different wings
of the party. The goal here is
to unify the

07:26.179 --> 07:29.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
various wings of the party
around common principles,
so we can go forward unified.

07:29.716 --> 07:35.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For his part,
Trump also played
down any rift with Ryan this
morning when

07:35.455 --> 07:37.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he phoned into FOX News.

07:37.357 --> 07:39.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
And I have a lot of respect for
Paul Ryan.

07:39.125 --> 07:43.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we make a deal, that will be
great. And
if we don't, we will trudge
forward like I

07:43.363 --> 07:45.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been doing, and winning,
you know, all
the time.

07:45.899 --> 07:52.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Trump easily won
yesterday's
GOP primaries in West Virginia
and Nebraska,

07:52.839 --> 07:58.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
while West Virginia's Democratic
voters handed
a primary victory to Bernie
Sanders. That

07:58.712 --> 08:04.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did little to cut Hillary
Clinton's big lead
in delegates, but Sanders was
undeterred.

08:04.050 --> 08:09.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
Let me be as clear as I can be.
We are in

08:09.389 --> 08:11.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this campaign to win the
Democratic nomination.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

08:13.860 --> 08:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton kept her
focus on Trump,
as she campaigned today in
Camden County,

08:20.333 --> 08:23.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New Jersey, one of the states
voting June
7.

08:23.603 --> 08:27.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I will stand up and fight for
and speak out

08:27.941 --> 08:29.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for every American that he
attacks and he
insults.

08:29.609 --> 08:31.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

08:31.411 --> 08:36.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: How do
you explain
to your children when someone
running for

08:36.216 --> 08:42.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president encourages people to
be beaten up,
encourages violence?

08:42.522 --> 08:47.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton also
challenged Trump
to release his tax returns. The
New York billionaire

08:47.861 --> 08:53.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said Tuesday he is waiting for
an audit of
his finances that won't be ready
before the

08:54.000 --> 08:56.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
November election.

08:56.703 --> 09:01.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No matter what comes out of his
meetings on
Capitol Hill tomorrow,
presumptive nominee

09:01.441 --> 09:05.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump has already created
deep divisions
within his own party.

09:05.912 --> 09:11.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We get two different Republican
viewpoints
on the future of the GOP from
strategist and

09:11.584 --> 09:18.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NBC News political analyst Mike
Murphy and
from Representative Raul
Labrador of Idaho.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gentlemen, we welcome both of
you.

09:20.360 --> 09:26.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The two of you do represent part
of the spectrum
of viewpoints inside the
Republican Party.

09:26.132 --> 09:28.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let me start with you,
Congressman Labrador.

09:28.601 --> 09:32.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why did you decide, coming from
where you
do, to support Donald Trump?

09:32.772 --> 09:36.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. RAUL LABRADOR (R), Idaho:
Well, it was
pretty simple. We have two
choices, unfortunately,

09:36.309 --> 09:39.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right now. We have Donald Trump
and we have
Hillary Clinton. I'm not going
to support

09:39.946 --> 09:43.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Hillary Clinton. I know
everything that she's
going to do. I know the kind of
people that

09:43.316 --> 09:46.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she's going to nominate to the
Supreme Court.
I know the kind of people that
are going to

09:46.953 --> 09:48.721 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be her V.P.s.

09:48.755 --> 09:51.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know the kind of people that
are going to
be on her Cabinet. And I know
the policies

09:51.691 --> 09:55.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that she's going to push. With
Donald Trump,
at least we have an opportunity
to work with

09:55.895 --> 10:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him and we have an opportunity
to sit down
with him. And he's going to try
to do some

10:00.233 --> 10:02.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
things that Republicans want.

10:02.035 --> 10:07.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it was a pretty simple
decision. Donald
Trump wasn't even on my top 10
list of people

10:07.607 --> 10:12.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that I wanted for the
nomination. But now
he won the nomination fair and
square, and

10:12.145 --> 10:14.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it's time for all of us
to unify.

10:14.214 --> 10:21.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mike Murphy,
you're a Republican
who has probably never supported
a Democrat,

10:21.054 --> 10:24.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but why isn't Donald Trump
someone you can
get -- you can go along with?

10:25.024 --> 10:27.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE MURPHY, Republican
Strategist: Well,
to be clear, I'm not supporting
Hillary Clinton.

10:27.927 --> 10:29.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think she would be an awful
president.

10:29.829 --> 10:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem is, I know Trump
would be an awful
president, too, and to support
him, in my

10:33.399 --> 10:37.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
view, crosses a moral line and
sells out every
principle our party believes in.
He is not

10:37.770 --> 10:41.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a conservative. He is not a good
businessman.
I don't think he believes in
anything other

10:41.908 --> 10:45.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than himself. And he is not
qualified to be
president of the United States,
both by some

10:45.512 --> 10:51.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the things he's said and by
the clear lack
of comprehension he has on a lot
of complicated,

10:51.451 --> 10:53.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
important issues.

10:53.353 --> 10:56.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So Republicans like me are going
to be focusing
down-ballot, where we have a
Senate to reelect,

10:56.956 --> 11:00.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and House races and
gubernatorial races we
care a lot about, but no way I
am going to

11:00.827 --> 11:02.629 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
vote for Trump.

11:02.662 --> 11:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman
Labrador, let's
just tackle part of that. We
heard Mike Murphy

11:06.799 --> 11:08.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say he's not qualified to be
president.

11:08.935 --> 11:13.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. RAUL LABRADOR: You know, he
might not
be qualified. That's up to the
people to decide

11:13.907 --> 11:15.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
whether he's qualified or not.

11:15.675 --> 11:21.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the reality is that we know
what makes
Hillary Clinton disqualified.
And on this

11:21.147 --> 11:25.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
race, we only have two choices.
I'm also going
to be concentrating down-ballot.
I'm also

11:25.051 --> 11:29.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be worried about the
Senate and the
House. But the reality is that
we have a very

11:29.188 --> 11:33.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
important decision that needs to
be made about
who the next Supreme Court
justice is.

11:33.126 --> 11:36.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is only one person who is
going to make
that decision, and it's going to
be the next

11:36.496 --> 11:41.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president of the United States.
So I'm hoping
that we can influence Donald
Trump to pick

11:41.434 --> 11:45.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the right person for the Supreme
Court, to
pick the right person to be his
vice president.

11:45.838 --> 11:48.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All those are very important
decisions.

11:48.441 --> 11:53.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even though I disagree with
him a lot,
I think I'm going to disagree
with Hillary

11:53.112 --> 11:54.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Clinton a lot more.

11:54.814 --> 11:58.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why isn't that an
argument
to at least try to work with
Donald Trump,

11:58.484 --> 12:00.286 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mike Murphy?

12:00.320 --> 12:02.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE MURPHY: Well, because
everything we know
about Trump's history, which
tends to predict

12:02.855 --> 12:04.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the future, is bad.

12:04.657 --> 12:09.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's been a liberal Democrat.
He's pretended
to be a conservative. The
Supreme Court is

12:09.662 --> 12:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
important, but Trump will put
Gary Busey on
it. I mean, he's totally
uncontrollable. So

12:13.766 --> 12:19.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taking a 100-to-1 bet that the
one issue Trump
will be trustworthy and
responsible on is

12:19.639 --> 12:23.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Supreme Court in exchange
for handing
him the presidency -- although,
frankly, I

12:23.209 --> 12:26.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think he can't win and he's
going to bring
disaster to the party
nonetheless -- I think

12:26.512 --> 12:28.214 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is a fool's bet.

12:28.247 --> 12:31.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the moral compromise you
have to make
to support a guy like that is a
price too

12:31.384 --> 12:37.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
high to pay. The Republican
Party can outlast
four years of Hillary Clinton if
we have to

12:37.123 --> 12:42.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and rebuild a party that is
worth voting for
in four years. I don't like the
idea of Hillary

12:42.061 --> 12:45.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton as president, but I just
abhor Trump
too much to support him.

12:45.365 --> 12:48.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman
Labrador, just
today or yesterday, Donald Trump
said once

12:48.735 --> 12:53.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
again he stands by his comments
that Senator
John McCain is not a hero for
having been

12:53.840 --> 12:58.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shot down in North Vietnam,
having served
as a prisoner of war. Is that
something you're

12:58.444 --> 13:00.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
comfortable with?

13:00.346 --> 13:02.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. RAUL LABRADOR: You know, I
am not comfortable
with a lot of things that Donald
Trump said.

13:02.415 --> 13:06.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, I have said that he
needs to grow
up. He acts like a child many
times. There

13:06.386 --> 13:11.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are many things that he has to
do. But I can
tell you for sure that I know
that what Hillary

13:11.157 --> 13:14.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton is going to do is going
to be bad
for the United States. With
Trump, at least

13:14.961 --> 13:18.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have an opportunity, and I
don't think
you need to make a moral
compromise.

13:18.264 --> 13:23.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What you need to say is, I'm
going to vote
for a person, but I'm also going
to hold him

13:23.069 --> 13:27.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
accountable. Maybe for the first
time, Congress
starts acting like Congress. I
think too many

13:27.473 --> 13:32.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
times, we put on our jerseys and
Republican
members of Congress actually go
with the Republican

13:32.278 --> 13:36.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
president and allow the
Republican president
to do things that they shouldn't
be doing.

13:36.315 --> 13:41.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the Democrats do the
same thing.
Maybe, for once, the Republicans
in Congress

13:41.421 --> 13:45.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will actually stand up to a
president of their
own party, and I think that's
pretty healthy.

13:45.792 --> 13:50.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I don't think I have to have
any moral
compromise. I actually have to
make sure that

13:50.129 --> 13:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I hold him accountable, just
like I held Barack
Obama accountable.

13:53.866 --> 13:57.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mike Murphy, what
about holding
Donald Trump accountable?

13:57.770 --> 14:02.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE MURPHY: Well, I have to
admit I'm amused
that the first time I think in
his political

14:02.075 --> 14:07.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
career that Congressman Labrador
has ever
talked about compromise is to
sell our party

14:07.246 --> 14:09.415 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out to a guy like Donald Trump.

14:09.449 --> 14:14.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact is, Trump is a wild
card. I mean,
this is presidential politics.
We're not electing

14:14.454 --> 14:19.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a second-class ward heeler in a
city here.
This is the big job. This
defines who we are

14:19.325 --> 14:24.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in our party. And to roll over
for that and
the idea that now you have a
Republican president

14:24.797 --> 14:29.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you can oppose, instead of a
Democratic president
you can oppose, is specious to
me. I don't

14:29.535 --> 14:31.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
buy that logic one bit.

14:31.304 --> 14:34.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman
Labrador, I want
you to respond to that and also
to this new

14:34.140 --> 14:39.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
controversy that's arisen,
Donald Trump saying
yesterday that he will not
release his tax

14:39.312 --> 14:41.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
returns before the election
after all.

14:41.814 --> 14:46.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Mitt Romney put out a
statement saying
that's a disqualifier for the
Republican Party

14:46.886 --> 14:48.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nominee for president.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. RAUL LABRADOR: You know,
it's funny to
have Mike Murphy actually talk
to me about

14:50.990 --> 14:56.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
compromise. I'm actually the
leader in the
House on any kind of compromise
on criminal

14:56.229 --> 15:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
justice reform. I have been
working on immigration
reform. I'm actually working on
the Puerto

15:00.266 --> 15:02.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Rico bill right now.

15:02.034 --> 15:05.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it shows that he's pretty
ignorant about
who I am and the things that I
stand for.

15:05.671 --> 15:08.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just because I don't like the
things that
he wants to do to the party,
which is to make

15:08.941 --> 15:13.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it a centrist party that stands
for nothing,
I think, is one of the problems
that we have,

15:13.813 --> 15:17.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it's the main reason that we
have Donald
Trump right now, is because
people like Mike

15:17.083 --> 15:22.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Murphy who actually kept telling
us to capitulate
to this president, to
compromise, to do things

15:22.121 --> 15:25.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that went against our
principles, is why we
have Donald Trump.

15:25.558 --> 15:28.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Congressman
Labrador,
very quickly, I want to come
back to this

15:28.361 --> 15:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
question of tax returns. Does it
concern you
that Donald Trump will not
release them before

15:33.699 --> 15:35.434 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the election?

15:35.468 --> 15:37.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. RAUL LABRADOR: It does
concern me. There
are a lot of things that concern
me about

15:37.403 --> 15:41.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump. There is a lot of
issues that
he has said, that he has raised
that are concerning.

15:41.407 --> 15:46.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think his reaction to certain
people, it's
actually concerning. And I think
he should

15:46.379 --> 15:51.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
release his tax returns. I think
he's using
some excuse right now that he
can't do it

15:51.484 --> 15:55.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because he's under an audit. I
think that's
preposterous. I think he needs
to come clean.

15:55.221 --> 15:59.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the American people
need to know
more about him, if he wants to
win the election.

15:59.592 --> 16:00.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mike Murphy,
how...

16:00.760 --> 16:01.761 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIKE MURPHY: This, we agree.

16:01.794 --> 16:02.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Go ahead.

16:02.829 --> 16:04.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE MURPHY: I'm with the
congressman on this.

16:04.197 --> 16:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This tax thing is a huge issue,
and Trump
has to come clean on it.

16:07.366 --> 16:09.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Final thing for
both of you.

16:09.702 --> 16:15.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump's comments about
women, The Washington
Post ran just a few of them,
statements he's

16:15.341 --> 16:19.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
made years ago that were
derogatory toward
women.

16:19.612 --> 16:25.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congressman, I can't repeat any
of them here.
How do you accept that and still
support him?

16:25.618 --> 16:28.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. RAUL LABRADOR: You know, I
think he's
done a lot of things that are
terrible, but

16:28.654 --> 16:32.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Hillary Clinton has said
and done
a lot of things that are
terrible.

16:32.058 --> 16:36.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unfortunately, we're picking
between the lesser
of two evils. I wish we had a
nominee -- I

16:36.262 --> 16:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first supported Rand Paul. Then
I supported
Ted Cruz. I think if more people
in the party

16:41.067 --> 16:45.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would have gotten behind a real
constitutional
conservative like Ted Cruz, I
think we would

16:45.071 --> 16:46.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have a different conversation
right now.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. RAUL LABRADOR: But I am
going to choose
the person who I think will give
us the best

16:50.276 --> 16:53.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
possibility to have a Supreme
Court nominee
that can actually be good.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mike Murphy,
final word here.

16:55.882 --> 17:00.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE MURPHY: It is a choice
between two evils.
And the way you fight evil is to
never choose

17:00.620 --> 17:01.520 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will leave
it there.

17:03.522 --> 17:08.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mike Murphy joining us from Los
Angeles, Congressman
Raul Labrador joining us from
Capitol Hill,

17:08.394 --> 17:13.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we thank you both.

17:13.165 --> 17:25.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It's been 15
years since
the fight began in Afghanistan.
There are

17:25.111 --> 17:31.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
signs that the Taliban is now
strengthening
again. And ISIS is making its
presence felt,

17:31.250 --> 17:32.985 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
too.

17:33.019 --> 17:37.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. and NATO formally ended
their combat
mission in 2014, but thousands
of foreign

17:37.223 --> 17:39.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
troops remain to aid in the
fight.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're joined now by special
correspondent
Jennifer Glasse in Kabul.

17:42.728 --> 17:46.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jennifer, we have noticed an
increase in the
number of headlines about
violence, the car

17:46.832 --> 17:51.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
bombs and so forth from
Afghanistan. Put this
in perspective. How active is
this fighting?

17:51.203 --> 17:55.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Well, Hari, we
have seen
fighting around the country. The
Taliban announced

17:55.274 --> 17:57.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their spring offensive in April.

17:57.209 --> 18:01.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, we have seen
them fighting
in the north in Kunduz. There
was a large

18:01.914 --> 18:05.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attack here in Kabul about a
week after they
announced the spring offensive.
But just in

18:05.885 --> 18:11.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the last 10 days or so, we're
seeing an uptick
in fighting in their heartland,
in Helmand

18:11.290 --> 18:13.359 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the south of the country.

18:13.392 --> 18:18.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We spoke to people in Lashkar
Gah. That's
the provincial capital of
Helmand province.

18:18.998 --> 18:22.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are very concerned.
They say there's
been a lot of fighting,
especially in the

18:22.234 --> 18:27.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last nine or 10 days. They can
actually hear
the gunfire in the center of the
city.

18:27.373 --> 18:33.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say the Taliban have tried
to attack
a number of areas around the
city, in the

18:33.279 --> 18:37.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ring of security around the
city. They have
managed to take a few
checkpoints, and, yesterday,

18:37.817 --> 18:39.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
15 Afghan policemen were killed.

18:39.618 --> 18:42.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, so
it seems that
multiple forces here, Taliban on
one side,

18:42.621 --> 18:46.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
maybe ISIS on the other. Any
idea of the scale
of how large this opposition is?

18:46.692 --> 18:50.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: We don't know
exactly how
many fighters there are. The
Taliban claimed

18:50.529 --> 18:55.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to have thousands of fighters
ready to launch
an offensive this year.

18:55.368 --> 19:00.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They usually exaggerate their
numbers. What
is clear then is the Taliban can
inflict very,

19:00.706 --> 19:08.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very large damage. Last year,
Afghan security
forces took very heavy
casualties, 5,500 killed.

19:08.247 --> 19:13.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's about 15 a day, and 14 --
about 14,000
injured. That was 2015 alone,
and they're

19:13.886 --> 19:16.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bracing for another difficult
year.

19:16.255 --> 19:19.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Taliban have been effective
in the kind
of attacks they have carried
out. So, even

19:19.492 --> 19:23.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when they took Kunduz for three
days last
year, the first time they took a
city, they

19:23.596 --> 19:28.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only went in, stayed for three
days, and went
out. It really created a lot of
fear. It was

19:28.167 --> 19:32.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very effective, and yet they
have been able
to hold a lot of area in the
country.

19:32.938 --> 19:37.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And things have really picked up
just in the
last 10 days or so because it's
the end of

19:37.576 --> 19:42.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the poppy harvest season, the
opium harvest
season in the south. A lot of
Taliban fighters

19:42.948 --> 19:47.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take part in that opium harvest.
We're told
it's going to be a bumper crop.
And so, of

19:47.486 --> 19:49.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
course, that's a lot more money
for the Taliban.

19:49.889 --> 19:54.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As for ISIS, they are largely in
the east
of the country, and their
numbers are estimated

19:54.160 --> 19:57.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be in the hundreds, but it's
very hard
to tell.

19:57.496 --> 20:01.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How involved
is the American
military in these battles?

20:01.100 --> 20:05.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Well, there are
about 10,000
U.S. forces still here. They
have got two

20:05.304 --> 20:08.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
missions, train, advise, and
assist, and a
counterterrorism mission.

20:08.574 --> 20:13.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, we know that Afghan special
forces have
been fighting alongside Afghan
forces. We

20:13.846 --> 20:19.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just learned recently that in
the -- in Kunduz
last September and October, when
the Taliban

20:19.885 --> 20:26.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
took the city for three days,
American special
forces were fighting very
actively in Kunduz.

20:26.492 --> 20:31.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that there are also
American special
forces guiding Afghan special
forces in Helmand

20:31.263 --> 20:37.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
province, and about several
hundred, about
500 or more U.S. army troops
from the 10th

20:37.570 --> 20:41.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mountain Division are in Helmand
province
now. They got there in February.
Now, that's

20:41.741 --> 20:46.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a big mission. They're trying to
reform and
retrain the army 215 Corps.

20:46.579 --> 20:52.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They have fired all the
commanders and all
the leaders there. They are
trying to get

20:52.685 --> 20:58.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Afghans to be a little bit
more aggressive,
to get off checkpoints and to
engage the Taliban

20:58.557 --> 21:00.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more effectively.

21:00.292 --> 21:02.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, there has
also been
some change in military
leadership on the

21:02.294 --> 21:05.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American side. Has there been
any sort of
a strategy or a vision laid out
on what might

21:05.798 --> 21:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
change in the near future?

21:07.633 --> 21:12.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Well, we know
that the new
commander here, General
Nicholson, is conducting

21:12.171 --> 21:15.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a 90-day review as to what
should happen next.

21:15.307 --> 21:20.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, there are 9,800 U.S.
forces in
country. That right now is
scheduled to go

21:20.546 --> 21:27.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down to 5,500 by the end of the
year. And
we know that General Nicholson
is reviewing

21:27.386 --> 21:31.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, checking to see what is
going on here.
And he's expected to give
President Obama

21:31.724 --> 21:38.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his advice in the next month or
so, when he
finishes that review, as to
whether he believes

21:38.898 --> 21:42.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those forces should remain --
those 10,000
forces should remain in
Afghanistan.

21:42.701 --> 21:45.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Jennifer Glasse
joining us from Kabul tonight,
thanks so much.

21:45.905 --> 21:51.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Good to be with
you.

21:51.043 --> 21:59.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

21:59.919 --> 22:05.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
debate over
allowing transgender people in
the U.S. military;

22:05.958 --> 22:12.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
setbacks for the car-sharing
services Uber
and Lyft; and Mr. Darcy becomes
a neurosurgeon,

22:12.131 --> 22:15.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a modern retelling of "Pride and
Prejudice."

22:15.501 --> 22:21.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, we are kicking off a
weekly series
tonight that will expand our
coverage of science

22:21.807 --> 22:25.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and technology on our broadcast
and online.

22:25.110 --> 22:29.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our science correspondent Miles
O'Brien will
frequently be our guide on
Wednesdays, as

22:29.915 --> 22:35.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he reports on a wide variety of
subjects,
including the environment, space
and technology,

22:36.021 --> 22:39.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and takes us to the leading edge
of research
and thinking in these fields.

22:39.925 --> 22:45.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we start with an
ambitious dream
to create a tube-based
high-speed transportation

22:45.931 --> 22:53.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
system of the future, one that
would cost
billions. You may have heard of
it, the Hyperloop.

22:53.172 --> 22:54.506 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Here's Miles.

22:54.540 --> 22:59.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: No rest for the
weary on Saturday
mornings at MIT.

23:00.012 --> 23:04.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sandwiched cheek to jowl between
grad students
building a high-performance
electric race

23:04.383 --> 23:15.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
car and a solar-powered
endurance vehicle,
you will find the Hyperloop team
hard at work.

23:15.928 --> 23:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On this morning, they were
attaching the outer
shell, or fairing, for the first
time.

23:21.000 --> 23:26.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MAYO, MIT Hyperloop Team: I
trusted it
would fit. I trust our team. Our
team is really

23:26.405 --> 23:28.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
good. So, it's great to actually
see if there
on the pod.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Measure twice,
cut once, right?

23:29.541 --> 23:31.343 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JOHN MAYO: Yes.

23:31.377 --> 23:35.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: John Mayo is on
the cusp of
getting his master's in
mechanical engineering.

23:35.314 --> 23:41.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is project manager of a
30-member team
that he hopes is on the cusp of
helping devise

23:41.053 --> 23:47.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a fifth mode of transportation,
to take its
place beside planes, trains,
automobiles and

23:47.626 --> 23:49.628 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
boats.

23:49.662 --> 23:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hyperloop is a cross between the
pneumatic
tube you use at the drive-up
teller, an air

23:54.166 --> 23:59.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hockey table and a bullet train.
Oh, and throw
in Concorde too.

23:59.972 --> 24:05.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MAYO: One of the big
differentiators
here is that tube, because you
have less aerodynamic

24:05.110 --> 24:07.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
drag, so you can go faster with
less resistance.

24:07.813 --> 24:12.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: They are building
this scale
model to compete with about 30
other college

24:12.618 --> 24:17.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
teams in a totally tubular
challenge this
summer to demonstrate the best
prototype.

24:17.856 --> 24:22.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: The winning team, from the
Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, the MIT
Hyperloop

24:22.361 --> 24:24.129 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
team.

24:24.163 --> 24:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: They are the team
to beat after
winning the design phase earlier
this year

24:28.233 --> 24:38.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at Texas A&amp;M. The basic concept
is not new.
A short pneumatic train line was
built beneath

24:38.277 --> 24:44.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at Texas A&amp;M. The basic concept
is not new.
A short pneumatic train line was
built beneath

24:44.149 --> 24:50.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Manhattan in 1870, but the idea
was just a
novelty then, and has remained
in the realm

24:50.789 --> 24:56.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of George Jetson's
Dream-O-Vision ever since.

24:56.161 --> 25:03.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in 2013, this white paper
changed the
equation. It's a technical
description of

25:03.802 --> 25:09.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a supersonic Hyperloop that
would carry people
from Los Angeles to San
Francisco in about

25:09.241 --> 25:16.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
30 minutes, a proposal like this
would normally
be dismissed, but the author was
the real-life

25:16.248 --> 25:26.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iron Man, Elon Musk, the founder
of PayPal,
electric car manufacturer Tesla,
and SpaceX,

25:26.058 --> 25:33.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the private company that
launches rockets
into low-Earth orbit and,
lately, lands the

25:33.999 --> 25:38.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spent first stages onto small
barges in one
piece.

25:38.537 --> 25:47.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MAYO: Elon has his way of
making everybody
excited about these seemingly
outlandish ideas,

25:47.546 --> 25:51.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but we have all the technology
there to do
it. It's just, you need the
excitement and

25:51.283 --> 25:55.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you need some funding behind it
and you need
people to push it. And Elon is
the pusher.

25:55.587 --> 26:00.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: At that awards
ceremony in
College Station, Texas, the
pusher surprised

26:00.926 --> 26:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his pushees with an appearance.
He got a rocket
star welcome from his biggest
fans. It was

26:07.666 --> 26:09.501 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nerd nirvana.

26:09.535 --> 26:13.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELON MUSK, CEO, Tesla Motors:
It's clear that
the public and the world want
something new,

26:13.739 --> 26:18.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I think you guys are going
to bring it
them. So, congratulations. Yes.

26:18.343 --> 26:20.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

26:20.145 --> 26:24.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Musk says he was
disappointed
by California's high-speed rail
line between

26:24.416 --> 26:31.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Los Angeles and San Francisco
now under construction.
He believes the trains just
aren't good enough.

26:31.457 --> 26:35.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their advertised top speed? A
measly 220 miles
per hour.

26:35.794 --> 26:38.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELON MUSK: What inspired me is,
I was stuck
in L.A. traffic.

26:38.897 --> 26:40.632 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

26:40.666 --> 26:46.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELON MUSK: And I was an hour
late for a talk.
And I was thinking, man, there
has got to

26:47.005 --> 26:49.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be some better way to get
around.

26:49.041 --> 26:55.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: When Musk got
back to his desk,
he started doing the math. His
first thought,

26:55.380 --> 27:04.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those pneumatic tubes. But using
giant fans
to create a supersonic gust of
wind for 350

27:04.056 --> 27:10.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
miles would create way too much
friction.
So what if the tubes were sealed
up tight,

27:10.128 --> 27:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a vacuum, and the pods were
lifted with magnetic
levitation?

27:15.234 --> 27:19.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
With no friction or wind
resistance, there
would be nothing to stop the pod
from going

27:19.805 --> 27:28.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
extremely fast. But sealing a
350-mile-long
tube tight enough to hold a
vacuum is also

27:28.580 --> 27:31.216 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a nonstarter.

27:31.250 --> 27:37.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The MIT team believes magnetic
levitation
is the answer, but with no
vacuum required,

27:37.523 --> 27:43.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just very low air pressure
inside the tube.
They are testing arrays of
common magnets

27:43.595 --> 27:49.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that would levitate the pod over
an aluminum
track. The engineering
challenge? The magnets

27:49.334 --> 27:53.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
provide lift, but also drag.

27:53.171 --> 27:56.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Philippe Kirschen is an
aerospace and astronautics
grad student.

27:56.074 --> 27:59.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHILIPPE KIRSCHEN, MIT Hyperloop
Team: The
drag is just the price that you
pay. You can't

27:59.278 --> 28:03.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get the free lift, so you pay
the price in
drag, and our goal essentially
is just to

28:03.215 --> 28:06.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
minimize the drag.

28:06.118 --> 28:12.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Philippe is
betting his career
on this technology. As soon as
he graduates,

28:12.324 --> 28:19.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he will take a job at Los
Angeles-based Hyperloop
One, a leading start-up in this
new field.

28:19.998 --> 28:25.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Its co-founder and chief
technology officer
is former SpaceX engineer Brogan
BamBrogan.

28:25.604 --> 28:29.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROGAN BAMBROGAN, Hyperloop One:
It's going
to be absolutely
turbulence-free. It's going

28:29.041 --> 28:33.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be smooth. We're talking
grandma-friendly,
dog-friendly, child-friendly.
It's absolutely

28:33.612 --> 28:38.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just a simple elevator ride
away. You get
in, and you arrive at your
destination. Ding.

28:38.450 --> 28:45.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The hype over
Hyperloop One
has brought the company $100
million in investment.

28:45.624 --> 28:51.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while it's an important step
to demonstrate
its electric propulsion system
works, it's

28:51.463 --> 28:56.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
likely the journey to reality
will be a lot
slower than a speeding capsule.

28:56.401 --> 29:02.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In fact, one key
part of the
Hyperloop dream was put to the
test today.

29:02.641 --> 29:06.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just how viable the propulsion
system will
be?

29:06.478 --> 29:11.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Miles was there for that
demonstration, which
took place about 30 miles
outside Las Vegas,

29:11.950 --> 29:13.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and he joins me now.

29:13.318 --> 29:14.953 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome, Miles.

29:14.987 --> 29:18.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, tell us, what exactly were
they trying
to prove today, and how did it
go?

29:18.690 --> 29:22.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, I think if
you were to
put it in Wright brother terms,
this wasn't

29:22.461 --> 29:26.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Kitty Hawk powered flight
moment. This
was probably one of the glider
tests that

29:27.032 --> 29:30.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're less familiar with that
the Wright brothers
did before that moment.

29:30.569 --> 29:35.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was an opportunity for them
to test out
their linear electric motor,
which will help

29:35.440 --> 29:41.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drive this capsule eventually.
They went from
zero to about 105 miles per hour
in all of

29:41.380 --> 29:46.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about five seconds. It was a
success, but
in the grant scheme of things,
an incremental

29:46.885 --> 29:48.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
success with many more steps to
go.

29:48.854 --> 29:54.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what do the
owners of this
venture, what are they saying at
this point?

29:54.092 --> 29:57.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, they're
trying to attract
some investment, and they're
doing a pretty

29:57.529 --> 30:03.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
good job so far. They have got
about $100
million so far, attracting some
serious deep-pocketed

30:03.268 --> 30:04.970 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investors.

30:05.003 --> 30:09.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a lot of enthusiasm over
this idea,
and, thus far, what the
engineers tell me

30:09.574 --> 30:14.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, there's no technological
stumbling blocks
that they foresee. Where it
comes down to

30:14.346 --> 30:19.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are the meddlesome issues of
right of way
and finding a way to make the
tubes as straight

30:19.818 --> 30:23.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
as possible, because the
straighter it is,
the faster you go.

30:23.288 --> 30:27.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But that's going
to involve
some technology, too. So, I
mean, just how

30:27.159 --> 30:29.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
practical a thing are we talking
about?

30:29.494 --> 30:33.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: You know, it's
hard to say
right now, because there's a lot
of thing

30:33.832 --> 30:36.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that have to fall into place to
make this
happen.

30:36.568 --> 30:40.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Given the level of enthusiasm
that people
have and given the fact that
traffic's not

30:40.439 --> 30:46.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get anything better, the ideal
of traveling
350 miles in all of a half-hour
has quite

30:46.445 --> 30:51.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an allure. Getting the rights of
way, building
the tubes, making sure there
aren't too many

30:51.316 --> 30:57.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sharp turns, so it slows down so
much that
it ruins its allure, is really
something that

30:57.522 --> 31:02.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remains to be seen. But given
the enthusiasm,
you know, we have to say this is
something

31:02.260 --> 31:03.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to watch for now.

31:03.995 --> 31:07.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You know, Miles,
I have to
tell you, traveling in China
last year, I

31:07.632 --> 31:15.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rode on the maglev train in
Shanghai between
downtown and that city out to
its airport.

31:15.107 --> 31:19.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's only a matter of a few
miles, but it
went almost 300 miles an hour.
How different

31:19.878 --> 31:21.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is this from that?

31:21.747 --> 31:25.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It's basically
taking the train
you were on in Shanghai, which
is one of the

31:25.317 --> 31:30.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most -- the fastest, most
sophisticated maglevs
in the world, and putting it
inside a tube.

31:30.922 --> 31:36.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're essentially taking away
the resistance
of the air, for all intents and
purposes.

31:36.128 --> 31:38.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that allows you to pretty
much double
the speed.

31:38.430 --> 31:42.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Miles,
finally, we just
want to say we're looking
forward to seeing

31:42.100 --> 31:48.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you on Wednesdays going forward,
a new segment
we're calling The Leading Edge.
And I think

31:48.807 --> 31:50.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're all looking forward to
learning a lot
from you.

31:50.742 --> 31:54.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, Judy, I
guess you could
say I'm kind of hyper about this
experience.

31:54.813 --> 32:01.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm very excited to be back more
frequently
on the "NewsHour" doing science
reporting.

32:01.052 --> 32:03.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No one else is doing it like the
"NewsHour."

32:03.955 --> 32:08.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we look forward to your
suggestions. If
folks out there have any ideas
for science

32:08.994 --> 32:12.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and technology stories that we
can bring to
you, by all means, let us know.

32:12.898 --> 32:17.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Miles O'Brien,
it's great to
have you with us. Thank you.

32:17.903 --> 32:26.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: You're welcome,
Judy.

32:26.211 --> 32:32.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It's been
nearly a year
since the secretary of defense
declared the

32:32.617 --> 32:38.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
military's ban on transgender
soldiers -- quote
-- "outdated," but the Pentagon
has yet to

32:38.056 --> 32:41.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
issue any new directives,
despite deadlines.

32:41.526 --> 32:45.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
William Brangham explores what
it means to
be transgender in the armed
forces.

32:45.363 --> 32:50.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In 2014,
Lieutenant Blake
Dremann was going to be one of
the first women

32:50.101 --> 32:51.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to serve on a U.S. Navy
submarine.

32:51.903 --> 32:56.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. BLAKE DREMANN, U.S. Navy: We
got invited
to the White House, and this is
me with the

32:56.208 --> 32:58.376 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president and the first 24
females on a submarine.

32:58.410 --> 33:03.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But by the
time that vessel
launched in late 2013, Blake was
physically

33:03.215 --> 33:07.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
transitioning to the male
gender, and giving
himself weekly hormone
injections.

33:07.152 --> 33:09.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. BLAKE DREMANN: I took my
first shot the
week before we got under way,
and I took them

33:09.588 --> 33:11.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
under way with us.

33:11.356 --> 33:15.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Blake is a
transgender man.
His sex at birth was female, but
he's long

33:15.427 --> 33:17.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
identified himself as male.

33:17.229 --> 33:22.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. BLAKE DREMANN: I probably
knew when I
was like 5, right, that
something was amiss.

33:22.801 --> 33:28.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you grow up in the church,
you grow up
in Bible college, that type of
environment,

33:28.240 --> 33:30.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and you just learn to ignore it.

33:30.242 --> 33:34.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Blake is now
stationed at
the Pentagon. He says most of
the other officers

33:34.312 --> 33:36.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
treat him like any another
colleague.

33:36.248 --> 33:39.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. BLAKE DREMANN: The senior
officers have
been very receptive about it.
And I have talked

33:39.150 --> 33:43.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to all kinds of them for
sometimes an hour
or an hour-and-a-half at a time
just kind

33:43.989 --> 33:47.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of answering questions. And if
you ask, I'm
very open.

33:47.626 --> 33:51.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The tide has
slowly been
turning for transgender service
members like

33:51.463 --> 33:59.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Blake. Until last year, if a
soldier, sailor,
airman or Marine changed their
gender identity,

33:59.104 --> 34:04.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pentagon policy was to give them
a medical
disqualification and discharge
them from service.

34:04.075 --> 34:09.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was policy, but it wasn't
always strictly
enforced. But last July,
Secretary of Defense

34:09.214 --> 34:14.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Ash Carter stopped these
dismissals, and ordered
the Pentagon to draft plans to
allow transgender

34:14.653 --> 34:16.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people to serve openly.

34:16.788 --> 34:22.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that change came too late
for some. As
a man, Brynn Tannehill graduated
with honors

34:22.294 --> 34:27.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the Naval Academy in 1997.
She went on
to serve as a Navy pilot for
over a decade.

34:27.465 --> 34:30.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. CMDR. BRYNN TANNEHILL, U.S.
Navy Reserve:
I was flying an SH-60B
helicopter full of

34:30.835 --> 34:37.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sub hunting gear and surface
search radars
and infrared cameras. We could
carry anti-ship

34:37.275 --> 34:39.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
missiles and torpedoes.

34:39.077 --> 34:42.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: She served in
the Persian
Gulf and elsewhere. And after
leaving the

34:42.247 --> 34:45.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Navy, she joined the Reserves,
but she soon
realized she couldn't keep
flying.

34:46.017 --> 34:50.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. CMDR. BRYNN TANNEHILL: I
left the military
in 2010, left the Reserves,
because I was

34:50.255 --> 34:56.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dealing with gender dysphoria. I
was dealing
with the fact that I didn't
identify with

34:56.261 --> 34:58.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the gender I had been assigned
at birth.

34:58.296 --> 35:02.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: She's now a
military consultant.
In her free time, she makes her
own medieval-style

35:02.500 --> 35:06.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
body armor and participates in
popular one-on-one
mock combat.

35:06.671 --> 35:11.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gender dysphoria, according to
the current
thinking among mental health
professionals,

35:11.476 --> 35:16.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the real deep-seated sense
that the gender
you were born with isn't really
who you are.

35:16.982 --> 35:22.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A survey of over 6,000
transgender Americans
found that 20 percent -- that's
one in five

35:22.454 --> 35:27.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- had served in the military.
That's more
than twice the percentage of the
general population.

35:27.959 --> 35:33.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another study, by the UCLA
School of Law,
estimates that about 15,500
trans people serve

35:33.932 --> 35:39.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the U.S. armed forces, out of
a total force
of 1.5 million. The same study
found that

35:39.404 --> 35:44.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there are about 130,000 trans
veterans, out
of 22 million total veterans.

35:44.209 --> 35:46.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. GEORGE BROWN, East Tennessee
State University:
You have to live a double life.
You have to

35:46.344 --> 35:51.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
live secretly. And there are
many problems
that arrive out of that type of
existence.

35:51.816 --> 35:56.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: George Brown
is associate
chairman for veterans affairs at
East Tennessee

35:56.054 --> 36:01.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State University. He spent 15
years as an
Air Force psychiatrist. Since
the 1980s, Dr.

36:01.926 --> 36:06.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brown has treated hundreds of
transgender
soldiers, sailors, airmen and
Marines. And

36:06.598 --> 36:10.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's developed a theory about
why so many
trans men and women serve.

36:10.969 --> 36:14.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. GEORGE BROWN: Ninety percent
of the people
I interviewed would say, you
know, when I

36:14.672 --> 36:19.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was 17, 18, 19 years old, I knew
there was
something different about
myself, and I really

36:19.277 --> 36:22.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wanted to run away from this.
And I thought,
if I joined the military, I
could become a

36:22.947 --> 36:24.783 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
real man.

36:24.816 --> 36:28.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: However trans
men and women
end up in the military, Brynn
Tannehill wants

36:28.153 --> 36:32.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them to be treated the same way
that all other
federal government workers are
treated.

36:32.190 --> 36:36.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. CMDR. BRYNN TANNEHILL: The
federal work
force already has policies in
place that allow

36:36.094 --> 36:42.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
other federal workers to
transition, to change
their names, change their gender
markers,

36:42.033 --> 36:47.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to use bathrooms, to use locker
rooms. All
of this has been worked out with
every other

36:47.172 --> 36:48.773 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
federal agency.

36:48.807 --> 36:52.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the military is really kind
of a little
bit behind the curve on this
one.

36:52.310 --> 36:56.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: She says VA
hospitals have
been providing hormones and
therapy to trans

36:56.548 --> 37:01.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
veterans since 2011. But that's
not the case
for service members on active
duty or in the

37:01.820 --> 37:07.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reserves. Tannehill says, if a
woman needs
hormone replacement therapy to
address menopausal

37:07.158 --> 37:11.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
symptoms or after cancer
treatment, she can
get it through the military
health care system,

37:12.030 --> 37:13.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but not women like her.

37:13.832 --> 37:17.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. CMDR. BRYNN TANNEHILL: If a
transgender
woman needs that same estrogen
in the same

37:17.102 --> 37:18.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
doses, she can't get it.

37:18.903 --> 37:21.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: According to a
recent study
in "The New England Journal of
Medicine" by

37:21.906 --> 37:26.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Aaron Belkin of the Palm Center
-- they're
a research and advocacy group
that focuses

37:26.177 --> 37:32.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on transgender issues -- it
would cost the
military about $5.6 million to
pay for hormones

37:32.183 --> 37:38.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and other transition-related
treatments annually.
According to the same estimate,
about 188

37:38.056 --> 37:40.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
soldiers would transition each
year.

37:40.692 --> 37:45.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While this represents just a
sliver of the
Pentagon's personnel, and its
nearly $600

37:45.663 --> 37:50.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
billion annual budget, for
retired Marine
Colonel Gary Anderson, his
concerns about

37:50.735 --> 37:52.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trans service members go beyond
just money.

37:53.004 --> 37:55.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COL. GARY ANDERSON (RET.), U.S.
Marine Corps:
I have nothing personally
against women in

37:55.640 --> 38:01.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
combat, gays in the military,
transsexuals
in the military, or gay pregnant
whales in

38:02.013 --> 38:08.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the military, as long as
somebody can show
me that there is value added and
not value

38:08.186 --> 38:10.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
taken away from the military
readiness.

38:10.421 --> 38:15.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Anderson says
that letting
transgender people and gays
serve has damaged

38:15.393 --> 38:20.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
morale. He claims it's the
lowest it's been
in decades. The cause? Changing
attitudes

38:20.365 --> 38:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about the LGBTQI community.

38:22.267 --> 38:29.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COL. GARY ANDERSON: I think
progressive fascism
is a fair description. I think
we have got

38:29.507 --> 38:36.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who -- quite frankly,
diversity in
this particular Pentagon and
this particular

38:36.681 --> 38:39.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
time frame has become a
religion.

38:39.784 --> 38:44.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In the past,
the Pentagon
has said that the impact of
letting gays and

38:44.455 --> 38:49.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lesbians serve openly has been
-- quote -- "negligible."
They have not yet studied the
impact of transgender

38:49.827 --> 38:51.629 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
service members.

38:51.663 --> 38:55.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Anderson also says that
transgender service
members present logistical
challenges.

38:55.500 --> 38:59.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COL. GARY ANDERSON: Will there
be a requirement
for a third bathing and sanitary
facility

38:59.971 --> 39:03.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
aboard submarines, on fire bases
and so forth?

39:03.541 --> 39:08.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. BLAKE DREMANN: We got
stalls. We're mature
enough to not -- you know, you
shut the door.

39:08.980 --> 39:13.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everybody knows. It's not like
there's any
secret to what going on when you
walk into

39:13.284 --> 39:15.086 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the bathroom.

39:15.119 --> 39:18.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: According to
the Palm Center,
18 countries, including Canada,
the U.K. and

39:18.656 --> 39:23.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other NATO allies, have allowed
transgender
soldiers to serve. And Tannehill
says there's

39:23.361 --> 39:26.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no evidence those militaries
suffered any
problems or setbacks.

39:26.798 --> 39:30.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. CMDR. BRYNN TANNEHILL: They
have dealt
with all the same issues that
the DOD is looking

39:30.702 --> 39:36.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at, and they dealt with them 15,
16 to 20
years ago, including facilities,
including

39:36.107 --> 39:41.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
medical care, including
nondiscrimination
and non -- anti-harassment
policies.

39:41.679 --> 39:45.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Tannehill and
others who
watch the issue are expecting
Defense Secretary

39:45.883 --> 39:50.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carter to make an announcement
about the Pentagon's
strategy by midsummer. They hope
it will put

39:50.788 --> 39:54.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to rest the uncertainty of
serving while transgender.

39:54.125 --> 40:00.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham.

40:00.231 --> 40:12.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now we turn to
Uber. The
ride-sharing giant's rise has
spurred a number

40:12.810 --> 40:14.779 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of fights across the country.

40:14.812 --> 40:19.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The latest move, an agreement to
create a
drivers association representing
about 35,000

40:19.717 --> 40:25.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drivers in New York City. That
follows a recent
settlement with drivers in
California and

40:25.189 --> 40:30.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Massachusetts, and a decision to
suspend service
in Austin, Texas.

40:30.128 --> 40:34.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mike Isaac covers this landscape
for The New
York Times, joins us now from
San Francisco.

40:34.332 --> 40:36.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
How significant was this
agreement that Uber
made in New York?

40:36.701 --> 40:42.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE ISAAC, The New York Times:
So, it's probably
the largest to date that Uber
has had in a

40:42.273 --> 40:46.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of positive agreement with
any sort of
recognized labor unions.

40:46.844 --> 40:52.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the first time that Uber is
actually
recognizing a group of drivers.
They're not

40:52.750 --> 40:58.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
calling it a union because they
lack some
really fundamental issues that
-- issues and

40:58.890 --> 41:04.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
abilities that unions have,
which includes
the ability to collectively
bargain with Uber

41:04.729 --> 41:06.431 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on pay.

41:06.464 --> 41:11.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, as far as overall
significance, it's
the first time Uber is actually
willing on

41:11.402 --> 41:13.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agree to talk to one of these
groups.

41:13.204 --> 41:16.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, is this a
step to try
to prevent unionization or to
have to call

41:16.974 --> 41:18.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
drivers employees?

41:18.776 --> 41:24.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE ISAAC: You know, it's --
Uber has never
really had good lines of
communication with

41:24.282 --> 41:26.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
any of the drivers that work for
them.

41:26.250 --> 41:30.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the biggest complaints
has always been,
you know, for drivers, that they
can't get

41:30.655 --> 41:37.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in touch with Uber. If they have
been deactivated
driving for Uber, they don't
know why often.

41:37.362 --> 41:41.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's sort of this first olive
branch from
the company saying, OK, we're
going to start

41:41.933 --> 41:45.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
listening to you and essentially
give you
a voice.

41:45.236 --> 41:52.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, that also serves another
purpose, to,
you know, sort of give a
quasi-union-style

41:52.276 --> 41:57.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
thing to drivers without
actually making them
employees, which would cost
Uber, you know,

41:57.548 --> 42:00.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hundreds of millions of dollars
more in overhead.

42:00.485 --> 42:05.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's kind of a -- it's
serving more than
one purpose at the same time.

42:05.089 --> 42:06.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK.

42:06.924 --> 42:08.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, what are the fights going
on in the other
parts of the country we
mentioned? Right in

42:08.493 --> 42:11.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your home area, in California,
what was the
settlement there about?

42:11.829 --> 42:18.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE ISAAC: So, in California
and in Massachusetts,
there was a class-action lawsuit
going on

42:18.169 --> 42:23.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where a number of -- tens of
thousands of
workers were essentially suing
Uber to -- for

42:23.408 --> 42:29.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back wages, for overtime, for
expenses, essentially
things that you would receive if
you were

42:29.380 --> 42:31.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a full-time employee.

42:31.215 --> 42:36.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, Uber, you know, continues
to call their
drivers their partner -- driver
partners and

42:36.154 --> 42:42.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has no real incentive to employ
these people.
So, that had been going on for a
while. But

42:42.160 --> 42:47.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Uber finally settled with the
class-action
-- or agreed to settle the
class-action for

42:47.565 --> 42:55.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up to $100 million and some of
the concessions
that you're seeing in this new
union -- union-esque

42:55.473 --> 42:57.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
group formed in New York
recently.

42:57.408 --> 43:02.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: I say Uber all
the time,
but it's almost a shorthand for
Uber, Lyft,

43:02.914 --> 43:06.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other ride-sharing companies.
They just pulled
out of Austin.

43:06.851 --> 43:10.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seems the strategy sometimes
for these
companies is to ask forgiveness,
rather than

43:10.755 --> 43:14.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
permission. What happened in
Austin, and why
did they have to leave?

43:14.058 --> 43:17.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE ISAAC: Well, Austin was an
interesting
battle for them.

43:17.361 --> 43:22.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They essentially were going up
against the
slate legislature over
background checks.

43:22.800 --> 43:28.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, basically, Uber has this
process where
they have an outside company
performing these

43:28.306 --> 43:33.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
background checks for drivers.
They're usually
turned around in a few days, and
drivers can

43:33.544 --> 43:36.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get on the platform and start
driving really
quickly.

43:36.280 --> 43:42.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, the point of contention
there was, taxi
drivers and cab drivers
generally have to

43:42.086 --> 43:47.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go through a fingerprint-based
background
check, which many people believe
is much more

43:47.058 --> 43:51.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comprehensive than the type of
background
checks that Uber is -- Uber and
Lyft and other

43:51.062 --> 43:52.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ride-sharing companies are
requiring.

43:52.897 --> 44:00.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Uber spent, I believe it was
$9 million
fighting that in the state
legislature, saying,

44:00.037 --> 44:05.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our background checks very safe.
But a law
passed that essentially sort of
made their

44:05.743 --> 44:12.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
argument moot, so Uber decided
to call their
bluff and pull out and see if
the drivers

44:12.116 --> 44:16.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Austin complained loud enough
for them
-- for the state to cave.

44:16.087 --> 44:19.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Mike Isaac of
The New York Times joining us
from San Francisco,

44:19.090 --> 44:20.591 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thanks so much.

44:20.625 --> 44:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE ISAAC: Thanks for having
me.

44:29.166 --> 44:35.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now the latest
addition to
the "NewsHour" Bookshelf.

44:35.840 --> 44:38.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown explores a new
take on a classic
novel.

44:38.743 --> 44:43.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: There's a
well-off bachelor,
a Mr. Bingley, moving to town,
and Mrs. Bennett

44:43.314 --> 44:47.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would just love to marry off one
of her five
daughters, preferably the
eldest, Jane.

44:48.019 --> 44:52.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Oh, and Bingley has a friend
named Darcy.
Maybe you have heard this story.
Jane Austen's

44:52.723 --> 44:57.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
novel of manners, "Pride and
Prejudice," was
first published in 1813. It has
been read

44:57.862 --> 45:01.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and played with in many forms,
including films,
ever since.

45:01.332 --> 45:06.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now comes "Eligible," part
of the Austen
Project, which asks six
contemporary novelists

45:06.370 --> 45:08.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to rewrite six of Austen's
books.

45:08.806 --> 45:13.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Author Curtis Sittenfeld's
previous bestsellers
include "Prep" and "American
Wife."

45:13.544 --> 45:14.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome to you.

45:14.679 --> 45:16.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CURTIS SITTENFELD, Author,
"Eligible": Thank
you.

45:16.480 --> 45:19.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Was this scary or
fun to take
on? Because you're inevitably
going to be

45:19.684 --> 45:22.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
compared to Jane Austen and to a
beloved book.

45:22.353 --> 45:25.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CURTIS SITTENFELD: I would say
it was scary
and fun.

45:25.122 --> 45:31.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was -- I mean, I always knew
that I was
writing this as an act of
admiration and not

45:31.329 --> 45:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as an attempt to improve upon
"Pride and Prejudice,"
which, of course, we all know is
perfect.

45:35.733 --> 45:38.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, what was the
mission? What
did you set yourself?

45:38.135 --> 45:44.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CURTIS SITTENFELD: Well, it was
just supposed
to be fun. I wanted it to sort
of show this

45:44.108 --> 45:49.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
admiration for "Pride and
Prejudice," but
also update it, and not be so
similar that

45:49.146 --> 45:52.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you would know at every twist
and turn what
would happen.

45:52.083 --> 45:57.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's supposed to be entertaining
and sizzy
and engaging and kind of -- it
can make you

45:57.388 --> 46:02.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
think about "Pride and
Prejudice" or go back
to the original. And, honestly,
some people

46:02.693 --> 46:07.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have said, you know, Jane Austen
would love
this, or Jane Austen would be
rolling in her

46:07.231 --> 46:12.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
grave, which I feel like
probably neither.
But it's OK that it's for some
people. It's

46:12.436 --> 46:14.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not for everyone.

46:14.038 --> 46:17.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so you set
your novel
in Cincinnati, first of all.
Why?

46:17.875 --> 46:19.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CURTIS SITTENFELD: Well, it's my
hometown.

46:19.377 --> 46:21.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK.

46:21.212 --> 46:22.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CURTIS SITTENFELD: So, it was
tempting. And
I had never set fiction there,
even though

46:22.480 --> 46:24.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I had written four previous
novels.

46:24.415 --> 46:30.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it also -- I feel like
Cincinnati and
a small English village in the
early 1800s

46:30.888 --> 46:36.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have certain things in common,
in that outsiders
might not think they're very
interesting,

46:36.193 --> 46:39.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but, if you live there, you know
that there's
drama and...

46:39.363 --> 46:41.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There's a lot
going on.

46:41.132 --> 46:44.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CURTIS SITTENFELD: Yes. People's
lives are
always exciting to them, and
people always

46:44.368 --> 46:46.137 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have crushes and intrigue.

46:46.170 --> 46:52.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so here,
Jane Bennet
is a yoga instructor. Lizzie is
a magazine

46:52.076 --> 46:57.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
writer. The two silly younger
sisters are
-- they spend a lot of their day
doing cross-fit

46:57.448 --> 46:59.250 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
workouts.

46:59.283 --> 47:04.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I can go on and on,
right? Darcy is
a haughty neurosurgeon now. Did
you have great

47:04.789 --> 47:07.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fun looking for comparisons to
our time?

47:07.658 --> 47:13.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CURTIS SITTENFELD: Yes, I did
have great fun.
I felt like, sitting at my desk,
I was basically

47:13.064 --> 47:14.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
enjoying myself quite a lot.

47:14.999 --> 47:19.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And from the beginning, when
these editors
approached me and asked me if I
would be interested

47:19.136 --> 47:26.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this, I said let me reread
"Pride and Prejudice"
and see if I can come up with
ideas for modern

47:26.210 --> 47:30.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parallels. And almost right
away, from the
first page, I thought this would
be fun. I

47:30.347 --> 47:33.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could do this. I have many
ideas.

47:33.050 --> 47:39.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, yes, it was -- I thought
in terms
of structure or plot or things
that happened.

47:39.056 --> 47:44.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It wasn't -- it was more like
trying to find
the parallels and trying to
borrow the architecture

47:44.995 --> 47:50.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of "Pride and Prejudice," and as
opposed to
just almost thinking, what are
modern things

47:50.101 --> 47:52.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that I can insert this old book?

47:52.136 --> 47:56.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But what are --
I'm curious,
what are the similarities or
differences that

47:56.774 --> 48:02.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you found in her time and ours?
Because so
much of that period and those
books are about

48:02.780 --> 48:09.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the class society, right, gender
relationships?
Is it similar or different?

48:09.954 --> 48:13.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CURTIS SITTENFELD: Yes. Don't
you think, in
2016, like, class is still...

48:13.257 --> 48:14.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

48:14.725 --> 48:16.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CURTIS SITTENFELD: It's always
sort of unspoken,
but always relevant.

48:16.494 --> 48:20.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, I think some of it -- to
me, I think
maybe the biggest questions in
"Pride and

48:20.464 --> 48:25.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prejudice" are, will I find my
soul mate?
Will my soul mate recognize that
we're soul

48:25.870 --> 48:31.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mates? Why is my family so
annoying? That's
always like an eternal question.
Do I have

48:31.809 --> 48:36.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a financially secure future?
Those are eternal,
timeless questions.

48:36.514 --> 48:41.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Except, nowadays,
in relationships,
there would be -- well, in your
book, there's

48:41.886 --> 48:43.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sex, for example, right?

48:43.120 --> 48:44.054 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

48:44.088 --> 48:45.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CURTIS SITTENFELD: I know, I
know, I know.

48:46.023 --> 48:53.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, here's the thing. I tried to
be respectful
of Jane Austen and her legacy
and not be kind

48:53.764 --> 48:59.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of over the top in that
category. But I do
think -- the book is set in
2013. "Eligible"

48:59.770 --> 49:07.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is set in 2013. And it seemed
like -- I have
aged Jane and Lizzie about 20
years. They're

49:07.378 --> 49:09.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
both approaching 40.

49:09.380 --> 49:15.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seemed rather unlikely that
these almost-40-year-old
women would have totally chaste
relationships.

49:15.085 --> 49:21.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, to me, it seemed relevant to
the plot
and not provocative for the sake
of being

49:21.458 --> 49:23.294 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
provocative.

49:23.327 --> 49:26.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: When you first
read Jane Austen,
when you went back as a writer,
what makes

49:26.430 --> 49:28.165 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Austen, Austen?

49:28.199 --> 49:32.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CURTIS SITTENFELD: Well, it's
interesting,
because I think a related
question is, why

49:32.570 --> 49:36.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do people love "Pride and
Prejudice" above
all her books?

49:36.807 --> 49:41.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's written so many -- six
wonderful novels,
and people love all of them, but
there's really

49:41.278 --> 49:47.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a special place in people's
heart for "Pride
and Prejudice." And I think
she's -- in "Pride

49:47.251 --> 49:51.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Prejudice," she's kind of
addressing a
lot of themes that she addresses
in the other

49:51.555 --> 49:56.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
books, but she just -- she
achieves this incredible,
seamlessness and this balance.

49:56.994 --> 50:04.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she's just at the top of her
game in terms
of character development and
language and

50:04.235 --> 50:08.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
insights about the human
condition, and the
romance is so romantic. So, it's
almost like

50:08.439 --> 50:10.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
everything comes together so
beautifully.

50:10.841 --> 50:15.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And have you
thought about
why the endless remakes and
twists? We were

50:15.813 --> 50:21.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talking before we started about
the famous
Colin Firth on television,
right, which a

50:21.485 --> 50:26.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot of people remember. Zombie
movies get
made. All kind of films get made
out of this,

50:26.657 --> 50:27.291 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right?

50:27.324 --> 50:28.692 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CURTIS SITTENFELD: Yes. Yes.

50:28.726 --> 50:29.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Bridget Jones."
I mean, you
can go on and on and on.

50:29.393 --> 50:31.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CURTIS SITTENFELD: Yes. Yes.

50:31.195 --> 50:34.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No, I have thought about this
and wondered,
is there something almost
Darwinian in us

50:34.131 --> 50:40.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that loves to watch a romance?
Like, I feel
like to me, as a reader or as a
viewer of

50:40.938 --> 50:46.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
television, if there's a couple,
and there's
such palpable, romantic tension
or sexual
