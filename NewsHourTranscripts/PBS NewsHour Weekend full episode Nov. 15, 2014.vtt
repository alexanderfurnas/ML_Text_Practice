THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.087
AT A SUMMIT MEETING IN AUSTRALIA

00:54.087 --> 00:55.656

00:55.656 --> 00:57.324

01:00.761 --> 01:02.829
ROLE IN THE WORLD AND CONDEMNED

01:02.829 --> 01:04.464
RUSSIA’S INCURSIONS INTO

01:04.464 --> 01:05.098

01:05.098 --> 01:05.999
>> AS THE WORLD’S ONLY

01:05.999 --> 01:07.267
SUPERPOWER, THE UNITED STATES

01:07.267 --> 01:09.469
HAS UNIQUE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT

01:09.469 --> 01:10.804
WE GLADLY EMBRACE.

01:10.804 --> 01:11.672
WE’RE LEADING THE INTERNATIONAL

01:11.672 --> 01:12.472
COMMUNITY IN THE FIGHT TO

01:12.472 --> 01:13.707
DESTROY THE TERRORIST GROUP

01:14.441 --> 01:15.609
WE’RE LEADING IN DEALING WITH

EBOLA IN WEST AFRICA AND IN

01:18.345 --> 01:19.613
OPPOSING RUSSIA’S AGGRESSION

01:24.418 --> 01:25.786
ARE BOTH AT THE SUMMIT, AND

01:25.786 --> 01:27.287
LATER, AFTER A PRIVATE MEETING,

01:27.287 --> 01:28.922
CAMERON SAID HE HAD WARNED PUTIN

01:28.922 --> 01:30.557
OF ADDITIONAL SANCTIONS.

01:30.557 --> 01:32.025
RUSSIA SENT NEW TROOPS INTO

01:32.025 --> 01:33.927
UKRAINE EARLIER THIS WEEK.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.195
IN AN INTERVIEW WITH GERMAN

01:35.195 --> 01:36.563
TELEVISION, PUTIN WARNED THAT

01:36.563 --> 01:38.031
SANCTIONS COULD BACKFIRE BY

01:38.031 --> 01:39.766
LIMITING RUSSIA’S ABILITY TO DO

01:39.766 --> 01:41.168
BUSINESS WITH THE WEST.

01:41.168 --> 01:43.737
AND HE ADDED THIS:

01:43.737 --> 01:44.805
>> (translated): OF COURSE WE

01:44.805 --> 01:46.306
EXPECT THE SITUATION TO CHANGE

01:46.306 --> 01:47.174
FOR THE BETTER.

01:47.174 --> 01:48.342
OF COURSE WE EXPECT THE

01:48.342 --> 01:50.043
UKRAINIAN CRISIS TO END.

01:50.043 --> 01:51.445
AND OF COURSE WE WANT TO HAVE

01:51.445 --> 01:52.379
NORMAL RELATIONS WITH OUR

01:52.379 --> 01:53.847
PARTNERS, INCLUDING IN THE

01:53.847 --> 01:55.682
UNITED STATES AND EUROPE.

01:55.682 --> 01:56.316
>> Sreenivasan: DURING A

01:56.316 --> 01:57.651
SURPRISE VISIT TO BAGHDAD TODAY,

01:57.651 --> 01:58.285
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT

01:58.285 --> 01:59.386
CHIEFS, GENERAL MARTIN DEMPSEY,

01:59.386 --> 02:00.721
SAID THE U.S. MILITARY HAD

02:00.721 --> 02:02.622
HELPED IRAQI AND KURDISH FORCES

02:02.622 --> 02:04.524
"PULL IRAQ BACK FROM THE

02:04.524 --> 02:05.225
PRECIPICE."

02:05.225 --> 02:06.560
AND HE SAID THE TIDE IS STARTING

02:06.560 --> 02:08.395
TO TURN AGAINST ISIS FIGHTERS

02:08.395 --> 02:09.162
THERE.

02:09.162 --> 02:10.364
YESTERDAY, IRAQI GOVERNMENT

02:10.364 --> 02:11.565
TROOPS REPORTEDLY DROVE THE

02:11.565 --> 02:13.300
EXTREMISTS OUT OF THE TOWN NORTH

02:13.300 --> 02:14.601
OF BAGHDAD WHERE THE NATION’S

02:14.601 --> 02:17.337
LARGEST OIL REFINERY IS LOCATED.

02:17.337 --> 02:18.472
POPE FRANCIS HAS WEIGHED IN

02:18.472 --> 02:19.573
AGAINST THE SO CALLED RIGHT TO

02:19.573 --> 02:20.240
DIE MOVEMENT.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.308
SPEAKING TODAY TO THE

02:21.308 --> 02:23.043
ASSOCIATION OF ITALIAN CATHOLIC

02:23.043 --> 02:24.644
DOCTORS, THE POPE SAID THE

02:24.644 --> 02:26.113
MOVEMENT OFFERS WHAT HE CALLED A

02:26.113 --> 02:27.848
"FALSE SENSE OF COMPASSION."

02:27.848 --> 02:29.082
TWO WEEKS AGO, A TOP VATICAN

02:29.082 --> 02:30.517
OFFICIAL CONDEMNED THE ASSISTED

02:30.517 --> 02:32.419
SUICIDE OF BRITTANY MAYNARD, THE

02:32.419 --> 02:34.388
29-YEAR-OLD SUFFERING WITH BRAIN

02:34.388 --> 02:34.988
CANCER.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.189
SHE TOOK A FATAL DOSE OF

02:36.189 --> 02:37.991
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN AN EFFORT,

02:37.991 --> 02:40.427
SHE SAID, TO DIE WITH DIGNITY.

02:40.427 --> 02:41.361
ACCORDING TO NEW DATA, LAST

02:41.361 --> 02:42.729
MONTH TIED FOR THE WARMEST

02:42.729 --> 02:45.432
OCTOBER IN THE 134 YEARS THAT

02:45.432 --> 02:46.733
RECORDS HAVE BEEN KEPT.

02:46.733 --> 02:47.868
IT WAS THE THIRD CONSECUTIVE

02:47.868 --> 02:48.702
MONTH OF RECORD-SETTING

02:48.702 --> 02:49.403
TEMPERATURES.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.004
UNLESS TEMPERATURES AROUND THE

02:51.004 --> 02:52.939
WORLD ARE SHARPLY BELOW AVERAGE

02:52.939 --> 02:55.008
THIS MONTH AND NEXT, EXPERTS SAY

02:55.008 --> 02:56.977
THIS YEAR WILL GO DOWN AS THE

02:56.977 --> 02:58.245
WARMEST ON RECORD.

02:58.245 --> 02:59.079
THE SPACECRAFT THAT MADE A

02:59.079 --> 03:00.547
HISTORIC LANDING ON A COMET

03:00.547 --> 03:02.249
EARLIER THIS WEEK HAS LOST POWER

03:02.249 --> 03:03.817
AND, TODAY, IT STOPPED SENDING

03:03.817 --> 03:05.652
BACK INFORMATION BACK TO EARTH.

03:05.652 --> 03:06.920
SCIENTISTS HOPE ITS SOLAR-

03:06.920 --> 03:08.688
POWERED BATTERIES WILL RECHARGE,

03:08.688 --> 03:10.023
BUT THE SPACECRAFT TOUCHED DOWN

03:10.023 --> 03:11.124
IN AN AREA THAT APPARENTLY

03:11.124 --> 03:12.726
RECEIVES LITTLE SUNLIGHT.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.094
BEFORE IT SHUT DOWN, SCIENTISTS

03:14.094 --> 03:15.262
CONDUCTED A SERIES OF

03:15.262 --> 03:16.430
EXPERIMENTS, AND THE SPACESHIP

03:16.430 --> 03:18.398
RELAYED THE INFORMATION BACK TO

03:18.398 --> 03:19.866
EARTH FOR ANALYSIS.

03:19.866 --> 03:20.834
COMETS ARE BELIEVED TO CONTAIN

03:20.834 --> 03:22.235
THE REMNANTS OF MATERIALS FROM

03:22.235 --> 03:23.737
WHEN THE SOLAR SYSTEM WAS FORMED

03:23.737 --> 03:25.806
BILLIONS OF YEARS AGO.

03:25.806 --> 03:26.706
DURING A MEETING WITH CENTRAL

03:26.706 --> 03:28.008
AMERICAN LEADERS, VICE PRESIDENT

03:28.008 --> 03:29.176
JOE BIDEN ANNOUNCED A PLAN

03:29.176 --> 03:30.444
STARTING NEXT MONTH THAT WILL

03:30.444 --> 03:32.012
ALLOW CHILDREN IN GUATEMALA,

03:32.012 --> 03:33.680
HONDURAS AND EL SALVADOR TO

03:33.680 --> 03:35.782
APPLY FOR REFUGEE STATUS IF

03:35.782 --> 03:37.517
THEIR PARENTS ARE LIVING LEGALLY

03:37.517 --> 03:38.919
IN THE UNITED STATES.

03:38.919 --> 03:39.719
BIDEN ANNOUNCED THE PLAN

03:39.719 --> 03:41.188
YESTERDAY IN RESPONSE TO LAST

03:41.188 --> 03:42.689
SUMMER’S MASS MIGRATION TO THE

03:42.689 --> 03:44.491
U.S. BY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

03:44.491 --> 03:46.426
CENTRAL AMERICAN CHILDREN.

03:46.426 --> 03:47.994
>> WE ALL HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO

03:47.994 --> 03:50.030
HELP THE MOST VULNERABLE AND TO

03:50.030 --> 03:51.531
KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER.

03:51.531 --> 03:52.699
>> Sreenivasan: AND TODAY IS THE

03:52.699 --> 03:53.333
FIRST DAY TO GO TO

03:53.333 --> 03:54.935
www.healthcare.gov TO ENROLL FOR

03:54.935 --> 03:56.303
NEXT YEAR’S HEALTH INSURANCE

03:56.303 --> 03:57.737
UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT,

03:57.737 --> 03:59.172
ALSO KNOWN AS OBAMACARE.

03:59.172 --> 04:00.340
THE WEB SITE RELAUNCHED THIS

04:00.340 --> 04:01.708
MORNING WITHOUT INCIDENT.

04:01.708 --> 04:03.176
THE ENROLLMENT PERIOD RUNS UNTIL

04:03.176 --> 04:04.778
FEBRUARY 15.

04:14.754 --> 04:15.555
>> Sreenivasan: LAST WEEKEND, ON

04:15.555 --> 04:16.823
THE 25th ANNIVERSARY OF THE FALL

04:16.823 --> 04:18.492
OF THE BERLIN WALL, FORMER

04:18.492 --> 04:19.893
SOVIET LEADER MIKHAIL GORBACHEV

04:19.893 --> 04:21.361
WARNED THAT A NEW COLD WAR COULD

04:21.361 --> 04:23.597
SOON BE UNDER WAY, IF IT ISN’T

04:23.597 --> 04:24.297
ALREADY.

04:24.297 --> 04:26.099
AND IN JUST THE FEW DAYS SINCE,

04:26.099 --> 04:27.167
RUSSIA REPORTEDLY SENT MORE

04:27.167 --> 04:29.035
TROOPS INTO UKRAINE AND THEN

04:29.035 --> 04:30.637
SENT FOUR WARSHIPS TO THE WATERS

04:30.637 --> 04:32.105
OFF AUSTRALIA, WHERE VLADIMIR

04:32.105 --> 04:33.106
PUTIN AND OTHER WORLD LEADERS

04:33.106 --> 04:33.974
ARE MEETING.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.475
WHAT DOES PUTIN HAVE IN MIND?

04:35.475 --> 04:36.710
FOR MORE, WE ARE JOINED NOW BY

04:36.710 --> 04:37.344
KIMBERLY MARTEN.

04:37.344 --> 04:38.712
SHE IS A RUSSIAN SCHOLAR AND A

04:38.712 --> 04:40.280
PROFESSOR AT BARNARD COLLEGE AND

04:40.280 --> 04:41.548
COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.016
SO, YOU KNOW WHAT’S INTERESTING

04:43.016 --> 04:44.551
IS, THOSE TWO WERE JUST THE MOST

04:44.551 --> 04:46.186
RECENT IN A LONG LIST OF

04:46.186 --> 04:47.921
AGGRESSIVE MOVES THAT RUSSIA HAS

04:47.921 --> 04:49.122
BEEN TAKING.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.557
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO, SWEDEN WAS

04:50.557 --> 04:51.925
LOOKING FOR A SUBMARINE OFF

04:51.925 --> 04:52.759
THEIR COAST.

04:52.759 --> 04:54.094
NOW, THEY CONFIRMED THERE WAS A

04:54.094 --> 04:54.928
FOREIGN SUB.

04:54.928 --> 04:55.996
BUT THE SUSPICION IS CERTAINLY

04:55.996 --> 04:56.830
ON THE RUSSIANS.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.231
WE’VE HAD AGGRESSIVE FLIGHTS

04:58.231 --> 05:00.967
NEAR THE U.S. SIMULATING BOMBING

05:00.967 --> 05:02.335
RUNS THAT COULD WORK FOR NEW

05:02.335 --> 05:03.503
YORK, CHICAGO.

05:03.503 --> 05:04.804
WHAT’S HE DOING?

05:04.804 --> 05:06.006
>> I THINK PART OF WHAT’S GOING

05:06.006 --> 05:07.507
ON IS THAT PUTIN IS TRYING TO

05:07.507 --> 05:09.109
TAKE ATTENTION OFF OF THE

05:09.109 --> 05:10.177
PROBLEMS THAT THE RUSSIAN

05:10.177 --> 05:11.645
ECONOMY IS FACING.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.146
THE SANCTIONS ARE WORKING MUCH

05:13.146 --> 05:14.181
BETTER THAN MANY PEOPLE

05:14.181 --> 05:16.383
PREDICTED THAT THEY WOULD, AND

05:16.383 --> 05:17.717
THEY’RE HAVING REAL IMPACT ON

05:17.717 --> 05:19.152
THE RUSSIAN OIL INDUSTRY, WHICH

05:19.152 --> 05:20.487
IS ONE OF THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS

05:20.487 --> 05:21.555
TO THE RUSSIAN BUDGET.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.190
AND THE UNITED STATES AND THE

05:23.190 --> 05:24.724
EUROPEANS ARE HOLDING TOGETHER

05:24.724 --> 05:26.560
ON THOSE SANCTIONS MUCH BETTER

05:26.560 --> 05:27.661
THAN PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY WERE

05:27.661 --> 05:28.361
GOING TO.

05:28.361 --> 05:29.930
AND NOW, EVEN PROPOSING MORE

05:29.930 --> 05:30.630
SANCTIONS.

05:30.630 --> 05:32.332
AND SO I THINK THAT WHAT PUTIN

05:32.332 --> 05:34.401
NEEDS TO DO IS CREATE AN ENEMY

05:34.401 --> 05:36.303
IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY WHAT’S

05:36.303 --> 05:38.238
HAPPENING TO THE ECONOMY, TO GET

05:38.238 --> 05:41.508
PEOPLE TO BE MOTIVATED BY A

05:41.508 --> 05:43.243
PATRIOTIC FERVOR IN SUPPORTING

05:43.243 --> 05:45.312
HIM, AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS

05:45.312 --> 05:46.780
THAT HE’S TRYING TO PROVOKE THE

05:46.780 --> 05:47.814
WEST, TRYING TO PROVOKE THE

05:47.814 --> 05:49.316
UNITED STATES INTO TAKING

05:49.316 --> 05:50.584
SOME KIND OF ACTION THAT

05:50.584 --> 05:51.918
JUSTIFIES WHAT HE’S DOING.

05:51.918 --> 05:52.786
>> Sreenivasan: IS IT WORKING?

05:52.786 --> 05:54.054
>> NOT SO FAR, THANK GOODNESS.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.523
I MEAN, WHEN WE HEAR ABOUT THESE

05:56.523 --> 05:57.857
NEW BOMBER PATROLS THAT ARE

05:57.857 --> 05:59.793
HAPPENING, PUTIN IS NOW

05:59.793 --> 06:00.727
THREATENING THAT THEY’RE

06:00.727 --> 06:01.494
GOING TO GO INTO THE GULF OF

06:01.494 --> 06:02.429
MEXICO.

06:02.429 --> 06:03.263
I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY

06:03.263 --> 06:04.397
INTERESTING THAT WE’VE HAD

06:04.397 --> 06:06.099
RETIRED AIR FORCE OFFICERS WHO

06:06.099 --> 06:07.500
HAVE WORKED ON THIS IN THE COLD

06:07.500 --> 06:09.169
WAR PERIOD SAYING, "OH, IT’S

06:09.169 --> 06:09.703
NOTHING.

06:09.703 --> 06:10.670
WE SHOULDN’T BE WORRYING ABOUT

06:10.670 --> 06:11.137
THIS."

06:11.137 --> 06:12.138
AND I THINK THAT’S THE RIGHT

06:12.138 --> 06:12.739
RESPONSE.

06:12.739 --> 06:13.773
I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

06:13.773 --> 06:15.275
IS THAT THE UNITED STATES DOES

06:15.275 --> 06:17.744
STAY CALM AND SAY, "LOOK, RUSSIA

06:17.744 --> 06:19.212
IS NOT REALLY A MILITARY THREAT

06:19.212 --> 06:19.813
AT THIS POINT.

06:19.813 --> 06:20.780
LET’S KEEP THINGS IN

06:20.780 --> 06:21.414
PERSPECTIVE."

06:21.414 --> 06:22.148
>> Sreenivasan: AND IT SEEMS

06:22.148 --> 06:23.550
LIKE HE’S ALSO TRYING TO SHORE

06:23.550 --> 06:24.251
UP HIS BASE.

06:24.251 --> 06:25.051
THERE WERE THESE PHOTOS THAT THE

06:25.051 --> 06:26.019
RUSSIAN NEWS AGENCY JUST

06:26.019 --> 06:27.754
RELEASED OF ALLEGEDLY A

06:27.754 --> 06:29.489
UKRAINIAN FIGHTER JET

06:29.489 --> 06:31.925
BLOWING OUT... OR SHOOTING DOWN

06:31.925 --> 06:34.828
THE MALAYSIAN AIRLINES, AND IN

06:34.828 --> 06:35.762
THE PUBLIC OPINION POLLS IN

06:35.762 --> 06:36.796
RUSSIA, THERE’S ONLY A VERY

06:36.796 --> 06:37.831
SMALL FRACTION OF PEOPLE THAT

06:37.831 --> 06:38.999
ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT THE REBELS

06:38.999 --> 06:39.833
COULD HAVE DONE IT.

06:39.833 --> 06:40.300
>> YES.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.235
AND THE PHOTOGRAPHS WERE VERY

06:42.235 --> 06:43.203
BADLY PHOTOSHOPPED.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.938
SO PEOPLE HAVE GONE BACK AND

06:44.938 --> 06:46.573
FOUND EARLIER IMAGES THAT MATCH

06:46.573 --> 06:48.341
THE IMAGES THAT WERE RELEASED OF

06:48.341 --> 06:49.709
SUPPOSEDLY HAVING HAPPENED IN

06:49.709 --> 06:50.377
THIS EVENT.

06:50.377 --> 06:51.444
>> Sreenivasan: YOU KNOW, WHEN

06:51.444 --> 06:52.946
YOU SAID RUSSIAN OIL COMPANIES,

06:52.946 --> 06:54.014
THAT ALSO MADE ME THINK THE

06:54.014 --> 06:55.815
PRICE OF OIL SEEMS TO BE GOING

06:55.815 --> 06:56.383
DOWN AND DOWN.

06:56.383 --> 06:57.984
IT’S DOWN TO AROUND 75 BUCKS.

06:57.984 --> 06:59.686
THAT HAS TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON

06:59.686 --> 07:01.254
RUSSIA’S OVERALL ECONOMY AND

07:01.254 --> 07:02.155
WHAT THEY’RE ABLE TO EXPORT

07:02.155 --> 07:02.989
AND SELL TO THE REST OF THE

07:02.989 --> 07:03.423
WORLD.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.157
>> IT REALLY DOES.

07:04.157 --> 07:05.358
THE NEW ESTIMATE THAT CAME OUT

07:05.358 --> 07:07.560
FROM THE UNITED STATES ENERGY

07:07.560 --> 07:08.795
ADMINISTRATION JUST A COUPLE OF

07:08.795 --> 07:10.363
DAYS AGO IS THAT PROBABLY

07:10.363 --> 07:12.632
THROUGHOUT 2015, OIL PRICES

07:12.632 --> 07:14.234
ARE GOING TO HOVER AROUND $80

07:14.234 --> 07:15.001
A BARREL.

07:15.001 --> 07:16.236
AND THE RUSSIANS HAD BEEN

07:16.236 --> 07:17.370
PLANNING THAT IT WOULD BE MORE

07:17.370 --> 07:18.972
LIKE $90 A BARREL, AND THAT’S

07:18.972 --> 07:20.373
WHAT THEIR STATE BUDGET WAS

07:20.373 --> 07:22.409
BASED ON FOR 2015.

07:22.409 --> 07:23.610
SO, THEY’RE GOING TO BE IN SOME

07:23.610 --> 07:26.079
DIFFICULTY MANAGING TO GET THE

07:26.079 --> 07:27.781
BASE THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO

07:27.781 --> 07:29.182
HAVE THEIR EXPENSES COVERED,

07:29.182 --> 07:30.850
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE NOW THAT THEY

07:30.850 --> 07:32.452
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS AREA IN

07:32.452 --> 07:33.987
CRIMEA AND NOW THAT THEY’RE

07:33.987 --> 07:35.455
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EASTERN

07:35.455 --> 07:36.890
PARTS OF UKRAINE, THESE ARE

07:36.890 --> 07:38.758
IMPOVERISHED TERRITORIES-- THE

07:38.758 --> 07:40.093
ONES IN EASTERN UKRAINE HAVE

07:40.093 --> 07:41.728
FACED A LOT OF DESTRUCTION,

07:41.728 --> 07:43.430
THE PEOPLE ARE UNEMPLOYED, AND

07:43.430 --> 07:44.631
SOMEHOW RUSSIA IS GOING TO HAVE

07:44.631 --> 07:45.298
TO PROVIDE FOR THEM.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.132
>> Sreenivasan: JUST LIKE WHEN

07:46.132 --> 07:47.467
WE SEE LOWER GAS PRICES AS

07:47.467 --> 07:48.968
SOMETHING BACK INTO CONSUMERS’

07:48.968 --> 07:50.570
POCKETBOOKS HERE, DO YOU THINK

07:50.570 --> 07:51.538
THAT THERE WILL BE ENOUGH

07:51.538 --> 07:52.605
FRUSTRATION ON THE PARTS OF

07:52.605 --> 07:53.873
RUSSIANS WHEN THEY SEE THESE

07:53.873 --> 07:55.608
SORT OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,

07:55.608 --> 07:56.676
VERY DIRE-- MAYBE IT’S

07:56.676 --> 07:57.677
UNEMPLOYMENT, MAYBE IT’S

07:57.677 --> 07:58.712
SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS THEM--

07:58.712 --> 07:59.679
THAT SAYS "YOU KNOW WHAT, STOP

07:59.679 --> 08:00.747
WITH ALL THE SABER RATTLING,

08:00.747 --> 08:02.015
FOCUS ON OUR COUNTRY"?

08:02.015 --> 08:03.616
>> IT MIGHT HAPPEN, BUT KEEP IN

08:03.616 --> 08:05.085
MIND THAT THERE’S A LONG HISTORY

08:05.085 --> 08:07.120
IN RUSSIA OF THE GENERAL

08:07.120 --> 08:08.154
POPULATION BEING

08:08.154 --> 08:09.856
RELATIVELY PASSIVE, OF JUST

08:09.856 --> 08:11.024
SORT OF ACCEPTING WHAT THE

08:11.024 --> 08:12.559
GOVERNMENT DOES, OF BELIEVING

08:12.559 --> 08:13.660
THAT THE GOVERNMENT MUST HAVE

08:13.660 --> 08:15.528
SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE TO WHAT THEY

08:15.528 --> 08:16.696
HAVE.

08:16.696 --> 08:17.664
IT WILL BE VERY INTERESTING TO

08:17.664 --> 08:18.865
SEE WHAT HAPPENS AS THE WINTER

08:18.865 --> 08:19.232
GOES BY.

08:19.232 --> 08:21.301
I THINK THIS MIGHT BE A YEAR

08:21.301 --> 08:22.635
OF CONCERN FOR RUSSIA, BUT I

08:22.635 --> 08:23.703
THINK IT’S TOO EARLY TO

08:23.703 --> 08:24.437
PREDICT THAT SOMETHING’S

08:24.437 --> 08:25.171
GOING TO GO WRONG YET.

08:25.171 --> 08:25.839
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

08:25.839 --> 08:26.806
KIMBERLY MARTEN, THANKS SO MUCH

08:26.806 --> 08:27.741
FOR YOUR TIME.

08:27.741 --> 08:28.274
>> THANK YOU, HARI.

08:37.484 --> 08:38.151
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW

08:38.151 --> 08:39.052
TO OUR SIGNATURE SEGMENT, OUR

08:39.052 --> 08:40.253
ORIGINAL IN-DEPTH REPORTS FROM

08:40.253 --> 08:41.755
AROUND THE NATION AND AROUND THE

08:41.755 --> 08:42.389
WORLD.

08:42.389 --> 08:43.590
TONIGHT, WE TAKE A LOOK AT A

08:43.590 --> 08:45.358
GROWING PROBLEM IN MANY OF OUR

08:45.358 --> 08:47.060
STATES THAT PRODUCE THE FOOD WE

08:47.060 --> 08:47.660
EAT.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.028
WE’RE TALKING ABOUT WEEDS THAT

08:49.028 --> 08:50.430
ARE RESISTANT TO COMMON

08:50.430 --> 08:52.132
HERBICIDES, AND THAT EXPERTS SAY

08:52.132 --> 08:54.200
THREATEN THE ABILITY OF FARMERS

08:54.200 --> 08:55.468
TO GROW CROPS.

08:55.468 --> 08:56.970
RECENTLY, THE E.P.A. APPROVED

08:56.970 --> 08:58.738
NEW CHEMICALS THAT COULD HELP

08:58.738 --> 09:00.407
THOSE FARMERS, BUT SOME

09:00.407 --> 09:01.841
ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY THOSE

09:01.841 --> 09:03.676
CHEMICALS WILL POSE RISKS.

09:03.676 --> 09:04.811
THE NEWSHOUR’S MEGAN THOMPSON

09:10.850 --> 09:13.653
OF AMERICA’S HEARTLAND.

09:13.653 --> 09:15.255
FARMER JEFF JORGENSEN IS BUSY

09:15.255 --> 09:16.823
HARVESTING SOYBEANS.

09:16.823 --> 09:18.892
HE ALSO GROWS CORN ON ABOUT

09:18.892 --> 09:21.294
2,000 ACRES IN THE SOUTHWEST

09:21.294 --> 09:22.962
CORNER OF THE STATE.

09:22.962 --> 09:24.464
FARMING IS BIG BUSINESS HERE IN

09:24.464 --> 09:25.331
IOWA.

09:25.331 --> 09:26.566
THIS STATE IS THE LARGEST

09:26.566 --> 09:28.401
PRODUCER OF CORN IN THE COUNTRY,

09:28.401 --> 09:29.903
AND IT’S SECOND ONLY TO ILLINOIS

09:29.903 --> 09:32.205
IN THE PRODUCTION OF SOYBEANS.

09:32.205 --> 09:33.640
FOR JORGENSEN, WHOSE FAMILY’S

09:33.640 --> 09:34.774
BEEN FARMING FOR FOUR

09:34.774 --> 09:36.743
GENERATIONS, IT’S ALL ABOUT

09:36.743 --> 09:38.745
KEEPING HIS YIELDS AS HIGH AS HE

09:38.745 --> 09:39.846
CAN.

09:39.846 --> 09:41.347
>> YIELD MONITOR’S HERE.

09:41.347 --> 09:42.282
>> Reporter: AND ONE OF THE

09:42.282 --> 09:43.683
BIGGEST BATTLES HE FIGHTS IS

09:43.683 --> 09:44.984
AGAINST WEEDS.

09:44.984 --> 09:46.085
>> A WEED IN THE FIELD’S GOING

09:46.085 --> 09:47.520
TO TAKE MOISTURE, GOING TO TAKE

09:47.520 --> 09:49.622
SUNLIGHT, NUTRIENTS AWAY FROM

09:49.622 --> 09:50.857
THE PLANTS SURROUNDING IT.

09:50.857 --> 09:52.158
AND THAT’S WHY WE HAVE TO KEEP

09:52.158 --> 09:53.760
CLEAN FIELDS.

09:53.760 --> 09:54.928
>> Reporter: BUT JORGENSEN SAYS

09:54.928 --> 09:56.362
KEEPING "CLEAN" FIELDS HAS BEEN

09:56.362 --> 09:58.164
GETTING HARDER AND HARDER.

09:58.164 --> 09:59.766
LIKE MANY FARMERS, HE RELIED FOR

09:59.766 --> 10:01.301
YEARS MAINLY ON AN HERBICIDE

10:01.301 --> 10:02.302
CALLED ROUNDUP THAT’S

10:02.302 --> 10:04.370
MANUFACTURED BY MONSANTO.

10:04.370 --> 10:06.039
ROUNDUP USE EXPLODED IN THE MID

10:06.039 --> 10:07.307
’90s WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF

10:07.307 --> 10:09.142
NEW, GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS

10:09.142 --> 10:11.377
THAT DOMINATE THE MARKET TODAY.

10:11.377 --> 10:12.445
THE CROPS WERE ENGINEERED TO

10:12.445 --> 10:14.647
WITHSTAND ROUNDUP, SO FARMERS

10:14.647 --> 10:16.349
COULD JUST SPRAY AN ENTIRE FIELD

10:16.349 --> 10:17.717
AND THE HERBICIDE WOULD KILL THE

10:17.717 --> 10:20.053
WEEDS BUT NOT THE CROPS.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.187
>> ANY WEED YOU HAD IN THE

10:21.187 --> 10:22.622
FIELD, ROUNDUP TOOK CARE OF.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.657
ROUNDUP REVOLUTIONIZED WEED

10:24.657 --> 10:26.659
MANAGEMENT FOR FARMERS.

10:26.659 --> 10:27.727
>> Reporter: JORGENSEN SAYS IT

10:27.727 --> 10:29.929
ALL WORKED GREAT FOR A WHILE.

10:29.929 --> 10:31.331
HE NO LONGER HAD TO SPEND LOTS

10:31.331 --> 10:33.266
OF TIME PLOWING TO KILL WEEDS.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.235
BUT OVER TIME, ROUNDUP AND ITS

10:35.235 --> 10:36.803
GENERIC VERSIONS-- ALL OF WHICH

10:36.803 --> 10:38.137
CONTAIN A CHEMICAL CALLED

10:38.137 --> 10:40.106
GLYPHOSATE-- STOPPED WORKING SO

10:40.106 --> 10:41.140
WELL.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.109
>> SIMPLE USE OF ONE HERBICIDE

10:43.109 --> 10:44.844
RECURRENTLY IN THE SYSTEM IS

10:44.844 --> 10:47.213
GOING TO INEVITABLY RESULT IN

10:47.213 --> 10:48.948
WEEDS THAT EVOLVE RESISTANCE TO

10:48.948 --> 10:50.283
THAT HERBICIDE.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.523
STATE UNIVERSITY IN AMES.

10:56.523 --> 10:58.892
>> IT IS A WIDESPREAD AND... AND

10:58.892 --> 11:00.827
A SIGNIFICANT FROM AN ECONOMIC

11:00.827 --> 11:03.796
PERSPECTIVE PROBLEM ACROSS THE

11:03.796 --> 11:05.798
MIDWEST AND, DARE I SAY, ACROSS

11:05.798 --> 11:07.500
AGRICULTURE IN GENERAL.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.468
>> Reporter: OWEN SAYS IT’S NO

11:08.468 --> 11:10.069
MYSTERY WHY THIS HAPPENED;

11:10.069 --> 11:11.437
IT CAN ALL BE EXPLAINED BY

11:11.437 --> 11:12.605
EVOLUTION.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.407
IN IOWA, ONE OF THE WEEDS THAT’S

11:14.407 --> 11:16.109
EVOLVED TO BE RESISTANT IS

11:16.109 --> 11:17.577
CALLED "WATERHEMP."

11:17.577 --> 11:21.247
>> THIS IS GIANT WATERHEMP, A

11:21.247 --> 11:22.782
WEED THAT WE HAVE DOWN IN

11:22.782 --> 11:25.084
SOUTHWEST IOWA THAT’S BECOME

11:25.084 --> 11:26.085
MORE TOLERANT.

11:26.085 --> 11:27.520
THIS PLANT, WHEN IT’S MATURE,

11:27.520 --> 11:28.788
WILL BE... CAN GET, YOU KNOW,

11:28.788 --> 11:30.189
FIVE TO SIX FEET TALL.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.258
WHERE IT’S VERY HEAVY, YOU CAN

11:32.258 --> 11:34.127
HAVE YIELDS CUT IN HALF, 50%

11:34.127 --> 11:35.094
LOSSES.

11:35.094 --> 11:37.263
>> IN IOWA, WE WOULD ESTIMATE AS

11:37.263 --> 11:41.501
THAT ABOUT 75% OF THE FIELDS

11:41.501 --> 11:44.571
HAVE INFESTATIONS OF COMMON

11:44.571 --> 11:48.074
WATERHEMP THAT ARE RESISTANT TO

11:48.074 --> 11:50.176
ONE OR MORE HERBICIDES.

11:50.176 --> 11:50.944
>> Reporter: THE WEEDS ARE NOT

11:50.944 --> 11:52.478
JUST A PROBLEM IN IOWA.

11:52.478 --> 11:54.747
IN ONE SURVEY, ALMOST 50% OF

11:54.747 --> 11:56.516
FARMERS ACROSS THE U.S. REPORTED

11:56.516 --> 11:57.951
HERBICIDE-RESISTANT WEEDS IN

11:57.951 --> 11:58.952
THEIR FIELDS.

11:58.952 --> 11:59.886
THE PROBLEM IS WORST IN THE

11:59.886 --> 12:01.888
SOUTH, WHERE SOME COTTON FIELDS

12:01.888 --> 12:03.089
CAN’T BE FARMED.

12:03.089 --> 12:04.390
BUT THE THREAT IS CREEPING NORTH

12:04.390 --> 12:07.894
INTO THE CORN AND SOYBEAN BELTS.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.195
KEEP IN MIND, CROP YIELDS IN THE

12:09.195 --> 12:11.397
U.S. ARE BOOMING, BUT MIKE OWEN

12:11.397 --> 12:12.999
SAYS IT’S POSSIBLE THEY COULD BE

12:12.999 --> 12:14.434
EVEN HIGHER WERE IT NOT FOR THE

12:14.434 --> 12:15.368
WEEDS.

12:15.368 --> 12:16.869
OWEN SAYS IT’S DIFFICULT TO

12:16.869 --> 12:18.605
QUANTIFY THE DAMAGE, BUT IF THE

12:18.605 --> 12:20.206
WEEDS START HAVING A SIGNIFICANT

12:20.206 --> 12:23.409
IMPACT, IT COULD BE TOO LATE.

12:23.409 --> 12:24.744
>> WE HAVE, IF YOU WILL, HIDDEN

12:24.744 --> 12:26.679
YIELD LOSSES AND THUS HIDDEN

12:26.679 --> 12:29.549
PROFIT LOSSES ON MILLIONS AND

12:29.549 --> 12:30.750
MILLIONS OF ACRES IN THE

12:30.750 --> 12:31.684
MIDWEST.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.953
IT HASN’T GOTTEN TO THE POINT,

12:33.953 --> 12:35.421
IF YOU WILL, OF A TRAIN WRECK.

12:35.421 --> 12:36.456
>> Reporter: WHAT COULD HAPPEN

12:36.456 --> 12:37.657
OR WHAT’S AT STAKE IF THIS

12:37.657 --> 12:39.492
DOESN’T GET UNDER CONTROL?

12:39.492 --> 12:41.561
>> WELL, THE TRAIN WRECK, AND...

12:41.561 --> 12:43.162
AND THAT IS THE INABILITY TO

12:43.162 --> 12:45.665
PRODUCE CROPS.

12:45.665 --> 12:46.599
>> Reporter: OVER THE LAST FOUR

12:46.599 --> 12:48.067
YEARS, THE ISSUE HAS STARTED TO

12:48.067 --> 12:50.370
GET MORE AND MORE ATTENTION.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.537
CONGRESS HELD HEARINGS, AND THE

12:51.537 --> 12:53.406

15:37.036 --> 15:40.439
SENSE IS THAT THE EVIDENCE SAYS

15:40.439 --> 15:41.908
THAT THE HERBICIDES WHEN USED

15:41.908 --> 15:43.409
APPROPRIATELY ARE SAFE.

15:43.409 --> 15:44.644

15:44.644 --> 15:46.379
ARE SAFE, THERE ARE SERIOUS

15:46.379 --> 15:47.914
CONCERNS THAT WEEDS COULD BECOME

15:47.914 --> 15:49.615
RESISTANT TO THE NEW HERBICIDE

15:49.615 --> 15:51.384
JUST AS THEY DID TO ROUNDUP.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.885
IT’S SOMETHING THE E.P.A. IS

15:52.885 --> 15:54.954
REQUIRING DOW TO MONITOR.

16:02.428 --> 16:04.430
RELYING LESS ON CHEMICALS, AND

16:04.430 --> 16:05.531
ALSO GOING BACK TO SOME OF THE

16:05.531 --> 16:07.500
OLD WAYS LIKE GROWING CROPS IN

16:07.500 --> 16:09.035
THE OFF SEASON TO SUPPRESS WEEDS

16:09.035 --> 16:10.603
AND REMOVING SOME WEEDS

16:10.603 --> 16:11.804
MECHANICALLY.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.406
>> GROWERS THUS FAR HAVE BEEN

16:13.406 --> 16:17.343
WANTING A NEW, SIMPLE SOLUTION.

16:17.343 --> 16:19.979
AND UNFORTUNATELY, THE INDUSTRY

16:19.979 --> 16:21.714
HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO COME UP

16:21.714 --> 16:23.249
WITH, IF YOU WILL, ANOTHER

16:27.486 --> 16:29.088
DOW PRODUCTS EXPECTED TO COME TO

16:29.088 --> 16:30.723
MARKET THIS SPRING WILL HELP

16:30.723 --> 16:31.991
FARMERS, ESPECIALLY IN THE

16:31.991 --> 16:33.092
SOUTH.

16:33.092 --> 16:34.760
TO BATTLE HIS WEEDS, HE’S BEEN

16:34.760 --> 16:36.562
MIXING OTHER HERBICIDES IN WITH

16:36.562 --> 16:38.564
ROUNDUP, SOMETHING MONSANTO

16:38.564 --> 16:40.032
RECOMMENDS.

16:40.032 --> 16:41.334
BUT JORGENSSON HE SAYS HE KNOWS

16:41.334 --> 16:42.835
HIS SYSTEM WILL INEVITABLY HAVE

16:42.835 --> 16:46.239
TO EVOLVE, JUST LIKE THE WEEDS.

16:46.239 --> 16:47.240
ARE YOU AFRAID THAT YOUR SYSTEM

16:47.240 --> 16:48.074
MIGHT STOP WORKING?

16:48.074 --> 16:49.108
>> OH, THERE’S NO QUESTION IT

16:49.108 --> 16:50.376
WILL CHANGE.

16:50.376 --> 16:51.410
THERE WILL BE A TIME WHERE IT

16:51.410 --> 16:53.012
WILL NOT HAVE THE EFFECT THAT IT

16:53.012 --> 16:53.980
DOES NOW.

16:53.980 --> 16:54.981
AFTER SEEING WHAT’S HAPPENED

16:54.981 --> 16:56.549

17:01.854 --> 17:03.189
HAPPEN IF IT LOSES ITS

17:03.189 --> 17:04.323
EFFECTIVENESS.

17:04.323 --> 17:06.525
THAT IS ALWAYS ON FARMERS’ MINDS

17:06.525 --> 17:08.694
BECAUSE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

17:08.694 --> 17:10.796

BEEN LOST IN THE HOLOCAUST, AND

20:23.255 --> 20:24.723
IS THIS SOMETHING THE REP CAN

20:24.723 --> 20:25.524
DO?"

20:25.524 --> 20:27.393
WELL, SHE SAID, "ABSOLUTELY."

20:27.393 --> 20:28.294
>> Reporter: AND THE REST, AS

20:28.294 --> 20:29.995
THEY SAY, IS HISTORY.

20:29.995 --> 20:31.831
THE MILWAUKEE REP BEGAN A LABOR

20:31.831 --> 20:32.832
OF LOVE.

20:32.832 --> 20:35.801
>> THEY BECAME FILLED WITH

20:35.801 --> 20:38.604
HEDWIG’S STORY, AND IT BECAME

20:38.604 --> 20:40.072
PERSONAL FOR THEM.

20:40.072 --> 20:40.873
>> Reporter: THEN, HARD WORK

20:40.873 --> 20:42.975
PAID OFF; A RESEARCHER FOUND A

20:42.975 --> 20:45.177
LETTER FROM HEDY, AND BIT BY BIT

20:45.177 --> 20:47.279
HEDY STRNAD TOOK SHAPE.

20:47.279 --> 20:48.447
>> WE FOUND OUT SHE HAD RED

20:48.447 --> 20:49.682
HAIR, AND THAT SHE SMOKED

20:49.682 --> 20:51.317
CIGARETTES, AND THAT SHE HAD A

20:51.317 --> 20:52.618
SENSE OF HUMOR.

20:52.618 --> 20:53.619
>> Reporter: TODAY, THE DRESSES

21:03.863 --> 21:05.598

21:05.598 --> 21:07.433
>> IT’S HAPPY, BUT IT’S

21:07.433 --> 21:08.934
HAUNTING, TOO.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.469
IT’S A HAUNTING THING.

21:10.469 --> 21:12.304
>> Reporter: AND INSPIRING, TOO.

21:16.008 --> 21:17.309
PERSONAL WAY.

21:17.309 --> 21:20.279
>> WHEN I PUT THE DRESS ON, IT

21:20.279 --> 21:22.314
FIT ME PERFECTLY.

21:22.314 --> 21:23.849
THE WHOLE THING IS SURREAL.

21:23.849 --> 21:25.017
THE TORCH HAS BEEN PASSED.

21:25.017 --> 21:27.453
IT WAS PASSED FROM HEDY’S DRESS

21:27.453 --> 21:29.555
DESIGNS THAT SHE CREATED IN

21:29.555 --> 21:35.227
BOHEMIA TO HER HUSBAND TO MY

21:35.227 --> 21:37.496

21:50.910 --> 21:53.779
THEIR STORY, AND NOW DO.

21:53.779 --> 21:54.947
>> WHAT WE SEE HERE IS HISTORY

21:54.947 --> 21:55.814
IS ONGOING.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.716
THIS IS NEVER GOING TO DIE.

21:57.716 --> 21:59.151
AND WE HAVE TO KEEP TELLING THE

21:59.151 --> 22:02.421
STORY SO THAT HISTORY DOES NOT

22:02.421 --> 22:03.722
REPEAT ITSELF.

22:34.253 --> 22:35.854
WHITLEY, WHO SERVED TIME FOR A

22:35.854 --> 22:37.523
CRIME HE DID NOT COMMIT.

22:37.523 --> 22:38.624
IT TURNS OUT THAT WHILE 30

22:38.624 --> 22:39.925
STATES DO OFFER THE WRONGLY

22:46.665 --> 22:48.834
PRISON BEFORE BEING EXONERATED

22:48.834 --> 22:49.868
OF THE CRIME.

22:49.868 --> 22:51.804
>> DID PEOPLE ASSUME AS SOON AS

22:51.804 --> 22:54.306
YOU WERE EXONERATED THAT YOU

22:54.306 --> 22:55.241
WOULD BE PAID MONEY?

22:55.241 --> 22:56.609
>> OH, YES.

22:56.609 --> 22:57.876
I DID, TOO.

22:57.876 --> 22:58.877
>> Sreenivasan: ALMOST EVERYONE

22:58.877 --> 23:00.079

23:01.747 --> 23:03.148
PHYLAND-JUAN BECERRA WROTE:

23:03.148 --> 23:04.850
"IT IS LUDICROUS THAT IN SO MANY

23:04.850 --> 23:06.418
STATES, MINE INCLUDED, THEY ARE

23:06.418 --> 23:08.020
LET OUT AND LEFT TO THEIR OWN

23:08.020 --> 23:09.955
DEVICES WITH ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

23:09.955 --> 23:11.857
SHAME, SHAME, SHAME."

23:11.857 --> 23:13.726
CAROLE PAPY ADDED: "WE CAN NEVER

23:13.726 --> 23:15.561
GIVE THEM BACK THE LOST, BEST

23:15.561 --> 23:17.162
YEARS OF THEIR LIVES, BUT MONEY

23:17.162 --> 23:18.597
IS BETTER THAN NOTHING AT ALL.

23:18.597 --> 23:20.532
A SLIDING SCALE FOR TIME SERVED

23:20.532 --> 23:22.067
AND HARSHNESS OF THE EXPERIENCE

23:22.067 --> 23:23.168
WOULD BE A START.

23:23.168 --> 23:24.436
AND THOSE 20 STATES THAT OFFER

23:24.436 --> 23:26.705
NOTHING NEED AN OVERHAUL AND A

23:26.705 --> 23:27.473
CONSCIENCE."

23:27.473 --> 23:28.941
SEVERAL PEOPLE SAID AUTHORITIES

23:28.941 --> 23:30.542
SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR

23:30.542 --> 23:31.644
THEIR MISTAKES.

23:31.644 --> 23:33.545
FROM JUDITH HARLAN, WHO SAID:

23:33.545 --> 23:35.347
"NOT POSSIBLE TO GIVE BACK WHAT

23:35.347 --> 23:36.949
WAS STOLEN, WHICH IS WHY JUDGES

23:36.949 --> 23:38.651
AND PROSECUTORS NEED TO BE

23:38.651 --> 23:40.519
BROUGHT TO JUSTICE AS THEY KNOW

23:40.519 --> 23:42.421
AND ACCEPT DAILY WRONGS."

23:42.421 --> 23:43.856
AND JAMES LEE LUCIER WENT

23:43.856 --> 23:45.391
FURTHER: "IF HE WAS

23:45.391 --> 23:47.159
INTENTIONALLY WRONGED, THOSE WHO

23:47.159 --> 23:48.527
WRONGED HIM SHOULD SPEND TIME IN

23:48.527 --> 23:50.429
PRISON, AND HE SHOULD BE AWARDED

23:50.429 --> 23:51.664
THEIR ASSETS.

23:51.664 --> 23:52.831
THE AUTHORITIES SHOULD MAKE A

23:52.831 --> 23:55.634
CLEAR AND LOUD PUBLIC APOLOGY."

23:55.634 --> 23:57.002
BUT SEVERAL OF YOU QUESTIONED

23:57.002 --> 23:58.837
WHETHER THERE WAS ANY REAL WAY

23:58.837 --> 24:00.339
TO MAKE AMENDS.

24:00.339 --> 24:01.974
JOSHELLE GREST WROTE: "THERE’S

24:01.974 --> 24:03.809
NO WAY TO REPAY TIME!

24:03.809 --> 24:05.044
THERE’S JUST NOT!"

24:05.044 --> 24:06.478
AND JOSHUA IANO SUMMED IT UP

24:06.478 --> 24:08.213
THIS WAY: "WE OWE THEM A NEW

24:08.213 --> 24:08.914
LIFE."
