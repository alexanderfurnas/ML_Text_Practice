JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.739 --> 00:07.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.641 --> 00:11.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: The
Trump administration
outlines an aggressive plan to
crack down

00:11.745 --> 00:16.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on undocumented immigrants and
to strengthen
border security.

00:16.350 --> 00:22.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, betting on Trump -- our
new series kicks
off in coal country, where
families are banking

00:22.789 --> 00:25.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the president's promise to
bring back jobs.

00:25.359 --> 00:29.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAKOTA HALL, Coal Miner: The
only thing that
I have really given thought
about is Trump

00:29.596 --> 00:32.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
getting in office and going back
to work.

00:32.366 --> 00:37.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My American dream would just be
to watch my
kids grow up happy and healthy.

00:37.137 --> 00:42.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And taking deep
breaths to
get through the school day --
how students

00:42.109 --> 00:45.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in Baltimore are using
meditation to relieve
stress.

00:45.312 --> 00:49.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARLILLIAN THOMPSON, Principal,
Coleman Elementary
School: The children are now
able to embrace

00:49.416 --> 00:52.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it and realize that: I don't
have to be angry.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't have to fight.

00:53.420 --> 00:55.022 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't have to show off.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.490 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
All I need to do is breathe.

00:56.523 --> 00:58.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:58.692 --> 00:59.660 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:59.693 --> 01:12.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The

01:12.506 --> 01:17.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
federal government has formally
begun moving
to get tougher on illegal
immigration.

01:17.711 --> 01:24.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Department of Homeland
Security set that
in motion today with top-level
memos.

01:24.284 --> 01:28.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The new memos on immigration
were set in motion
just after President Trump's
inauguration.

01:28.855 --> 01:32.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
I just signed two executive
orders that will

01:32.859 --> 01:40.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
save thousands of lives,
millions of jobs,
and billions and billions of
dollars.

01:40.300 --> 01:46.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now the secretary
of homeland
security, John Kelly, is putting
the presidential

01:46.373 --> 01:48.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
orders into practice.

01:48.909 --> 01:54.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His directives greatly expand
the pool of
immigrants subject to quick
deportation.

01:54.982 --> 02:01.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now anyone in the U.S. illegally
who's charged
or convicted of any crime is an
enforcement

02:01.755 --> 02:03.657 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
priority.

02:03.690 --> 02:08.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Obama administration focused
on immigrants
convicted of serious crimes,
threats to national

02:08.662 --> 02:12.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
security and recent border
crossers.

02:12.332 --> 02:14.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
White House spokesman Sean
Spicer:

02:14.101 --> 02:17.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
The message from this White
House and from

02:17.137 --> 02:22.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the DHS is that those people who
are in this
country and pose a threat to our
public safety

02:22.509 --> 02:27.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or have committed a crime will
be the first
to go, and we will be
aggressively making

02:27.047 --> 02:28.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sure that that occurs.

02:28.915 --> 02:34.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The new
directives do not change
the Obama program known as DACA
that protected

02:34.121 --> 02:40.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from deportation more than
750,000 young immigrants,
the so-called dreamers.

02:40.927 --> 02:45.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump addressed their plight
during last
week's White House news
conference.

02:45.532 --> 02:47.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We're going to
show great heart.

02:47.701 --> 02:51.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DACA is a very, very difficult
subject for
me, I will tell you.

02:51.538 --> 02:55.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To me, it's one of the most
difficult subjects
I have, because you have these
incredible

02:55.475 --> 02:57.277 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
kids.

02:57.310 --> 03:02.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Today, he told
NBC News, "We
are going to try to take care of
the dreamers

03:02.149 --> 03:04.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
very, very much."

03:04.084 --> 03:10.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Authorities do plan to enforce a
longstanding
provision on people caught in
the act of illegally

03:10.323 --> 03:12.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
crossing the Mexican border.

03:12.359 --> 03:17.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They will be sent back to
Mexico, even if
they're from a different
country.

03:17.264 --> 03:24.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On plans for a border wall, the
Kelly memos
identify locations near El Paso,
Texas; Tucson,

03:24.671 --> 03:28.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Arizona; and El Centro,
California, for initial
construction.

03:28.975 --> 03:34.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition, Secretary Kelly has
directed
Immigration and Customs
Enforcement to hire

03:34.848 --> 03:40.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
10,000 additional officers and
agents.

03:40.754 --> 03:46.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of this comes amid rising
fears among
immigrants and nationwide
protests.

03:46.660 --> 03:51.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, activists staged a
day without
immigrants, shutting down
restaurants and

03:51.298 --> 03:56.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
stores to highlight the
contributions of workers
born outside the U.S.

03:56.136 --> 04:01.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I think it's important to
show support
and to try to open their eyes
that we're not

04:01.975 --> 04:03.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
here to be criminals.

04:03.877 --> 04:10.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And immigration
advocates point
to two cases, in Phoenix and
Seattle, in which

04:10.684 --> 04:17.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people were detained despite
apparent protection
under President Obama's
policies.

04:17.257 --> 04:22.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
death of a Mexican
teenager at the hands of a U.S.
Border Patrol

04:22.395 --> 04:25.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agent reached the U.S. Supreme
Court.

04:25.132 --> 04:30.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It happened in 2010, between El
Paso, Texas,
and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.

04:30.737 --> 04:36.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The agent was on the American
side when he
fired at the boy on the Mexican
side.

04:36.309 --> 04:39.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Details of what preceded the
shooting are
in dispute.

04:39.079 --> 04:44.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The teen's family is seeking the
right to
sue the agent in U.S. federal
court.

04:44.818 --> 04:50.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Israel, a military court
sentenced Army
Sergeant Elor Azaria to a
year-and-a-half

04:50.290 --> 04:53.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in prison for killing a wounded
Palestinian
attacker.

04:53.994 --> 04:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Diana Magnay of Independent
Television News
reports on the outcome in the
hotly debated

04:59.566 --> 05:01.334 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
case.

05:01.368 --> 05:06.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANA MAGNAY: Grinning with
nerves perhaps
as he enters the courtroom and
still in the

05:06.673 --> 05:11.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comfort of his mother's arms as
he awaits
sentencing, Sergeant Elor
Azaria, 11 months

05:11.912 --> 05:18.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago an unknown teenage army
medic, now a household
name and something of a hero to
many in Israel

05:18.185 --> 05:24.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after a military trial which has
divided the
nation.

05:24.524 --> 05:29.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the national anthem from his
supporters
once the sentence is handed
down, 18 months'

05:29.863 --> 05:35.135 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
jail time, one year on
probation, and a demotion
in rank, which his defense team
says they

05:35.168 --> 05:37.404 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
will appeal.

05:37.437 --> 05:42.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rewind to March last year in the
town of Hebron
in the occupied West Bank.

05:42.042 --> 05:46.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the ground is a Palestinian
man called
Abdel Fattah al-Sharif.

05:46.346 --> 05:51.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Moments before, he and another
Palestinian
had stabbed and wounded an
Israeli soldier.

05:51.151 --> 05:52.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The other man is dead.

05:52.786 --> 05:55.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Al-Sharif lies wounded and
seemingly harmless.

05:55.388 --> 06:02.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
None of the soldiers pay him
much attention,
except for one, 19-year-old Elor
Azaria.

06:02.462 --> 06:10.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He cocks his gun, steps forward
and fires.

06:10.303 --> 06:14.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Hebron today, Al-Sharif's
family watched
as Azaria celebrated.

06:14.841 --> 06:19.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The prosecutor had asked for
three to five
years, but the sentence was less
than half

06:19.412 --> 06:25.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that, the judge citing
mitigating circumstances,
that Hebron was hostile
territory and the

06:25.318 --> 06:28.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
suffering the Azaria family had
experienced
throughout the trial.

06:28.421 --> 06:31.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YOUSRI AL-SHARIF, Father of
Abdel Fattah Al-Sharif
(through translator): Getting a
year-and-a-half

06:31.625 --> 06:32.592 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is a joke.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is not a sentenced.

06:34.394 --> 06:37.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If one of us killed an animal,
they would
put us in jail for God knows how
long.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're just making fun of us.

06:39.733 --> 06:45.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANA MAGNAY: For Azaria's
supporters, he's
a victim, doing his duty by the
country in

06:45.372 --> 06:48.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the face of a terrorist threat,
no matter
the rules of engagement.

06:48.908 --> 06:52.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: He's already spent a year
in jail dealing
with this.

06:52.379 --> 06:54.281 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
His family has been broken.

06:54.314 --> 06:55.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
His father had a stroke.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
His mother has collapsed.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he's got no backing from our
government.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't blame the army.

07:01.321 --> 07:03.056 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I blame Bibi.

07:03.089 --> 07:06.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANA MAGNAY: Bibi, Israel's
prime minister,
Benjamin Netanyahu, has gone
from backing

07:07.027 --> 07:11.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the military on Azaria's case
for last month
asking for him to be pardoned.

07:11.064 --> 07:15.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The prime
minister was out
of the country today, and had no
immediate

07:15.568 --> 07:17.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
comment on the sentence.

07:17.237 --> 07:20.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There has been another migrant
tragedy in
the Mediterranean.

07:20.540 --> 07:25.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Libyan Red Crescent says
that at least
74 bodies of African migrants
have washed

07:26.012 --> 07:28.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ashore near a city in Western
Libya.

07:28.915 --> 07:32.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They had been on a rubber dinghy
that was
trying to sail to Italy.

07:32.686 --> 07:36.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officials say more bodies are
still floating
offshore.

07:36.723 --> 07:41.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, hundreds
of people in
Northern California were forced
to evacuate

07:41.294 --> 07:46.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their homes after heavy storms
sent creeks
and rivers flowing over their
banks.

07:46.633 --> 07:52.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In San Jose, fire crews carried
out a series
of rescues as water levels
surged.

07:52.639 --> 07:58.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One rescue came near a homeless
encampment
amid reports that up to 40
people might be

07:58.078 --> 08:00.013 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
trapped.

08:00.046 --> 08:01.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH MATLOW, San Jose Fire
Department: Normally,
that's only three or four feet
deep out there,

08:01.715 --> 08:03.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but that water is not where it
normally sits.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I can't tell you how deep it
is.

08:05.719 --> 08:08.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of the water in the Coyote
Creek watershed
right now is dangerous.

08:08.955 --> 08:10.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's swift moving.

08:10.457 --> 08:14.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's carrying debris with it
from areas that
haven't seen water in years.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And on top of that, it may be
contaminated.

08:15.962 --> 08:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Authorities say
it may take
four days or longer for the
rivers to begin

08:20.633 --> 08:22.435 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to fall.

08:22.469 --> 08:27.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The new head of the U.S.
Environmental Protection
Agency, Scott Pruitt, struck a
conciliatory

08:27.207 --> 08:29.109 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tone today.

08:29.142 --> 08:35.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Oklahoma's attorney general,
he sued the
EPA more than a dozen times to
rein in regulations.

08:35.248 --> 08:38.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He also expressed doubt about
climate science.

08:38.318 --> 08:44.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, he told agency staffers
that he wants
to -- quote -- "listen, learn
and lead."

08:44.257 --> 08:48.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The rally resumed on Wall Street
today, after
the President's Day break.

08:48.395 --> 08:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained nearly
119 points to close at 20743.

08:54.234 --> 08:59.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 27, and the S&amp;P
500 added
14.

08:59.939 --> 09:04.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All three closings were new
record highs.

09:04.077 --> 09:09.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the National Zoo in
Washington, D.C.,
said goodbye to Bao Bao, its
3-year-old giant

09:09.749 --> 09:11.618 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
panda cub.

09:11.651 --> 09:17.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After a late last breakfast,
zookeepers packed
the panda up, put her in a FedEx
travel crate,

09:17.791 --> 09:22.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including bamboo and other
snacks, and drove
her to Washington's Dulles
Airport to catch

09:23.029 --> 09:25.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
her flight, the panda express.

09:25.698 --> 09:30.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After a 16-hour flight, Bao Bao
will join
a panda breeding program in
China.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will miss you, Bao Bao.

09:32.539 --> 09:36.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
more details
on the impact of the Trump
administration's

09:37.010 --> 09:44.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plan to deport undocumented
immigrants; fears
of a spike in anti-Semitic
violence; using

09:44.451 --> 09:59.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
meditation to improve student
learning; and
much more.

09:59.432 --> 10:04.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We take a deeper look now at
today's directives
on immigration laid out by the
federal Department

10:04.471 --> 10:06.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Homeland Security.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Joining us from Miami, Alan
Gomez.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's an immigration reporter for
USA Today.

10:11.611 --> 10:17.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And from Tucson, Nancy Montoya,
she is senior
reporter on immigration on
border issues for

10:17.083 --> 10:19.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Arizona Public Media.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We welcome both of you to the
program.

10:21.488 --> 10:23.356 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Alan Gomez, to you first.

10:23.389 --> 10:27.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You wrote today that this is
going to mean
a significant shift in the
government's deportation

10:27.760 --> 10:29.262 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
strategy.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Just how big a shift are we
talking about?

10:31.631 --> 10:36.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ, USA Today: It's
really difficult
to put into context just how big
this is.

10:36.870 --> 10:41.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's many components of what
President
Trump is trying to do that he's
going to need

10:41.474 --> 10:43.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
help from Congress.

10:43.276 --> 10:46.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we talk about building a
border wall,
hiring 10,000 more Immigration
and Customs

10:46.880 --> 10:51.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Enforcement officers and agents,
hiring more
Border Patrol, hiring more
immigration judge,

10:51.518 --> 10:54.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's going to need a lot of help
from Congress
on that.

10:54.053 --> 10:59.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But even if you put all of that
aside, changes
that were announced today in the
Department

10:59.058 --> 11:03.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Homeland Security memos
represent one of
the biggest shifts in
immigration enforcement

11:03.730 --> 11:06.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that we have seen in a
generation.

11:06.533 --> 11:12.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The pool of undocumented
immigrants that are
now available to be deported has
vastly increased.

11:12.305 --> 11:15.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The powers of immigration agents
have vastly
increased.

11:15.475 --> 11:20.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The ability of local police to
be deputized
to carry out not just ICE
functions, but Border

11:20.413 --> 11:23.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Patrol functions, is now a
reality and is
something that's going to
increase.

11:23.950 --> 11:27.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when you look across the
board at all
the different changes that they
make, again,

11:27.220 --> 11:30.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's just really difficult to
explain just
how big of a change this is.

11:30.323 --> 11:35.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Basically, most undocumented
immigrants living
in the country now are at a high
risk of deportation.

11:35.261 --> 11:37.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nancy Montoya, is
that what
you see?

11:37.897 --> 11:41.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're someone who has covered
border and
immigration stories for the
last, what, several

11:41.634 --> 11:42.635 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
decades.

11:42.669 --> 11:43.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What stands out here for you?

11:43.970 --> 11:45.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NANCY MONTOYA, Arizona Public
Media: Absolutely.

11:45.772 --> 11:50.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, I agree with Alan that we
are seeing
a major shift in how immigration
is functioning

11:50.777 --> 11:52.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the United States.

11:52.412 --> 11:57.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not just that the president
is going
to require help from Congress in
order to

11:57.383 --> 11:59.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
implement all these changes.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's also the attitude of people
around the
world.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.190 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How will they view America?

12:04.223 --> 12:09.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have been talking to folks
along the U.S.-Mexican
border all day long today.

12:09.963 --> 12:14.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I can tell you, in my nearly
four decades
of covering the U.S.-Mexico
border, I have

12:14.734 --> 12:21.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
never seen such energy and such
emotion coming
from the border, and it's not
positive energy

12:21.674 --> 12:23.343 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
either.

12:23.376 --> 12:26.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Alan Gomez, there
is a bit
of a contradiction going on
here, because,

12:26.312 --> 12:30.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the one hand, we hear the
secretary of
homeland security, John Kelly,
saying, no,

12:30.717 --> 12:33.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we're not talking about mass
deportations.

12:33.219 --> 12:38.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, on the other hand, there is
an enormous
amount of fear that's being
described in the

12:38.591 --> 12:42.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reporting of those who have been
talking to
people who could be affected by
this.

12:42.128 --> 12:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ: And that's because
there's a difference
between saying that you're going
to target

12:46.799 --> 12:51.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
undocumented immigrants who have
a criminal
record and what else you're
allowed to do.

12:51.604 --> 12:55.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama and President
Trump have said
the same thing, that their
target for their

12:55.241 --> 12:59.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
limited deportation dollars are
undocumented
immigrants who have a criminal
conviction

12:59.746 --> 13:05.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on their background, who are
gang members,
who pose some sort of threat to
national security.

13:05.251 --> 13:09.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what is different under
President Trump
is that now there are more
people who are

13:09.789 --> 13:12.225 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
deemed enforcement priorities.

13:12.258 --> 13:14.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That means you don't just have
to be convicted
of a crime.

13:14.427 --> 13:18.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can simply be charged with a
crime, just
be arrested and charged with
that crime.

13:18.398 --> 13:23.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can commit an act that an
immigration
agent deems is a deportable
offense on his

13:23.269 --> 13:27.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
own and initiates deportation
proceedings
against you.

13:27.040 --> 13:31.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And along the way, while ICE is
conducting
its operations, it is now ICE
policy for the

13:32.011 --> 13:38.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first time that anyone that they
pick up along
the way who just has purely
immigration violations

13:38.051 --> 13:39.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on their record can also be
rounded up.

13:39.786 --> 13:41.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ: So that's why
everybody is scared
that it's not just going to be
criminal undocumented

13:43.423 --> 13:45.191 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
immigrants; it's going to be the
whole pool.

13:45.224 --> 13:49.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nancy Montoya,
how clear is
all this to the people who are
affected by

13:49.562 --> 13:50.530 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it?

13:50.563 --> 13:52.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NANCY MONTOYA: It's not clear at
all.

13:52.398 --> 13:58.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, I talked today with
groups from DACA
and DAPA, which are the deferred
action folks,

13:58.705 --> 14:02.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who are supposedly safe under
these new orders.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They don't feel safe at all.

14:04.343 --> 14:08.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, they have told me that
the -- that
President Trump has used up all
his potential

14:08.514 --> 14:11.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
credibility when it comes to
immigration issues.

14:11.517 --> 14:12.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They do not trust him.

14:12.819 --> 14:15.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They do not believe that they
are safe.

14:15.321 --> 14:20.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many of the DACA students, who
are the dreamers,
those who were brought here as
children, told

14:20.860 --> 14:23.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
me today that there is still
this fear.

14:23.996 --> 14:30.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, going alongside of that
fear is this
renewed energy, because groups
from all over

14:30.570 --> 14:37.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the country, all over Arizona,
are meeting,
are working together, and so you
are going

14:37.076 --> 14:41.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to see a surge of protests like
never before.

14:41.080 --> 14:45.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, meantime,
assuming they
get the funding for it, Alan
Gomez, the administration

14:45.284 --> 14:51.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is talking about another 10,000
ICE immigration
agents.

14:51.357 --> 14:57.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are already about that
many, what, 12,000
immigration and Border Patrol
officials, if

14:57.630 --> 14:59.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you add it together.

14:59.465 --> 15:03.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we're looking at a doubling
of the number
of people who are going to be
carrying out

15:03.636 --> 15:04.604 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
enforcement.

15:04.637 --> 15:06.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is that expected to mean?

15:06.472 --> 15:09.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ: What that means is
that, right
now, if you're an undocumented
immigrant who

15:09.742 --> 15:15.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is living in the United States
under President
Obama, the odds of you running
into an immigration

15:15.214 --> 15:17.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
officer, the odds of a raid at
your...

15:17.350 --> 15:18.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean under
President Trump.

15:18.951 --> 15:20.219 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You said under President Obama.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think you meant under
President...

15:21.254 --> 15:22.221 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

15:22.255 --> 15:23.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ: Yes, I was just...

15:23.289 --> 15:24.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Oh, you were
making a contrast.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.224 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

15:25.258 --> 15:26.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALAN GOMEZ: Comparison.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.226 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Yes, sorry.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Go ahead.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ: Basically, before,
it was -- the
odds of you running into an
immigration agent

15:30.963 --> 15:33.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who was going to arrest you,
detain you, and
start initiation -- deportation
hearings was

15:33.232 --> 15:34.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very low.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What this does is ramp that up
dramatically.

15:36.803 --> 15:42.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it allows -- and when you
add the numbers
-- the numbers of more ICE
agents with their

15:42.542 --> 15:45.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new directives, and knowing that
they can
target anybody that they
encounter on the

15:45.912 --> 15:49.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
street, you're going to have
what we have
seen in the last couple weeks,
which is panic.

15:50.016 --> 15:53.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a school in Corpus
Christi that
almost had to close down because
there was

15:53.252 --> 15:56.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a fear that there was
immigration agents in
the neighborhood.

15:56.255 --> 15:58.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so you are going to see more
of them.

15:58.090 --> 16:01.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And every time undocumented
immigrants or
those immigrant communities at
large see ICE

16:01.994 --> 16:05.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agents in the area, it's going
to create a
panic in that community.

16:05.631 --> 16:08.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're going to see that
repeating itself
over and over.

16:08.100 --> 16:12.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nancy Montoya, is
that what
you think may be happening?

16:12.505 --> 16:17.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if that's the case, what are
the recourses
for people who are out there who
have questions?

16:17.243 --> 16:22.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do they feel they can even come
forward and
try to get those questions
answered?

16:22.081 --> 16:27.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY MONTOYA: One of the things
that has
amazed me is how the faith
community has come

16:27.920 --> 16:29.689 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
together.

16:29.722 --> 16:33.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in the 1980s, there was
something called
the sanctuary movement that
started right

16:33.125 --> 16:37.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here in Tucson, in fact, at
South Side Presbyterian
Church.

16:37.096 --> 16:43.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's when Central American
refugees fleeing
the violence of the civil war in
Central America

16:43.269 --> 16:45.705 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wound up in the U.S.

16:45.738 --> 16:53.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, just two or three weeks
ago, South Side
Presbyterian Church again has
ignited the

16:54.013 --> 16:55.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sanctuary movement.

16:55.848 --> 17:01.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, there are more than
2,000 churches,
synagogues and mosques around
the country

17:01.787 --> 17:08.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are calling themselves
sanctuary sites,
where people can go in and ask
for help.

17:08.327 --> 17:11.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I was asked, how do people
find this?

17:11.163 --> 17:16.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you just Google sanctuary
churches, you
will be able to hook up with a
church, a mosque

17:16.836 --> 17:18.671 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in your area.

17:18.704 --> 17:22.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Alan Gomez,
finally, for those
who have questions about this,
where do they

17:22.408 --> 17:23.876 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
turn?

17:23.910 --> 17:25.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Where can they go to get
answers?

17:25.912 --> 17:31.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ: That's a very good
question.

17:31.817 --> 17:34.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's -- right now, the best
thing you can
-- the only option you have
right now is to

17:34.987 --> 17:39.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
look at the two memos the
Department of Homeland
Security put out there.

17:39.258 --> 17:44.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House and Homeland
Security have
tried to provide some guidance.

17:44.297 --> 17:49.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It took some prodding from us
today for them
to say on the record that DACA
will remain

17:49.502 --> 17:53.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that those people who have
those DACA
protections, those will be
honored.

17:53.572 --> 17:58.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, yes, I think, a little bit
like we saw
with the travel ban a few weeks
ago, we're

17:58.077 --> 18:02.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
operating in a bit of a gray
space, where
we're not quite sure how exactly
all these

18:02.648 --> 18:04.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
orders are going to be
implemented.

18:04.450 --> 18:08.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a lot of questions about
how specific
aspects that we haven't even had
time to get

18:08.087 --> 18:10.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into tonight are going to be
implemented.

18:10.823 --> 18:13.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's going to be
like we saw with
the travel ban, little by
little, as things

18:14.026 --> 18:19.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get tested, and as people fight
back and sue
the Department of Homeland
Security in certain

18:19.565 --> 18:22.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cases, that we're going to
really realize
what this all means.

18:22.601 --> 18:26.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, the
"NewsHour" is going
to continue to cover this very
closely.

18:26.072 --> 18:29.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Alan Gomez, Nancy Montoya, we
thank you.

18:29.108 --> 18:34.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALAN GOMEZ: Thank you.

18:34.380 --> 18:39.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NANCY MONTOYA: Thank you.

18:39.652 --> 18:46.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The past couple
of months have
seen a wave of anti-Semitic
incidents in the

18:46.459 --> 18:52.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States, including a dozen
bomb threats
at Jewish community centers in
the past two

18:52.198 --> 18:56.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
days, and the destruction of
gravestones in
a Jewish cemetery in Missouri.

18:56.869 --> 19:02.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president today made a
statement of condemnation,
but it comes amid growing
concerns in this

19:02.241 --> 19:08.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country about anti-Semitism and
other incidents
involving hate, and some
criticism that President

19:08.781 --> 19:12.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Trump hasn't responded
forcefully and quickly
enough.

19:12.184 --> 19:14.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Our John Yang has the story.

19:14.687 --> 19:20.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Over the past two
days, authorities
have evacuated Jewish community
centers in

19:20.826 --> 19:25.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a dozen cities across the
country, the latest
this morning in La Jolla,
California.

19:25.898 --> 19:29.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: It's just bigotry raising
its head again
in this country.

19:29.201 --> 19:35.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: No explosive devices
were found,
but it's part of an unsettling
series of events.

19:35.307 --> 19:41.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On Monday, more than 200
headstones were toppled
and damaged at a Jewish cemetery
in Saint

19:41.580 --> 19:43.249 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Louis.

19:43.282 --> 19:49.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since January 1, 54 Jewish
centers in 27 states
have been the target of 70
threats.

19:49.755 --> 19:54.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In all of 2016, there was just
one such incident.

19:54.360 --> 19:59.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This morning, at the National
Museum of African
American History and Culture,
President Trump

19:59.298 --> 20:01.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
condemned the threats.

20:01.133 --> 20:03.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
The anti-Semitic threats
targeting our Jewish

20:03.469 --> 20:13.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community and community centers
are horrible
and are painful and a very sad
reminder of

20:13.846 --> 20:20.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the work that still must be done
to root out
hate and prejudice and evil.

20:20.386 --> 20:25.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Trump's comments
followed Monday's
tweet from his daughter Ivanka,
who converted

20:25.391 --> 20:31.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Orthodox Judaism before her
2009 marriage
to Jared Kushner: "We must
protect our houses

20:31.630 --> 20:34.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of worship and religious
centers."

20:34.233 --> 20:39.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president was far stronger
today than
he was last week, when, in two
news conferences

20:39.705 --> 20:43.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over two days, he was asked
about the apparent
uptick in anti-Semitic
incidents.

20:44.009 --> 20:45.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Watch how friendly
he is.

20:45.811 --> 20:47.680 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Go ahead.

20:47.713 --> 20:50.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: On Thursday, he
dismissed a question
from a reporter for an Orthodox
Jewish weekly

20:50.816 --> 20:53.185 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as very insulting and unfair.

20:53.219 --> 21:01.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Number one, I am
the least anti-Semitic
person that you have ever seen
in your entire

21:01.427 --> 21:02.394 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

21:02.428 --> 21:03.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I hate the charge.

21:04.029 --> 21:05.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I find it repulsive.

21:05.865 --> 21:10.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Today, the
Anti-Defamation League
urged Mr. Trump to present a
plan to combat

21:10.369 --> 21:13.005 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
anti-Semitism.

21:13.038 --> 21:17.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we are joined by the head of
the Anti-Defamation
League, Jonathan Greenblatt, who
is in Palm

21:17.276 --> 21:18.344 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Beach, Florida.

21:18.377 --> 21:20.446 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jonathan, thanks for joining us.

21:20.479 --> 21:25.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You tweeted this afternoon that
polling shows
that anti-Semitic views have
been fairly constant

21:25.751 --> 21:29.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the past 20 years, despite a
little uptick,
you say, in 2013 and 2016.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONATHAN GREENBLATT, CEO and
National Director,
Anti-Defamation League: Right.

21:31.123 --> 21:37.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Why, then, are we
seeing this wave
of threats against Jewish
community centers?

21:37.096 --> 21:38.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's going on here, in your
view?

21:38.864 --> 21:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN GREENBLATT: Well, look,
the ADL has
been tracking anti-Semitic
attitudes since

21:41.834 --> 21:43.636 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the 1960s.

21:43.669 --> 21:48.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as you said, our latest
poll, which looks
at anti-Semitic attitudes in
2016, turned

21:48.440 --> 21:52.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up about 14 percent of all
Americans harbor
these ideas.

21:52.444 --> 21:54.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's more than 30 million
Americans.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it's not a small number.

21:56.015 --> 22:02.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think what's changed is
the fact that,
over the course of the last 12
to 18 months,

22:02.755 --> 22:08.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we saw -- we had a political
campaign that
saw extremism move from the
margins into the

22:08.460 --> 22:11.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mainstream of the political
conversation.

22:11.530 --> 22:18.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw images and ideas from
white supremacists
literally shared from political
campaigns

22:18.637 --> 22:22.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
showing up in the Twitter feeds
of major news
organizations.

22:22.141 --> 22:24.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We saw it in our political
rallies as well.

22:24.743 --> 22:28.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, after the election,
there was a
surge of hate crimes.

22:28.647 --> 22:34.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw acts of vandalism,
certainly a lot
of slander on social media and,
in fact, in

22:34.553 --> 22:41.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the last few months, as you
mentioned, a number
of bomb threats, almost 70, to
dozens of Jewish

22:41.427 --> 22:43.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
community centers across the
country.

22:43.262 --> 22:48.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think what's happened is,
the extremists
feel emboldened.

22:49.001 --> 22:54.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The lack of comments from the
highest levels
of our political office have
created a vacuum

22:54.540 --> 22:59.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they have rushed to fill,
bringing their
hateful ideas literally into the
center of

22:59.912 --> 23:01.714 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our public life.

23:01.747 --> 23:02.881 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's got to stop.

23:02.915 --> 23:05.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, the president
did speak out
today.

23:05.084 --> 23:06.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's your response to that?

23:06.118 --> 23:07.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you think of what he
said?

23:07.286 --> 23:09.588 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JONATHAN GREENBLATT: He did.

23:09.622 --> 23:12.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president took an important
first step
today.

23:12.758 --> 23:18.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Literally, we hadn't heard him
speak in the
way that he did, talking about
that these

23:18.430 --> 23:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
threats are painful and that
anti-Semitism
is horrible.

23:21.834 --> 23:23.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Of course we agree.

23:23.369 --> 23:25.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so his statement today was
an important
first step.

23:25.971 --> 23:31.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as we have said for a long
time, now
we need the next step, which is
a plan of

23:31.977 --> 23:37.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
action to calm these communities
where anxiety
has reached an incredibly high
level.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What do you want to
see him do?

23:39.551 --> 23:41.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONATHAN GREENBLATT: Well, there
are a series
of things.

23:41.387 --> 23:46.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We think it's time for the
president to announce
steps for the White House to
undertake.

23:46.558 --> 23:52.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Number one, the FBI has been
fantastic in
responding to these threats and
these scares.

23:52.598 --> 23:59.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But we'd like to see a
full-fledged, comprehensive
investigation from the
Department of Justice,

23:59.371 --> 24:02.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
using all of their energies to
launch a civil
rights investigation.

24:02.608 --> 24:08.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have got the power to do
that and to
work with U.S. attorneys around
the country.

24:08.580 --> 24:11.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Attorney General Sessions should
get that
started immediately.

24:11.917 --> 24:16.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Number two, we'd like to see a
White House
task force on hate crimes.

24:17.022 --> 24:20.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This could be something again
convened by
the attorney general, but you
would bring

24:20.859 --> 24:27.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to bear DHS, the Department of
Education,
the FBI and other federal
agencies to use

24:27.166 --> 24:30.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all of their resources to deal
with this problem.

24:30.869 --> 24:35.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Number three, law enforcement
needs to be
trained on dealing with
extremism.

24:35.874 --> 24:37.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The ADL does this already around
the country.

24:37.843 --> 24:43.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we need to make sure that
every law enforcement
agency and officer understands
how to deal

24:43.916 --> 24:45.284 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with hate.

24:45.317 --> 24:49.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, number four, we think every
state should
have hate crimes laws.

24:49.455 --> 24:54.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's worth sharing, John, that
five states
today don't have hate crimes
laws, including

24:54.093 --> 24:59.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
South Carolina, where just last
week, a man
was arraigned.

24:59.098 --> 25:04.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had been arrested by the FBI
for plotting
a Columbine-style attack on a
synagogue in

25:04.303 --> 25:05.537 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Myrtle Beach.

25:05.571 --> 25:07.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But you know what?

25:07.406 --> 25:09.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That man couldn't be charged
with a hate crime
in South Carolina because it
doesn't have

25:09.942 --> 25:11.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a law on the books.

25:11.844 --> 25:15.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the attorney general could
push and the
president could push governors
and state attorney

25:15.881 --> 25:21.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
generals to move forward with
hate crimes
laws all over America to protect
the Jewish

25:21.120 --> 25:23.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
community and other marginalized
groups.

25:23.322 --> 25:25.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: We have got about a
minute left.

25:25.491 --> 25:31.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president was asked about
this very topic
three times over two press
conferences last

25:31.997 --> 25:32.965 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
week.

25:32.998 --> 25:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JONATHAN GREENBLATT: Yes.

25:34.833 --> 25:36.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What did you think of
the responses
last week, and why do you think
it took him

25:36.402 --> 25:39.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
until today to get to where he
is today and
what he said today?

25:39.638 --> 25:43.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN GREENBLATT: Well, look,
the response
last week in both press
conferences was clearly

25:43.976 --> 25:45.244 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
inadequate.

25:45.277 --> 25:48.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what we should focus on now
is, he's taken
the first step.

25:48.046 --> 25:50.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, how do we seize this
opportunity?

25:50.883 --> 25:57.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How can he manifest moral
leadership and say,
I'm not only outraged, I am
energized to take

25:57.856 --> 25:59.625 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
action?

25:59.658 --> 26:04.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when he does that, the ADL
will be prepared
to work with him to find the
perpetrators

26:04.696 --> 26:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and to ensure that America truly
is no place
for hate.

26:08.167 --> 26:13.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Jonathan Greenblatt
of the Anti-Defamation
League, thanks very much for
joining us.

26:13.772 --> 26:19.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JONATHAN GREENBLATT: You're
welcome.

26:19.745 --> 26:22.714 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

26:22.748 --> 26:26.552 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

26:26.585 --> 26:31.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
coal miners who
have placed their bets on
President Trump's

26:31.190 --> 26:37.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
promise to bring back jobs; and
using the
game of chess to help troubled
youth.

26:37.262 --> 26:44.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first; Baltimore, Maryland,
has high unemployment
and a violent crime rate of
nearly twice the

26:44.236 --> 26:46.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
national average.

26:46.138 --> 26:51.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Educators say that factors like
these add
significant stress to children
and cause emotional

26:51.243 --> 26:53.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and behavioral problems.

26:53.212 --> 26:57.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Several area public schools are
working to
reduce that stress with programs
that teach

26:57.816 --> 27:00.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
mindfulness and meditation.

27:00.486 --> 27:02.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our Hari Sreenivasan has the
story.

27:02.521 --> 27:05.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It for our weekly series Making
the Grade.

27:05.557 --> 27:10.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: And exhale, pushing out all
the things
that make you stressed out.

27:10.229 --> 27:13.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This isn't
your local yoga
studio.

27:13.065 --> 27:17.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the Mindful Moments Room at
Patterson
High School in East Baltimore.

27:17.536 --> 27:22.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a place students go when
they act up,
get stressed out, or just need a
break.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Stay in your happiness.

27:23.642 --> 27:26.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LATONYA LEE, Student: My day is
so stressful.

27:26.512 --> 27:29.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As soon as I walk in the door --
I don't even
have to do exercises.

27:29.448 --> 27:34.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's just a big smile on my
face because
I'm in here.

27:34.119 --> 27:38.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they didn't have mindful
moments in Patterson,
I wouldn't be here at all.

27:38.490 --> 27:39.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Why?

27:39.491 --> 27:41.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LATONYA LEE: Because it's too
stressful.

27:41.159 --> 27:46.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for -- to not have a place
to relieve
stress is like putting you in a
oven.

27:46.532 --> 27:50.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: These students
are participant
ambassadors for mindfulness
meditation programs

27:50.969 --> 27:55.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
run by the nonprofit Holistic
Life Foundation
at Patterson High.

27:55.240 --> 27:59.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a school that has struggled
with higher
rates of dropouts, absenteeism,
and has more

27:59.811 --> 28:04.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
students on free or reduced
lunches than the
national average.

28:04.049 --> 28:09.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nineteen-year-old Chris Bowman
not only practices
mindfulness meditation at
school, but he starts

28:09.621 --> 28:13.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his day with it, and yoga, which
he's used
to deal with his demons.

28:13.992 --> 28:18.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a previous school, he says he
used to fight
with kids who picked on him for
being black.

28:18.830 --> 28:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then his father died when he was
13.

28:20.899 --> 28:23.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BOWMAN, Student: Growing
up without
a father and stuff like that, I
struggled

28:24.002 --> 28:29.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a lot of depression, a lot
of grief,
and a lot of just really bad --
really bad

28:29.841 --> 28:31.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
zones of like suicidal thoughts.

28:31.510 --> 28:33.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I had to find a way to get
out of that.

28:33.946 --> 28:42.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A mindful moment is when you --
you just take
a deep breath in a moment of
conflict and

28:42.554 --> 28:46.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just -- maybe you just look at
that and just
like, I can do this in a
different way.

28:46.158 --> 28:47.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't have to fight this
person.

28:47.526 --> 28:49.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't have to look violence as
the answer.

28:49.962 --> 28:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: When you get
really angry
at somebody else, and they want
to fight you,

28:55.167 --> 28:58.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and you're close to losing it,
what do you
do?

28:58.337 --> 29:00.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TADREAL KING, Student: I just
stress rest.

29:00.672 --> 29:07.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I will go to the back of the
room and
sit by myself and due stress
rest to relieve,

29:07.779 --> 29:09.514 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
so I won't...

29:09.548 --> 29:13.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But isn't that
person going
to say, oh, well, look at that,
she lost,

29:13.185 --> 29:15.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she doesn't want to fight me,
she's too scared?

29:15.053 --> 29:18.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TADREAL KING: See, at that
point, I don't
care.

29:18.190 --> 29:23.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I'm just thinking of the
positives, instead
of fighting, because...

29:23.829 --> 29:25.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Good.

29:25.497 --> 29:30.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kirk Philips manages mindful
moment programs
for the Holistic Life
Foundation.

29:30.168 --> 29:33.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Given all the stresses that
they're living
with, how does taking a few
breaths help?

29:33.105 --> 29:35.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIRK PHILIPS, Program Manager,
Holistic Life
Foundation: There's the drama,
there's violence,

29:35.641 --> 29:37.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there's all kinds of issues.

29:37.476 --> 29:41.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they need it more than most
kids who don't
have that sort of trauma in
their everyday

29:41.279 --> 29:42.981 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lives.

29:43.015 --> 29:47.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are the kids that really
do need to
step outside of that cycle of
violence.

29:47.753 --> 29:49.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Patterson principal Vance Benton
agrees.

29:49.588 --> 29:52.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VANCE BENTON, Principal,
Patterson High School:
When they're under situations
outside the

29:52.157 --> 29:59.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
school building, sometimes
difficult situations,
hopefully, they will be able to
take a breath,

29:59.865 --> 30:02.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reconsider, and possibly walk
away from death.

30:02.768 --> 30:07.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when I say walk away from
death, that
means either death themselves or
them killing

30:07.639 --> 30:11.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
someone based on a situation
that exploded.

30:11.209 --> 30:15.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A survey at
Patterson High
four years ago showed most
students experienced

30:15.914 --> 30:18.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the death of a relative or
neighbor.

30:18.383 --> 30:23.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The founders of Holistic Life
approached the
principal soon thereafter with
an idea.

30:23.422 --> 30:25.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Principal Benton is so
convinced, he now meditates
every day.

30:26.024 --> 30:29.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VANCE BENTON: Lift your head up
with your
outward breath.

30:29.261 --> 30:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The feel in here since we have
had the mindful
moment is calmer.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Children are a lot calmer.

30:38.637 --> 30:43.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't believe in jinx, so I
will say this,
that although there are
altercations that

30:43.075 --> 30:47.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happen during the course of a
school day,
during the course of a school
year, our male

30:47.879 --> 30:52.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
students, particularly our black
male students,
they don't fight each other in
this building.

30:52.851 --> 30:57.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There's
research that shows
the effectiveness of mindfulness
and meditation,

30:57.823 --> 31:01.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but whether or not it is
effective in the
classroom will take some more
research.

31:02.027 --> 31:06.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Studies in peer-reviewed
journals have shown
mindfulness meditation that
focuses on breathing

31:06.565 --> 31:10.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
has positive impacts on
important parts of
the brain.

31:10.535 --> 31:16.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The amygdala, stimulated from
strong emotions
such as fear, shows less
activity through

31:16.074 --> 31:17.809 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
meditation.

31:17.843 --> 31:21.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The hippocampus, which regulates
the amygdala
and is key to learning and
memory, becomes

31:21.246 --> 31:23.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
more active following
mindfulness.

31:23.415 --> 31:29.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the prefrontal cortex,
associated with
maturity and making wise
decisions, also becomes

31:29.254 --> 31:30.989 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more active.

31:31.022 --> 31:34.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Erica Sibinga of Johns Hopkins
University
has published studies on
mindfulness practice

31:34.893 --> 31:36.628 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and children.

31:36.661 --> 31:38.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERICA SIBINGA, Johns Hopkins
University: Our
qualitative data, our interview
data from

31:38.497 --> 31:43.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
youth do suggest that they use
these techniques
to help them settle themselves
before they

31:43.835 --> 31:51.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take tests, to help them have
better sleep
patterns and sleep hygiene.

31:51.309 --> 31:57.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we believe that those
outcomes will also
have downstream effects on
academic performance.

31:57.716 --> 32:02.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Education
administrators
often look at measurable
results, like test

32:02.254 --> 32:04.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
scores and graduation rates.

32:04.289 --> 32:06.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But how can you measure the
effectiveness
of mindfulness?

32:06.558 --> 32:11.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIAH WOODS, Student: Inhale in
deep and
bring the goodness in.

And slowly get up.

32:15.000 --> 32:19.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want you to lay down, close
your eyes, and
you relax and you -- that's the
time, that's

32:19.604 --> 32:25.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the time for you just to relax
and make sure
you think of the good things in
your mind.

32:25.277 --> 32:28.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you have all the love in
your heart,
and you just want to send it to
somebody,

32:28.547 --> 32:35.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not even calling on the phone,
all you got
to do is inhale and send all of
it out, and

32:35.086 --> 32:36.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they're going to get it.

HARI SREENIVASAN: Third and
fourth graders
at Coleman Elementary practice
yoga and meditation

32:42.160 --> 32:46.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
during after-school programs
often without
anyone to lead them.

32:46.364 --> 32:50.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their principal, Carlillian
Thompson, has
noticed a major change in
behavior in the

32:50.468 --> 32:52.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
last three years.

32:52.337 --> 32:56.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARLILLIAN THOMPSON, Principal,
Coleman Elementary
School: Since it's been in
effect, office

32:56.942 --> 32:59.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
referrals, the number has gone
to almost zero.

32:59.411 --> 33:01.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have zero suspensions.

33:01.179 --> 33:08.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The children are now able to
embrace it and
realize that: I don't have to be
angry.

33:08.286 --> 33:09.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't have to fight.

33:09.287 --> 33:10.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't have to show off.

33:10.288 --> 33:12.224 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
All I need to do is breathe.

HARI SREENIVASAN: Mindfulness
breathing programs
are now in more than a dozen
Baltimore schools.

33:18.196 --> 33:22.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Similar programs are in schools
in at least
15 states across the country.

33:22.500 --> 33:32.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

JUDY WOODRUFF: Now a special
series this week
on the hopes and economic
realities of many

33:41.219 --> 33:44.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of those Americans who voted for
President
Trump.

33:44.389 --> 33:49.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Three reports will take us to
Erie County,
Pennsylvania, Central Valley,
California,

33:49.661 --> 33:51.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the coal towns of West
Virginia.

33:52.030 --> 33:57.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president made economic
promises in each
of these places that helped him
win.

33:57.168 --> 34:02.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Filmmakers with PBS' "Frontline"
went to those
areas looking for personal
stories.

34:02.841 --> 34:08.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our first report is set in coal
country in
West Virginia, and profiles two
miners we

34:08.280 --> 34:10.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
spoke with after the election.

34:10.282 --> 34:16.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is part of How the Deck Is
Stacked, "NewsHour"'s
collaboration with "Frontline"
and Marketplace,

34:16.354 --> 34:19.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%

DAVE BOUNDS, Retired Coal Miner:
I have been
registered Democrat all my life,
but I crossed

34:26.831 --> 34:28.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
over this year.

34:28.300 --> 34:31.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I voted for Donald Trump,
because he promised
to help the coal miner.

34:31.870 --> 34:35.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, for this region, we need
help.

34:35.640 --> 34:48.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's good men out here just
walking the
streets.

34:48.920 --> 34:49.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Their families are getting
desperate.

34:49.921 --> 34:50.889 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Welfare can't keep people
forever.

34:50.922 --> 34:58.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These men need to go back to
work.

34:58.363 --> 35:01.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
So I just left parts of
Virginia, and West

35:01.499 --> 35:02.534 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Virginia.

35:02.567 --> 35:04.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the coal industry is
decimated.

35:04.235 --> 35:05.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The miners are out of work.

35:05.236 --> 35:07.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They are totally out of work.

35:07.605 --> 35:14.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, there's -- there will be
no such thing
as coal in this country pretty
soon.

35:14.079 --> 35:17.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What we're going to do, folks,
is going to
be so special.

35:18.016 --> 35:22.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to bring back our
jobs.

35:22.120 --> 35:32.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are going to be America
first.

35:32.163 --> 35:41.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are going to be America
first.

35:42.007 --> 35:48.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are going to make America
great again.

DAKOTA HALL, Coal Miner: I
really want to
be a coal miner, always have
been, ever since

35:55.186 --> 35:56.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was in high school.

35:56.688 --> 35:59.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everybody had their dreams about
being a basketball
player, football player.

35:59.257 --> 36:02.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I always just wanted to be a
coal miner.

36:02.994 --> 36:17.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only thing that I really
have given thought
about is Trump getting in office
and going

36:17.175 --> 36:18.676 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
back to work.

36:18.710 --> 36:22.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My American dream would just be
to watch my
kids grow up happy and healthy.

36:22.781 --> 36:25.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the only thing I could
ever ask for.

36:25.517 --> 36:29.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I didn't have anything very
long, you know,
not a whole lot anyway.

36:29.120 --> 36:30.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Didn't make enough.

36:30.121 --> 36:31.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Didn't work long enough.

36:31.122 --> 36:32.490 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They said that things went dry.

36:32.524 --> 36:36.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It made it really, really hard
to take care
of a baby and a wife.

36:36.761 --> 36:46.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Since the election, a lot

of lights have
came on in mining.

36:55.413 --> 36:59.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most of them have a job waiting
on them, or
they wouldn't be here to spend
that money.

36:59.984 --> 37:05.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Getting outside with nobody
hurt, now that's
what pays the bills, and pays it
the right

37:06.024 --> 37:06.991 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

37:07.025 --> 37:07.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't want no blood on that
coal.

37:08.026 --> 37:08.993 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Nobody does.

37:17.202 --> 37:20.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAKOTA HALL: I guess I basically
seek it because
it's hard work.

37:20.505 --> 37:22.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I have always been a fan of
hard work.

37:22.373 --> 37:28.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the way I was brought up, a
family man,
I guess.

37:28.079 --> 37:31.983 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are you doing, buddy?

37:32.016 --> 37:34.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Callie (ph), she's 4 days old.

37:34.319 --> 37:36.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She was just born on Friday.

Colton (ph), he's -- he will be
2 in February.

37:41.025 --> 37:44.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My father never was really there
through the
picture, you know?

37:44.496 --> 37:45.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I only got to meet him twice.

37:45.830 --> 37:47.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I never would let my kids down.

37:47.198 --> 37:49.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I always told myself that.

37:49.167 --> 37:58.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Coal mining, I don't think it's
that risky.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
My family's done it for
generations.

38:00.678 --> 38:03.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But I think it's well worth it.

38:03.248 --> 38:05.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, there is risk in
everything you
take.

38:05.884 --> 38:14.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Respirable dust is on the
test.

38:14.058 --> 38:16.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can't see that with your
naked eye.

38:16.060 --> 38:17.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The dust you see, you will cough
up.

38:17.962 --> 38:21.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It gets caught in your throat
and in your
nose and in your mouth.

38:21.266 --> 38:25.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we will do our job, we can
eliminate black
lung.

38:25.370 --> 38:27.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's something you don't want as

DAVE BOUNDS: Coal mining is a
rough job.

38:49.093 --> 38:51.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was very seldom off.

38:51.095 --> 38:53.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I worked six days a week, and
sometimes seven.

38:53.698 --> 38:55.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I worked 16 hours a day, instead
of eight.

38:55.600 --> 39:04.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I first went in the mines
in 1969, the
risk factor of black lung
disease wasn't mentioned

39:04.142 --> 39:05.610 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a whole lot.

39:05.643 --> 39:09.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was one of them young coal
miners.

39:09.247 --> 39:10.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I would never get it.

39:10.949 --> 39:12.283 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No, not me.

39:12.317 --> 39:15.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it happens to a lot of
these older
miners, but not me.

39:15.620 --> 39:16.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what I thought.

39:16.621 --> 39:18.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The doctor told me, he said, you
have contracted.

39:18.389 --> 39:20.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now you need to do something
about it.

39:20.091 --> 39:24.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But buying a home, buying two
automobiles,
I had my daughter in school.

39:24.529 --> 39:29.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You couldn't go out and just
quit work and
go hunt a job somewhere in
another field that

39:29.100 --> 39:30.068 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you wasn't even trained for.

39:30.101 --> 39:31.736 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, you just had to keep
working.

39:31.769 --> 39:41.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You had to keep going, until,
one day, you
realize, hey, I done went too
far.

39:41.813 --> 39:46.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You had to keep going, until,
one day, you
realize, hey, I done went too
far.

39:46.951 --> 39:53.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our new administration is
talking about repealing
Obamacare and doing away with
Obamacare and

39:53.057 --> 39:54.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
starting a new one.

39:54.892 --> 39:59.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of our greatest fears
now is, if you
take the provisions out for the
coal miners

39:59.097 --> 40:05.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- I spent four-and-a-half years
in litigation
to get my black lung benefits
started.

40:05.637 --> 40:09.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wouldn't want my wife to spend
four-and-a-half
years trying to get her started,
if something

40:09.641 --> 40:18.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
were to happen to me.

40:18.783 --> 40:26.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I realize a lot of coal mines
have shut down.

40:26.958 --> 40:28.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have filed bankruptcy.

40:29.027 --> 40:33.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But taking a man's benefits
shouldn't be part
of it.

40:33.831 --> 40:40.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And everything that was promised
unto him
to go to work should be there
waiting on him

40:41.005 --> 40:45.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when he gets ready to retire,
without any
controversy.

40:45.543 --> 40:47.178 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He earned that.

40:47.211 --> 40:51.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I thought I was 10-foot-tall and
bulletproof.

40:51.082 --> 40:54.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It didn't take long for me to
realize I wasn't.

40:54.252 --> 40:58.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Now I find myself as a
69-year-old, broken-down
coal miner.

40:58.589 --> 41:05.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's going to be the one
to take me
out in the end.

41:05.096 --> 41:14.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They can say, well, this man
died of black
lung.

41:14.205 --> 41:21.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAKOTA HALL: If it picks up and
it starts
booming, that's probably all I
will do for

41:21.412 --> 41:24.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the rest of my life, until I
retire anyway.

41:24.716 --> 41:30.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would love to do that, be a
coal miner,
support my family, make good
money, you know,

41:30.221 --> 41:34.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have something in life.

41:34.759 --> 41:46.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVE BOUNDS: I cherish the days
I got to spend
with my dad and worked with him.

41:46.671 --> 41:48.272 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I miss him.

41:48.306 --> 41:49.874 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I really do.

41:49.907 --> 41:54.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those memories, I wouldn't -- I
wouldn't want
taken away.

41:54.245 --> 41:56.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if I could give any advice
to any young
miner right now, I would say
run.

41:56.948 --> 41:58.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Find you another occupation.

41:58.249 --> 42:01.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you see a coal mine, turn
around and
go the other way.

42:01.319 --> 42:08.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You just got to leave.

42:08.493 --> 42:17.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For a look at the
full-length
film, you can go to the
"NewsHour" Web site.

42:17.402 --> 42:30.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

42:30.948 --> 42:35.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As we reported earlier,
President Trump visited
the African American Museum of
History and

42:35.520 --> 42:41.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Culture today, spending time
considering the
struggle to overcome racism in
the United

42:41.959 --> 42:43.661 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

42:43.694 --> 42:48.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, another installment in
our series
Race Matters, focused on finding
solutions

42:48.166 --> 42:49.934 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to racism.

42:49.967 --> 42:54.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special Charlayne Hunter-Gault
reports from
Athens, Georgia, on building
bridges through

42:54.739 --> 42:56.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the game of chess.

42:56.641 --> 43:01.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: This is
one of Lemuel
LaRoche's day jobs, teaching
graduate students

43:01.846 --> 43:07.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the University of Georgia's
School of Social
Work.

43:07.552 --> 43:12.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But LaRoche is a man of many
parts, one who
doesn't separate town from gown,
especially

43:12.957 --> 43:15.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the parts of town populated by
troubled youth.

43:15.827 --> 43:19.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEMUEL LAROCHE, University of
Georgia School
of Social Work: These kids are
looking for

43:19.630 --> 43:21.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opportunities, looking for a way
out, bouncing
from foster home to foster
homes.

43:21.466 --> 43:25.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And, to
that end,
LaRoche puts all of his teaching
skills to

43:25.203 --> 43:30.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
work with troubled and
not-so-troubled youth,
and others from other places,
with chess,

43:30.875 --> 43:33.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the game he loves and sees as
more than a
game.

43:33.845 --> 43:38.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEMUEL LAROCHE: While in Israel,
I got an
opportunity to play chess with
this old Russian

43:38.616 --> 43:40.451 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
man.

43:40.485 --> 43:45.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And although we didn't have --
we didn't speak
the same language, while we had
the chessboard,

43:45.223 --> 43:50.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as were playing chess, I kind of
stepped outside
of myself and realized, like,
wow, and how

43:50.461 --> 43:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was able to connect with this
person, that
even we didn't play chess --
even though we

43:55.967 --> 44:00.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't speak the same language,
we were able
to connect through the
chessboard.

44:00.171 --> 44:01.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But you
learned something
from it?

44:01.772 --> 44:02.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LEMUEL LAROCHE: Yes.

44:02.840 --> 44:03.941 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

44:03.975 --> 44:05.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: What was
it that you
learned?

44:05.810 --> 44:09.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEMUEL LAROCHE: What I took from
that lesson
was more of a -- this is a game
that can really

44:09.547 --> 44:11.682 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unify races.

44:11.716 --> 44:14.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a game that can really
unify people.

44:14.151 --> 44:16.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Chess is such a metaphor for
life.

44:16.053 --> 44:20.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I teach chess, I try to
teach it from
the perspective of, how do you
take this game

44:20.892 --> 44:23.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and correlate it with the real
world?

44:23.861 --> 44:28.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when teaching children how
to play chess,
I try to teach them how to look
at the world

44:28.733 --> 44:29.967 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
different.

44:30.001 --> 44:32.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The same goes, when you give a
man fish, he
eats for a day.

44:32.403 --> 44:36.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you teach a man how to
fish, he eats
for a lifetime.

44:36.207 --> 44:38.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I try to apply the same concept
with chess.

44:38.109 --> 44:41.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIONNE MCALLA, Chess Player: I
think more
critically.

44:41.445 --> 44:46.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have to focus more, because,
in chess, if
you mess up moves, then you can
basically

44:46.517 --> 44:47.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
throw your whole game off.

44:47.885 --> 44:51.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you really need to think
about what you
do before you do it.

44:51.422 --> 44:57.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But you
also begin
to close doors -- well, close
spaces between

44:57.428 --> 45:00.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
black children and white
children and Latin
children.

45:00.431 --> 45:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tell me how you did that.

45:02.300 --> 45:05.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEMUEL LAROCHE: Adults are
programmed in their
own viewpoints, their political
views, their

45:05.403 --> 45:06.370 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
religious views.

45:06.404 --> 45:08.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But kids are still innocent.

45:08.105 --> 45:13.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if we can succeed at putting
children
together, getting children to
shake hands,

45:13.244 --> 45:19.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look into each other's eyes,
have that socialization
in where they can engage and
touch each other

45:19.483 --> 45:24.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a positive way, then, when
that child becomes
a mayor or a commissioner or is
put in a position,

45:24.689 --> 45:29.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he or she has an experience or
have had an
experience with African-American
youth.

45:29.927 --> 45:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, using chess as a tool to
bring kids together,
we do it through chess and
pizza, chess and

45:35.833 --> 45:38.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ice cream, where we bring these
kids together.

45:38.669 --> 45:44.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That, in essence, force the
parents to come
together, and before we know it,
we have a

45:44.742 --> 45:46.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
community that is really
beginning to build
collectively.

45:46.911 --> 45:50.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And they
begin to
understand each other beyond
chess?

45:50.181 --> 45:51.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LEMUEL LAROCHE: Indeed, because
that's important.

45:51.882 --> 45:55.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, oftentimes, chess is just
used as the
hook to bring them to the table.

45:55.686 --> 46:01.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, beyond chess, now that I
have a relationship
with you -- if I have been
programmed to see

46:01.225 --> 46:08.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you as a criminal, as a thug, as
a racist,
chess is a way for you to have
that one-on-one

46:08.366 --> 46:14.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interaction, and now I realize
that man what
-- who I thought was a thug just
beat me in

46:14.839 --> 46:16.607 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
chess.

46:16.641 --> 46:19.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MORRIS, Chess Player:
What this is
doing is helping me learn in
life that you

46:19.910 --> 46:21.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think ahead and plan ahead
before you move.

46:21.746 --> 46:24.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: What
happens when
the police play chess with these
kids?

46:24.482 --> 46:28.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEMUEL LAROCHE: To watch the
police officers
engage with youth in a game of
chess is -- to

46:28.285 --> 46:29.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
me, it's a brilliant thing.

46:30.021 --> 46:33.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is because, a lot of times,
the way we
have been programmed and
conditioned to see

46:33.824 --> 46:38.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
each other, kids have been
programmed to hate
the police, based on historical
mistrust,

46:38.562 --> 46:43.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as well as relationships that
they have had
with parents, or if they have
seen a police

46:43.067 --> 46:44.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
officer incarcerate their
parents.

46:44.568 --> 46:47.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So there is a negative
stereotype about police
officers in our community.

46:47.905 --> 46:53.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, oftentimes, police officers
have been
programmed to see a lot of young
African-American

46:53.778 --> 46:57.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
youth as criminals because of
the things that
they have dealt with.

46:57.448 --> 47:01.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Engaging the kids with the
police officers
in a game of chess, it helps
both the youth,

47:01.952 --> 47:05.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as well as police officers, to
break the stereotypes
that we have developed about
each other.

47:05.723 --> 47:07.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And you
get reactions
from...

47:07.625 --> 47:11.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEMUEL LAROCHE: Very positive
reactions, because,
one, the kid now recognizes he
has seen a

47:11.529 --> 47:12.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
police officer smile.

47:12.963 --> 47:15.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's positive socialization.

47:15.299 --> 47:17.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People are beginning to engage
with each other.

47:17.268 --> 47:20.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The police officer is telling a
kid, man,
you beat me in chess.

47:20.237 --> 47:23.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It develops a relationship that
you don't
see.

47:23.574 --> 47:26.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, once a year, we have what's
called Justice
Served.

47:26.377 --> 47:30.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is a way for the kids
to whoop up
on the police officers through
chess, but

47:30.915 --> 47:32.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
all in positive interaction.

47:32.750 --> 47:37.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So, for
communities
where they don't have a chess
master, or even

47:37.688 --> 47:41.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a griot, are there lessons
beyond chess, do
you think?

47:41.092 --> 47:44.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
When you they have these
divisions, how do
you bridge the gaps?

47:44.662 --> 47:47.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LEMUEL LAROCHE: By bringing
people together.

47:47.331 --> 47:48.632 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: How?

47:48.666 --> 47:51.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can't just stand on the
street and you
say, you all come.

47:51.669 --> 47:53.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to get together
tonight.

47:53.037 --> 47:56.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEMUEL LAROCHE: By building what
we have built
locally in Athens.

47:56.240 --> 47:58.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was a process.

47:58.209 --> 48:04.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You first have to allow those
who are in positions
of power to engage with people
who are affected

48:04.315 --> 48:07.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by policies that are being
joined.

48:07.985 --> 48:14.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, to get both in a room, we
have helped
to strengthen that process
through our annual

48:14.091 --> 48:15.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
chess conference.

48:15.926 --> 48:20.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a conference that brings
policy-makers
in the room with kids that are
affected by

48:20.531 --> 48:21.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
policies.

48:21.799 --> 48:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But now
you're talking
about chess.

48:23.434 --> 48:25.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to talk about how you do
it if you
don't have chess as the
centerpiece?

48:25.703 --> 48:30.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEMUEL LAROCHE: I truly believe
that it is
important to try to reach them
at the youth,

48:30.274 --> 48:31.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at the ground level.

48:31.575 --> 48:34.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Who has
to take the
lead?

48:34.645 --> 48:40.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What kind of people do you think
need to get
engaged in this, and how do they
go about

48:40.785 --> 48:42.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bringing this in?

48:42.653 --> 48:47.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEMUEL LAROCHE: If we begin to
look at things
as we are all small pieces of
the big puzzle,

48:47.825 --> 48:50.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then that helps to make the
picture a lot
more clearer.

48:50.628 --> 48:56.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The great WEB Du Bois said that
the problem
with the 20th century is going
to be the problem

48:56.300 --> 48:58.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with the color line.

48:58.202 --> 49:03.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's sad that, in the 21st
century, we
still find ways to erase that
color line or

49:03.607 --> 49:07.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
find a way to turn that line
into a circle,
where we can include everyone.

49:07.711 --> 49:13.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm optimistic because I see how
we engage
the youth on the ground.

49:13.517 --> 49:18.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I see what happens when we
engage little white
boys, little white girls, and,
you know, Asian

49:18.923 --> 49:19.890 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Hispanic.

49:19.924 --> 49:21.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We bring the kids together.

49:21.926 --> 49:24.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I see that type of engagement
that they have.

49:24.395 --> 49:26.530 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I see the genuineness in it.

49:26.564 --> 49:32.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm in a position that, when
I see parents,
the parents, the parroting of
the parents,

49:32.503 --> 49:36.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when the kids are repeating what
they hear
from the parents.

49:36.040 --> 49:40.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then it's an opportunity for me
to redirect
that concept, redirect that
thought.

49:40.077 --> 49:45.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, by engaging the youth on the
ground, having
them engage, talk to each other,
having them

49:45.516 --> 49:50.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
play with each -- socialize with
each other,
I believe that that is the one
way that we

49:50.187 --> 49:51.989 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can erase it.

49:52.022 --> 49:56.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's about allowing those
who have been
programmed to see you a certain
way, or how

49:56.160 --> 50:00.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have been programmed to see
other people
certain ways, that we really
begin to have

50:01.031 --> 50:04.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that genuine dialogue, that
genuine interaction.

50:04.068 --> 50:05.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I try to do that through my
work.

50:05.703 --> 50:08.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I am very optimistic that it
can happen.

50:08.172 --> 50:10.341 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's tough, but it can happen.

50:10.374 --> 50:13.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Thank
you very much,
Lemuel LaRoche, for joining us.

50:13.577 --> 50:16.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LEMUEL LAROCHE: Thank you so
much.

50:16.714 --> 50:23.187 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's an honor.

50:23.220 --> 50:32.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight:
perspective
on America's elderly from a
once-worried daughter.

50:32.696 --> 50:39.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America's aging population
continues to explode
and will double, from 46 million
today to

50:39.303 --> 50:41.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
98 million by the year 2060.

50:41.972 --> 50:47.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This week's IMHO, In My Humble
Opinion, features
Annabelle Gurwitch.

50:47.211 --> 50:48.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the author of the book "Wherever
You Go, There
They Are."

50:48.979 --> 50:53.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNABELLE GURWITCH, Author,
"Wherever You
Go, There They Are": When my
sister and I

50:53.083 --> 50:59.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stepped in to help our declining
parents,
there were finances and
insurances to detangle.

50:59.590 --> 51:04.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We wanted them to move nearer to
us, but they
needed to stay close to their
doctors.

51:04.528 --> 51:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, the aging-at-home option
has been touted
as a cost saver, but it doesn't
address the

51:09.667 --> 51:14.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
isolation and loneliness that
marks life for
many seniors.

51:14.371 --> 51:18.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we started looking for the
next place.

51:18.342 --> 51:22.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It turns out there are few
resources for the
middle class.

51:22.980 --> 51:28.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We found palatial residences
like the one
I think of as villa grande with
wine tastings

51:29.019 --> 51:35.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and white table dining, or villa
even more
grande with personal butlers and
architectural

51:35.926 --> 51:39.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
layouts named for Picasso and
Renoir.

51:39.330 --> 51:44.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Michelangelo was the size of
New Hampshire.

51:44.735 --> 51:48.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I started waking up in the
middle of the night
just to search the Web.

51:48.105 --> 51:52.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just how much are kidneys going
for these
days?

51:52.810 --> 51:59.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My parents had champagne taste,
but were on
a box wine budget, and the place
that we found

51:59.116 --> 52:00.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was something of a letdown.

52:00.818 --> 52:02.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It wasn't the most up-to-date.

52:02.786 --> 52:08.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was hard for them to get used
to the traffic
sounds and the bright lights
outside the facility.

52:08.425 --> 52:10.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My parents were Jewish, but not
observant.

52:10.861 --> 52:17.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my father was caught on more
than one
occasion smuggling bacon into
the kosher cafeteria,

52:17.901 --> 52:22.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
while my mother found it
upsetting that, at
the exercise class, which
included people

52:22.673 --> 52:29.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in wheelchairs, they played the
song "Don't
Get Around Much Anymore."

52:29.213 --> 52:31.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There were small victories.

52:31.048 --> 52:36.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My mother lobbied for K.C. and
the Sunshine
Band, so the still ambulatory
residents could

52:36.320 --> 52:42.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shake, shake, shake, shake,
shake, shake their
booty every Tuesday and Thursday
morning.

52:42.593 --> 52:47.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But my mother still had trouble
making friends,
because depression can keep you
trapped inside

52:47.197 --> 52:48.999 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your shell.

52:49.033 --> 52:53.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now I was waking up in the
middle of the night
wondering if I should move
closer to them,

52:53.270 --> 52:58.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but my son was in high school,
and I'm a writer
and performer who is often on
the road.

52:58.942 --> 53:02.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then something remarkable
happened.

53:02.746 --> 53:09.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My father's health deteriorated,
and this
community rallied around them,
visiting, helping

53:09.953 --> 53:14.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out, making sure that my mother
had someone
to have meals with.

53:14.191 --> 53:21.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One night, my mother's new BFF,
Helen, and
I went for a stroll, and she
took my arm.

53:21.231 --> 53:26.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I had no idea what had
happened in Helen's
life that had brought her to the
same place

53:26.403 --> 53:35.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as my mother, who she loved or
who loved her,
but I took my first deep breath
in months.

53:35.712 --> 53:38.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Villa grande wouldn't have been
right.

53:38.482 --> 53:41.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My house wouldn't have been
right.

53:41.185 --> 53:47.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They found a family, which was
more than what
any of us could have hoped for.

53:47.157 --> 53:53.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online right
now: When is a laugh not a real
laugh?

53:53.697 --> 53:58.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before her death, writer and
civil rights
activist Maya Angelou reflected
on the inspiration

53:58.869 --> 54:05.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for one of her most enduring
poems, a story
that's featured in a new PBS
"American Masters"

54:05.075 --> 54:06.176 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
documentary.

54:06.210 --> 54:10.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We take a look at it on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

54:10.447 --> 54:12.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And tune in later tonight on
PBS.

54:12.116 --> 54:16.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A new "Frontline," "Out of
Gitmo," tracks
down what life is like for those
released

54:16.920 --> 54:19.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from America's most
controversial prison.

54:19.723 --> 54:20.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

54:20.991 --> 54:22.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:22.159 --> 54:23.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

evening.

54:34.071 --> 54:42.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
