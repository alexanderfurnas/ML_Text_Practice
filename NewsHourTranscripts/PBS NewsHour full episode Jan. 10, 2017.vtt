JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.372 --> 00:06.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.607 --> 00:10.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: from
torture to
banning Muslims.

00:10.077 --> 00:15.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At his confirmation hearing to
be the next
attorney general, Senator Jeff
Sessions lays

00:15.682 --> 00:20.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
out legal limits to
president-elect Trump's
campaign statements.

00:20.087 --> 00:26.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, our series The Obama Years
continues
with a look at the president's
legacy on criminal

00:26.059 --> 00:27.794 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
justice.

00:27.828 --> 00:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And how integrating arts in the
classroom
helps turn around poorly
performing schools.

00:33.433 --> 00:39.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALFRE WOODARD, Actress: Art
completes not
only the education, but it
completes the human

00:39.439 --> 00:43.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being, our ability to create,
and to express
that creation.

00:43.710 --> 00:47.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:47.547 --> 00:51.752 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:51.785 --> 01:03.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's opening day
of confirmation
season for team Trump.

01:03.797 --> 01:08.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Senator Jeff Sessions, the
nominee for
attorney general, was leadoff
man.

01:08.702 --> 01:13.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He went before colleagues on the
Senate Judiciary
Committee, defending his views
on race and

01:13.640 --> 01:18.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
civil rights and, at times,
separating himself
from the man who chose him.

01:18.779 --> 01:20.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins begins our
coverage.

01:20.881 --> 01:27.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Alabama Senator
Jeff Sessions
walked into his hearing to some
as a longtime,

01:27.454 --> 01:34.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
accomplished senator unfairly
accused of prejudice,
to others, as an extreme
conservative who

01:34.728 --> 01:36.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
stokes racial divide.

01:36.763 --> 01:41.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In his opening remarks, the
attorney general
hopeful laid out his theme to
both sides,

01:41.468 --> 01:43.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying he would put the law
above his own
views.

01:43.904 --> 01:45.405 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS (R-AL), Attorney
General Nominee:
I have always loved the law.

01:46.506 --> 01:50.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is the very foundation of our
great country.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the exceptional foundation
of America.

01:53.013 --> 01:58.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But Sessions'
politics and
view of the law have sparked
furious opposition.

01:58.385 --> 02:04.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 1986, accusations of racially
insensitive
remarks and actions led the
Senate to reject

02:04.658 --> 02:05.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
him for a federal judgeship.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.761 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D),
California: And the
committee has received letters
of opposition

02:09.930 --> 02:16.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from 400 different civil rights
organizations,
1,400 law professors.

02:16.370 --> 02:22.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Today, ranking
Democrat California's
Dianne Feinstein opened by
pointing to fears

02:22.109 --> 02:26.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Sessions wouldn't enforce
laws fairly
to all.

02:26.113 --> 02:28.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Sessions insisted the
accusations were all
false.

02:28.281 --> 02:29.549 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:29.583 --> 02:35.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS: This caricature
of me in 1986
was not correct.

02:35.088 --> 02:37.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have become United States
attorney.

02:37.591 --> 02:44.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I supported, as the civil rights
attorney
said, major civil rights cases
in my districts.

02:44.831 --> 02:54.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The hearing was
interrupted
regularly by protesters raising
an array of

02:54.341 --> 02:58.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
concerns, from civil rights to
immigration
to marijuana policy.

02:58.512 --> 03:03.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Committee Democrats like largely
withheld
fire today, instead focusing on
questions

03:03.483 --> 03:05.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about major issues like
abortion.

03:05.052 --> 03:06.753 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:06.787 --> 03:10.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANNE FEINSTEIN: You have
referred to Roe
vs. Wade as -- quote -- "one of
the worst,

03:10.390 --> 03:16.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
colossally erroneous Supreme
Court decisions
of all time" -- end quote.

03:16.396 --> 03:17.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that still your view?

03:17.998 --> 03:18.965 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:18.999 --> 03:19.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFF SESSIONS: It is.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is law of the land.

03:21.334 --> 03:25.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has been so established and
settled for
quite a long time.

03:25.138 --> 03:28.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it deserves respect, and I
would respect
it and follow it.

03:28.642 --> 03:34.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This was
Sessions' refrain:
His view hasn't changed; his job
would.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Similarly, on same-sex marriage.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.784 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:37.818 --> 03:41.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS: The five justices
on the Supreme
Court, a majority of the court,
has established

03:41.288 --> 03:45.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the definition of marriage for
the entire
United States of America.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I will follow that decision.

03:47.461 --> 03:48.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: And on
water-boarding.

03:48.628 --> 03:50.363 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:50.397 --> 03:53.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS: Congress has
taken an action
now that makes it absolutely
improper and

03:53.867 --> 04:02.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
illegal to use water-boarding or
any form
of torture in the United States
by our military

04:02.042 --> 04:04.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and by all other departments and
agencies.

04:04.978 --> 04:09.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It was on
immigration, an
issue where Sessions will have
tremendous

04:09.316 --> 04:11.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
power, that he took a staunch
stand.

04:11.118 --> 04:13.086 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:13.120 --> 04:19.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS: I do believe that
if you continually
go through a cycle of amnesty,
that you undermine

04:19.126 --> 04:25.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the respect for the law and
encourage more
illegal immigration into
America.

04:25.499 --> 04:28.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I believe the American people
spoke clearly
in this election.

04:28.735 --> 04:31.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I believe they agreed with my
basic view.

04:31.271 --> 04:35.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: One question
was asked by
both parties: How would Sessions
handle any

04:35.408 --> 04:39.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cases involving president-elect
Trump and
his family?

04:39.246 --> 04:42.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sessions insisted he would
resign, rather
than do something unlawful.

04:42.682 --> 04:46.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Later, Democratic Senator
Sheldon Whitehouse
asked about Russia.

04:46.052 --> 04:47.854 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHELDON WHITEHOUSE (D), Rhode
Island: Will
the Department of Justice and
the FBI under

04:49.756 --> 04:56.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your administration be allowed
to continue
to investigate the Russian
connection, even

04:56.730 --> 05:01.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if it leads to the Trump camp
and Trump interests
and associates?

05:01.635 --> 05:05.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Sessions didn't
answer directly,
and brought up another country.

05:05.872 --> 05:07.507 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:07.541 --> 05:12.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS: If there are laws
violated
and they can be prosecuted, then
of course

05:12.379 --> 05:15.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you will have to handle that in
an appropriate
way.

05:15.348 --> 05:23.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would say that the problem may
turn out
to be, as in the Chinese hacking
of hundreds

05:23.990 --> 05:29.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of thousands of maybe millions,
of records,
it has to be handled at a
political level.

05:29.930 --> 05:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Sessions told
the committee
he would recuse himself on cases
involving

05:33.633 --> 05:37.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton's e-mail, but
asked if he'd
recuse himself from any Trump
investigations?

05:38.004 --> 05:39.706 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:39.739 --> 05:44.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS: I would review it
and try to
do the right thing as to whether
or not it

05:44.077 --> 05:48.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
should stay within the
jurisdiction of the
attorney general or not.

05:48.982 --> 05:52.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And we may see
more drama
and strong words tomorrow.

05:52.419 --> 05:56.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's when there will be
witnesses for and
against Mr. Sessions.

05:56.156 --> 06:00.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa, thanks,
along with other
nominee confirmations.

06:00.660 --> 06:06.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Lisa, separately today, the
president-elect
told The New York Times in an
interview that

06:06.066 --> 06:12.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he wants Republicans in Congress
to replace
Obamacare, the Affordable Care
Act, at the

06:12.472 --> 06:16.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
same time or very shortly after
they repeal
it.

06:16.476 --> 06:20.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How does that square with what
Republicans
are thinking and planning to do?

06:20.313 --> 06:23.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's
certainly been the
other big headline on Capitol
Hill today.

06:23.316 --> 06:27.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is at odds with the direction
Republicans
had been going in.

06:27.354 --> 06:31.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, the repeal itself
seems likely
to happen some time perhaps by
the end of

06:31.391 --> 06:36.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
January, at its fastest, and
replacement,
Republicans haven't agreed on a
timeline for

06:36.129 --> 06:38.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, some of them looking at
even maybe this
summer.

06:38.965 --> 06:43.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now we have had word from
the House Republican
Speaker Paul Ryan today, saying
he hopes to

06:43.503 --> 06:48.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
add in some concurrent elements
of the replace
as they repeal.

06:48.908 --> 06:53.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, all in all, Judy, this
is sort of
the longtime Republican leaders
in Congress

06:53.246 --> 06:59.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coming, perhaps clashing with to
some degree
the new Republican president to
be.

06:59.686 --> 07:03.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, just quickly,
Lisa, this
could mean a delay in the repeal
vote?

07:03.390 --> 07:06.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: No, I don't
think so, but
I think what it means, it will
be very difficult

07:06.860 --> 07:10.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to meet Donald Trump's timeline
of an immediate
repeal.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The repeal itself is probably
still weeks
away.

07:12.465 --> 07:16.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa Desjardins
at the Capitol,
thank you.

07:16.936 --> 07:22.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: A
federal jury sentenced
Dylann Roof to death for killing
nine black

07:22.242 --> 07:25.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
worshipers at a church in
Charleston, South
Carolina.

07:25.745 --> 07:31.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The white supremacist
represented himself,
but he presented no case and
didn't ask the

07:31.284 --> 07:33.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
jury to spare his life.

07:33.153 --> 07:37.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Afterward, one man whose sister
was killed
called the verdict a hollow
victory.

07:38.024 --> 07:41.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MELVIN GRAHAM, Brother of
Victim: My sister
is still gone.

07:42.028 --> 07:49.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wish that this verdict could
have brought
her back, but it can't.

07:49.369 --> 07:58.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what it can do is just send
a message
to those who feel the way he
feels that this

07:58.678 --> 08:01.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
community will not tolerate it.

08:01.114 --> 08:05.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Roof is the first
person sentenced
to die for a federal hate crime.

08:06.019 --> 08:09.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He still faces murder charges in
state court.

08:09.823 --> 08:14.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama is back home
tonight in Chicago
for his farewell address to the
nation.

08:14.661 --> 08:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is expected to reflect on his
eight years
in office before an audience of
thousands

08:19.766 --> 08:21.568 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of supporters.

08:21.601 --> 08:25.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a Facebook post today, he
previewed his
message, saying -- quote -- "We
have reaffirmed

08:25.805 --> 08:30.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the belief that we can make a
difference with
our own hands, in our own time."

08:30.810 --> 08:35.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PBS will have special live
coverage of the
president's speech later
tonight.

08:35.915 --> 08:41.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The man in line to be the next
secretary of
homeland security says building
barriers along

08:41.154 --> 08:43.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Mexican border is not
enough.

08:44.023 --> 08:48.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Retired Marine General John F.
Kelly had his
Senate confirmation hearing
today.

08:48.762 --> 08:54.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among the questions: What about
president-elect
Trump's promise to build a
border wall?

08:54.334 --> 08:56.169 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KELLY (RET.), Homeland
Security Secretary
Nominee: Certainly, as a
military person that

08:57.971 --> 09:02.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
understands defense and
defenses, a physical
barrier, in and of itself, will
not do the

09:02.575 --> 09:03.543 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
job.

09:03.576 --> 09:05.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It has to be, really, a layered
defense.

09:05.645 --> 09:09.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you were to build a wall from
the Pacific
to the Gulf of Mexico, you would
still have

09:09.749 --> 09:15.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to back that wall up with
patrolling by human
beings, by sensors, by
observation devices.

09:15.355 --> 09:20.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kelly also said
he doesn't
support the idea of a registry
for Muslims

09:20.527 --> 09:23.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or for other religious groups.

09:23.096 --> 09:28.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Afghanistan, nearly 40 people
died today
in a pair of bombings that
rocked Kabul.

09:28.067 --> 09:30.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Taliban claimed
responsibility.

09:30.336 --> 09:35.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The blasts erupted near the
Afghan parliament
complex during evening rush
hour.

09:35.241 --> 09:39.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In addition to the dead, more
than 70 others
were wounded.

09:39.913 --> 09:44.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thousands of people in Northern
California
remain under evacuation orders
tonight, as

09:44.451 --> 09:47.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
heavy rain and snow roll over
the region.

09:47.854 --> 09:52.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even police vehicles got stuck
in the Sierra
Nevada Mountains, where up to 10
feet of snow

09:52.959 --> 09:57.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was falling, and even ski
resorts had to shut
down.

09:57.096 --> 10:02.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Elsewhere, flooding in Sonoma
County is now
the worst in a decade, forcing
officials to

10:02.435 --> 10:06.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
open a Sacramento dam for the
first time since
2005.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Wall Street mostly marked time
today.

10:09.909 --> 10:15.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost nearly
32 points to close at 19855.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 20 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
was unchanged.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the newly crowned champions
of college
football are back home in
Clemson, South Carolina,

10:18.618 --> 10:20.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tonight, after an epic victory
over Alabama.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Tigers scored last night
with one second
left on the clock to win 35 to
31.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was a rematch of last year's
title game,
when Alabama won.

10:23.490 --> 10:27.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
U.S. intelligence
chiefs lay out the case of
Russian hacking;

10:27.460 --> 10:32.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iran mourns the loss of an
influential moderate
voice; President Obama's efforts
to reform

10:32.966 --> 10:47.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the nation's criminal justice
system; and
much more.

10:47.947 --> 10:53.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The nation's top intelligence
officials appeared
before the Senate Intelligence
Committee today,

10:53.286 --> 10:59.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just days after the release of a
report on
the alleged role of Russian
influence during

10:59.526 --> 11:05.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the 2016 election and intrusion
into both
Democratic and Republican
networks.

11:05.398 --> 11:06.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Margaret Warner reports.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.201 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

11:08.234 --> 11:13.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK WARNER (D), Virginia: Now,
in any of
your careers, have you ever seen
this level

11:13.039 --> 11:16.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Russian interference in our
political process?

11:16.176 --> 11:18.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will start with Director
Comey, and
just go down the line.

11:18.244 --> 11:19.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY, FBI Director: No.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.047 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: I have not.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.048 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
MAN: No.

11:22.081 --> 11:23.816 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
MAN: No.

11:23.850 --> 11:27.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: It was a
unified response
from America's top intelligence
officers in

11:27.420 --> 11:33.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their first public appearance
since releasing
an unclassified report
describing a coordinated

11:33.259 --> 11:37.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian effort to disrupt the
2016 presidential
election.

11:37.630 --> 11:42.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The report released Friday
determined with
-- quote -- "high confidence"
that Russian

11:42.335 --> 11:47.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Vladimir Putin ordered
the hack
of American political
organizations, focused

11:47.774 --> 11:52.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Democrats, that it was
designed to aid
president-elect Donald Trump and
discredit

11:52.712 --> 11:57.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his Democratic rival, Hillary
Clinton, and
that stolen information was then
delivered

11:57.917 --> 12:01.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to WikiLeaks, and other groups,
which published
it online.

12:01.821 --> 12:06.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The report stopped short of
providing the
evidence underlying those
judgments.

12:06.392 --> 12:11.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That remained the case today,
with Director
of National Intelligence James
Clapper saying,

12:11.331 --> 12:13.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to disclose more would
jeopardize sources.

12:13.866 --> 12:18.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAMES CLAPPER, National
Intelligence Director:
We are very dependent on --
given the nature

12:18.271 --> 12:25.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of intelligence work to start
with you, very
dependent on you, as our
overseers, to look

12:25.078 --> 12:27.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at that yourselves on behalf of
the electorate.

12:27.513 --> 12:31.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Committee
chair, Senator
Richard Burr, also said he would
investigate

12:31.584 --> 12:35.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leaks to the media about the
report in advance
of its release.

12:35.955 --> 12:40.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FBI Director James Comey
declined to say if
there is an investigation into
whether the

12:41.027 --> 12:45.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian government communicated
with anyone
in the Trump team.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That raised eyebrows with some
members.

12:47.333 --> 12:51.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: In a public forum,
we never confirm
or deny a pending investigation.

12:51.170 --> 12:52.972 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

12:53.006 --> 12:58.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGUS KING (I), Maine: The irony
of your making
that statement here, I cannot
avoid, but I

12:58.511 --> 13:00.079 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
will move on.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: Well, we sometimes
think differently
about closed investigations.

13:02.048 --> 13:05.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you asked me if I had any
pending investigations,
and we're not going to talk
about that.

13:05.418 --> 13:09.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: That was a
veiled reference
to Comey's decision to speak
publicly before

13:09.455 --> 13:15.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the election about the FBI's
investigation
into Hillary Clinton's private
e-mail server.

13:15.762 --> 13:19.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also at question, whether the
hacks altered
the outcome of the election.

13:19.766 --> 13:23.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trump team has characterized
the report
as saying the hacking had no
effect on the

13:23.903 --> 13:25.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
election results.

13:25.338 --> 13:29.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But, in fact, the report
explicitly said it
made no judgment on that.

13:29.742 --> 13:34.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It did say there is no evidence
that voting
machinery or counting was
affected.

13:34.447 --> 13:40.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CIA Director John Brennan also
said he had
recently discussed the hacking
with his Russian

13:40.119 --> 13:41.954 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
counterpart.

13:41.988 --> 13:45.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN, CIA Director: And
told him clearly
that if Russia was doing this,
they're playing

13:45.825 --> 13:47.593 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with fire.

13:47.627 --> 13:50.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He denied any type of activity
along these
lines, but I made it very clear
to him that,

13:50.196 --> 13:52.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
basically, we're onto them.

13:52.098 --> 13:56.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Separately, a
group of 10
senators from both parties
introduced legislation

13:56.269 --> 13:58.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seeking to broaden sanctions on
Russia.

13:58.137 --> 14:04.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

14:04.444 --> 14:16.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This morning, I
sat down with
outgoing Secretary of State John
Kerry at

14:16.122 --> 14:18.124 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the U.S. Institute of Peace.

14:18.157 --> 14:23.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He was one of many Obama
administration officials
participating in an event called
Passing the

14:23.429 --> 14:27.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Baton, focused on a smooth
transition between
administrations.

14:27.900 --> 14:31.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I began by asking him just how
smoothly the
transition to the Trump team is
going.

14:31.971 --> 14:35.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: Well,
it's going pretty smoothly
because there's

14:35.608 --> 14:37.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not an enormous amount of it.

14:37.777 --> 14:41.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are some people that have
been in the
building for a period of time.

14:41.814 --> 14:49.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, quite candidly, I
think there
has not been a lot of high-level
exchange

14:49.088 --> 14:50.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at this point in time.

14:50.623 --> 14:56.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm still expecting to meet with
my successor
at some point in the near term.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You haven't met
with him yet?

14:58.397 --> 15:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN KERRY: No, I haven't met
with him yet.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you expect to?

15:02.034 --> 15:03.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN KERRY: I do.

15:03.970 --> 15:08.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What are the one
or two things
that you wish you had known in
the very beginning

15:08.808 --> 15:11.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that you only learned later and
maybe painfully?

15:11.511 --> 15:22.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY: What troubles me a
little bit
is that people are not
separating a remarkable

15:22.255 --> 15:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
transformation that is taking
place globally
naturally from things that we're
really responsible

15:34.734 --> 15:35.668 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for.

15:35.701 --> 15:38.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let me give you an example, Arab
Spring.

15:38.905 --> 15:40.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We didn't start the Arab Spring.

15:40.706 --> 15:43.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We couldn't have stopped the
Arab Spring,
particularly with respect to
Syria.

15:43.776 --> 15:47.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think there are some
things that might
have been able to have been
done.

15:47.847 --> 15:50.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that had nothing to do with
the red line.

15:50.716 --> 15:54.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And let's make that absolutely
clear, folks.

15:54.821 --> 15:58.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama never retreated
from his red
line.

15:58.691 --> 16:05.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He never changed his mind about
his readiness
to bomb Assad to make it clear,
you don't

16:05.531 --> 16:08.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
use chemical weapons, never.

16:08.501 --> 16:11.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a mythology that's grown
up around
this.

16:11.337 --> 16:19.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the greatest challenges
we all face
right now, not just America, but
every country

16:19.045 --> 16:29.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the world, is, we are living
in a factless
political environment.

16:29.822 --> 16:38.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And every country in the world
better stop
and start worrying about
authoritarian populism

16:38.130 --> 16:45.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the absence of substance in
our dialogue,
if you call it that.

16:45.538 --> 16:47.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What can the U.S.
do about
that?

16:47.506 --> 16:49.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN KERRY: Well, we're going to
have to fight
for it.

16:49.709 --> 16:54.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think a lot of people are
struggling with
the, what do you do about it?

16:54.247 --> 17:04.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If policy is going to be made in
140 characters
on Twitter, and every reasonable
measurement

17:04.090 --> 17:10.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of accountability is being
bypassed, and people
don't care about it, we have a
problem.

17:10.696 --> 17:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's not just our problem
here in the
United States.

17:14.433 --> 17:16.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's all over the world.

17:16.202 --> 17:20.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Secretary Kerry
also called
for a new Marshall Plan to help
countries

17:20.806 --> 17:26.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in critical regions around the
world educate
their exploding youth
populations and prevent

17:26.712 --> 17:40.293 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them from being radicalized.

17:40.326 --> 17:45.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Sunday, one of the founders
of the Islamic
Revolution in Iran died at age
82.

17:45.798 --> 17:53.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani
helped to lead
the 1979 uprising, and went on
to serve both

17:53.139 --> 17:58.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as the powerful speaker of the
parliament
and as Iran's president in the
1980s.

17:58.511 --> 18:03.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was also a mentor of their
current president,
Hassan Rouhani, who will be up
for reelection

18:03.983 --> 18:05.618 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this May.

18:05.651 --> 18:11.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining me now to discuss
Rafsanjani, his
influence and Iran going forward
is Karim

18:11.123 --> 18:12.558 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Sadjadpour.

18:12.591 --> 18:15.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a senior fellow at the
Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Karim, thank you for being back
with us.

18:17.496 --> 18:18.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARIM SADJADPOUR, Carnegie
Endowment For International
Peace: Thank you.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.865 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you, Judy.

18:19.899 --> 18:22.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What made
Rafsanjani the influential
figure that he was?

18:22.268 --> 18:26.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARIM SADJADPOUR: Well, to
begin, he was a
close confidant of the father of
the Islamic

18:26.472 --> 18:29.108 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Revolution, Ayatollah Khomeini.

18:29.141 --> 18:34.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think what was unique
about Rafsanjani
was that he was always the
cleric in Iran

18:34.213 --> 18:38.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who was interested in putting
the country's
interests, namely, its economic
interests,

18:38.684 --> 18:41.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
before revolutionary ideology.

18:41.754 --> 18:47.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he ultimately lost that
battle against
the current supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali

18:47.326 --> 18:51.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Khamenei, who always believed
that the revolutionary
ideology should come first.

18:51.397 --> 18:55.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, as you
wrote, you have
written in the last couple of
days, he helped

18:55.901 --> 19:01.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to put Khamenei, the current
ayatollah, in
power, but almost immediately
started trying

19:01.340 --> 19:03.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to get him out of power.

19:03.409 --> 19:04.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a fascinating story.

19:04.410 --> 19:06.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KARIM SADJADPOUR: It really is.

19:06.178 --> 19:09.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I call it Shiite Shakespeare,
like a Shakespearian
epic, because he was the
kingmaker.

19:09.849 --> 19:16.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He made Khamenei supreme leader
in 1989, thinking
that he could -- he would be
weak and pliant

19:16.956 --> 19:19.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Rafsanjani could control
him.

19:19.125 --> 19:23.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think he spent the last
three decades
of his life trying to wrestle
power back from

19:23.429 --> 19:24.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Khomeini, unsuccessfully.

19:24.764 --> 19:29.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: They were two
very different
men, weren't they?

19:29.468 --> 19:32.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why was one successful and the
other one wasn't
ultimately?

19:32.304 --> 19:36.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARIM SADJADPOUR: Well, I think,
ultimately,
what was -- what made Khamenei
successful

19:36.409 --> 19:41.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, I think he understood an
important Machiavellian
rule, which is, in authoritarian
regimes,

19:41.714 --> 19:44.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's much more important to be
feared than
to be loved.

19:44.583 --> 19:50.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Khamenei very carefully over
the last
couple decades had cultivated
the military,

19:50.289 --> 19:53.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Revolutionary Guard, and so
that was deeply
helpful to him.

19:53.793 --> 20:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, whereas
Khamenei had a reputation
for being financially clean,
Rafsanjani and

20:01.000 --> 20:06.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his family had a terrible
reputation of being
economically corrupt, which
provoked a lot

20:06.639 --> 20:08.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of popular resentment against
them.

20:08.441 --> 20:13.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Resentment, and
yet you're
telling us his death means a
great deal for

20:13.979 --> 20:15.748 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Iran.

20:15.781 --> 20:19.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARIM SADJADPOUR: Well, yes, he
was one of
the pillars, the last two
remaining pillars

20:19.318 --> 20:25.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the 1979 revolution who
played a very important
role as a mentor to the younger
generation

20:25.391 --> 20:29.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of technocrats, and, as you
mentioned, President
Hassan Rouhani.

20:29.295 --> 20:34.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And he was kind of a
counterweight against
more radical forces in Iran.

20:34.500 --> 20:38.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that obituary writers
are very confused
about Rafsanjani, because, on
one hand, he

20:38.971 --> 20:41.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was someone who had blood on his
hands.

20:41.240 --> 20:45.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He ordered the killing of
dissidents and intellectuals
within Iran.

20:45.377 --> 20:48.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was implicated in terrorist
operations
overseas.

20:48.481 --> 20:53.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the same time, in the
context of the
Islamic Republic of Iran, he was
more moderate

20:53.853 --> 20:55.321 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than his peers.

20:55.354 --> 20:58.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, that was my
next question:
How moderate was he truly?

20:58.224 --> 21:03.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARIM SADJADPOUR: So, in a
Western liberal
context, he wasn't a
Jeffersonian democrat,

21:03.295 --> 21:08.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but in the context of Iran, as I
said, he
favored putting the country's
economic interests

21:08.534 --> 21:14.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before revolutionary ideology,
which meant
things that -- that he was
supportive of detente

21:14.206 --> 21:15.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with the United States.

21:15.841 --> 21:20.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was supportive of a cordial
relationship
with Saudi Arabia.

21:20.079 --> 21:27.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he differed on these issues
of revolutionary
ideology, in contrast to the
supreme leader.

21:27.453 --> 21:32.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I think we
mentioned he was
a mentor to the current
president, President

21:32.291 --> 21:33.492 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Rouhani.

21:33.526 --> 21:36.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what does it mean now that
he's gone from
the scene?

21:36.595 --> 21:39.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you expect to see in the
months to
come?

21:39.899 --> 21:43.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARIM SADJADPOUR: I think May
2017 will be
the first litmus test.

21:44.003 --> 21:45.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's Iran's presidential
elections.

21:45.905 --> 21:49.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we have learned in the
United States
that predicting presidential
elections even...

21:49.275 --> 21:51.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We have learned
that.

21:51.110 --> 21:53.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARIM SADJADPOUR: We have
learned -- even
in a democratic system is
difficult, let alone

21:53.546 --> 21:56.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in an opaque, authoritarian
system like Iran.

21:56.982 --> 22:03.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, I made the comparison,
I make the
comparison with Bill Clinton.

22:03.822 --> 22:07.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Rafsanjani was an elder
statesman of Iranian
politics.

22:07.426 --> 22:09.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He served as president of the
country.

22:09.762 --> 22:12.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But his political -- he didn't
have a political
future.

22:12.598 --> 22:14.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He had a prominent past.

22:14.967 --> 22:20.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I ultimately don't think
that this
is a game-changer for Iran, in
that the powers

22:20.472 --> 22:25.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that be currently, the supreme
leader, the
Revolutionary Guards, are going
to remain

22:25.678 --> 22:27.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the main powers that be.

22:27.346 --> 22:30.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, an influential
counterweight
against them has now been
removed.

22:30.316 --> 22:34.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Karim Sadjadpour,
thank you
very much.

22:34.787 --> 22:43.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KARIM SADJADPOUR: Thank you,
Judy.

22:43.629 --> 22:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

22:48.133 --> 22:53.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
what to expect
from President Obama's farewell
address; and

22:53.505 --> 22:58.477 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
using art to boost math skills.

22:58.510 --> 23:04.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: As president, Mr.
Obama made a
pledge to shine a light on mass
incarceration

23:04.183 --> 23:06.118 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and criminal justice issues.

23:06.151 --> 23:11.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among other things, he has used
his executive
power to grant clemency to more
people than

23:11.323 --> 23:13.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
any other president in modern
history.

23:13.659 --> 23:19.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As part of our series The Obama
Years, the
"NewsHour"'s Hari Sreenivasan
begins our coverage.

23:19.231 --> 23:24.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NORMAN BROWN, Released Prisoner:
"Dear Norman,
I wanted to personally inform
you that I will

23:24.703 --> 23:26.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be granting your application for
commutation."

23:27.006 --> 23:30.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Norman Brown
is reading
the letter from President Obama
that gave

23:30.609 --> 23:32.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
him his life back.

23:32.645 --> 23:37.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For 24.5 years, he was in
federal prison for
selling drugs in Washington,
D.C., specifically

23:37.950 --> 23:40.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
six counts of distributing
cocaine.

23:40.452 --> 23:43.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was his third strike, and
that meant life
without parole.

23:43.355 --> 23:47.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NORMAN BROWN: I never thought
that I would
get no more than maybe 15 years.

23:47.359 --> 23:51.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: While he was
in prison,
his parents, his grandmother,
his brother

23:51.730 --> 23:56.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all died, his children grew up,
and the men
sentenced with him were
released.

23:56.635 --> 24:05.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NORMAN BROWN: I wanted to get
out to prove
to people that I had a monster
sentence, but

24:05.344 --> 24:07.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I wasn't a monster.

24:07.146 --> 24:11.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Brown took
classes, taught
others, earned certificates for
trade skills

24:11.517 --> 24:13.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and was a model prisoner.

24:13.319 --> 24:17.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
It is my strong belief that, by
exercising

24:17.489 --> 24:25.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these presidential powers, I
have the chance
to show people what a second
chance can look

24:25.097 --> 24:26.965 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
like.

24:26.999 --> 24:29.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The president
explained
his motivation this year at a
lunch with clemency

24:29.635 --> 24:31.437 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
recipients, including Brown.

24:31.470 --> 24:37.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2014, Mr. Obama began a
large-scale clemency
project, reducing the sentences
of mostly

24:37.710 --> 24:43.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nonviolent drug offenders, after
his administration's
efforts to overhaul the criminal
justice system

24:43.649 --> 24:45.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
failed in Congress the previous
year.

24:45.718 --> 24:49.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NORMAN BROWN: And being an
example for you
all is a part of my duty.

24:49.955 --> 24:52.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Brown has been
out for a
year now.

24:52.524 --> 24:56.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He mentors kids in the juvenile
justice system
as a volunteer for the
Washington Department

24:56.829 --> 25:01.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Youth Rehabilitation Services
and helps
former prisoners like him
reenter society.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NORMAN BROWN: It's about growing
up.

25:03.836 --> 25:07.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Steve
Wasserman of the National
Association of Assistant U.S.
Attorneys defends

25:07.740 --> 25:12.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the strict sentencing guidelines
that put
people like Brown behind bars
for so long.

25:12.745 --> 25:14.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN WASSERMAN, National
Association of
Assistant U.S. Attorneys: When
you look at

25:14.279 --> 25:19.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
recidivism rates in this
country, they range
anywhere from 50 to 75 percent.

25:19.184 --> 25:23.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The statistics would indicate
that a large
number of them will reoffend.

25:23.956 --> 25:32.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they will reoffend in a
variety of different
ways, which will victimize
people, the public.

25:32.064 --> 25:34.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's where our core
concern is.

25:34.233 --> 25:39.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: President
Obama has received
more than 35,000 petitions for
clemency in

25:39.171 --> 25:41.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the past eight years.

25:41.240 --> 25:51.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's granted 1,324; 1,176 of
those are commutations
that simply shorten a sentence;
148 are presidential

25:52.017 --> 25:58.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
pardons, which forgive a
person's conviction
and reinstate civil liberties,
like voting.

25:58.157 --> 26:03.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are still 12,000
commutation petitions
awaiting a decision before the
end of Obama's

26:03.729 --> 26:04.997 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
term.

26:05.030 --> 26:07.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Darren Perkins (ph) has filed
for one.

26:07.132 --> 26:12.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 1993, he was sentenced to
life without
parole on conspiracy charges for
distribution

26:12.771 --> 26:15.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of crack cocaine in Washington,
D.C.

26:15.908 --> 26:19.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mandatory guidelines in effect
at the time
made it difficult to sentence
him with anything

26:19.311 --> 26:22.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
less than life in prison without
parole.

26:22.381 --> 26:27.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Perkins' family still lives in
the same D.C.
neighborhood and has stood by
him for the

26:27.085 --> 26:31.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
almost 26 years that he's been
locked up.

26:31.356 --> 26:34.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His youngest child, Brandi
Patterson, was
born after Perkins'
incarceration.

26:34.593 --> 26:37.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANDI PATTERSON, Daughter of
Inmate: My dad's
been in jail for 26 years.

26:37.062 --> 26:39.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that he's definitely
served his debt.

26:39.231 --> 26:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's paid his debt to society.

26:41.533 --> 26:43.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he wasn't able to see his
children grow.

26:43.869 --> 26:47.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I feel like the little bit
of time that
he does have left with us, that
he should

26:47.239 --> 26:49.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be able to experience it
physically.

26:49.308 --> 26:54.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Perkins'
eldest son, Delonte
Simon, knows his father was far
from perfect,

26:54.112 --> 26:57.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but wonders what life would be
like if his
arrest never happened.

26:57.716 --> 27:02.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DELONTE SIMON, Son of Inmate: Me
and Brandi
talked about, if our father was
out, how would

27:02.921 --> 27:05.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we be or how would things be
with our family?

27:05.123 --> 27:06.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Would we be the same people?

27:06.124 --> 27:07.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Would our family be as strong as
it is now?

27:07.125 --> 27:08.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What, we don't know.

27:08.460 --> 27:12.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, at the end of the day,
everything happens
for a reason.

27:12.297 --> 27:15.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Even the judge
who sentenced
him to life sent a letter to the
president

27:15.934 --> 27:20.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying he would have imposed a
shorter sentence
if the law had allowed it.

27:20.339 --> 27:24.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Perkins told the "NewsHour" in
an e-mail from
prison that he will continue to
fight for

27:24.109 --> 27:28.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his freedom, but is unsure what
a Trump administration
will mean for his future.

27:28.580 --> 27:34.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: I am the
law and order candidate.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

27:36.154 --> 27:40.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
President-elect Trump has
been silent on his plans for
clemency, but

27:40.325 --> 27:45.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his pick for attorney general,
Senator Jeff
Sessions, made it clear in a
2014 press release

27:45.864 --> 27:48.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the current administration
has overstepped.

27:48.767 --> 27:52.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sessions called the president's
sentencing
reform efforts -- quote -- "a
thumb in the

27:52.404 --> 27:57.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eye of law enforcement officers,
prosecutors,
defense attorneys, judges, court
and prison

27:57.376 --> 27:59.177 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
personnel."

27:59.211 --> 28:03.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wasserman says the reason why
President Obama
is granting massive amounts of
clemency are

28:03.282 --> 28:05.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the major problem.

28:05.083 --> 28:10.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN WASSERMAN: He's granting
essentially
mass commutations simply because
he disagrees

28:10.989 --> 28:16.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the law as duly passed by
Congress.

28:16.895 --> 28:24.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we believe that that is an
historical
break from previous presidents'
exercise of

28:24.136 --> 28:25.904 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that power.

28:25.938 --> 28:29.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: While Perkins
and his family
wait and hope to receive a
letter from the

28:29.141 --> 28:30.943 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president...

28:30.976 --> 28:33.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NORMAN BROWN: "I am granting
your application
because you have demonstrated
the potential

28:33.612 --> 28:35.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to turn your life around."

28:35.280 --> 28:38.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: ... Norman
Brown knows the
responsibility that comes with
it.

28:38.750 --> 28:43.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even the president in his letter
tells you
people are going to doubt you,
whether you

28:43.755 --> 28:47.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are reformed, whether you can
live a clean,
good life.

28:47.693 --> 28:49.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, it's a challenge.

28:49.261 --> 28:50.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NORMAN BROWN: Yes.

28:50.462 --> 28:54.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I wouldn't want to let him
down.

28:54.266 --> 29:01.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wouldn't want to let --
because to let him
down means that the process of
clemency doesn't

29:01.740 --> 29:04.576 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
work.

29:04.610 --> 29:12.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I say that because of the
fact that, if
we are not given a second
chance, that means

29:12.050 --> 29:20.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of us who have talents
that society
can use will just dry-rot in
jail.

29:20.258 --> 29:22.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And society needs what we have
to offer.

29:22.461 --> 29:26.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes, we made a mistake, but who
hasn't?

29:26.098 --> 29:28.967 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
"So, good luck.

29:29.001 --> 29:29.935 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Godspeed.

29:29.968 --> 29:32.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sincerely yours, President
Obama."

29:32.671 --> 29:35.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For the "PBS
NewsHour,"
Hari Sreenivasan, Waldorf,
Maryland.

29:35.974 --> 29:40.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in addition
to the president's
record on executive clemency, we
wanted to

29:41.013 --> 29:45.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take a broader look at his
overall record
on criminal justice reform.

29:45.651 --> 29:47.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has that look.

29:47.552 --> 29:52.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: President
Obama often points
out that the U.S. is 5 percent
of the world's

29:52.557 --> 29:56.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
population, but has over 20
percent of the
world's prisoners.

29:56.194 --> 30:00.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His administration has tried
various initiatives
to change that reality.

30:00.065 --> 30:02.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But how successful has that
effort been?

30:02.367 --> 30:04.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm joined now by Wesley Lowery.

30:04.469 --> 30:09.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's a reporter for The
Washington Post who
won a Pulitzer Prize for his
work on policing,

30:09.307 --> 30:11.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and he's the author of the book
"They Can't
Kill Us All."

30:11.810 --> 30:13.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I'm joined by Bill McCollum.

30:13.979 --> 30:18.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a former congressman from
Florida and
former attorney general of the
state.

30:18.050 --> 30:19.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's now a lawyer in private
practice.

30:19.551 --> 30:21.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome, gentlemen, to you both.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wesley Lowery, I would like to
start with
you.

30:23.655 --> 30:28.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the things that is one of
the most
dramatic efforts that the Obama
administration

30:28.093 --> 30:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has made is the Department of
Justice intervening
in local police departments to
try to stamp

30:34.566 --> 30:36.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out what they see as abuses
there.

30:36.535 --> 30:40.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This has happened in almost two
dozen police
departments around the country.

30:40.472 --> 30:43.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Broadly speaking, can you tell
us, what are
they trying to do, and how
successful has

30:43.975 --> 30:45.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that effort been?

30:45.844 --> 30:48.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WESLEY LOWERY, The Washington
Post: What we
see in these cases has been a
very aggressive

30:48.046 --> 30:49.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Civil Rights Division of the
Department of
Justice.

30:49.948 --> 30:53.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what they would do in a
case like Ferguson
or Baltimore is send federal
investigators

30:53.952 --> 30:56.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to that town, to that city to
conduct investigations.

30:57.022 --> 30:59.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They would request reams of
data.

30:59.658 --> 31:01.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They would dig through internal
documents.

31:01.560 --> 31:05.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what they were essentially
doing is preparing
a prosecution document, these
reports that

31:05.697 --> 31:11.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you would see, in which the
Department of
Justice would lay out their case
for litigation.

31:11.103 --> 31:15.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They would argue that a police
department
is violating the civil rights of
its residents,

31:15.474 --> 31:19.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether it be through traffic
stops or through
use of force.

31:19.211 --> 31:23.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it would lay those things
out, essentially
with the threat to sue the city
and sue the

31:23.381 --> 31:25.117 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
department.

31:25.150 --> 31:28.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In order to prevent that
lawsuit, many of
these departments and these
cities would enter

31:28.286 --> 31:32.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what are called federal consent
decrees, and
so -- in which the city and
department agree

31:32.457 --> 31:36.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a certain set of reforms and
agree to some
type of federal monitoring for a
period of

31:36.895 --> 31:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time, something the Obama
administration has
used very aggressively in order
to try to

31:41.566 --> 31:44.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
force change to departments that
otherwise
might not have seen it, because
what we have

31:44.503 --> 31:48.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to remember is, the federal
government actually
has very little power over local
police departments,

31:48.807 --> 31:50.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
based on kind of our system of
government.

31:50.675 --> 31:53.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Policing is a small government,
local issue.

31:53.211 --> 31:56.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is one of the few ways that
the federal
government can actually make the
police in

31:56.281 --> 31:58.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
your town or your city behave
differently.

31:58.617 --> 32:01.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Bill McCollum,
I wonder
what your take on that is.

32:01.186 --> 32:06.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is your sense of how the
Obama administration
has handled its efforts to
reform police in

32:06.458 --> 32:08.360 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the country?

32:08.393 --> 32:09.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL MCCOLLUM, Former Florida
Attorney General:
Well, I don't think, first of
all, that the

32:09.861 --> 32:12.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
need of reform of police is very
strong.

32:12.063 --> 32:13.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But they have gone into a few
communities.

32:13.899 --> 32:17.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't doubt that, out of the
thousands of
local police and sheriff's
departments, there

32:17.068 --> 32:19.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are some that need some kind of
attention.

32:19.404 --> 32:23.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the biggest problem I see
with the Obama
administration's approach is
that it's all

32:23.441 --> 32:25.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
civil rights-focused.

32:25.377 --> 32:30.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It doesn't recognize the fact
that the police
overall do a terrific job and
need more support.

32:30.582 --> 32:35.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their morale is at an all-time
low today around
the country as a result of,
frankly, the president's

32:35.453 --> 32:39.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lack of leadership or his
misdirection in
that leadership in the face of
some very serious

32:39.825 --> 32:42.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
incidents that I think did need
some attention.

32:42.327 --> 32:46.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Wesley Lowery,
in defending
his own record, the president
this weekend

32:46.298 --> 32:51.736 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
cited that we have seen
historically low levels
of crime during his presidency.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Can the president take credit
for that?

32:54.005 --> 32:56.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is taking credit for it, but
is that a
legitimate thing to claim?

32:56.875 --> 33:01.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WESLEY LOWERY: You know, it is
certainly accurate
and true that we are seeing some
of the lowest

33:01.446 --> 33:04.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
levels of crime in the history
of the United
States of America.

33:04.082 --> 33:07.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Obama years are some of the
most peaceful
years in American history as it
relates to

33:07.853 --> 33:09.588 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
crime.

33:09.621 --> 33:12.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think New York City just had
the least violent
year in its modern recorded
history.

33:12.190 --> 33:17.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, that means very little to a
family living
in West Englewood, Chicago,
right, or in Englewood,

33:17.829 --> 33:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or in many of the neighborhoods
in Baltimore
and even here in D.C.

33:21.566 --> 33:25.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we have -- what we have
certainly seen
is that the majority of the
country has become

33:25.437 --> 33:28.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
safer, and yet the places that
are dangerous
have become more dangerous.

33:28.640 --> 33:34.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Bill, one of
the other things
that President Obama has taken
great effort

33:34.145 --> 33:38.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at is trying to reduce what he
believes is
an epidemic of mass
incarceration.

33:38.617 --> 33:44.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has signed laws that would
reduce mandatory
minimum sentences, change these
sentencing

33:44.322 --> 33:47.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
guidelines for crack cocaine vs.
powdered
cocaine.

33:47.659 --> 33:49.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you make of that effort
over the past
eight years?

33:49.861 --> 33:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL MCCOLLUM: Well, I think
he's right to
try to reduce the differences
between crack

33:54.699 --> 33:56.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and powder cocaine.

33:56.501 --> 34:00.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't have a problem with
granting clemency
on a case-by-case basis.

34:00.872 --> 34:03.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As attorney general of Florida,
that's something
that I did.

34:03.108 --> 34:06.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was part of the clemency board
that met
every month.

34:06.211 --> 34:08.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I do believe in minimum
mandatory sentences.

34:08.413 --> 34:12.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do believe in deterrence that
is going to
come out of a determinate
sentencing.

34:12.951 --> 34:16.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When I was on the Crime
Subcommittee in Congress
several years ago, we didn't
have that.

34:16.955 --> 34:21.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And instead, we had judges that
were widely
varied in the kind of sentencing
that they

34:21.126 --> 34:22.093 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
did.

34:22.127 --> 34:23.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the messaging was terrible.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the reasons that we
do have this
lower crime rate today is
because we have

34:26.765 --> 34:32.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
locked up a lot of the bad guys
for long sentences,
and we have seen fewer of them
out on the

34:32.437 --> 34:34.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
street to commit those crimes.

34:34.272 --> 34:37.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I fear that we're going back
into a new cycle,
where everybody is saying, hey,
let's turn

34:37.542 --> 34:40.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
everybody out, and you haven't
rehabilitated
anybody in prison.

34:40.812 --> 34:44.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Wes Lowery,
obviously, we're
coming to the end of the Obama
administration.

34:44.582 --> 34:49.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Trump administration has
signaled
at least in several of his
potential appointees

34:49.387 --> 34:51.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a different tide.

34:51.556 --> 34:54.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you think we're likely
to see in this
next administration?

34:54.492 --> 34:58.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WESLEY LOWERY: Well, I certainly
think we're
going to see a very different
tenor and tone

34:58.363 --> 35:00.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from the administration.

35:00.198 --> 35:04.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have already begun to see
this in terms
of how many of these issues are
framed, right?

35:04.536 --> 35:08.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So while, for example, President
Obama or
Eric Holder was much more likely
to be talking

35:08.907 --> 35:14.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about something such as a police
shooting
or community distrust,
president-elect Trump

35:14.346 --> 35:17.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and his incoming attorney
general, Jeff Sessions,
have shown they are much more
likely to talk

35:17.716 --> 35:24.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about things such as supporting
police officers,
so-called war on police, and the
idea of,

35:24.389 --> 35:26.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you know, ridding things of
violent crime.

35:26.257 --> 35:29.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think very often, in our
partisan political
lens, we talk about either one
of those things

35:29.728 --> 35:34.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or the other one of those
things, when, in
reality, most police chiefs who
you talk to

35:34.566 --> 35:38.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will note that both of those
things are things
that deteriorate the
relationships between

35:38.169 --> 35:39.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
police and communities.

35:39.270 --> 35:41.006 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

35:41.039 --> 35:42.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the Trump administration, it
is going to
be fascinating to see what the
posture of

35:42.640 --> 35:46.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the DOJ is towards these issues,
not just
policing, but criminal justice
broadly.

35:46.811 --> 35:50.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Jeff Sessions, you have an
attorney general
who is one of the people who on
the Hill has

35:50.949 --> 35:55.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prevented the criminal justice
reform package
that has been proposed by a
bipartisan set

35:55.754 --> 35:58.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of senators and congressmen from
happening.

35:58.056 --> 36:01.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it is going to be very
interesting
to see what, if any federal
leadership on

36:01.259 --> 36:05.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- in terms of either walking
back mandatory
minimums, which has been a major
focus of

36:05.864 --> 36:10.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Obama administration, issues
of clemency,
and then also issues of kind of
data collection.

36:10.168 --> 36:14.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It is going to be very
interesting to see
what, if at all is pursued by
the Trump administration

36:14.539 --> 36:15.673 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in those spaces.

36:15.707 --> 36:17.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Bill McCollum,
last to you.

36:17.108 --> 36:19.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you think the Trump
administration
will do in this regard?

36:19.310 --> 36:22.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL MCCOLLUM: Well, I like to
think they
are going to return to the
policies that the

36:22.180 --> 36:25.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reagan and Bush administrations
of the '80s
and early '90s did.

36:25.850 --> 36:30.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that was to look at examples
like Boston's
policing, where they did
community policing,

36:30.088 --> 36:34.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and take examples and say, look
to local governments,
here's some money, federal
money.

36:34.192 --> 36:39.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Go do it, like the police block
grants that
were given out years ago, not
without some

36:39.597 --> 36:43.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strings, but basically saying,
we want you
cops back out on the streets,
walking those

36:43.701 --> 36:47.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
beats, instead of being afraid
to do your
job, which they are today.

36:47.439 --> 36:51.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would like to see and
believe that they're
going to also focus on the black
community

36:51.109 --> 36:52.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the Hispanic community and
the minorities.

36:52.811 --> 36:56.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's where I think
president-elect Trump
has said he's going to do
things.

36:56.381 --> 37:01.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the best thing he can do is
to address
the black-on-black crime,
Hispanic-upon-Hispanic

37:01.286 --> 37:05.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crime, the gangs that are there,
to try to
prevent the crime in the first
place and deter

37:05.390 --> 37:10.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
it, and then, of course,
arresting those who
really are the ones that are
making the trouble.

37:10.728 --> 37:21.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Bill McCollum,
Wesley Lowery, thank you both
very much.

37:21.206 --> 37:24.409 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WESLEY LOWERY: Thank you.

37:24.442 --> 37:29.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
will deliver
his farewell address to the
nation this evening

37:29.781 --> 37:32.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
before a room full of supporters
in Chicago.

37:33.017 --> 37:38.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We discuss a little of the Obama
legacy and
look ahead to tonight's speech
with two historians,

37:38.690 --> 37:45.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"NewsHour" regular Michael
Beschloss, and
Annette Gordon-Reed of Harvard
University.

37:45.163 --> 37:47.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you back
to the "NewsHour."

37:47.499 --> 37:48.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Michael, let me start with you.

37:48.833 --> 37:51.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How often do presidents give
farewell addresses?

37:51.503 --> 37:54.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS, Presidential
Historian:
Well, George Washington began
the tradition,

37:55.006 --> 38:00.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but it's really been more a
thing of modern
times begun by Harry Truman, who
did one from

38:00.178 --> 38:04.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Oval Office when he retired
in 1953.

38:04.048 --> 38:05.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But they don't always work.

38:05.917 --> 38:10.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The ones that really work are
when you have
the sense that the president is
sort of leveling

38:10.155 --> 38:16.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with you in a way that perhaps
he wasn't able
to during his four or eight
years in office.

38:16.261 --> 38:20.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he's saying something that
you haven't
heard before with new candor.

38:20.565 --> 38:26.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the other thing is that when
he says something
that sounds as if it's a lesson
he's learned

38:26.137 --> 38:27.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that perhaps he didn't know
before.

38:27.972 --> 38:34.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The best example of this,
Eisenhower in 1961,
said, worry about the military
industrial

38:34.546 --> 38:36.381 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
complex.

38:36.414 --> 38:39.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was something that he had
been increasingly
worried about for a long time,
but this was

38:39.184 --> 38:41.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the first time he said it to the
public.

38:41.052 --> 38:45.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Annette
Gordon-Reed, of course,
it's speculation, but why do you
think President

38:45.490 --> 38:47.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Obama wants to do this?

38:47.325 --> 38:51.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNETTE GORDON-REED, Harvard
University Law
School: Well, he's in an
interesting position.

38:51.696 --> 38:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The election didn't turn out the
way he probably
thought it was going to turn
out.

38:55.366 --> 38:59.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a chance to cement his
legacy and
talk about the kinds of things
that he wanted

39:00.004 --> 39:01.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to do as president.

39:01.673 --> 39:06.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he is facing a situation
where people
might try to undo a good amount
of that.

39:06.311 --> 39:10.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think this is a good way
for him to
sort of lay a template, perhaps,
for historians

39:10.582 --> 39:13.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
later on, even though that's
almost an impossible
thing to do.

39:13.251 --> 39:18.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think it's a way for him
to talk about
his legacy, to sort of say to
the American

39:18.590 --> 39:22.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people what was important to
him, what he
thinks he accomplished as
president.

39:22.660 --> 39:26.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Michael,
there is some
reporting over the last few days
that the

39:26.431 --> 39:33.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president may be rethinking how
he wants to
spend his post-presidency, given
the outcome

39:33.605 --> 39:35.139 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the election.

39:35.173 --> 39:36.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Could this be part of that?

39:36.641 --> 39:38.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: Might very
well be.

39:38.710 --> 39:44.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He might spend a lot more time
replying and
criticizing things that Donald
Trump may be

39:44.515 --> 39:46.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
doing as president.

39:46.284 --> 39:50.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if that's true, he's got to
have some
kind of foreshadowing of that in
this speech

39:50.622 --> 39:52.323 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tonight.

39:52.357 --> 39:55.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One thing everyone will be
wondering is, what
is his current thinking about
Trump?

39:55.660 --> 39:59.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right after the election, he
seemed quite
moderate about it, hoping
perhaps to coax

39:59.664 --> 40:05.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump to make more
moderate appointments
and more moderate policies than
he was expecting

40:05.169 --> 40:06.137 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to.

40:06.170 --> 40:08.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But that's all over now.

40:08.072 --> 40:13.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if Barack Obama gets through
this speech
and there's not some, you know,
genuine statement

40:13.845 --> 40:18.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from him saying, you know, the
country has
to worry a little bit about what
the new president

40:18.983 --> 40:23.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is doing and, you know, perhaps
think about
a different direction, then I
think we may

40:23.321 --> 40:27.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not feel that he's really
leveling with us
in the way that other presidents
have.

40:27.392 --> 40:31.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Annette
Gordon-Reed, the White
House did release just a small
portion of

40:31.095 --> 40:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what the president is going to
say.

40:34.999 --> 40:39.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's basically he's saying -- he
talks about
the beauty of democracy and the
experiment

40:39.437 --> 40:41.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
itself, government.

40:41.272 --> 40:44.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said, "This is a great gift
our founders
gave us, the freedom to chase
our individual

40:44.642 --> 40:47.779 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dreams through our sweat, toil
and imagination."

40:47.812 --> 40:52.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But is Michael right, he's going
to need to
say more than that about what
he's got in

40:52.517 --> 40:55.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mind for the future, or else
people may be
disappointed?

40:55.653 --> 41:00.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNETTE GORDON-REED: Well, I
think we're in
unchartered waters here.

41:00.725 --> 41:03.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have a president who has
never held office
before.

41:03.761 --> 41:07.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is one of the things that
was apparently
one of his attractions to
people.

41:07.498 --> 41:10.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't know what to expect.

41:10.068 --> 41:11.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so I think Michael is right.

41:11.869 --> 41:17.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We really do expect to have him
say something
that indicates what kind of role
he's going

41:17.208 --> 41:23.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to play after he leaves office,
because we're
in an unprecedented era, and the
president

41:23.548 --> 41:25.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has to be different perhaps.

41:25.483 --> 41:29.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The post-presidency has to be
different, not
just matter of a person getting
their library

41:29.487 --> 41:31.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
together or whatever.

41:31.189 --> 41:34.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When he's talking about the
experiment, the
American experiment, the
question is, how

41:34.959 --> 41:38.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
does it continue in this
particular moment?

41:38.629 --> 41:41.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I expect he will say
something like
that.

41:41.332 --> 41:45.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael, is there
-- I mean,
looking at what presidents have
done through

41:45.737 --> 41:53.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
history, post-presidency, have
their actions
been affected by the outcome of
the election?

41:53.344 --> 41:55.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: They sure
have.

41:55.146 --> 41:59.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, Eisenhower said that,
when Kennedy
defeated his vice president,
Nixon, he felt

41:59.283 --> 42:03.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as if he had been hit in the
solar plexus
by a baseball bat.

42:03.621 --> 42:08.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think, in Barack
Obama's case, if
we hear him tonight not saying
essentially

42:08.826 --> 42:13.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I didn't expect to finish my
presidency giving
this office over to a successor
who wants

42:13.798 --> 42:18.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to destroy much of what I have
tried to do
and who is in many ways almost
the opposite

42:18.803 --> 42:24.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of me, if he just sort of plays
cool, as if
sort of he's unruffled by that,
the best Obama

42:24.976 --> 42:29.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speeches have been -- and this
is true of
most presidents -- when you
really feel that

42:29.113 --> 42:31.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you are hearing his inner
monologue.

42:31.783 --> 42:37.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If this is too rhetorical, if
he's trying
too hard to imitate, let's say,
George Washington's

42:37.221 --> 42:40.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
farewell address, this will not
be a success
tonight.

42:40.057 --> 42:43.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Annette
Gordon-Reed, how much
have presidents in the past have
been able

42:43.795 --> 42:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to sort of, I don't want to say
tinker with
their legacy, but, say, shape
their legacy

42:48.966 --> 42:50.401 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
post-presidency?

42:50.435 --> 42:53.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm thinking about Jimmy Carter,
but I -- but
there are other examples.

42:53.671 --> 42:58.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNETTE GORDON-REED: Well, Jimmy
Carter has
done a wonderful job with his
legacy and sort

42:58.543 --> 43:02.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of changing what people think
about him in
his post-presidential years.

43:02.613 --> 43:07.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, for the most part, it's
very difficult
to set your legacy, because
every generation

43:07.118 --> 43:11.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of people asks different
questions and is
concerned about different
things.

43:11.155 --> 43:16.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, a president could say, oh,
this is what
I want people to focus on, but
other generations

43:16.127 --> 43:18.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
aren't really as concerned about
that.

43:18.463 --> 43:21.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it's -- you know, it's a
gamble.

43:21.265 --> 43:24.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They do the best they can do,
but historians
are going to do what they're
going to do and

43:24.936 --> 43:28.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
write what they're going to
write based upon
the needs of their particular
generation.

43:28.973 --> 43:30.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about that,
Michael?

43:30.041 --> 43:31.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: Annette is
absolutely right.

43:31.742 --> 43:35.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We cannot be spun, or at least
we'd like to
think that we cannot be.

43:35.780 --> 43:41.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the presidents who are
trying to -- too
overtly to try to say, here is
what you historians

43:41.886 --> 43:47.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and what you later Americans
should think
of my presidency, 30 or 40 years
later, they

43:47.492 --> 43:49.327 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
look silly.

43:49.360 --> 43:51.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And finally,
Annette, the fact
that he's doing it in front of
an audience

43:51.429 --> 43:56.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of supporters, we have not
always -- we have
not seen many presidential
speeches in that

43:56.267 --> 43:57.235 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
form, have we?

43:57.268 --> 43:59.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANNETTE GORDON-REED: No, we have
not.

43:59.036 --> 44:03.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this is a special moment,
and he's in
a special place, the place where
he began

44:03.441 --> 44:06.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his life as a public servant.

44:06.077 --> 44:08.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so it's fitting that he
would be here.

44:08.112 --> 44:11.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Annette
Gordon-Reed, thank
you very much.

44:11.449 --> 44:12.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Michael Beschloss, we thank you
both.

44:12.683 --> 44:13.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: We will be
listening.

44:13.684 --> 44:14.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANNETTE GORDON-REED: Glad to be
here.

44:14.952 --> 44:16.754 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Yes, we will be.

44:16.787 --> 44:20.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we want to
add that, before
the president's address tonight,
we hope you

44:20.324 --> 44:24.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will head to our Web site, where
we have put
together some of the most
memorable moments

44:24.662 --> 44:30.268 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from President Obama's speeches
over the years.

44:30.301 --> 44:40.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

44:40.878 --> 44:49.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now: using the power and appeal
of the arts
to boost low-performing schools.

44:49.520 --> 44:55.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Arts frequently get cut from
school curricula
due to money and time, but a
pilot program

44:55.192 --> 45:00.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around the country is trying to
use music,
performance and other arts in
dozens of schools

45:00.965 --> 45:02.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to motivate kids.

45:02.967 --> 45:04.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

45:04.468 --> 45:10.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of our weekly series
on Making the
Grade.

45:10.908 --> 45:20.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Making music and
using the
arts to build math and other
skills, that's

45:20.484 --> 45:29.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the theory here at the ReNEW
Cultural Arts
Academy, a public charter school
in New Orleans,

45:29.160 --> 45:33.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not long ago, one of the lowest
performing
schools in Louisiana, a state
ranking near

45:33.798 --> 45:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the bottom in the nation.

45:36.434 --> 45:42.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a school now showing
measurable signs
of educational advancement.

45:42.974 --> 45:46.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why does the singing help you do
math?

45:46.777 --> 45:51.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: Because, at my old
school, when we
didn't have any songs for
multiplication,

45:51.315 --> 45:56.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we -- like, half my class used
to get, like,
unsatisfactories, because they
didn't remember

45:56.854 --> 45:58.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it for multiplication.

45:58.756 --> 46:02.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But now that I'm at this school,
and I'm singing
songs, I can memorize it more.

46:02.793 --> 46:08.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A floor above, an
eighth grade
social studies class uses the
musical "Hamilton"

46:08.566 --> 46:09.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to make history come alive.

46:09.967 --> 46:11.736 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Teacher Areonne Howard:

46:11.769 --> 46:15.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AREONNE HOWARD, Teacher, ReNEW
Cultural Arts
Academy: I'm obsessed with
"Hamilton," and

46:15.806 --> 46:25.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so the rap battles were just a
perfect way
to bring them into what a debate
actually

46:25.783 --> 46:27.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is and how to do it.

46:27.618 --> 46:29.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It triggers their listening
skills, too, and
their writing skills, because
they're going

46:29.420 --> 46:36.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have to write their own, and
so that we
provided a model for them, but
they love it.

46:36.060 --> 46:41.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Samantha King
works for KID
smART, a consulting company
that's helped

46:41.132 --> 46:44.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
craft the curriculum here and at
other schools.

46:44.035 --> 46:48.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA KING, KID smART: The
general idea
of arts integration is to appeal
to different

46:48.673 --> 46:50.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
modalities of children's
learning.

46:50.608 --> 46:58.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they get to get up and use
perhaps skills
and things that they love or are
drawn to,

46:58.249 --> 47:01.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
theater, dance, visual arts,
music.

47:01.719 --> 47:06.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we find that, when you put
both things
together, it sticks.

47:06.357 --> 47:09.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, they remember things.

47:09.126 --> 47:10.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's in their body memory.

47:10.528 --> 47:13.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Kathy Fletcher is
national
director of Turnaround Arts.

47:13.998 --> 47:16.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KATHY FLETCHER, National
Director, Turnaround
Arts: The idea is really simple,
and it is

47:16.967 --> 47:23.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the arts in education can
be used not
just as a flower, something to
do after math

47:23.174 --> 47:27.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and science scores are up, but
actually as
a reform strategy, something
that really can

47:27.244 --> 47:29.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
help to reach and teach and
engage children.

47:29.980 --> 47:34.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Turnaround Arts
is a 5-year-old
program created by the
President's Committee

47:34.151 --> 47:36.020 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on the Arts and Humanities.

47:36.053 --> 47:41.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the first federal effort to
use arts
education as a tool to boost
achievement in

47:41.525 --> 47:46.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the nation's lowest performing
schools.

47:46.864 --> 47:51.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Seventy percent of its funding
comes from
foundations and the private
sector.

47:51.736 --> 47:53.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Turnaround began in eight
schools around the
country.

47:53.804 --> 47:58.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The number recently rose to 68
in 15 states
and the District of Columbia.

47:58.876 --> 48:03.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHY FLETCHER: In the decades
past, the first
thing to get cut when budgets
are going are

48:03.647 --> 48:05.516 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the arts.

48:05.549 --> 48:11.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think a lot of people
thought that families
would get their own art lessons
and dance

48:11.222 --> 48:12.957 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
classes.

48:12.990 --> 48:15.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's about six million
kids in this
country who are in public
schools, charter

48:16.026 --> 48:19.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
schools, who don't have those
opportunities,
so they don't get any arts in
school.

48:20.030 --> 48:25.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to have something that
positive and that
joyful to kick-start literacy
and a lot of

48:25.803 --> 48:31.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the other core content subjects,
it just seems
like a smart way to teach.

48:31.942 --> 48:38.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That strikes a
personal chord
in the Turnaround artists,
accomplished professionals

48:38.816 --> 48:42.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who volunteer their time to work
with students
and teachers.

48:42.286 --> 48:49.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At ReNEW Dolores T. Aaron
Academy, we watched
actress Alfre Woodard, singer
Graham Nash

48:49.593 --> 48:52.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and our own David Brooks, The
New York Times
columnist, in action.

48:52.630 --> 48:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALFRE WOODARD, Actress: So, let
me hear the
sound it makes.

48:56.333 --> 48:57.902 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Ah.

48:57.935 --> 48:59.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Never hold sound in.

48:59.537 --> 49:01.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUDENT: I have been watching
the news.

49:01.405 --> 49:03.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And just remember
to take your
time.

49:03.073 --> 49:04.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're going to want to, like,
rush through
because you will be a little
nervous.

49:04.975 --> 49:11.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you can stop and breathe,
it will seem
long to you, but it will seem
great to everybody

49:11.248 --> 49:12.616 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
else.

49:12.650 --> 49:14.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GRAHAM NASH, Musician: Can you
feel the vibrations
in the guitar?

49:14.251 --> 49:16.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Listen, put your hands on the
body.

49:16.220 --> 49:21.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Woodard, known
for award-winning
film, stage and television
roles, is a veteran

49:21.125 --> 49:22.426 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the program.

49:22.459 --> 49:23.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why is this work important?

49:23.594 --> 49:26.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALFRE WOODARD: Somebody showed
up for both
of us.

49:26.430 --> 49:30.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's why we're here.

49:30.334 --> 49:35.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Art completes not only the
education, but
it completes the human being,
our ability

49:35.973 --> 49:39.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to create, and to express that
creation.

49:39.510 --> 49:45.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we also have all the visuals
now of channels
in your brain opening up when
you're doing

49:45.282 --> 49:46.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a particular discipline.

49:46.784 --> 49:51.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, once we had that, we wanted
to come into
schools, put it to the test.

49:51.155 --> 49:57.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRAHAM NASH: You know, this
particular school,
it was one of their very first
projects.

49:57.161 --> 50:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when they first came here,
the windows
were blacked out and the
skylight was blocked

50:01.899 --> 50:05.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
off and the rats were running
along the top
of the wall.

50:05.402 --> 50:07.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And now look at it.

50:07.238 --> 50:12.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Graham Nash of
Crosby, Stills,
Nash and Young is a two-time
Rock and Roll

50:12.142 --> 50:17.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hall of Fame inductee, but never
forgets his
bleak childhood in post-World
War II England.

50:17.882 --> 50:21.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRAHAM NASH: I like to go into a
thing not
knowing exactly what's going on,
but I will

50:22.019 --> 50:24.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
turn that, then I will deal with
whatever
it is.

50:24.154 --> 50:25.890 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

50:25.923 --> 50:28.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, one of the kids comes up to
me, and he
goes, you know, Mr. Nash, we
have rewritten

50:28.192 --> 50:29.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
your song "Chicago," and here it
is.

50:30.027 --> 50:31.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're going to teach it to
you.

50:31.462 --> 50:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
(singing): Won't you please come
to New Orleans
just to dance?

50:36.533 --> 50:42.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I went, OK, let's go, you know,
because you
can either stop it right there
and say, look,

50:42.840 --> 50:47.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you can't rewrite my song, blah,
blah, blah,
or you can just go with it and
see what happens.

50:47.344 --> 50:51.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you choose that moment,
that's when
the world opens up and all kinds
of opportunities

50:51.849 --> 50:53.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
come your way.

50:53.784 --> 50:56.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: An independent
evaluation of
the original eight Turnaround
schools conducted

50:56.954 --> 50:58.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
showed early success.

50:58.455 --> 51:01.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Half the schools improved their
attendance
rates.

51:01.325 --> 51:08.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The average improvement in math
proficiency
was 22 percent and reading close
to 13 percent.

51:08.732 --> 51:10.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And discipline problems fell.

51:10.501 --> 51:16.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At ReNEW Cultural Arts Academy,
for example,
suspensions were down 51
percent.

51:16.407 --> 51:19.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And the kids themselves?

51:19.743 --> 51:25.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New Orleans ninth grader Jared
Mullens has
seen his own turnaround through
the arts.

51:25.449 --> 51:30.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JARED MULLENS, Student: I will
be thinking,
what more can I achieve in life,
instead of

51:30.421 --> 51:31.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just stopping at this point?

51:31.422 --> 51:39.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When I'm in the arts, I'm
focused.

51:39.330 --> 51:46.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Last spring, he
found himself
at the White House singing for
first lady

51:47.004 --> 51:51.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michelle Obama, an early backer
of Turnaround
Arts.

51:51.842 --> 51:59.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Months later, in New Orleans, he
sang to a
packed crowd of a different
sort, a high school

51:59.316 --> 52:09.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gymnasium filled with students,
teachers,
parents and Turnaround artists.

52:09.793 --> 52:13.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Turnaround Arts will expand to
20 more schools
next fall.

52:13.230 --> 52:17.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in a step to ensure its
future, the John
F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts

52:17.868 --> 52:21.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Washington will help manage
and host the
program.

52:21.105 --> 52:24.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

fuel tank, and
the heroic efforts to prevent
the nuclear

52:57.374 --> 53:00.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
warhead from exploding.

53:00.044 --> 53:05.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
