03:43.167 --> 03:46.333
CARING FOR THE LONG TERM

03:46.333 --> 03:47.733
UNEMPLOYED IS ONE CHALLENGE AN

03:47.733 --> 03:50.833
SO IS FINDING JOBS FOR THE YOUNG

03:50.833 --> 03:50.967
WORKERS.

03:50.967 --> 03:52.333
THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS I

03:52.333 --> 03:55.100
THE MID TEENS AND EVEN HIGHE

03:55.100 --> 03:56.667
THAN THAT AMONG YOUN

03:56.667 --> 03:56.900
MINORITIES

03:56.900 --> 03:59.433
FOR MORE ABOUT ALL OF THIS, WE

03:59.433 --> 04:03.033
ARE JOININGED BY VICTORI

04:03.033 --> 04:03.300
STILLWELL.

04:03.300 --> 04:05.833
THERE WAS A RECESSION IN THE

04:05.833 --> 04:09.633
'70s AND A STOCK MARKET CRASH IN

04:09.633 --> 04:10.400
1987 AND JOBS WERE SCARCE.

04:10.400 --> 04:13.367
WHAT MAKES THIS SO DIFFERENT FOR

04:13.367 --> 04:15.833
YOUNG AMERICANS COMPARED T

04:15.833 --> 04:17.667
THOSE TIMES?

04:17.667 --> 04:20.833
>> THE GREAT RECESSION WAS

04:20.833 --> 04:20.967
UNPRECEDENTED.

04:20.967 --> 04:23.100
IT EXACERBATED TRENDS.

04:23.100 --> 04:25.800
WE HAVE BEEN SEEING UNEMPLOYMENT

04:25.800 --> 04:32.300
FOR PEOPLE AGED 16 TO 24 HIGH.

04:32.300 --> 04:34.200
BUT THAT SPREAD HAS WIDENED OUT.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.333
IN THE LAST RECOVERY THE PRE

04:36.333 --> 04:38.533
BETWEEN UNEMPLOYMENT FOR YOUNG

04:38.533 --> 04:42.900
PEOPLE AND FOR EVERYONE ELSE WAS

04:42.900 --> 04:44.100
ABOUT 5 TO 6 PERCENTAGE POINTS

04:44.100 --> 04:46.133
AND NOW IT IS 7 PERCENTAGE

04:46.133 --> 04:46.567
POINTS

04:46.567 --> 04:48.033
WE HAVE AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE

04:48.033 --> 04:48.833
THAT IS DOUBLE THE NATIONA

04:48.833 --> 04:49.133
AVERAGE.

04:49.133 --> 04:50.500
THAT'S A PROBLEM

04:50.500 --> 04:52.300
>> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS

04:52.300 --> 04:53.133
INTERESTING ABOUT THIS

04:53.133 --> 04:56.333
WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT LOW

04:56.333 --> 04:57.933
INCOME STARTER JOBS.

04:57.933 --> 04:59.367
THESE ARE PEOPLE GETTING READY

04:59.367 --> 05:01.133
TO START THEIR CAREERS AND HAV

05:01.133 --> 05:02.600
BEEN TO COLLEGE AND GRAD SCHOOL.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.467
WHAT IS THE IMPLICATION OF THOSE

05:04.467 --> 05:07.367
PEOPLE BEING OUT OF WORK

05:07.367 --> 05:08.300
>> IF WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT HAVE

05:08.300 --> 05:10.200
PUT IN ALL THIS MONEY INTO

05:10.200 --> 05:12.033
GETTING AN EDUCATION, WHO HAVE

05:12.033 --> 05:13.733
MADE A REAL INVESTMENT IN TRYING

05:13.733 --> 05:15.733
TO SECURE BETTER CAREERS AND ARE

05:15.733 --> 05:17.700
STUCK WITH A WAITRESSING O

05:17.700 --> 05:19.967
RETAIL JOB THERE ARE A LOT O

05:19.967 --> 05:21.800
IMPLICATIONS WITH THAT

05:21.800 --> 05:23.467
THEY MAY HAVE STUDENT LOANS THEY

05:23.467 --> 05:25.167
CANNOT PAY OFF

05:25.167 --> 05:27.767
THAT INCREASES THEIR PROBABILITY

05:27.767 --> 05:30.033
OF DEFAULTING ON THE LOANS

05:30.033 --> 05:32.700
THEY ALSO LOWER THEIR LIFETIME

05:32.700 --> 05:34.667
EARNINGS POTENTIAL

05:34.667 --> 05:36.233
THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS

05:36.233 --> 05:38.400
DID A STUDY ON THE LONG TERM

05:38.400 --> 05:39.433
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS

05:39.433 --> 05:41.700
AND THEY FOUND THAT FOR THE

05:41.700 --> 05:44.067
MILLION AMERICANS WHO ARE YOUN

05:44.067 --> 05:45.767
AND WHO ARE UNEMPLOYMENTED

05:45.767 --> 05:47.867
BECAUSE OF THE GREAT RECESSION

05:47.867 --> 05:49.900
THEY PROBABLY LOST A COLLECTIV

05:49.900 --> 05:54.167
$20 BILLION IN EARNINGS FOR TH

05:54.167 --> 05:55.567
NEXT 10 YEARS.

05:55.567 --> 05:58.067
>> WHAT ABOUT THE LARGER PART OF

05:58.067 --> 05:58.833
THE ECONOMY?

05:58.833 --> 06:00.500
>> IF YOU HAVE YOUNG PEOPL

06:00.500 --> 06:02.133
LIVING WITH RELATIVES AN

06:02.133 --> 06:04.267
FRIENDS, COUCH SURFING, RENTIN

06:04.267 --> 06:05.933
INSTEAD OF BUYING A HOME BECAUSE

06:05.933 --> 06:08.333
THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO D

06:08.333 --> 06:11.567
THAT OR THE CREDIT BUILT UP TO

06:11.567 --> 06:14.267
DO THAT OR HAVE BAD CREDIT, THAT

06:14.267 --> 06:15.467
PUSHES BACK THE TIME LINE WHER

06:15.467 --> 06:17.467
THEY CAN BUY A HOME AND IF THE

06:17.467 --> 06:19.033
DO IT AT ALL

06:19.033 --> 06:21.567
IT ALSO HAD A BIG IMPLICATIO

06:21.567 --> 06:23.433
FOR CONSUMER SPEND COMING IS THE

06:23.433 --> 06:25.100
BIGGEST PART OF OUR ECONOMY.

06:25.100 --> 06:26.667
IF PEOPLE ARE EARNING LESS OVE

06:26.667 --> 06:29.700
THEIR LIFETIME THEY WILL B

06:29.700 --> 06:31.000
BUYING AND CONSUMING LESS.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.800
>> SO EVERYTHING GETS PUSHED

06:32.800 --> 06:33.700
BACK DOWN THE LINE

06:33.700 --> 06:35.033
>> EXACTLY

06:35.033 --> 06:36.700
>> I'M WONDERING IF THE WAY WE

06:36.700 --> 06:38.533
THOUGHT ABOUT THESE JOBS FOR

06:38.533 --> 06:39.967
YOUNG PEOPLE THAT IT'S OVER.

06:39.967 --> 06:42.567
THAT THESE JOBS HAVE BEEN TAKE

06:42.567 --> 06:44.667
BY TWO OR THEE OF THESE JOBS T

06:44.667 --> 06:46.067
MAKE UP FOR A SALARY THEY HA

06:46.067 --> 06:46.467
ONCE

06:46.467 --> 06:49.300
THEY ARE TAKE CARE OF THEI

06:49.300 --> 06:51.300
FAMILIES WITH WHAT WE THOUGHT OF

06:51.300 --> 06:52.900
AS KIDS' JOBS.

06:52.900 --> 06:54.133
IS THIS A NEW NORMAL

06:54.133 --> 06:56.567
>> THE HOPE IS AS THE ECONOM

06:56.567 --> 06:58.433
IMPROVES AND WAS GET HIGHE

06:58.433 --> 07:00.767
DEMAND AS COMPANIES SEE A NEED

07:00.767 --> 07:02.433
TO TAKE ON MORE WORKERS THEY

07:02.433 --> 07:04.733
WILL DO THAT AND IT WILL OPEN UP

07:04.733 --> 07:06.567
THE LOWER ENTRY LEVEL JOBS FOR

07:06.567 --> 07:08.033
THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TYPICALL

07:08.033 --> 07:09.700
HAD THEM

07:09.700 --> 07:11.633
THE GREAT RECESSION CAUSED A LOT

07:11.633 --> 07:12.767
OF RIPPLE EFFECTS.

07:12.767 --> 07:19.400
PEOPLE WHO WERE MAKING 50, 60,

07:19.400 --> 07:22.367
$70,000 A YEAR HAD TO FLIP

07:22.367 --> 07:22.767
BURGERS.

07:22.767 --> 07:26.000
THE HOPE IS THAT AS THINGS GET

07:26.000 --> 07:27.767
BETTER LIKE THEY, ARE THAT W

07:27.767 --> 07:29.633
WILL BE ABLE TO GET YOUNG PEOPLE

07:29.633 --> 07:31.667
BACK IN THOSE JOBS AND ADD

07:31.667 --> 07:32.933
SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE AND GET ON

07:32.933 --> 07:34.267
THE TRACK THEY NEED TO BE.

07:34.267 --> 07:35.800
