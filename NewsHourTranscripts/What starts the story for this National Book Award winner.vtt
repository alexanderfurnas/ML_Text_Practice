UDY WOODRUFF: Now another in
our conversations with winners

00:02.569 --> 00:06.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the 2015 National Book
Awards. dam Johnson, a

00:06.240 --> 00:10.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
professor of creative writing at
Stanford and a 2012 Pulitzer

00:10.444 --> 00:14.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
winner, won the fiction category
for his collection of stories,

00:14.147 --> 00:17.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Fortune Smiles." effrey Brown
talked with him recently at the

00:17.918 --> 00:21.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Miami Book Fair, starting with a
question about the appeal of

00:21.822 --> 00:23.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
writing short stories.ADAM
JOHNSON, National Book Award

00:23.891 --> 00:27.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Winner: I love the short story.
aving written two novels in a

00:27.094 --> 00:30.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
row, I missed the power of the
short story. To me, a short

00:30.163 --> 00:35.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
story is like a battery that can
store emotion and just charge

00:35.569 --> 00:39.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you up directly with it, and it
can hold emotion for as long as

00:39.072 --> 00:42.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you want and then transmit it.
have always loved research. I

00:42.276 --> 00:46.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have always loved going out into
the world and finding a twin for

00:46.980 --> 00:50.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what's going on inside me. Maybe
technology's part of that.

00:50.050 --> 00:53.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EFFREY BROWN: So, what starts
a story for you?ADAM JOHNSON:

00:53.887 --> 00:57.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have learned over the years to
trust my obsessions.JEFFREY

00:57.491 --> 00:59.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BROWN: Obsessions.ADAM
JOHNSON: When I get obsessed

00:59.660 --> 01:03.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about Nirvana songs, listening
to them over and over, or buying

01:03.697 --> 01:07.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mauri dade (ph) over the
Internet late at night and

01:07.701 --> 01:13.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
running up my eBay bill, it
usually means it's connected to

01:13.540 --> 01:16.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something inside. And I won't
know what it is until I put that

01:16.476 --> 01:19.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
obsession into a story. EFFREY
BROWN: Mm-hmm. And does it come

01:19.680 --> 01:23.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quickly once you start? DAM
JOHNSON: These stories came very

01:23.951 --> 01:29.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quickly.You know, when you're
writing a novel, and it takes

01:29.356 --> 01:32.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years, there are all these
beautiful tempting stories that

01:32.359 --> 01:35.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
come along and they say, write
me. Oh, no, quit your novel.

01:35.162 --> 01:37.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's hard work. It might fail.
Come write me. I'm alluring.

01:37.864 --> 01:40.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And...(LAUGHTER)ADAM
JOHNSON: But you have got to say

01:40.267 --> 01:42.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
no to those.JEFFREY BROWN: You
have a personal relationship

01:42.703 --> 01:44.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with these stories, huh?ADAM
JOHNSON: That's the devil

01:44.972 --> 01:46.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
talking, because you must
complete your novel and the long

01:47.007 --> 01:49.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
journey.And when I was done, I
couldn't wait to go write some

01:49.643 --> 01:52.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stories.JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.
And once you start, is there a

01:52.412 --> 01:56.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lot of chiseling that goes into
them? How crafted are -- no.

01:56.083 --> 01:58.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAM JOHNSON: I would say,
rather than drafting, it's more

01:58.752 --> 02:03.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about discovering.I write
scene by scene, and I think, I

02:03.090 --> 02:05.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
want to get my character to this
point. I want to get my

02:05.859 --> 02:09.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
characters to the bedroom. I
want to get my characters toward

02:09.730 --> 02:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the appearance of the first
hologram. And then I just -- I

02:13.734 --> 02:16.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have to really ponder and think
about what is going to happen

02:16.603 --> 02:19.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
next. think contemporary
fiction is very closely related

02:19.740 --> 02:23.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to improvisational jazz. The
jazz musician has a tradition,

02:23.510 --> 02:27.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has a talent, has some concerns.
It's in conversation. But he or

02:27.280 --> 02:30.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she doesn't know what the song
is going to be. It appears

02:30.217 --> 02:33.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
before them.JEFFREY BROWN: The
first story, called "Nirvana,"

02:33.487 --> 02:37.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
involves holograms, involves new
technology. There, you had to do

02:37.457 --> 02:39.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a different kind of research, I
assume. DAM JOHNSON: Well,

02:39.459 --> 02:42.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just -- I just had to look
around me.JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

02:42.362 --> 02:45.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAM JOHNSON: I live in San
Francisco, and I work in Silicon

02:45.165 --> 02:47.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Valley and there are
self-driving cars. And on

02:47.734 --> 02:52.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Stanford campus, there will be
flying solar-powered autonomous

02:52.372 --> 02:55.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things zipping around, or things
that balance on one wheels that

02:55.976 --> 02:58.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
students are making.JEFFREY
BROWN: And yet we're still

02:58.345 --> 03:00.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
human, right, which is part of
what comes through in the story.

03:00.714 --> 03:03.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAM JOHNSON: That's exactly
it. And what is it going to mean

03:03.116 --> 03:05.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to have holograms in our lives?
ou know, Josephine Baker is

03:05.719 --> 03:08.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going on tour next year.
EFFREY BROWN: Yes, you're

03:08.755 --> 03:12.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
talking -- the great singer
FMDNMOÃ˜long dead, but is going on

03:12.592 --> 03:15.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tour through a hologram.ADAM
JOHNSON: Long dead. That's

03:15.128 --> 03:17.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right.(CROSSTALK) EFFREY
BROWN: And that triggers

03:17.130 --> 03:19.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
something for you.ADAM
JOHNSON: People are going to

03:19.132 --> 03:21.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fill auditoriums, because the
tickets have already sold out

03:21.268 --> 03:24.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the premiere performances,
because they love her.And it

03:24.838 --> 03:30.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doesn't matter. As long as the
human voice is there, I think it

03:30.110 --> 03:32.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doesn't matter that it -- she's
just made of light. EFFREY

03:32.979 --> 03:36.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: But that's weird, right?
I mean, it's strange. DAM

03:36.383 --> 03:39.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHNSON: Well...JEFFREY BROWN:
She's made of light, and people

03:39.119 --> 03:43.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are going to see a dead -- long
dead singer perform. That sounds

03:43.256 --> 03:45.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like an Adam Johnson story,
actually. CROSSTALK)ADAM

03:45.258 --> 03:47.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHNSON: Do we not look at a
television and respond

03:47.494 --> 03:50.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
profoundly to cinema and to good
TV? And those people are made of

03:50.464 --> 03:54.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
light.JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.
hen you and I talked after you

03:54.634 --> 03:58.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wrote "The Orphan Master's Son"
set in North Korea, you said --

03:58.939 --> 04:01.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just went back to look at that
interview. You said to me, when

04:01.975 --> 04:05.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I asked you, why North Korea,
"It seemed, as a writer, that

04:05.078 --> 04:07.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this was perhaps the most
difficult place on earth to be

04:07.481 --> 04:11.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fully human." hat goes just to
what we are talking about,

04:11.718 --> 04:15.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right, this idea of being fully
human, even amid technological

04:15.789 --> 04:19.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
change, natural disasters,
torture.ADAM JOHNSON: That's

04:19.893 --> 04:23.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right. Right. s the state of
being human eternal, as we think

04:23.930 --> 04:29.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of it throughout the history of
our evolution, or is it mutable?

04:29.269 --> 04:32.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, I'm not really sure.
As a fiction writer, the thing

04:32.439 --> 04:38.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm scared of the most is phones
in stories. What does it do to

04:38.745 --> 04:42.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tension, inertia, momentum,
information management if one

04:42.782 --> 04:47.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
character at any moment can
share anything at a distance

04:47.320 --> 04:50.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
privately with another
character?What does it do to

04:50.657 --> 04:54.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
brooding, building, withholding,
with human confrontation,

04:54.961 --> 05:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conflict, with revelation, if
that's all subverted through

05:00.167 --> 05:04.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
technology? EFFREY BROWN: All
right, the National Book Award

05:04.037 --> 05:08.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Winner for Fiction, Adam Johnson
for his book "Fortune Smiles."

ongratulations, and thanks.
DAM JOHNSON: Well, thank you.
