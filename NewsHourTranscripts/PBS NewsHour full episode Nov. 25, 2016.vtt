terror here, no doubt, elements with great
hostility toward the state of Israel.

06:17.611 --> 06:20.480 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
this Thanksgiving holiday weekend.

06:20.580 --> 06:23.450 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
John Yang has more on one with added significance.

06:23.550 --> 06:28.722 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN YANG: To examine the role of the White
House counsel and the challenges Donald McGahn

06:28.822 --> 06:33.426 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
faces tackling president-elect Trump's business
holdings, we're joined by Jack Quinn, who

06:33.526 --> 06:36.529 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
was White House counsel under President Bill
Clinton.

06:36.630 --> 06:37.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jack Quinn, welcome.

06:37.964 --> 06:39.733 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JACK QUINN, Former White House Counsel: Thank
you, John.

06:39.833 --> 06:43.870 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN YANG: When a White House counsel approaches
an issue like figuring out what to do with

06:43.970 --> 06:50.310 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a president's business holdings, is the client
the president as a individual or the presidency

06:50.410 --> 06:51.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as an institution?

06:51.411 --> 06:53.680 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
JACK QUINN: It's definitely the latter.

06:53.780 --> 06:58.318 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
As White House counsel, you represent the
office of the president of United States,

06:58.418 --> 07:01.388 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
not the individual, whether it's Bill Clinton
or Donald Trump.

07:01.488 --> 07:07.193 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN YANG: So, in this case, the counsel may
be looking at having to tell the president

07:07.294 --> 07:12.098 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
as an individual maybe he can't do what he
wants or maybe what he wants to do isn't a

07:12.198 --> 07:13.099 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
good idea?

07:13.199 --> 07:15.068 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JACK QUINN: That's right.

07:15.168 --> 07:18.872 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And the White House counsel is in the one
who is in a position to invoke executive privilege,

07:18.972 --> 07:20.707 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for example.

07:20.807 --> 07:25.445 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
A White House counsel cannot participate in
a private litigation involving a president

07:25.545 --> 07:32.719 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in his individual capacity and use that power
to influence the outcome of the litigation.

07:32.819 --> 07:34.521 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That would be inappropriate.

07:34.621 --> 07:41.528 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And while it's true that the president is
exempt in certain senses from the conflict

07:41.628 --> 07:48.868 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
of interest rules, as are other federal officials,
for good reason, that is not a blank check,

07:48.968 --> 07:50.203 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
so to speak.

07:50.303 --> 07:55.175 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
There are other governors on the conduct of
the presidency.

07:55.275 --> 08:02.816 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The president may not accept emoluments, or,
in other words, economic benefits, from foreign

08:02.916 --> 08:09.022 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
powers, still has to file disclosure of his
financial information, and, most importantly,

08:09.122 --> 08:14.861 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ultimately, is governed by the impeachment
provisions, which enable the Congress to remove

08:14.961 --> 08:21.034 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
a president if he commits high crimes or misdemeanors,
which is generally understood to mean an abuse

08:21.134 --> 08:22.836 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of power.

08:22.936 --> 08:28.341 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN YANG: So, is the standard -- the standard
is more than just the letter of the law?

08:28.441 --> 08:33.179 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Is there something broader that a counsel
looks at when advising the president on something

08:33.279 --> 08:35.181 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
like the business holdings?

08:35.281 --> 08:37.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JACK QUINN: Sure.

08:37.150 --> 08:42.655 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Well, the White House counsel and others need
to look not just at the letter of the law,

08:42.756 --> 08:48.762 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
but also at the power of the Congress, which
is equally broad, to invoke the impeachment

08:48.862 --> 08:51.564 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
provisions, for example, if a president does
abuse the power.

08:51.664 --> 08:57.036 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Remember, the conflict of interest provision
simply says you can't participate in a decision

08:57.137 --> 09:00.373 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that would affect you or a member of your
family financially.

09:00.473 --> 09:06.679 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It doesn't mean that you can use the power
of government to influence this -- to create

09:06.780 --> 09:09.516 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
decisions that would benefit you.

09:09.616 --> 09:13.019 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We're really in unchartered territory when
it comes to that.

09:13.119 --> 09:19.225 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That's not to presume that anything of this
kind will take place, but this is, as I say,

09:19.325 --> 09:20.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not a blank check.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.295 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I think it's an appropriate metaphor in this
case.

09:22.395 --> 09:26.933 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN YANG: So, in addition to sort of the
ethics questions that the counsel looks at,

09:27.033 --> 09:33.139 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
what other areas in sort of representing the
institutional interests of the presidency,

09:33.239 --> 09:35.775 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
what other areas is the White House counsel
looking at?

09:35.875 --> 09:42.115 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JACK QUINN: Well, look, ultimately what one
wants to do is ensure that the American people

09:42.215 --> 09:47.320 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
have faith in their government, in their president,
and everyone who works for their president.

09:47.420 --> 09:54.894 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So it is awfully important that the White
House counsel do everything possible to make

09:54.994 --> 10:02.368 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
sure that the appearance of conflict, the
appearance of self-dealing is avoided.

10:02.469 --> 10:04.237 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That's critically important.

10:04.337 --> 10:08.007 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
As I say, other officials, and the White House
counsel and the president himself need to

10:08.107 --> 10:10.944 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
provide that assurance to the American people
as well.

10:11.044 --> 10:15.048 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN YANG: You have been -- before you held
the office, you had been counsel to the vice

10:15.148 --> 10:17.050 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
president, Al Gore at the time.

10:17.150 --> 10:20.253 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You had experience on the Hill, political
campaigns.

10:20.353 --> 10:24.824 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Is there anything that really can prepare
anyone for becoming White House counsel?

10:24.924 --> 10:27.260 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JACK QUINN: No.

10:27.360 --> 10:33.299 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
There are so many things that come up in a
job like that that -- you know, when I walked

10:33.399 --> 10:38.371 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
into the office the first time, I thought
there would be volumes on the shelves of prior

10:38.471 --> 10:39.372 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
decisions.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.207 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's not like that at all.

10:41.307 --> 10:44.878 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You do have the Office of Legal Counsel over
at the Justice Department that is helpful,

10:44.978 --> 10:50.483 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and you have a large staff of lawyers who
help you do the research necessary to make

10:50.583 --> 10:52.285 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
good decisions.

10:52.385 --> 10:57.557 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But decisions come up all the time that are
novel, that have never come up before.

10:57.657 --> 11:04.597 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
And, you know, you have to exercise good judgment,
again, remembering all of the time that you're

11:04.697 --> 11:09.335 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in a position of sacred trust, as are all
the other people around you, and ultimately

11:09.435 --> 11:14.274 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
you have got to make a judgment that is in
the interest of the American people and the

11:14.374 --> 11:15.375 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
conduct of good government.

11:15.475 --> 11:17.110 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
JOHN YANG: And there is no manual, no handbook.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.411 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
JACK QUINN: There is not.

11:18.511 --> 11:22.415 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN YANG: Jack Quinn, thanks so much for
joining us.

11:22.515 --> 11:29.656 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JACK QUINN: You're so welcome.

11:29.756 --> 11:36.429 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lost amid November's election
results was the large number of states that

11:36.529 --> 11:41.868 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
legalized the use of marijuana for either
recreational or medical purposes.

11:41.968 --> 11:48.107 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The results spell one of the biggest shifts
in U.S. drug policy in decades, but significant

11:48.207 --> 11:49.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
questions remain.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
William Brangham has the story.

11:51.678 --> 11:55.381 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Legalizing marijuana was
on the ballot in nine different states in

11:55.481 --> 11:56.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this past election.

11:56.482 --> 11:59.118 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
And except in Arizona, they all passed.

11:59.218 --> 12:05.058 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Four states, Montana, North Dakota, Arkansas,
and Florida, voted to legalize use of marijuana

12:05.158 --> 12:07.093 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
for certain medical conditions.

12:07.193 --> 12:13.366 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
And four other states, Maine, Nevada, Massachusetts,
and California, legalized marijuana for anyone

12:13.466 --> 12:15.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
21 years and over.

12:16.035 --> 12:19.772 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
This means that millions more people will
be able to purchase marijuana in sanctioned

12:19.872 --> 12:24.711 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
state-approved shops, but, according to federal
law, the drug is still illegal, and the Trump

12:24.811 --> 12:28.781 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
administration could choose on day one tostart enforcing that law.

12:28.881 --> 12:32.752 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
To help us understand the complexity of all
this, I'm joined now by Taylor West, who is

12:32.852 --> 12:37.624 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the deputy director of the National Cannabis
Industry Association, and John Hudak, who

12:37.724 --> 12:41.060 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
studies drug policy, among other things, atthe Brookings Institution.

12:41.160 --> 12:42.762 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
Welcome to you both.

12:42.862 --> 12:45.431 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Taylor, I would like to start with you first.

12:45.531 --> 12:50.003 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Election Day had to be an enormous day for
your industry.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.672 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Do you think of this as a tipping point going
forward?

12:52.772 --> 12:54.741 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
TAYLOR WEST, Deputy Director, National Cannabis
Industry Association: Absolutely.

12:54.841 --> 12:59.412 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
This was a watershed day for the industry
of cannabis, but also for cannabis policy

12:59.512 --> 13:01.280 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the U.S.

13:01.381 --> 13:06.919 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We saw, as you said, eight states vote for
some form of legal, regulated marijuana program.

13:07.020 --> 13:12.992 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We now have 20 percent of the country living
in a state that has access to legal marijuana,

13:13.092 --> 13:17.764 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and more than 60 percent of the country living
in a state that has legal access to medical

13:17.864 --> 13:19.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
marijuana.

13:19.766 --> 13:22.835 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
This is in line with what we have seen from
public opinion polls, so it really does reflect

13:22.935 --> 13:26.139 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the direction that the country is moving on
these issues.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.441 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: John Hudak, tipping point?

13:28.541 --> 13:32.211 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Do you think this is just the inevitable roll
of this sort of policy going out across the

13:32.311 --> 13:34.080 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country?

13:34.180 --> 13:36.449 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN HUDAK, Brookings Institution: This was
absolutely the biggest day of the marijuana

13:36.549 --> 13:38.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
reform hands-down.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.120 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In terms of it being a tipping point, it's
a bit hard to tell.

13:41.220 --> 13:46.092 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I think, in the short term, we're not going
to see much movement at the federal level.

13:46.192 --> 13:48.761 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
What happened in this election was big for
marijuana.

13:48.861 --> 13:53.132 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But what also happened was the status quo
in Congress, the same leadership in Congress,

13:53.232 --> 13:55.501 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
who, frankly, is opposed to reform.

13:55.601 --> 14:01.908 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
But what this change in the landscape of marijuana
policy can do is to start to embolden the

14:02.008 --> 14:07.013 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
industry, to start to get the industry having
a stronger voice, a more powerful voice, and

14:07.113 --> 14:12.118 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a more powerful economic voice to eventually
move policy in the right direction toward

14:12.218 --> 14:14.787 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
their interests in reform.

14:14.887 --> 14:18.124 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: John, staying with you,
I mean, as I mentioned in the introduction,

14:18.224 --> 14:21.594 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
this is still illegal as far as the federal
government is concerned.

14:21.694 --> 14:25.998 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And the Obama administration put out a memo
basically saying to states, if you guys run

14:26.099 --> 14:28.935 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a tight ship, we're not going to interfere
in what you're doing.

14:29.035 --> 14:34.207 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Now, the Trump administration could come andundo that memo in an instant.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.042 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
Do you think that we're going to see that?

14:36.142 --> 14:39.879 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
What do you imagine when Trump takes over
that that administration is going to do with

14:39.979 --> 14:41.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
regards to marijuana?

14:41.848 --> 14:46.586 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN HUDAK: President-elect Trump has voiced
some interest in keeping the status quo when

14:46.686 --> 14:48.454 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
it comes to medical marijuana.

14:48.554 --> 14:52.024 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
His words around recreational marijuana have
been less firm.

14:52.125 --> 14:57.430 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, I think, right now, we don't know for
sure what Donald Trump will do on marijuana.

14:57.530 --> 15:00.933 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I think that's true on a lot of policy areas,but it's true with marijuana.

15:01.033 --> 15:04.804 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I think his attorney general pick is one that
worries industry.

15:04.904 --> 15:05.972 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He's a vowed prohibitionist.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.073 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This is Jeff Sessions.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.008 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
JOHN HUDAK: Jeff Sessions from Alabama.

15:09.108 --> 15:14.280 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
He's someone who has injected subjective judgment
onto not just marijuana, but the marijuana

15:14.380 --> 15:16.149 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
user.

15:16.249 --> 15:20.086 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, I think however much leash that Donald
Trump gives his attorney general will determine

15:20.186 --> 15:25.925 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
whether the Obama doctrine on marijuana holds
the day or whether we see a real transformation

15:26.025 --> 15:27.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
back to years past.

15:27.960 --> 15:32.064 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Taylor, as John points out,
Jeff Sessions, who likely will be the attorney

15:32.165 --> 15:36.936 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
general, has been very clear that he doesn't
like what states all over the country are

15:37.036 --> 15:39.205 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
doing with regards to recreational marijuana.

15:39.305 --> 15:45.745 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Does your industry worry that, come January,
you might all of a sudden face federal enforcement?

15:45.845 --> 15:50.082 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
TAYLOR WEST: It is certainly something that
we're keeping an eye on.

15:50.183 --> 15:55.454 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The fact is that, during the campaign, as
John mentioned, president-elect Trump said

15:55.555 --> 16:01.394 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
on multiple occasions that he really did see
this as a state issue, and that programs in

16:01.494 --> 16:06.766 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the states that have been chosen by the voters
should be allowed to move forward.

16:06.866 --> 16:12.939 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Certainly, Senator Sessions has expressed
his personal opinion on issues around marijuana,

16:13.039 --> 16:18.144 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
but the reality is that Senator Sessions has
also on many occasions been a strong advocate

16:18.244 --> 16:22.448 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
of state sovereignty and the concept of federalism.

16:22.548 --> 16:29.522 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So I think there really is a nexus of agreement
there on the idea that a program chosen by

16:29.622 --> 16:34.560 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the voters of the state working in the way
that it's meant to ought to be respected.

16:34.660 --> 16:39.365 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Now, as John said, there's still some uncertainty
about exactly which direction any of these

16:39.465 --> 16:43.536 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
policies will go, but we do see that sort
of path forward.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.771 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: John, let's take Taylor's
point.

16:45.872 --> 16:48.474 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Let's assume that the federal government doesn't
interfere.

16:48.574 --> 16:53.112 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Aren't we still going to see conflict, though,
between federal law and state law?

16:53.212 --> 16:54.680 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
There are still other problems.

16:54.780 --> 16:58.551 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
I mean, banks, for instance, can't take marijuana
money.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.386 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And that causes a huge problem for the industry.

17:00.486 --> 17:01.754 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
Those things have got to get worked out eventually.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.589 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

17:03.689 --> 17:05.958 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN HUDAK: The reforms that have happened
during the Obama administration have allowed

17:06.058 --> 17:11.330 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the industry to really get up and running
and have cover, feel safe that what they are

17:11.430 --> 17:14.700 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
going to do will be protected from federal
intervention.

17:14.800 --> 17:20.940 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But, at the same time, the Cole memos, which
have really taken this enforcement discretion

17:21.040 --> 17:28.547 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to a formal stance from the Obama administration
policy, does create these unintended consequences

17:28.648 --> 17:34.020 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
around taxes, around banking, around interstate
access, around a variety of issues that can

17:34.120 --> 17:36.622 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
be very challenging for the industry.

17:36.722 --> 17:40.092 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
Those are going to need to be addressed eventually.

17:40.192 --> 17:42.128 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
We just don't know when that will happen.

17:42.228 --> 17:47.733 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Taylor, we have seen already
Colorado and Washington have had a period

17:47.833 --> 17:52.838 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of time where their legalization infrastructure
has been built, their licensing, their taxing,

17:52.939 --> 17:54.640 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their selling.

17:54.740 --> 17:59.612 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Do those states' experience over the last
years or so give us any sense of how this

17:59.712 --> 18:02.381 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
is going to go forward for other states thatare just trying this out?

18:02.481 --> 18:06.385 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
TAYLOR WEST: Well, I think there are a couple
important lessons to take from what we have

18:06.485 --> 18:09.221 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
seen in places like Colorado and Washington.

18:09.322 --> 18:15.061 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The biggest one is that, by and large, this
works, that these programs have been implemented

18:15.161 --> 18:16.595 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
successfully.

18:16.696 --> 18:19.532 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We haven't seen the major issues that opponents
were concerned about.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The sky hasn't fallen.

18:21.600 --> 18:27.106 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And then a secondary lesson to that is that,
when there have been problems that have arisen,

18:27.206 --> 18:30.977 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the legislature and regulators have been able
to address them.

18:31.077 --> 18:34.380 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That's something that you don't get in an
unregulated system.

18:34.480 --> 18:39.552 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I think that's an important thing for
states that are now embarking on these programs

18:39.652 --> 18:44.724 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to realize, that they have given themselves
the power to shape this industry in their

18:44.824 --> 18:46.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
states as it grows.

18:46.759 --> 18:52.531 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, those are things that I think are important,
both from the state implementation standpoint

18:52.631 --> 18:58.070 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and something that's important for the federalleaders to remember as well.

18:58.170 --> 19:01.974 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Turning back the clock on this doesn't just
end regulated sales.

19:02.074 --> 19:06.879 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It really sends them back into a criminal
market that we have very little control over.

19:06.979 --> 19:10.116 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: John, last question for
you.

19:10.216 --> 19:11.951 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
What happens on the legal front?

19:12.051 --> 19:17.123 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
If people are -- now have a criminal record
because of marijuana sales or possession,

19:17.223 --> 19:22.495 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
or are in prison for marijuana sales or possession,
do these legalization schemes have any say

19:22.595 --> 19:23.829 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in that?

19:23.929 --> 19:26.132 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Does anyone get their record expunged or looked
at again?

19:26.232 --> 19:31.170 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN HUDAK: Some of the legalization efforts
have put these issues at the forefront.

19:31.270 --> 19:37.176 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
California, for instance, built into its initiative
the ability of individuals who were arrested

19:37.276 --> 19:43.382 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and charged with low-level marijuana offenses,
effectively what were formerly offenses that

19:43.482 --> 19:48.521 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
would now be considered legal in California,
to go to court and ask for their record to

19:48.621 --> 19:49.588 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be expunged.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.924 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Now, those are very specific circumstances.

19:52.024 --> 19:56.662 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They obviously couldn't be done in conjunction
with violent crimes or larger crimes.

19:56.762 --> 20:03.436 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But these are issues that affect particularly
communities of color and create barriers to

20:03.536 --> 20:08.841 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
economic opportunity, barriers to educational
opportunity, and have really long-term effects

20:08.941 --> 20:12.812 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
on an individual who faces criminal justice
through this process.

20:12.912 --> 20:18.017 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And so some states have really spearheaded
the ability to do this, but as more states

20:18.117 --> 20:23.489 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
have come online, that conversation has broadened
and these criminal justice reform issues have

20:23.589 --> 20:28.761 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
become not dominant, but at least pushed to
the front of the line in terms of issues that

20:28.861 --> 20:29.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are talked about.

20:30.096 --> 20:31.564 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I think that's a very important part of
this.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.099 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right.

20:33.199 --> 20:37.503 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
John Hudak and Taylor West, thank you bothvery much for being here.

20:37.603 --> 20:42.741 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
JOHN HUDAK: Thank you.

20:42.842 --> 20:47.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAYLOR WEST: Thank you.

20:48.080 --> 20:51.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

20:51.584 --> 20:57.189 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": sharing the wealth
in this time of giving; one woman's mission

20:57.289 --> 21:03.295 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to improve education around the world; and
Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Michael Chabon

21:03.395 --> 21:06.198 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on his new book.

21:06.298 --> 21:08.734 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
But first to the analysis of Shields and Brooks.

21:08.834 --> 21:13.706 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That's syndicated columnist Mark Shields and
New York Times columnist David Brooks.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.841 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And we welcome both of you on this day after
Thanksgiving.

21:15.941 --> 21:16.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.911 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David is in Philadelphia.

21:19.011 --> 21:23.682 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Let's talk about -- we're getting -- beginning
to get a sense, Mark, of Donald Trump's administration,

21:23.782 --> 21:24.984 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a little sense.

21:25.084 --> 21:27.920 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He has named two more people today to the
White House.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.755 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
What are we learning from this?

21:29.855 --> 21:32.992 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
What are we -- what do you now understand
about him that we didn't understand before?

21:33.092 --> 21:34.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Not much.

21:34.927 --> 21:40.499 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I mean, I would say that there's been the
small Donald, the petty, vindictive Donald,

21:40.599 --> 21:44.570 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
who can be rather mean-spirited, as he was
on display at The New York Times editorial

21:44.670 --> 21:51.043 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
board meeting, where he gratuitously took
out after Kelly Ayotte, the former Republican

21:51.143 --> 21:55.981 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
-- senior Republican senator in New Hampshire,
who had -- after the "Access Hollywood" tape

21:56.081 --> 21:59.718 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
had refused to support Donald Trump and said
she couldn't get a job.

21:59.818 --> 22:06.892 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And then we see the little bit larger Donald
in hiring Nikki Haley, who had, in fact, backed

22:06.992 --> 22:14.400 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
both Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz and in the national
address, in response -- the official Republican

22:14.500 --> 22:18.871 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
response to the president's State of the Union,
had warned the party against following the

22:18.971 --> 22:25.511 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
siren call of those -- it was a direct allusionto Donald Trump at the time.

22:25.611 --> 22:29.715 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
So he was larger in spirit in choosing her.

22:29.815 --> 22:37.189 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
And she certainly is a person who has demonstrated
leadership and character under stress at the

22:37.289 --> 22:41.694 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
time of the massacre, the racial massacre
at the Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston

22:41.794 --> 22:47.800 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and leading in lowering the Confederate Battle
Flag over the state -- on the state capitol

22:47.900 --> 22:48.801 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
grounds.

22:48.901 --> 22:49.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David?

22:49.902 --> 22:50.803 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

22:50.903 --> 22:51.804 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Excuse me.

22:51.904 --> 22:52.805 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I didn't mean to interrupt.

22:52.905 --> 22:54.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Sure.

22:54.907 --> 22:56.308 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What are you learning about
Donald Trump from these appointments or announcements?

22:56.408 --> 22:58.344 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, I guess it's -- yes, of
some comfort, I guess.

22:58.444 --> 23:02.815 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Sometimes, the campaign seemed to be, as Mark
said, vindictive, but sort of a depraved three-ring

23:02.915 --> 23:03.849 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
circus.

23:03.949 --> 23:05.951 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
The transition period has not been that.

23:06.051 --> 23:11.023 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He's nominated people like DeVos or Haley
who are competent people, who are more or

23:11.123 --> 23:14.126 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
less professional, experienced people.

23:14.226 --> 23:17.463 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They may not be, on substantive ground, all
of our cup of tea.

23:17.563 --> 23:22.401 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
They are very consistent with the way he campaigned,
a nationalist campaign on education policy,

23:22.501 --> 23:25.104 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a campaign that is enthusiastic about school
choice.

23:25.204 --> 23:30.376 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
But they are more or less the sort of professionalversion of Trump's ideology.

23:30.476 --> 23:36.282 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I do think there is just this animating
spirit here to create a sort of nationalist,

23:36.382 --> 23:41.720 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
populist conservatism that will in some ways
stretch the Republican Party and in some ways

23:41.820 --> 23:43.589 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
offend a lot of conservatives.

23:43.689 --> 23:46.925 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But I think there is an animating vision here
to try to create a movement that will last

23:47.026 --> 23:51.797 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
post-Trump, a populist movement that may even
try to span some of the dividing lines that

23:51.897 --> 23:56.735 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
have existed so far through large economic
policies, through infrastructure policies,

23:56.835 --> 24:01.807 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
through a tough anti-terror policy that nonetheless
keeps American troops out of war.

24:01.907 --> 24:05.411 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
There's an animating vision here, and it's
being executed, at least in the appointments

24:05.511 --> 24:08.347 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
so far, in some intellectually coherent way.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.215 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, a movement in the making
maybe?

24:10.316 --> 24:15.087 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MARK SHIELDS: A movement in the making -- I
guess I don't share David's enthusiasm about

24:15.187 --> 24:16.722 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Betsy DeVos.

24:16.822 --> 24:21.727 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I mean, 90 percent of American schoolchildrenare in public schools, Judy.

24:21.827 --> 24:29.268 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And the emphasis on private schools and charter
schools and parochial schools is not unimportant.

24:29.368 --> 24:31.370 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
I don't mean that, but we're at 90 percent.

24:31.470 --> 24:34.473 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We're heading to 91 percent will be in public
schools.

24:34.573 --> 24:37.710 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I'm not sure Betsy DeVos has ever spent a
day in a public school.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.813 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I don't -- I'm pretty sure Donald Trump
hasn't.

24:40.913 --> 24:49.254 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, I do look upon the secretary of education's
primary responsibility as the quality of education

24:49.355 --> 24:53.859 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that -- and improving the education that every
child in American public schools receives.

24:53.959 --> 24:55.294 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about that, David?

24:55.394 --> 24:56.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What about Betsy...

24:56.395 --> 24:57.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

24:57.396 --> 24:58.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Go ahead, yes.

24:58.397 --> 24:59.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

24:59.565 --> 25:00.933 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
First of all, charter schools are public schools.

25:01.033 --> 25:02.501 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They're paid for publicly and they're part
of the public system.

25:02.601 --> 25:04.670 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
They just have a more independent structure.

25:04.770 --> 25:06.972 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And so I guess I would say, we need a reform
movement.

25:07.072 --> 25:10.642 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We have seen, I think, in the charter school
movement started out, whatever it was, 10

25:10.743 --> 25:13.946 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
or 15 years ago -- it's increasingly gotten
better.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.814 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Charter schools are figuring out how to do
this.

25:15.914 --> 25:19.918 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The charter schools that are most effective
are scaling the most quickly, and so there's

25:20.018 --> 25:22.154 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
got to be a continued move for reform.

25:22.254 --> 25:25.824 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
At the same time, the teachers unions are
pushing at that reform, has had some political

25:25.924 --> 25:27.659 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
successes.

25:27.760 --> 25:32.064 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And so I think charter schools, choice, and
frankly school standards need a champion.

25:32.164 --> 25:34.133 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And DeVos has been a good pretty champion.

25:34.233 --> 25:36.101 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Now, I don't -- she's not without fault.

25:36.201 --> 25:37.970 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You have got to have two things in education
reform.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.839 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You have got to have some flexibility, so
people can figure out what to do.

25:40.939 --> 25:45.444 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But you also have to have accountable, basically
what the Common Core standards were, some

25:45.544 --> 25:48.647 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
sort of set of national standards, so we can
measure.

25:48.747 --> 25:50.582 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
It's hard for parents just to measure schools.

25:50.682 --> 25:53.519 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
DeVos has been really good at the flexibility.

25:53.619 --> 25:55.721 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
She's not been enthusiastic about the accountability.

25:55.821 --> 25:58.257 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
So, she's a complete -- an incomplete operator.

25:58.357 --> 26:00.025 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
But I do think -- I have met her a few times.

26:00.125 --> 26:04.263 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
She's a normal person, a sophisticated person,
in some ways a self-effacing person.

26:04.363 --> 26:09.435 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And she has been at least a champion of reform,
if maybe too much emphasizing choice, not

26:09.535 --> 26:11.236 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
enough, in my view, emphasizing charters.

26:11.336 --> 26:12.237 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You want to come...

26:12.337 --> 26:13.238 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

26:13.338 --> 26:14.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

26:15.073 --> 26:19.645 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I mean, I just -- I applaud David's interest
in, enthusiasm for charter schools.

26:19.745 --> 26:25.184 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It's a very mixed record, and particularly
in Detroit, where that's -- the emphasis has

26:25.284 --> 26:26.652 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
been.

26:26.752 --> 26:27.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's less than mixed.

26:27.953 --> 26:30.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's really discouraging.

26:30.989 --> 26:37.529 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And in the final analysis, American public
education -- American education will be determined

26:37.629 --> 26:42.768 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
by the quality of American public education,
and that's public schools that are available.

26:42.868 --> 26:49.842 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
The charter school is a possibility, an alternative
in certain circumstances, but not in most,

26:49.942 --> 26:54.980 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and not in most places, and not -- most parents
don't have either the time, the inclination

26:55.080 --> 27:00.486 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
or the aptitude to sit and go through sifting
what school and what is available and what

27:00.586 --> 27:02.488 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the options are.

27:02.588 --> 27:06.124 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They are dependent upon the quality of theirneighborhood and local schools.

27:06.225 --> 27:07.426 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, I want to...

27:07.526 --> 27:08.427 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
DAVID BROOKS: If I could just make...

27:08.527 --> 27:09.595 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Go ahead, yes.

27:09.695 --> 27:10.429 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
DAVID BROOKS: ... one more point on that quickly.

27:10.529 --> 27:12.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: OK.

27:12.531 --> 27:14.433 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DAVID BROOKS: Just, as I have traveled around
from school to school, whether it's project-based

27:14.533 --> 27:16.869 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
learning or an outward bound curriculum, it's
very hard to tell the difference between charters

27:16.969 --> 27:18.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and public anymore.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's no fine line.

27:20.239 --> 27:22.841 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They're often adopting very similar programs,
maybe with a different administrative structure.

27:22.941 --> 27:26.345 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But what I'm saying is, you're seeing reform
throughout the movement, in the so-called

27:26.445 --> 27:29.481 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
charters, in the so-called publics, if we're
going to call them that.

27:29.581 --> 27:32.651 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And that reform dynamism has to be kept going.

27:32.751 --> 27:37.489 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, I also want to bring
up with both of you the questions I think

27:37.589 --> 27:42.327 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that came up day after day this last week
about Donald Trump's business connections,

27:42.427 --> 27:48.534 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
his business -- deep business interests and
how that's going to work as president of the

27:48.634 --> 27:50.402 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
United States.

27:50.502 --> 27:53.672 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It came up in John Yang's conversation just
now with Jack Quinn, the former White House

27:53.772 --> 27:54.773 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
counsel.

27:54.873 --> 27:56.241 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
How do you see that developing?

27:56.341 --> 27:58.010 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Do you see it as a problem?

27:58.110 --> 28:00.245 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Do you see it as something that Trump is going
to be able to handle?

28:00.345 --> 28:02.047 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What do you see?

28:02.147 --> 28:06.184 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I would invite viewers
to go back and read a book by a guy named

28:06.285 --> 28:10.255 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
George Washington Plunkitt of Tammany Hall,
who had a concept called honest graft, where

28:10.355 --> 28:13.592 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
his own public -- private interest corresponded
to public interest.

28:13.692 --> 28:17.162 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That's what Trumps seems to be advocating,
merging the two.

28:17.262 --> 28:19.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's just bad news.

28:19.131 --> 28:23.201 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I hope the new presumed White House counsel
will just say, this is not going to work.

28:23.302 --> 28:25.437 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You have got to have a bright line between
these two things.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.940 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
We're no longer living in Tammany Hall America.

28:28.040 --> 28:31.877 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And it will just lead to scandal after scandal
that will end up hurting your own administration.

28:31.977 --> 28:33.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark?

28:33.278 --> 28:34.613 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MARK SHIELDS: I think David is absolutely
right, Judy.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.515 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I think it's very serious.

28:36.615 --> 28:42.387 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I mean, when the -- you have got 70 days between
the election and taking office, an enormous

28:42.487 --> 28:44.256 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
responsibility.

28:44.356 --> 28:49.661 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And when you spend that time actually meeting
with Indian business investors for a Trump

28:49.761 --> 28:57.402 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
apartment complex in Mumbai, when you meet
with Nigel Farage and raise the question of

28:57.502 --> 29:02.007 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
eliminating the wind farm because it would
hurt the view at Donald Trump's golf course

29:02.107 --> 29:07.512 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in Scotland and urges a change in policy,
I mean, this is the man who doesn't understand

29:07.613 --> 29:11.083 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the difference between public policy, publictrust and private interest.

29:11.183 --> 29:19.691 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
When you see Ivanka Trump hawking the $10,000
bracelet that she wore on the "60 Minutes"

29:19.791 --> 29:25.931 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
broadcast from her jewelry -- presidential
trust is something, Judy, that's perishable

29:26.031 --> 29:27.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and it's precious.

29:27.899 --> 29:31.770 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And once a president loses it, it's not a
question of whether it's conflict of interests

29:31.870 --> 29:34.172 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
laws or there aren't conflict of interests
laws.

29:34.272 --> 29:38.577 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The president has to have the trust, earn
the trust, maintain the trust of people in

29:38.677 --> 29:40.512 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
order to lead.

29:40.612 --> 29:44.149 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And there's nothing that will lose it quicker
than a sense that he's in it for a quick buck.

29:44.249 --> 29:46.184 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, do you want to add anything
on that?

29:46.284 --> 29:52.624 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Because I do want to move on to what is apparently
-- what seems to be a split inside Trump world

29:52.724 --> 29:55.327 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
over who is going to be secretary of state.

29:55.427 --> 30:00.999 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We saw Kellyanne Conway, who has been sort
of the face of the Trump transition, tweeting

30:01.099 --> 30:07.572 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
openly just yesterday that they're picking
up a lot of criticism about the fact that

30:07.673 --> 30:10.575 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
he's considering Mitt Romney.

30:10.676 --> 30:18.784 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
What does this tell us about folks inside
Trump world who may be dismayed at where Donald

30:18.884 --> 30:20.652 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trump is headed?

30:20.752 --> 30:23.121 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DAVID BROOKS: I'm looking forward to the live
tweets of the Oval Office meetings in the

30:23.221 --> 30:24.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump administration.

30:24.222 --> 30:25.924 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

30:26.024 --> 30:28.293 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DAVID BROOKS: There's certainly a lot of chaos
and openness that they're saying so far.

30:28.393 --> 30:32.497 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I think Trump is sort of -- from what we can
see from his comments, sort of attracted to

30:32.597 --> 30:34.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the idea of a Romney.

30:34.199 --> 30:37.035 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He looks the part, as Trump -- looks are veryimportant to Donald Trump.

30:37.135 --> 30:40.505 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And so -- but I do think there is some sign
of respectability.

30:40.605 --> 30:43.341 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Personally, I think Mitt Romney would be agreat secretary of state.

30:43.442 --> 30:44.576 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
He knows a lot.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.378 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
He's a very professional -- a consummate professional.

30:46.478 --> 30:49.347 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Frankly, if I were Donald Trump, I would be
a little suspicious.

30:49.448 --> 30:54.619 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It's very easy to imagine he's got his America
first crew in the National Security Council.

30:54.720 --> 30:56.455 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Mitt Romney's a more internationalist.

30:56.555 --> 30:59.658 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It's easy to see him setting up a foreign
policy establishment over there in the State

30:59.758 --> 31:03.128 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Department that would be a rival to the White
House, and maybe that's a good thing.

31:03.228 --> 31:07.099 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
But, if I were Donald Trump, it's not necessarily
what I would want in my foreign policy apparatus.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.533 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you think of the split?

31:08.633 --> 31:11.870 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MARK SHIELDS: Now that David has sunk Mitt
Romney's chances...

31:11.970 --> 31:12.871 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

31:12.971 --> 31:14.339 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

31:14.439 --> 31:16.108 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MARK SHIELDS: ... separate entity over at
the State Department.

31:16.208 --> 31:17.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
To me, it's fascinating.

31:17.642 --> 31:19.578 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's a choice.

31:19.678 --> 31:20.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump loves loyalty.

31:21.079 --> 31:23.381 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
He prizes loyalty, who was with him.

31:23.482 --> 31:25.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Rudy was with him.

31:25.417 --> 31:33.825 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Rudy, you will recall, was the moderate Republican
mayor of New York who was for immigration

31:33.925 --> 31:38.630 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
rights, for gun control, for abortion rights,
for gay rights.

31:38.730 --> 31:43.769 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He abandoned those positions to endorse Donald
Trump after a disastrous run for president

31:43.869 --> 31:48.640 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and gave a speech at the convention that sounded
like a New York cab driver stuck in traffic

31:48.740 --> 31:49.808 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
at 4:30 in the afternoon.

31:49.908 --> 31:50.809 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

31:50.909 --> 31:52.677 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MARK SHIELDS: It was a rant.

31:52.778 --> 31:59.951 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He went on, Judy, to say, if you will recall,
eight years before -- eight years prior to

32:00.051 --> 32:06.057 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Barack Obama coming in, there were no attacks
on the United States, and they all began when

32:06.158 --> 32:11.930 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Obama and Clinton took office, conveniently
forgetting completely the tragedy, the national

32:12.030 --> 32:13.732 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tragedy of 9/11.

32:13.832 --> 32:21.706 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, there are questions and doubts about Rudy
Giuliani and his competence for the job.

32:21.807 --> 32:25.377 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But there's no question that Newt Gingrich
is out for him.

32:25.477 --> 32:29.281 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Kellyanne Conway is apparently advocating
and championing for him.

32:29.381 --> 32:30.715 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, this is -- this is a split.

32:30.816 --> 32:34.853 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I agree with David that Mitt Romney does fit
the bill.

32:34.953 --> 32:36.922 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
He looks like a secretary of state.

32:37.022 --> 32:39.424 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
He looks like the chancellor of the exchequer.

32:39.524 --> 32:41.359 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A lot of people said he would
look like a president.

32:41.459 --> 32:42.360 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
MARK SHIELDS: He looks like a president.

32:42.460 --> 32:43.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I mean, he really does.

32:43.695 --> 32:44.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's central casting.

32:44.896 --> 32:48.033 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
You want a leader, Western leader, English-speaking?

32:48.133 --> 32:49.634 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mitt Romney.

32:49.734 --> 32:51.403 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, just a quick minute-and-a-half
on the Democrats.

32:51.503 --> 32:53.638 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We are going to reserve just a moment for
them.

32:53.738 --> 32:59.010 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
David, we're seeing Chuck Schumer, the incoming
Democratic leader in the Senate, saying, we,

32:59.110 --> 33:03.548 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the Democrats, need to look at ways possiblyto work with Donald Trump.

33:03.648 --> 33:07.319 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And then, on the other hand, we're seeing
Congressman Keith Ellison, who is up for running

33:07.419 --> 33:12.224 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
for head of the Democratic Party, the Democratic
National Committee say, Mark, say, no, we're

33:12.324 --> 33:15.961 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
not going to be working with him, and I don't
want to hear about it.

33:16.061 --> 33:19.564 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
David, are the Democrats making the rightkind of noises right now?

33:19.664 --> 33:21.600 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
Or do we just wait and see what happens?

33:21.700 --> 33:26.371 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DAVID BROOKS: I think Schumer is right to
keep the possibility open that Trump is movable

33:26.471 --> 33:29.741 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
on some issues, which is clearly what Obama
believes, and that they can work with him

33:29.841 --> 33:31.877 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
on some issues, like infrastructure or something
like that.

33:31.977 --> 33:35.013 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, I think, if they could have a good six
months where they work together, there will

33:35.113 --> 33:37.616 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
be plenty of time for fighting later on.

33:37.716 --> 33:38.617 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

33:38.717 --> 33:40.685 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MARK SHIELDS: David is right.

33:40.785 --> 33:45.123 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I think the worst thing the Democrats
could do is to follow the playbook that Mitch

33:45.223 --> 33:49.127 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
McConnell and the Republicans adopted in 2009
against Barack Obama.

33:49.227 --> 33:51.329 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And that's just total, all-out obstructionism.

33:51.429 --> 33:54.466 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: To say on day one or day two...

33:54.566 --> 33:58.470 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, that's right, the most
important thing is to defeat him for reelection.

33:58.570 --> 34:00.305 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
I think that America has had enough of it.

34:00.405 --> 34:01.473 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It doesn't work.

34:01.573 --> 34:04.175 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
And it's not the best of the Democratic tradition.

34:04.276 --> 34:12.717 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields, David Brooks,
thank you very much.

34:12.817 --> 34:29.200 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Next: On what the stores call Black Friday,
the unofficial launch of the holiday shopping

34:29.301 --> 34:34.506 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
season, special correspondent Mike Cerre reports
on a growing effort to expand the scope of

34:34.606 --> 34:40.745 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
seasonal giving to include charitable causes,
with a focus on one company turning bombs

34:40.845 --> 34:42.614 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into bracelets.

34:42.714 --> 34:50.455 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MIKE CERRE: Looking to escape the holiday
shopping madness, to give something more unique

34:50.555 --> 34:53.124 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and meaningful this year?

34:53.224 --> 34:59.130 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
This coming Giving Tuesday, you can buy a
goat online through CARE USA to help an African

34:59.230 --> 35:05.904 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
family in need, or, closer to home, perhaps
some school supplies for your neighborhood

35:06.004 --> 35:10.208 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
school through DonorsChoose.com.

35:10.308 --> 35:14.980 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
For something a little more exotic, how about
jewelry handmade in Laos out of unexploded

35:15.080 --> 35:18.683 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
bombs to help the Mines Advisory Group clear
UXOs?

35:18.783 --> 35:20.919 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
HENRY TIMMS, Founder, Giving Tuesday: We know
about Black Friday.

35:21.019 --> 35:21.920 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We know about Cyber Monday.

35:22.020 --> 35:23.755 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
We know they help stimulate our economy.

35:23.855 --> 35:25.290 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
But it felt like there was a missing gap.

35:25.390 --> 35:28.293 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It felt like there was a moment to talk about
philanthropy and giving.

35:28.393 --> 35:30.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: For the arts.

35:30.161 --> 35:33.164 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MIKE CERRE: It's called the giving season
for a reason.

35:33.264 --> 35:38.470 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
December is typically the most important month
for nonprofits all over the country.

35:38.570 --> 35:43.675 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Henry Timms started this online philanthropy
event four years ago out of New York's 92nd

35:43.775 --> 35:45.710 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Street Y.

35:45.810 --> 35:49.848 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Giving Tuesday is now celebrated in over 30
countries.

35:49.948 --> 35:58.490 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Last year, over 700,000 holiday shoppers pledged
more than $110 million to their favorite charities,

35:58.590 --> 36:00.358 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
big and small.

36:00.458 --> 36:03.561 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
HENRY TIMMS: One of the things we have always
seen -- and we see it more now with social

36:03.661 --> 36:06.464 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
media -- is the kind of fluidity of giving.

36:06.564 --> 36:10.301 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So people are able to form movements quickly
around campaigns and causes they care about.

36:10.402 --> 36:11.870 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
I think we have already seen that post-election.

36:11.970 --> 36:15.140 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We have seen lots of different groups thathave seen spikes in giving.

36:15.240 --> 36:18.910 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ELIZABETH SUDA, Article 22: And each piece
helps clear some of the 80 million bombs that

36:19.010 --> 36:20.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
haven't yet exploded.

36:20.879 --> 36:28.086 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I think our jewelry has this multilayered
impact, where the giver is consciously choosing

36:28.186 --> 36:32.257 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
something that has benefits for the people
that make it.

36:32.357 --> 36:35.660 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
We will still continue to use these hand tools.

36:35.760 --> 36:40.732 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MIKE CERRE: We first discovered Elizabeth
Suda and her jewelry made from UXOs during

36:40.832 --> 36:45.870 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
President Obama's state visit to Laos in September,
when he pledged to nearly double the amount

36:45.970 --> 36:51.443 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of money the U.S. spends each year cleaning
up UXOs, unexploded ordnance, dropped during

36:51.543 --> 36:53.311 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Vietnam War.

36:53.411 --> 36:58.283 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ELIZABETH SUDA: This is actually a cluster
bomb known as the pineapple, and it has aluminum

36:58.383 --> 37:01.052 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
fins here and then other aluminum components.

37:01.152 --> 37:06.424 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They are also able to make plane parts hammered
down and put in the kiln, and you can actually

37:06.524 --> 37:10.962 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
get quite a few bracelets out of various pieces.

37:11.062 --> 37:16.634 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The pieces really started as conversation
starters.

37:16.734 --> 37:24.576 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The idea was to buy back the bombs and help
clear unexploded ordnance, and give people

37:24.676 --> 37:31.049 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
an entry point into a conversation about what
might otherwise be a forgotten part of history.

37:31.149 --> 37:36.588 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MIKE CERRE: More than four decades since the
end of the Vietnam War, neighboring Laos is

37:36.688 --> 37:43.661 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
still littered with UXOs, unexploded ordnance,
which continue to kill and maim civilians,

37:43.761 --> 37:48.600 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
mostly children, and even some of these jewelry
makers, like this one, who lost an eye as

37:48.700 --> 37:50.635 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a boy.

37:50.735 --> 37:55.907 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Proceeds from the sale of jewelry on Giving
Tuesday and throughout the year goes to MAG,

37:56.007 --> 38:01.212 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the Mines Advisory Group, to safely clear
the artisans' fields of these still dangerous

38:01.312 --> 38:03.214 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
legacies of war.

38:03.314 --> 38:09.287 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
HENRY TIMMS: And the thing we have seen happen
over and over again is the most creative campaigns

38:09.387 --> 38:12.524 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
are coming from some of the smallest institutions,
right?

38:12.624 --> 38:15.226 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
what we often see is, those with the fewest
resources actually thinking of some really

38:15.326 --> 38:19.564 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
smart ideas to try and think about how to
approach Giving Tuesday in new ways.

38:19.664 --> 38:26.271 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MIKE CERRE: Giving Tuesday and recycling bombs
into jewelry isn't as much about anti-consumerism

38:26.371 --> 38:31.409 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
as it is about buying, making and selling
stuff that benefits others and extends the

38:31.509 --> 38:35.647 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
gratification that comes from gift-giving
beyond the holidays.

38:35.747 --> 38:39.184 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ELIZABETH SUDA: The Love Is a Bomb pieces,
I believe, are $185.

38:39.284 --> 38:43.721 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
People are shopping for holiday gifts that
they're going to give to somebody that they

38:43.821 --> 38:46.391 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
love or that they care about.

38:46.491 --> 38:51.663 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And the jewelry that we offer is a symbol
of that love, both in terms of it being a

38:51.763 --> 38:54.832 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
gift, but in terms of the story that it carries.

38:54.933 --> 39:01.773 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MIKE CERRE: Charlie Decker discovered the
story and Article 22's holiday booth in New

39:01.873 --> 39:07.178 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
York's Union Square and bought a matching
set of wedding rings made from bombs to give

39:07.278 --> 39:09.080 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
something back this holiday season.

39:09.180 --> 39:13.318 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
CHARLIE DECKER, Consumer: Hoping that, you
know, all the wounds get healed, and this

39:13.418 --> 39:16.588 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
is our little piece that we had to play in
it.

39:16.688 --> 39:26.564 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MIKE CERRE: For the "PBS NewsHour," Mike Cerre,
reporting from New York.

39:26.664 --> 39:36.174 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now another installment of
our entrepreneur series.

39:36.274 --> 39:41.179 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Emily Feistritzer, who was a Catholic nun
in her youth, later became a teacher.

39:41.279 --> 39:46.684 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In 2011, she created TEACH-NOW, a company
that trains and certifies teachers around

39:46.784 --> 39:47.719 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the world.

39:47.819 --> 39:50.588 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
It is now a multimillion-dollar business.

39:50.688 --> 39:54.726 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
William Brangham returns, having caught up
with Feistritzer in her Washington, D.C.,

39:54.826 --> 39:56.394 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
home.

39:56.494 --> 40:00.431 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For Emily Feistritzer, lifeas an entrepreneur began early.

40:00.531 --> 40:05.069 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
As a young girl growing up in Kentucky, she
went door to door in her mostly Protestant

40:05.169 --> 40:06.871 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
neighborhood.

40:06.971 --> 40:09.707 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
EMILY FEISTRITZER, CEO, TEACH-NOW: Selling
statues of the Virgin Mary that glowed in

40:09.807 --> 40:10.708 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the dark.

40:10.808 --> 40:11.809 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

40:11.909 --> 40:13.077 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That was your first business?

40:13.177 --> 40:15.346 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
EMILY FEISTRITZER: Yes, my first business.

40:15.446 --> 40:20.018 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That business never took
off, but it led to her next stop, the Catholic

40:20.118 --> 40:21.853 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
convent.

40:21.953 --> 40:26.224 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
At 19, she became a nun, and got her first
job in education, teaching high school math

40:26.324 --> 40:28.092 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and science.

40:28.192 --> 40:35.199 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
EMILY FEISTRITZER: I would never, ever be
doing what I'm doing today if I hadn't learned

40:35.300 --> 40:40.705 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the kind of focus and discipline that that
life provided.

40:40.805 --> 40:45.943 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
I mean, you were taught to be laser-focused.

40:46.044 --> 40:49.047 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And you really do trace
it back to your time in the convent?

40:49.147 --> 40:51.182 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
EMILY FEISTRITZER: Absolutely.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.183 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Absolutely.

40:52.283 --> 40:55.787 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
There's no question about that.

40:55.887 --> 41:00.792 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
People sort of say, where did you get your
training to be a successful businesswoman?

41:00.892 --> 41:02.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I say, the convent.

41:02.727 --> 41:06.497 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: She left the convent, and
the Catholic Church, at 31, earned a Ph.D

41:06.597 --> 41:10.668 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and launched a career in education that hasspanned more than four decades.

41:10.768 --> 41:12.370 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
She was a professor.

41:12.470 --> 41:16.541 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
She wrote books on teacher training, started
a clearinghouse on best practices.

41:16.641 --> 41:21.346 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And then, a few years ago, she plopped down
half-a-million dollars of her own money to

41:21.446 --> 41:23.915 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
launch a brand-new digital company.

41:24.015 --> 41:27.452 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You could very easily have just said, you
know what, it's time.

41:27.552 --> 41:31.956 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I'm going to have a peaceful retirement andjust enjoy the end of your life.

41:32.056 --> 41:36.594 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Instead, you dove into what may be, arguably,
the most intense period of work in your life.

41:36.694 --> 41:38.129 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

41:38.229 --> 41:41.632 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
EMILY FEISTRITZER: Well, I was sort of playing
around with retiring.

41:41.733 --> 41:49.273 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I was already getting a Social Security check,and I really didn't like it.

41:49.374 --> 41:53.778 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
I have to be engaged in something.

41:53.878 --> 41:56.314 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
And I didn't want to, like, do pottery.

41:56.414 --> 41:59.217 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That decision has more than
paid off.

41:59.317 --> 42:05.556 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Today, her company, known as TEACH-NOW, has
15 full-time employees, and more than 40 part-time

42:05.656 --> 42:07.458 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
instructors around the world.

42:07.558 --> 42:14.432 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
EMILY FEISTRITZER: It's now bringing in revenues
of around $4 million and a profit margin of

42:14.532 --> 42:17.168 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
about 20 percent, 20-25 percent.

42:17.268 --> 42:23.708 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: TEACH-NOW charges $6,000
per person to take its nine-month teacher-certification

42:23.808 --> 42:25.510 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
program.

42:25.610 --> 42:28.579 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That's a cheaper and faster alternative to
what most traditional universities offer.

42:28.679 --> 42:33.017 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And since it began, more than 1,200 peoplehave completed the course.

42:33.117 --> 42:36.120 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Classrooms look like this.

42:36.220 --> 42:38.423 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Students log in virtually anywhere in the
world.

42:38.523 --> 42:40.825 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And lessons are given by veteran teachers.

42:40.925 --> 42:44.095 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Dan Roggenkamp lives and works in Taiwan.

42:44.195 --> 42:45.897 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
He's leading this discussion.

42:45.997 --> 42:50.234 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DAN ROGGENKAMP, Teacher: So, we're looking
for as little redundancy in information as

42:50.334 --> 42:52.136 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
possible.

42:52.236 --> 42:58.476 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Before completion, however,
people like Walter Allen must spend at least

42:58.576 --> 43:02.847 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
12 weeks in a real classroom, where they are
filmed and monitored by mentors online.

43:02.947 --> 43:07.251 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WALTER ALLEN, Teacher: As a teacher, it helps
a lot.

43:07.351 --> 43:13.057 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Like, I know a lot of first-year teachers
personally who didn't have to undergo any

43:13.157 --> 43:18.429 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
field experience prior to getting hired, and
sometimes that first year is like a disaster.

43:18.529 --> 43:22.433 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Allen is teaching reading
intervention at Kelley Miller Middle School

43:22.533 --> 43:24.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Washington, D.C.

43:24.135 --> 43:27.638 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It's a class designed to help students whohave fallen behind in English.

43:27.738 --> 43:32.443 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He's aiming to not only be certified as a
special-ed instructor, but he also wants do

43:32.543 --> 43:34.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
something much bigger.

43:34.479 --> 43:41.152 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WALTER ALLEN: Growing up, going to D.C. public
schools, elementary, middle school, high school,

43:41.252 --> 43:46.424 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I didn't -- personally, I didn't have many
African-American teachers, African-American

43:46.524 --> 43:48.259 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
male teachers.

43:48.359 --> 43:52.163 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, enrolling into the TEACH-NOW program,
taking education seriously, graduating from

43:52.263 --> 43:59.804 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
college, furthering my education, all of this
allows me to become that idea, that possibility

43:59.904 --> 44:02.940 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
for African-American students that I teach
now.

44:03.040 --> 44:07.712 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They see me inside of their classroom teaching
as an African-American male teacher and say,

44:07.812 --> 44:11.315 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
hey, maybe, one day, I can become a teacher.

44:11.415 --> 44:16.654 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Kerri Valencia is an elementary
Spanish teacher in Washington, D.C.'s Sheridan

44:16.754 --> 44:18.523 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
School.

44:18.623 --> 44:21.792 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
She completed the TEACH-NOW certification
three years ago while living in Ecuador, where

44:21.893 --> 44:24.595 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
she was teaching English at an international
school.

44:24.695 --> 44:29.233 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Valencia had a bachelor's degree in Spanish,
but thought that wasn't going to be enough

44:29.333 --> 44:31.269 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
to land her a teaching job back in the U.S.

44:31.369 --> 44:35.172 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
KERRI VALENCIA, Teacher: And I was just really
drawn to the fact that it was a nine-month

44:35.273 --> 44:36.173 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
program.

44:36.274 --> 44:38.009 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I have a family.

44:38.109 --> 44:41.279 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I wasn't in a place where I could go back
and do another four-year degree or two-year

44:41.379 --> 44:44.115 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
degree, which is kind of what looked my options
were.

44:44.215 --> 44:48.252 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Feistritzer says she's met
several teachers like Valencia, who came to

44:48.352 --> 44:51.489 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the profession late or had been working, but
without certification.

44:51.589 --> 44:55.526 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
EMILY FEISTRITZER: So there's really been
a groundswell of interest in teaching on a

44:55.626 --> 45:02.066 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
part of mid-career switchers, people who've
raised a family and decided to do a career

45:02.166 --> 45:07.538 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
later in life, people who want to move in
and out of careers.

45:07.638 --> 45:10.308 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, that market, I saw coming.

45:10.408 --> 45:17.381 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
When you run the kind of program we're running,
which is not only so good, but it can be taken

45:17.481 --> 45:21.419 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
anywhere, any time, it's very desirable.

45:21.519 --> 45:26.057 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As for what the future may
have in store, Feistritzer says she's keeping

45:26.157 --> 45:30.394 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
an open mind, even to another business opportunity
coming up.

45:30.494 --> 45:41.072 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm William Brangham
in Washington, D.C.

45:41.172 --> 45:48.813 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight: the "NewsHour"
Bookshelf.

45:48.913 --> 45:54.685 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Jeffrey Brown sits down with Pulitzer Prize-winning
author Michael Chabon about his new book,

45:54.785 --> 46:00.124 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
"Moonglow," and the blending of fact and fiction
in literary art.

46:00.224 --> 46:11.068 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Moonglow," a classic tune
performed by Benny Goodman, background music

46:11.168 --> 46:16.907 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in the Berkeley, California, writing studio
of Michael Chabon, where he often works deep

46:17.008 --> 46:18.209 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into the night.

46:18.309 --> 46:21.846 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
"Moonglow" is also the title of Chabon's new
book.

46:21.946 --> 46:26.817 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
A novel, it's presented as a kind of memoir,
blurring the lines between truth and fiction.

46:26.917 --> 46:29.654 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MICHAEL CHABON, Author, "Moonglow": You're
telling a lie when you're writing a novel.

46:29.754 --> 46:30.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
A novel is a lie.

46:30.755 --> 46:31.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

46:31.756 --> 46:32.823 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right.

46:32.923 --> 46:34.725 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MICHAEL CHABON: It's the only good kind of
lie.

46:34.825 --> 46:37.495 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It's the lie that you're telling to someone
with their permission, and not only with their

46:37.595 --> 46:38.829 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
permission, but at their invitation.

46:38.929 --> 46:43.501 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, the reader comes to the novel and says,
lie to me.

46:43.601 --> 46:44.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I want to hear it.

46:44.602 --> 46:45.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Like, tell me a story.

46:45.603 --> 46:46.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

46:46.804 --> 46:47.471 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You, the author, say, let me tell you a good
lie.

46:47.571 --> 46:49.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL CHABON: Exactly.

46:49.440 --> 46:53.711 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And that's part of what is so beautiful about
that particular relationship, is that it's

46:53.811 --> 46:59.984 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a kind of voluntary permission to deception,
just like with magic.

47:00.084 --> 47:06.791 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: In this case, the magic started
with an actual ad he found from a 1958 "Esquire"

47:06.891 --> 47:12.963 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
magazine for something called Chabon Scientific
Company that sold models of missiles that

47:13.064 --> 47:14.899 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you can fly.

47:14.999 --> 47:19.370 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MICHAEL CHABON: My name, C-H-A-B-O-N, if that's
your last name, you're related to me somehow.

47:19.470 --> 47:21.572 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And there aren't very many Chabons in the
world.

47:21.672 --> 47:25.309 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: But this Chabon had never heard
of that company.

47:25.409 --> 47:26.410 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No one had.

47:26.510 --> 47:29.213 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
So, he invented its story as part of "Moonglow."

47:29.313 --> 47:35.953 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MICHAEL CHABON: I defy anyone using Google
to contradict anything I say about the history

47:36.053 --> 47:37.755 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
of Chabon Scientific Company in my book.

47:37.855 --> 47:38.856 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:38.956 --> 47:39.757 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: Because there ain't no history.

47:39.857 --> 47:40.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL CHABON: Not yet.

47:40.858 --> 47:41.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I mean, they may come forward.

47:41.859 --> 47:43.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: There is now.

47:43.661 --> 47:45.730 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MICHAEL CHABON: The real -- the defendants
of the founding Chabon of that company may

47:45.830 --> 47:49.500 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
emerge to tell their version of the story.

47:49.600 --> 47:52.369 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But, until that happens, Google can't help
you.

47:52.470 --> 47:54.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You're at my mercy.

47:54.371 --> 47:58.142 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: Then there was this man, Chabon's
real grandfather, who on his deathbed, under

47:58.242 --> 48:03.948 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the influence of painkilling drugs, began
telling his then-26-year-old grandson unknown

48:04.048 --> 48:06.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
stories from his life.

48:06.450 --> 48:08.319 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
This too became fodder for the novel.

48:08.419 --> 48:12.757 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MICHAEL CHABON: There is all this stuff I
was hearing that was clearly still there,

48:12.857 --> 48:16.660 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
you know, that was in his mind, in his memory,
in his experience, in his life, that I had

48:16.761 --> 48:17.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
never heard before.

48:17.762 --> 48:19.630 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
And it just was all kind of coming out.

48:19.730 --> 48:22.366 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
And I thought, like, you think you know somebody.

48:22.466 --> 48:23.701 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
You think you have heard their stories.

48:23.801 --> 48:25.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

48:25.703 --> 48:30.641 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MICHAEL CHABON: And then to suddenly, at the
very end, get this glimpse of an entire other

48:30.741 --> 48:35.513 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
life that I had never heard of before, not
that it was a life of dark secrets or anything

48:35.613 --> 48:38.682 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
like that, but just there was so much more,
so much more.

48:38.783 --> 48:43.988 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: But then that opens the floodgates
for you, and you, being a novelist, get to

48:44.088 --> 48:45.222 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
play, right?

48:45.322 --> 48:47.825 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MICHAEL CHABON: That's what I do with every
book.

48:47.925 --> 48:55.866 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That procedure of taking bits and pieces of
an element of lived experience, of stories

48:55.966 --> 49:02.206 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I have heard, anecdotes and research or whatever
it might be gets all swirled together with

49:02.306 --> 49:04.041 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the invention.

49:04.141 --> 49:08.145 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The reader wants to hear the lie that sounds
true and ultimately, I think, in the case

49:08.245 --> 49:13.250 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
of fiction, in the case of a novel, that delivers
a truth -- a truth.

49:13.350 --> 49:19.256 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: To see Chabon's studio is to
peek into the brain that produces that invention,

49:19.356 --> 49:24.862 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
action figures, vintage science fiction and
fantasy novels, vinyl records, much of it

49:24.962 --> 49:29.500 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
connected to things he's written, from the
Pulitzer-Prize winning "Adventures of Kavalier

49:29.600 --> 49:35.406 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&amp; Clay" to now the mash-up of "Moonglow,"
which explores war, family and technology

49:35.506 --> 49:40.344 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in mid-century America and mixes historicalfigures with the fictional.

49:40.444 --> 49:45.749 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
War, rocketry, space travel, even -- you and
I have talked about this before when you're

49:45.850 --> 49:47.318 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
writing some of it, genre-bending.

49:47.418 --> 49:52.089 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You know, it's a sort of memoir, but it getssort of into almost fantasy.

49:52.189 --> 49:53.958 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MICHAEL CHABON: Love among people in their
golden years.

49:54.058 --> 49:54.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

49:55.059 --> 49:55.960 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

49:56.060 --> 49:56.961 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
A lot of things going on there.

49:57.061 --> 49:58.863 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
But that allows you the freedom.

49:58.963 --> 50:00.998 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Once you have that freedom, you're off.

50:01.098 --> 50:01.999 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

50:02.099 --> 50:03.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL CHABON: Right.

50:03.100 --> 50:04.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's what it's all about.

50:04.101 --> 50:05.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The facts are so dull.

50:05.102 --> 50:06.003 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

50:06.103 --> 50:07.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: So dull?

50:07.872 --> 50:13.210 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MICHAEL CHABON: We turn to fiction, we turn
to a novel because fiction persuades us.

50:13.310 --> 50:19.783 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
All art persuades us that there is a pattern
to life, that there is meaning to life, that

50:19.884 --> 50:27.625 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
if you look at life the right way, you can
see sense in it, you can find meaning in it.

50:27.725 --> 50:29.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It might not be true.

50:29.193 --> 50:30.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Maybe that's an illusion.

50:31.061 --> 50:38.269 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Maybe that's like the greatest illusion of
the magic act of literature, but I don't care.

50:38.369 --> 50:39.470 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That's what is good about it.

50:39.570 --> 50:40.871 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That's what we turn to it for.

50:40.971 --> 50:43.474 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: The new novel is "Moonglow."

50:43.574 --> 50:45.175 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Michael Chabon, thank you for letting us visit.

50:45.276 --> 50:46.176 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
MICHAEL CHABON: Oh, absolutely.

50:46.277 --> 50:47.177 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you, Jeff.

50:47.278 --> 50:51.015 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

50:51.115 --> 51:08.065 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Online, a 22-year-old Syrian
refugee tells the story of how he fled his

51:08.165 --> 51:13.771 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
war-torn home for the Netherlands, where he
helps other refugees rebuild their lives.

51:13.871 --> 51:17.074 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Plus, has Black Friday become less relevant?

51:17.174 --> 51:20.744 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Our partners from The Conversation tackle
the question.

51:20.844 --> 51:25.149 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
All that and more is on our Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

51:25.249 --> 51:30.154 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And tonight on "Washington Week": a roundtable
discussion focusing on Donald Trump's administration

51:30.254 --> 51:33.223 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
picks and the future of the Democratic Party.

51:33.324 --> 51:36.260 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
That's later this evening on most PBS stations.

51:36.360 --> 51:41.932 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
On tomorrow's edition of "PBS NewsHour Weekend,"
Jeffrey Brown sits down with singer-songwriter

51:42.032 --> 51:48.472 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Norah Jones to talk about her evolving craft,
her signature voice, and her musical roots.

51:48.572 --> 51:52.543 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: Everything I see about this
new album, including in the publicity, it

51:52.643 --> 51:56.747 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
says Norah Jones is returning to her jazz
roots.

51:56.847 --> 51:57.915 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Do you buy that?

51:58.015 --> 51:59.350 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Or what do you think is going on here?

51:59.450 --> 52:01.218 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NORAH JONES, Singer-Songwriter: I definitely
think it's accurate.

52:01.318 --> 52:05.689 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That's now how I would describe what I'm doing,
because I feel like I'm moving forward, as

52:05.789 --> 52:07.558 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I do with every album, you know?

52:07.658 --> 52:11.829 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But I definitely have been playing more piano
again.

52:11.929 --> 52:13.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I don't know.

52:13.764 --> 52:14.932 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Music -- man, it's just music.

52:15.032 --> 52:16.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Just listen to it.

52:16.934 --> 52:21.071 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: Jones was at ease at the Brooklyn
Conservatory of Music recently, not far from

52:21.171 --> 52:24.108 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
where she lives now with a family of her own.

52:24.208 --> 52:26.977 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Marriage and motherhood, right, no doubt changes
your life.

52:27.077 --> 52:28.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NORAH JONES: Yes.

52:28.112 --> 52:29.880 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: Does it change your music?

52:29.980 --> 52:34.718 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NORAH JONES: I don't think necessarily think
that my music is -- I don't go about playing

52:34.818 --> 52:35.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
music differently.

52:36.086 --> 52:39.523 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It changes my sleeping schedule and my drinking
habits.

52:39.623 --> 52:40.958 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:41.058 --> 52:44.328 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's tomorrow night on "PBS
NewsHour Weekend."

52:44.428 --> 52:49.867 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And we will be back right here on Monday with
a look at the far-right movement in France.

52:49.967 --> 52:51.368 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
That's the "NewsHour" for tonight.

52:51.468 --> 52:52.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

52:52.469 --> 52:53.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Have a great weekend.

52:53.470 --> 52:57.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you, and good night.
