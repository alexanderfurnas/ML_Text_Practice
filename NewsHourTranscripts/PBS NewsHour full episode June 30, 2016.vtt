JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.073 --> 00:07.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
a major shift in the military.
The Pentagon

00:12.079 --> 00:16.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
lifts the ban to allow
transgender people
to openly serve in the armed
forces.

00:16.850 --> 00:21.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Then: As the
death toll
from the Istanbul attack rises,
Turkey arrests

00:21.521 --> 00:26.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
13 people with suspected links
to ISIS and
identifies the bombers as
foreign nationalists.

00:26.460 --> 00:31.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Thursday, I
sit down with the U.S.
ambassador to the United

00:31.131 --> 00:37.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nations, Samantha Power, to talk
about the
plight of millions of refugees
and fears of

00:37.237 --> 00:39.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what taking them in may lead to.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER, U.S. Ambassador
to the United
Nations: Some of the fears are
warranted.

00:41.642 --> 00:46.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, people are wondering,
could ISIL
potentially, you know, sneak
through? And

00:46.546 --> 00:47.881 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we have to answer those fears.

00:47.915 --> 00:54.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:54.955 --> 00:57.691 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:57.724 --> 01:07.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: From the Pentagon
today, a
sweeping declaration:
Transgender people are

01:07.868 --> 01:12.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no longer barred from serving
openly in the
military.

01:12.039 --> 01:16.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of Defense Ash Carter
defended the
decision on both moral and
practical grounds.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ASHTON CARTER, U.S. Defense
Secretary: We
have reason to be proud today of
what this

01:19.980 --> 01:24.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will mean for our military,
because it's the
right thing to do, and it's
another step in

01:24.985 --> 01:31.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ensuring that we continue to
recruit and retain
the most qualified people. And
good people

01:31.391 --> 01:34.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are the key to the best military
in the world.

01:34.361 --> 01:38.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will explore
the effects
of today's announcement right
after the news

01:38.565 --> 01:40.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
summary.

01:40.334 --> 01:43.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the day's
other news:
Taliban attackers in Afghanistan
killed 37

01:43.236 --> 01:48.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people and wounded 40 in a
double suicide
bombing. They struck in Paghman
district,

01:48.408 --> 01:53.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about 12 miles to the west of
Kabul. The first
bomber targeted two buses
carrying police

01:53.981 --> 01:58.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trainees. The second blew
himself up when
people rushed in to help the
victims.

01:58.352 --> 02:03.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Two more people
have died as
a result of their wounds from
Tuesday's airport

02:03.290 --> 02:10.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bombings in Istanbul, Turkey.
That pushes
the total to 44 dead, with
dozens more hospitalized.

02:10.630 --> 02:15.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police also said today that the
three suicide
bombers were from Russia and two
of the former

02:15.602 --> 02:19.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Soviet republics. We will have a
full report
later in the program.

02:19.373 --> 02:23.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Meanwhile,
airstrikes in
Iraq devastated two Islamic
State convoys

02:23.243 --> 02:27.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to escape Fallujah this
week. Aerial
video from Iraq's Defense
Ministry showed

02:27.781 --> 02:32.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vehicles as they came under
attack by Iraqi
helicopters and U.S. coalition
warplanes.

02:32.853 --> 02:37.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The attacks began Tuesday night.
Iraqi forces
have now recaptured most of
Fallujah from

02:37.958 --> 02:39.793 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ISIS.

02:39.826 --> 02:43.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.N.
Children's Fund reports
the war with ISIS in Iraq has
taken a terrible

02:43.964 --> 02:50.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
toll on children. One in five,
or more than
3.5 million kids, are classified
at serious

02:51.004 --> 02:55.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
risk of death, injury, sexual
abuse or being
forced to fight.

02:55.809 --> 02:59.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In Britain,
more fallout
today from the Brexit vote.
Former London

02:59.312 --> 03:03.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mayor Boris Johnson dropped out
of the race
to be prime minister. His
support melted away

03:03.450 --> 03:08.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after a key conservative party
ally, Michael
Gove, announced his own
candidacy. Johnson

03:08.188 --> 03:12.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
had been a leader of the
campaign to quit
the European Union. He says his
focus now

03:12.426 --> 03:14.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will be on making the
transition.

03:14.161 --> 03:18.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BORIS JOHNSON, Former Mayor of
London: My
role will be to give every
possible support

03:18.098 --> 03:24.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to the next conservative
administration to
make sure that we properly
fulfill the mandate

03:24.104 --> 03:31.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the people that was delivered
at the referendum
and to champion the agenda I
believe in.

03:31.611 --> 03:35.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Current Prime
Minister David
Cameron is stepping down after
losing the

03:35.682 --> 03:37.851 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fight to keep Britain in the
European Union.

03:37.884 --> 03:43.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A new Palestinian
stabbing
attack today left a 13-year-old
Israeli girl

03:43.423 --> 03:48.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dead, who was also an American
citizen. Israeli
police say a man broke into the
girl's home

03:48.795 --> 03:54.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a West Bank settlement and
knifed her as
she slept. He also wounded a
guard, before

03:54.367 --> 03:59.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being fatally shot. Another
Palestinian was
killed later after he stabbed
and wounded

04:00.006 --> 04:02.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
two Israelis in the coastal city
of Netanya.

04:02.876 --> 04:07.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Back in this
country, the
Navy blamed weak leadership and
bad judgment

04:07.114 --> 04:11.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Iran's capture of 10 U.S.
sailors last
January. Their two boats
mistakenly entered

04:11.985 --> 04:17.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iranian waters, and they spent
15 hours in
Iranian captivity, before being
released.

04:17.224 --> 04:22.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Navy says several violated
military rules
by cooperating with their
captors.

04:22.796 --> 04:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: U.S. Attorney
General Loretta
Lynch is fending off questions
about a meeting

04:27.434 --> 04:32.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with former President Bill
Clinton. Their
paths crossed Monday at an
airport in Phoenix

04:32.939 --> 04:38.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at a time when the FBI is
investigating Hillary
Clinton's e-mail practices as
secretary of

04:38.945 --> 04:40.647 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
state.

04:40.680 --> 04:44.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House spokesman Josh
Earnest defended
Lynch today without specifically
saying if

04:44.284 --> 04:46.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the meeting was proper.

04:46.086 --> 04:50.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
She certainly understands that
investigations

04:50.490 --> 04:58.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should be conducted free of
political interference
and consistent with the facts.
Investigators

04:58.064 --> 05:01.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should be guided by the facts
and by evidence,
and that's ultimately what
should support

05:01.935 --> 05:03.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their conclusions.

05:03.803 --> 05:06.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The attorney
general says she
and the former questioned
president discussed

05:06.773 --> 05:12.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
families and friends, but none
of the issues
involving his wife, the
presumptive Democratic

05:12.479 --> 05:14.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
presidential nominee.

05:14.281 --> 05:17.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: House Speaker
Paul Ryan
is promising a vote next week on
barring terror

05:17.517 --> 05:22.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suspects from buying guns. His
announcement
today follows last week's sit-in
by House

05:22.722 --> 05:27.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats. Republicans say their
bill will
block gun sales tied to the
terror watch list

05:27.460 --> 05:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if prosecutors show probable
cause. Democrats
in the Senate blocked a similar
bill last

05:33.200 --> 05:35.101 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
week.

05:35.135 --> 05:38.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On Wall Street
today, a third
straight rally. The Dow Jones
industrial average

05:38.038 --> 05:47.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gained 235 points to close at
17930. The Nasdaq
rose 63 points, and the S&amp;P 500
added 28.

05:47.647 --> 05:51.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And there's
word the ozone
hole over the South Pole is
getting smaller.

05:51.618 --> 05:55.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. and British researchers say
the hole
is now about one-fifth smaller
than in the

05:55.755 --> 06:02.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year 2000. Their report in the
journal "Science"
credits a 1987 treaty on phasing
out chemicals

06:02.329 --> 06:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that deplete ozone. The gas
shields the Earth
from ultraviolet radiation.

06:06.800 --> 06:11.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
the military lifts its ban on
transgender

06:11.471 --> 06:17.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
service members; new insights
into the identities
of the Istanbul Airport bombers;
the U.S.

06:17.877 --> 06:23.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ambassador to the U.N. on
shaping public perception
of refugees; a Detroit company
that's tied

06:23.750 --> 06:34.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
its own fate to the city; and
much more.

06:34.661 --> 06:43.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Last summer,
Defense Secretary
Carter declared the military's
ban on transgender

06:43.470 --> 06:45.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
soldiers -- quote -- "outdated."

06:45.438 --> 06:49.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carter's announcement today that
transgender
people can serve openly will
impact the estimated

06:49.709 --> 06:57.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2,500 to 7,000 transgender
soldiers currently
serving, out of a total 1.5
million on active

06:58.018 --> 07:03.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
duty. There are between 1,500
and 4,000 transgender
reservists.

07:03.356 --> 07:06.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our John Yang has been reporting
on the new
policy. He joins me now.

07:06.559 --> 07:08.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, what's the big impact,
today's announcement?

07:08.695 --> 07:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, starting today,
transgendered
men and women in the services
can no longer

07:13.533 --> 07:16.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be kicked out simply for being
transgendered.

07:16.736 --> 07:23.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The entire policy is going to be
phased in
over a year, but starting in 90
days, medical

07:23.209 --> 07:29.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
services, medical treatments for
transgendered
service people, hormone
treatments, and even

07:29.215 --> 07:34.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sexual reassignment surgery
itself will be
covered under the military
health care system.

07:34.788 --> 07:38.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a first. They have had to
go outside
the system and pay for it
themselves until

07:38.858 --> 07:40.493 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

07:40.527 --> 07:42.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the
first things
the secretary said in his speech
was that

07:42.495 --> 07:46.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he needed access to 100 percent
of the population
to have the best military
possible. What about

07:46.132 --> 07:48.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the impact on are recruiting,
recruits?

07:48.268 --> 07:52.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Recruits now can go
in if they
are transgendered, if they have
had the reassignment

07:52.305 --> 07:54.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
surgery, sexual reassignment
surgery in the
past.

07:54.774 --> 08:00.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they have to certify or have
a doctor
certify that they have been
without distress

08:00.447 --> 08:05.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or impairment for 18 months.
Now, this is
like any other medical
condition. They're

08:05.285 --> 08:12.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to cut down on lost duty
time. If you
have had knee surgery, you have
got to show

08:12.625 --> 08:16.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the same proof. If you have had
symptoms of
depression, you have got to show
the same

08:16.529 --> 08:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
proof. So this is all treating
it like any
other medical condition now.

08:19.866 --> 08:23.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Why did it
take so long
since his announcement to now?

08:23.670 --> 08:28.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It was delayed
several months.
We don't quite know why. There
have been reports

08:28.408 --> 08:34.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about opposition coming from the
top ranks
of the military worried about
unit cohesion,

08:34.948 --> 08:38.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about military preparedness, and
effectiveness
in battle.

08:38.418 --> 08:44.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There have been some retired
officers who
have been wondering why what
they call a social

08:44.691 --> 08:49.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
experiment is being done at a
time when you
have got troops deployed around
the world

08:49.462 --> 08:55.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fighting insurgent forces. But
Secretary Carter
said he spoke to all the uniform
chiefs and

08:55.402 --> 08:57.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that they are all on board with
this.

08:57.337 --> 09:00.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You know,
there was also
a kind of moral component to
what he was saying,

09:00.573 --> 09:02.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that this is the right thing to
do.

09:02.342 --> 09:07.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He quoted the chief
the staff of
the Army, saying that we are
fighting the

09:07.647 --> 09:12.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- the men and women in the
armed forces are
fighting for people and they're
open to any

09:12.385 --> 09:17.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American, and that if they're
willing to fight
and die for it, they ought to
live by it at

09:18.024 --> 09:19.826 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
all.

09:19.859 --> 09:21.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This comes at
a time when
even there was a conversation
just recently

09:21.661 --> 09:25.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about the Marines taking
gender-based titles
out of their force. Right? This
is an active

09:25.465 --> 09:27.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conversation that is happening
in the military
right now.

09:27.300 --> 09:30.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: I mean, this is
something, we think
about it, in the last five
years, you have

09:30.904 --> 09:35.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had the military open up to gays
serving in
the military serving openly in
the military,

09:35.875 --> 09:41.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women in combat roles, and now
transgendered
men and women serving openly in
the military.

09:41.414 --> 09:46.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This has been a huge social
change in a rather
tradition-bound and rather rigid
-- or thought

09:47.020 --> 09:48.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of as being rigid institution.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And in a
relatively short
period of time.

09:51.024 --> 09:59.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang, thanks so much.

09:59.132 --> 10:07.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We return now to
Istanbul and
the aftermath of Tuesday's
deadly airport

10:07.574 --> 10:12.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attack. More of the dead were
memorialized
today, and larger questions are
being asked

10:12.912 --> 10:15.715 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about how Turkey will respond.

10:15.748 --> 10:19.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
From Istanbul, special
correspondent Jane
Ferguson reports.

10:19.586 --> 10:25.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JANE FERGUSON: Shattered
families have gathered
to bury their loved ones in
funerals across

10:25.492 --> 10:32.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Istanbul. Many of those killed
on Tuesday's
attack at Ataturk Airport were
Turkish nationals,

10:32.499 --> 10:36.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
leaving behind grieving
relatives and a shocked
country.

10:36.436 --> 10:41.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At this small high school in the
city, people
gathered to say goodbye to
28-year-old teacher

10:41.274 --> 10:47.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hussayn Tunch (ph). He was
waiting for a friend
to arrive when the attackers
struck. His students

10:47.113 --> 10:48.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are clearly shaken.

10:48.948 --> 10:52.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT (through translator): We
first heard
the news from social media and
couldn't believe

10:52.385 --> 10:55.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it. Then we checked the school
Web site and
found out it was our teacher.

10:55.989 --> 11:00.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Police say the
attack was planned
here, a historic neighborhood in
Istanbul

11:00.627 --> 11:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
called Fatih. The three suicide
bombers lived
in this second-floor apartment
before that

11:06.866 --> 11:13.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attack. Turkish news media here
report that
neighbors complained of a
suspicious chemical

11:13.273 --> 11:15.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
odor coming from the building.

11:15.642 --> 11:20.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Turkish government says the
three men
were from Russia and the central
Asian countries

11:20.580 --> 11:27.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan,
and that it
was an ISIS operation. Reactions
to Tuesday's

11:27.320 --> 11:33.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attack reflect how polarized
Turkey's population
is. Some locals in Istanbul told
the "NewsHour"

11:34.027 --> 11:38.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they don't think the government
is doing everything
it can to keep them safe.

11:38.565 --> 11:42.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I
don't think they
do enough. With this last
attack, there is

11:42.502 --> 11:46.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not much they can do. They
tried, but they
made it worse. They cannot
control it.

11:46.739 --> 11:49.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Others are
staunch defenders
of the government.

11:49.475 --> 11:53.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): The
opposition,
they don't know anything. They
just talk.

11:53.680 --> 11:58.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JANE FERGUSON: Turkey's
president, Recep Tayyip
Erdogan, has been criticized in
the past for

11:58.885 --> 12:04.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tolerating the Islamic State's
use of the
country as a backdoor into
Syria. ISIS recruits

12:05.024 --> 12:10.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have often traveled through
Turkey on their
way to join the group. It's an
issue that's

12:10.663 --> 12:12.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
led to backlash in the streets.

12:12.699 --> 12:16.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): We
think we are
surviving by chance, because the
government

12:16.636 --> 12:21.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supports ISIS, and innocent
people are killed
as a result. We are here for the
innocent

12:21.240 --> 12:23.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people who were killed yesterday
at the Ataturk
Airport.

12:23.476 --> 12:27.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JANE FERGUSON: Now the
government is under
renewed pressure to react to the
attacks,

12:27.880 --> 12:33.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in part by thawing relations
with Russia.
Erdogan has called for Syria's
President Bashar

12:33.586 --> 12:39.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
al-Assad to step down, and had
been angered
by Russia's support of the
dictator.

12:39.425 --> 12:45.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, Turkish jets downed a
Russian plane
accused of entering their
airspace from Syria.

12:45.164 --> 12:51.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Turkish analysts say Ankara
increasingly
sees Russia as an important
partner, not only

12:52.005 --> 12:53.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the fight against ISIS.

12:53.806 --> 12:58.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BORA BAYRAKTAR, Istanbul Bilgi
University:
Russia provides balance for
Turkey. Turkey

12:58.444 --> 13:03.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
always need a power to balance
European and
American demands.

13:03.383 --> 13:11.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Those swings in
alliances continue,
as Syria's war tests country
after country,

13:11.524 --> 13:16.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and as front-line state Turkey
faces some
of the most daunting challenges
of all.

13:16.562 --> 13:25.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Jane
Ferguson
in Istanbul, Turkey.

13:25.071 --> 13:34.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to my
interview with the
U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, Samantha

13:34.547 --> 13:36.315 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Power.

13:36.349 --> 13:43.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was here in Washington
yesterday to speak
on the plight of refugees, now a
record 65

13:43.056 --> 13:47.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
million worldwide. I spoke with
her yesterday
afternoon at the State
Department.

13:47.927 --> 13:49.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ambassador Susan Power, thank
you very much
for talking with us.

13:50.029 --> 13:51.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER, U.S. Ambassador
to the United
Nations: Great to be here.

13:51.831 --> 13:56.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You are calling
this situation
right now the greatest refugee
crisis the

13:56.602 --> 14:03.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world has known since World War
II. And yet
you see this rising, enormous
backlash in

14:03.076 --> 14:07.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Europe, in the United States. It
says that
a lot of people, maybe most
people, don't

14:08.014 --> 14:11.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
share your view about what to
do. How do you
deal with that?

14:11.851 --> 14:17.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER: Well, I think
there's a lot
of latent public opinion that
also doesn't

14:17.523 --> 14:22.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
necessarily get airtime during
presidential
elections, for instance.

14:22.729 --> 14:29.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are fears. I think
those fears are
stoked. We have seen those in
history at different

14:29.035 --> 14:34.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
times, whether it's on whether
we let in Jewish
refugees during the Second World
War or Vietnamese

14:34.373 --> 14:36.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
refugees after the Vietnam War.

14:36.509 --> 14:42.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there's nothing new in that
set of fears.
I think some of the fears are
warranted. People

14:42.749 --> 14:48.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are wondering, could ISIL
potentially sneak
through? And we have to answer
those fears.

14:48.087 --> 14:54.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we have by putting
in place these
incredibly strenuous vetting
processes that

14:54.727 --> 14:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have the FBI and the Center for
Counterterrorism
and the Department of Homeland
Security at

14:59.899 --> 15:02.268 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the table vetting the time it
takes.

15:02.301 --> 15:07.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we also need to do a better
job lifting
up, I think, the voices of those
people who,

15:07.206 --> 15:12.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
again, aren't necessarily
running for office,
but who have welcomed refugees
into their

15:12.211 --> 15:16.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
homes, into their communities,
or giving small
amounts of money, donating toys.
And I see

15:16.315 --> 15:19.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that all over the place in going
to meet with
refugees around the country, is
just how much

15:19.652 --> 15:21.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
generosity there is at the same
time.

15:21.420 --> 15:26.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you also see,
of course,
the vote in the United Kingdom
to leave the

15:26.125 --> 15:32.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
E.U., the Brexit vote. You see
Chancellor
Merkel in Germany facing
growing, significant

15:32.665 --> 15:34.534 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
opposition.

15:34.567 --> 15:38.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This has become a political
crisis or problem,
as much as a humanitarian one.
How much harder

15:38.971 --> 15:40.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
does that make it for you?

15:40.706 --> 15:44.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER: Clearly, there
are difficult
politics associated with this
issue.

15:44.143 --> 15:49.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we have to be a little
careful to
choose -- to pull out of Brexit
one thing

15:49.582 --> 15:54.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and say, wow, those people voted
that way
because of the Syrian refugee
crisis or because

15:54.887 --> 15:59.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of displacement. I mean, there
were concerns,
of course, that we saw in exit
polls and heard

15:59.592 --> 16:05.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from people about immigration,
so I don't
dismiss the point at all.

16:05.097 --> 16:10.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, I think that part
of what is
making people feel a little
overwhelmed now,

16:10.770 --> 16:16.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just by reading the newspaper,
is a sense
of an uncontrolled flow, just
people tumbling

16:16.542 --> 16:20.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over borders. And that's also
where the security
fears -- people are asking,
well, could -- among

16:21.013 --> 16:27.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that population of ISIL in
Syria, couldn't
they be smuggled into that very
large number

16:27.353 --> 16:29.055 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of people?

16:29.088 --> 16:34.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we're trying to do is
to say we have
systems here. We have processes.
In order

16:34.493 --> 16:38.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for those systems to work, there
has to be
burden-sharing. It has to be
more equitable.

16:38.130 --> 16:44.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It can't just be falling to
Turkey to take
three million Syrians, and then
have countries

16:44.170 --> 16:46.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
washing their hands of an
obligation to take
any.

16:47.006 --> 16:50.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If there's a way to -- and it's
very difficult
to do, but to sort of slow down
the process,

16:50.977 --> 16:55.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make sure that the screening
and the procedures
are in place, to be sure that
communities

16:55.248 --> 16:59.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are ready to absorb refugees
when they land,
because there's nothing worse
than the volatility

16:59.752 --> 17:06.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of an unready community, you
know, meeting
an influx of families who have
gone through

17:06.092 --> 17:07.860 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
so much.

17:07.894 --> 17:10.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it sounds
like what you're
saying is you're calling on
leaders to go

17:10.196 --> 17:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against the popular will in
their countries,
because there are these -- as
you just said,

17:14.467 --> 17:20.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are very real concerns in
this country
that so many of these refugees
may be terrorists

17:20.873 --> 17:24.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hiding or pretending to be
somebody else.

17:24.076 --> 17:27.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER: This is an issue
that has
proven divisive, there's no
question.

17:27.880 --> 17:36.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I, again, draw on the number
of mayors
and local officials and school
board heads

17:36.188 --> 17:41.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who -- and private sector CEOs
who have gone
out of their way in this country
to say we

17:41.761 --> 17:45.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want refugees. We have seen how
refugees work.
We have seen how they enrich our
community.

17:45.631 --> 17:49.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think, again, we just --
we just have
to know that there's more
beneath the surface

17:49.302 --> 17:51.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than necessarily meets the eye.

17:51.037 --> 17:54.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At the same time,
Americans
-- many Americans are looking at
this from

17:54.440 --> 17:59.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a -- frankly, a more parochial
standpoint.
They're thinking these people
may be taking

17:59.178 --> 18:05.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
jobs away from us. They may be
presenting
a very real security threat to
us right now.

18:05.651 --> 18:08.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you guarantee the American
people those
things aren't going to happen?

18:08.888 --> 18:14.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER: Well, what I can
say is that,
since September 11, we have
taken 800,000

18:14.360 --> 18:17.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people into this country in our
resettlement
program and not one of them has
been involved

18:17.663 --> 18:19.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in domestic terrorism.

18:19.565 --> 18:24.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I can say is that our
system for screening
refugees is the most robust of
any for anybody

18:24.904 --> 18:30.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coming into the country, and
that Syrian refugees
get an added layer of vetting
because of the

18:30.910 --> 18:33.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
proximity, of course, with a
battleground
and with ISIL.

18:33.679 --> 18:37.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're probably
the person
in this administration at a high
level most

18:37.416 --> 18:42.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
identified with the humanitarian
cause, certainly
because of all the work you did
on humanitarian

18:42.755 --> 18:45.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
issues before you came into the
administration.

18:45.624 --> 18:51.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you square that with what
has to be,
I mean, from your perspective, a
disappointing

18:51.964 --> 18:54.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
response on the part of the
U.S.? I guess
the U.S. at this point has taken
in just a

18:54.600 --> 18:55.601 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
few thousand...

18:55.634 --> 18:57.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SAMANTHA POWER: Syrians.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... Syrian --
Syrian refugees
out of over -- of millions.

18:58.604 --> 18:59.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER: Yes. Yes.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you
reconcile that personally?

19:01.974 --> 19:09.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SAMANTHA POWER: Well, I
reconcile it in part
because nobody is the more vocal
champion

19:09.648 --> 19:14.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of enhancing our support for
refugees than
the president I get to work for
every day.

19:14.153 --> 19:19.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we have now increased the
number of refugees
we're taking this year to
85,000, including

19:19.725 --> 19:25.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
10,000 Syrians. We are
increasing next year
then to 100,000. That is a 40
percent increase

19:25.898 --> 19:30.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in just a two-year period of
time. We have
got to make sure the system is
ready, and

19:30.569 --> 19:34.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we can do the vetting
consistent with
our primary responsibility,
which is to keep

19:34.774 --> 19:36.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the American people safe.

19:36.642 --> 19:41.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Of course, the
root cause of
the most of the Syrian refugee
crisis is the

19:41.847 --> 19:46.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
war ongoing there. And just
recently, a number
of U.S. diplomats wrote a letter
to Secretary

19:47.019 --> 19:52.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kerry saying they want the U.S.
very much
to take a more aggressive
military role in

19:52.925 --> 19:53.926 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that war.

19:53.959 --> 19:56.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do you -- what's your
feeling about that?

19:56.429 --> 20:02.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER: The views
expressed in that
cable are views and policy
positions that

20:02.701 --> 20:08.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been taken in meetings I'm
in, in meetings
the president has chaired. I
mean, he welcomes

20:08.307 --> 20:10.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that kind of debate.

20:10.042 --> 20:14.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we were able to present
something that
makes a compelling case, where,
you know,

20:14.313 --> 20:20.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the benefits in terms of ending
the Syrian
war are going to exceed the
costs, he's going

20:20.686 --> 20:25.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to embrace that. And there's not
an option
that's been presented, again,
that he hasn't

20:25.257 --> 20:32.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
embraced, you know, that if
somebody presents
it in a manner where it is
compelling and

20:32.965 --> 20:36.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually looks like it's going
to solve the
problem, he's going to be all
over it.

20:36.902 --> 20:41.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to this day, even with the
short time
left in his tenure, we are still
looking to

20:41.540 --> 20:44.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
end the war, and we are still
being encouraged
to look under every rock.

20:44.977 --> 20:52.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: U.S. Ambassador
to the United
Nations Samantha Power, thank
you very much.

20:52.751 --> 20:56.889 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER: Thank you.

20:56.922 --> 21:02.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

21:02.194 --> 21:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
deeper look
into why some voters don't trust
Hillary Clinton;

21:07.166 --> 21:12.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the untold story of women
mathematicians who
launched the U.S. into space;
and Tig Notaro's

21:12.905 --> 21:15.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
take on healing through comedy.

21:15.341 --> 21:20.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: how a small company
in Detroit
is trying to bring more
manufacturing of a

21:20.079 --> 21:21.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
different kind back to the Motor
City.

21:21.981 --> 21:26.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, the company is branding
its products
as built in Detroit. But what
does that really

21:26.685 --> 21:28.420 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mean?

21:28.454 --> 21:31.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Roben
Farzad has the
story, part of our series on
business and

21:31.490 --> 21:34.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
economics, Making Sense, which
airs Thursdays.

21:34.093 --> 21:39.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Shinola's flagship
store in
Midtown Detroit showcases
hand-made leather

21:39.265 --> 21:45.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
goods, bicycles constructed on
site, and,
of course, watches, the product
that put this

21:45.037 --> 21:46.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
luxury brand on the map.

21:46.906 --> 21:52.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you look at your marketing
research for,
say, a 40-something with some
money to spend

21:52.378 --> 21:57.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
walks into a store, and aspires
to buy a Shinola
watch, what is that person
buying?

21:57.716 --> 22:04.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACQUES PANIS, President,
Shinola: First and
foremost, a high-quality time
piece that has

22:04.056 --> 22:05.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a story behind it

22:05.858 --> 22:09.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: President Jacques
Panis says
that story is about Detroit, a
city that got

22:09.929 --> 22:15.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
hit especially hard by a
financial crisis
that saw Washington bailing out
General Motors.

22:15.701 --> 22:21.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Adding insult, the NFL's Lions
went winless,
the city's mayor was indicted,
and Detroit

22:21.407 --> 22:27.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
later filed for the biggest
bankruptcy in
municipal history. Even so, five
years ago,

22:27.513 --> 22:29.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Shinola set up shop here in a
former GM lab.

22:29.582 --> 22:34.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACQUES PANIS: It's a city that
is going to
be one of the great stories of
our country.

22:34.320 --> 22:39.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, yes, it fell on hard times.
And we at
Shinola have come to this city
and have been

22:39.959 --> 22:41.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a small part of this
revitalization.

22:41.961 --> 22:48.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: The company has
created almost
400 jobs here, 240 in
manufacturing. Mesha

22:48.901 --> 22:52.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
McCoy was laid off by a car
parts maker in
2009.

22:52.905 --> 22:57.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This feels much less kind of
what I imagine
manufacturing to be. It's a
clean room. We're

22:57.309 --> 23:00.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wearing, you know, smocks and
we're wearing
things over our shoes.

23:00.579 --> 23:04.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MESHA MCCOY, Shinola: I like it
because, when
we come in, we're clean, and
when we leave,

23:04.650 --> 23:08.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're clean. At the auto --
automotive industry,
it was the total opposite. Go in
clean, you

23:08.988 --> 23:11.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
leave out dirty. So, I love it.

23:11.590 --> 23:15.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: McCoy was one of
the first workers
on the movement assembly line.

23:15.160 --> 23:19.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MESHA MCCOY: I didn't know
anything about
a watch, but to know how to set
it.

23:19.164 --> 23:23.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Titus Hayes used
to work on
dashboards for Chrysler. He too
was among

23:23.068 --> 23:24.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Shinola's first hires.

23:24.903 --> 23:28.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TITUS HAYES, Shinola: They
helped us assemble
the movements and they trained
us piece by

23:28.440 --> 23:32.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
piece, step by step how to
assemble movements,
until we can do it on our own.

23:32.311 --> 23:39.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: The workers on the
floor earn
$13.50-$15.50 an hour. This
year, they will

23:39.818 --> 23:45.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
churn out 225,000 watches.
They're also ramping
up production of leather
passport covers,

23:45.524 --> 23:46.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
key fobs and journal covers.

23:47.026 --> 23:49.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA COOK, Michigan State
University: This
is the future of manufacturing.

23:49.528 --> 23:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Michigan State
University economist
Lisa Cook says the days when
Detroit manufacturers

23:54.733 --> 24:00.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
employed 200,000 are gone. But
there is a
future for smaller, niche
operations like

24:00.039 --> 24:01.840 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Shinola.

24:01.874 --> 24:06.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA COOK: We can expect that
many different
types of novelty products might
be produced,

24:06.545 --> 24:12.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ones that require high skills
like Shinola
watches, and these goods, and
goods like them,

24:12.518 --> 24:14.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
represent that kind of comeback.

24:14.053 --> 24:18.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Detroit is and always has
been an amazing
place to be.

24:18.357 --> 24:22.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Shinola has
closely aligned
itself with the resilience of
Detroit and

24:22.294 --> 24:27.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the revival of American
manufacturing. As
a result, it's won some famous
fans, like

24:27.366 --> 24:29.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
presidents past and present and
movie stars.

24:29.468 --> 24:34.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN AFFLECK, Actor: I got this
Shinola watch
in Detroit. Any time you can
contribute in

24:34.907 --> 24:37.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
any way to that city, it's -- it
feels good.

24:37.710 --> 24:42.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Billionaire sports
and tech
mogul Ted Leonsis invested $25
million in

24:42.081 --> 24:47.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shinola's parent company,
Bedrock. Why? He
saw more and more young people
buying products

24:47.086 --> 24:48.987 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with meaning.

24:49.021 --> 24:52.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TED LEONSIS, Founder, Revolution
Growth: Millennials
really wanted the ability to not
only badge,

24:52.524 --> 24:58.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wear something of high quality,
fairly priced,
beautifully made, like my
Shinola watch right

24:58.630 --> 25:04.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
here, but equally, as
importantly, to be able
to support your community and
your neighbors.

25:04.303 --> 25:09.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Shinola founder
Tom Kartsotis,
who made his fortune building
Fossil watches,

25:09.742 --> 25:14.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
named his company after an old
shoe-polish
brand that came up in
conversation one day.

25:14.079 --> 25:19.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TED LEONSIS: When Tom talked to
his lawyer
and told him, I'm going to do a
moonshot,

25:19.184 --> 25:25.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm going to build the next
great company
to put people to work, he said,
you don't

25:25.524 --> 25:30.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know no (EXPLETIVE DELETED) from
Shinola about
doing that. And he said, what is
Shinola?

25:30.229 --> 25:31.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And went online and...

25:31.230 --> 25:32.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ROBEN FARZAD: Is that
apocryphal? That's real?

25:32.898 --> 25:38.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TED LEONSIS: Yes, and ended up
buying the
brand kind of a little tweak and
fun, you

25:38.504 --> 25:43.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, you're probably right. I
don't know
what we're doing around this,
but let's go

25:43.976 --> 25:45.744 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for it.

25:45.778 --> 25:49.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Though it has yet
to turn a
profit, Shinola made $100
million in revenue

25:49.515 --> 25:58.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last year, up from $60 million
the year before.
But Shinola has its critics, who
point out

25:58.424 --> 26:03.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that it's owned by a company in
Texas, not
Detroit.

Aaron Foley is the author of
"How to Live

Jackass."

26:07.366 --> 26:09.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AARON FOLEY, Author, "How to
Live in Detroit
Without Being a Jackass": It
seemed like overnight

26:09.301 --> 26:15.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they were talked about in the
same, you know,
breath with Ford, GM, and not
just them, Motown,

26:15.140 --> 26:18.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all of these things that are so
iconic and
historic to Detroit.

26:18.177 --> 26:23.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Who's to say that, you know,
once the luster
of the coolness of Detroit wears
off, Shinola

26:23.949 --> 26:28.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
won't, you know, pull up their
stakes and
go to Toledo or Cleveland or
whatever the

26:28.654 --> 26:31.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
next hot Rust Belt, Midwest city
on the rise
is?

26:31.757 --> 26:36.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Detroit writer Jon
Moy believes
Shinola is exploiting Detroit's
travails to

26:36.161 --> 26:37.930 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
make money.

26:37.963 --> 26:44.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jon, come on. Detroit, jobs,
happy workers,
revival, renaissance, leather
watches, how

26:44.369 --> 26:46.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could you have any beef with
that?

26:46.171 --> 26:48.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON MOY, Writer: I don't think I
have a beef
with jobs. I don't think I have
a beef with

26:48.440 --> 26:53.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new things, but, I mean, I think
it's a valid
criticism to say that they have
sort of co-opted

26:53.912 --> 26:58.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this city and the struggle of
the city and
sort of commodified it in a way
that most

26:58.717 --> 27:01.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
companies I think would be
reticent.

27:01.353 --> 27:05.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Case in point,
this ad for a
new watch which ran soon after
Detroit filed

27:05.757 --> 27:07.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for bankruptcy, and this tweet.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JON MOY: You know, "Bankruptcy
schmankruptcy."

27:10.329 --> 27:15.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, I don't think a lot of
people here would
sort of respond the same to the
city canceling

27:15.767 --> 27:22.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pensions and retirement plans
and benefits.
To sort of use it to sell luxury
goods, and

27:22.608 --> 27:27.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
it's, I think, at least
problematic, you know,
and, at worst, it's cynical and
manipulative.

27:27.980 --> 27:32.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Washington has
also weighed
in. The Federal Trade Commission
recently

27:32.417 --> 27:37.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
told Shinola to stop using the
slogan "Where
American Is Made," because so
many parts come

27:38.023 --> 27:39.525 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from overseas.

27:39.558 --> 27:42.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Panis says built in Detroit will
now be qualified.

27:42.561 --> 27:46.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACQUES PANIS: Built in Detroit,
with Swiss
and imported parts.

27:46.532 --> 27:51.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: The company argues
the FTC regulations
are too strict since many
components are not

27:51.403 --> 27:53.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
even available here.

27:53.238 --> 27:57.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TED LEONSIS: Swiss companies are
able to say
made in Switzerland, even though
they're bringing

27:57.843 --> 28:05.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parts in from China and around.
There's a
globalization for manufacturing
companies.

28:05.250 --> 28:10.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Lisa Cook gets the
criticism,
but she thinks ultimately
Shinola is a boon

28:10.556 --> 28:12.457 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for Detroit.

28:12.491 --> 28:18.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA COOK: I am an economist. I
am a macroeconomist.
I will take growth any way you
can get it.

28:18.063 --> 28:25.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even if it's not sort of made
wholly in Detroit,
it's made enough in Detroit.
Open more manufacturing

28:25.337 --> 28:30.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
stores like this, more
manufacturing outlets
like this. There are niche
products that people

28:30.776 --> 28:36.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to buy. So, why not supply
those consumers
who want these goods? And why
not have these

28:36.682 --> 28:38.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
goods come from Detroit?

28:38.483 --> 28:43.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: The Shinola brand
seems to enjoy
goodwill among the locals we
bumped into.

28:43.088 --> 28:45.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Would you get a Shinola watch?
Are you interested
in that brand?

28:45.657 --> 28:46.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: I got two Shinola watches.

28:46.491 --> 28:47.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBEN FARZAD: You do?

28:47.059 --> 28:48.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Two of them.

28:48.827 --> 28:51.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: If they have good
quality, that says
that Detroit has quality
workers. Then people

28:51.964 --> 28:55.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will buy them and bring Detroit
some more
shine.

28:55.300 --> 29:01.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I wanted to get one of the
bikes, but
they're kind of expensive. It's
Detroit, though,

29:01.273 --> 29:02.574 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you know?

29:02.608 --> 29:07.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ROBEN FARZAD: What that
ultimately means,
only time will tell.

29:07.179 --> 29:14.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour" I'm Roben
Farzad reporting
from Detroit.

29:14.252 --> 29:25.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the 2016
campaign for
the White House, as we get
closer to the national

29:26.031 --> 29:27.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
party conventions.

29:27.866 --> 29:32.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Impressions of both Hillary
Clinton and Donald
Trump have begun to take hold in
the minds

29:32.404 --> 29:36.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of more and more voters, some
positive and
some less so.

29:36.775 --> 29:41.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In our ongoing effort to look at
not only
the candidates' positions on the
issues, but

29:41.480 --> 29:46.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also at their personalities and
character
traits, we take a look tonight
at voters'

29:46.251 --> 29:48.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
perceptions of Clinton.

29:48.086 --> 29:51.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s Lisa Desjardins
begins our
report.

29:51.156 --> 29:56.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This past
Monday, Hillary
Clinton directly confronted a
perception that

29:56.061 --> 29:57.929 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has dogged her.

29:57.963 --> 29:59.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
A lot of people tell pollsters
they don't

29:59.798 --> 30:04.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trust me. Now, I don't like
hearing that,
and I have thought a lot about
what is behind

30:04.770 --> 30:06.571 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

30:06.605 --> 30:09.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It's something
even Democratic
voters have expressed, as from
this Sanders

30:09.374 --> 30:11.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
supporters in New York back in
April.

30:11.376 --> 30:15.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: First of all, she's lying
about Benghazi.
She's lying about her e-mails.

30:15.847 --> 30:20.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Recent polls
such as this
week's NBC/Wall Street Journal
survey back

30:20.118 --> 30:25.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up the anecdotes; 69 percent of
those polled
said they're concerned by
criticism that Clinton

30:25.991 --> 30:31.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has a -- quote -- "record of
being dishonest."
Just 28 percent said that wasn't
a concern

30:31.596 --> 30:33.398 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for them.

30:33.432 --> 30:38.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Enter the Republican
nominee-to-be, Donald
Trump. He has his own polling
negatives, but

30:38.437 --> 30:40.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's pouncing on the Clinton
trust gap.

30:40.539 --> 30:44.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Most people know she's a
world-class liar.

30:44.943 --> 30:47.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Just look at her pathetic e-mail
server statements.

30:47.612 --> 30:51.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Some point to
her time in
the White House and the
investigation into

30:51.616 --> 30:56.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
both Clintons' investments in
Arkansas property
known as Whitewater as the
origin of questions

30:56.922 --> 30:58.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about her trustworthiness.

30:58.724 --> 31:04.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Clinton defenders say this
is pure politics,
the drawback of a nearly
four-decade-long

31:04.096 --> 31:06.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
career, this from one Iowa voter
in January.

31:06.932 --> 31:12.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN SCHRAG, Iowa Resident: I
think you can't
be a candidate who has been in
the public

31:12.237 --> 31:17.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eye for as long as Hillary has,
and not have
something that can be sort of
picked apart.

31:17.175 --> 31:22.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The candidate
insists she
is a victim of politics and
misunderstanding.

31:22.781 --> 31:25.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She says she's ready to confront
the issue.

31:25.484 --> 31:30.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: You
can't just talk
someone into trusting you. You
have got to

31:30.188 --> 31:31.456 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
earn it.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm
Lisa Desjardins.

31:33.358 --> 31:38.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We explore this
question of
trust with Anne Gearan. She
covers the Clinton

31:38.497 --> 31:45.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign for The Washington
Post. Democratic
pollster Peter Hart, founder of
Hart Research.

31:45.203 --> 31:49.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And strategist Ann Lewis, she's
a Hillary
Clinton supporter who has known
the candidate

31:49.574 --> 31:51.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for more than two decades.

31:51.309 --> 31:53.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Welcome, all three of you, back
to the program.

31:53.612 --> 31:54.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANNE GEARAN, The Washington
Post: Thank you.

31:54.546 --> 31:56.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Anne Gearan, to
you first.

31:56.448 --> 32:02.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You do follow the Clinton
campaign very closely.
How serious do they view this
issue, this

32:03.021 --> 32:04.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
question of trustworthiness?

32:04.756 --> 32:09.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE GEARAN: Well, I think you
get a measure
of how serious and persistent an
issue, a

32:09.161 --> 32:14.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problem this is for Clinton by
the fact that
she took time out of an
otherwise unrelated

32:14.166 --> 32:20.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
event earlier this week to
address it, which
was, you know, on Monday at an
otherwise civil

32:20.505 --> 32:27.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rights-themed event, she kind of
made an aside
to say, before a friendly
audience, that she

32:27.445 --> 32:31.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
understood that people have
questions and
doubts about her
trustworthiness, and that

32:31.917 --> 32:35.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she's trying to work to address
those.

32:35.320 --> 32:40.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's trying to neutralize it
and cauterize
that the best she can at the
start of the

32:40.091 --> 32:44.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
general election campaign,
because it's something
that stuck with her throughout
the primary

32:44.229 --> 32:49.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and appears to be primed to be a
major topic
during the general.

32:49.100 --> 32:52.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, Peter Hart,
based on the
polling you have done over the
years, especially

32:52.671 --> 32:56.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this year, talking to voters,
what do you
see?

32:56.107 --> 33:00.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER HART, Democratic Pollster:
It's a big
problem. I mean, this is our
NBC/Wall Street

33:00.178 --> 33:06.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Journal poll, and we asked
people to use their
own words when they hear the
word President

33:06.551 --> 33:08.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary Clinton. What comes to
mind?

33:08.887 --> 33:13.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you can see the biggest word
there is
trustworthy, liar, and all of
this. There

33:13.725 --> 33:18.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are lots of good things to say
about her,
but the biggest problem and
challenge that

33:18.730 --> 33:22.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she has is, how do you overcome
the integrity
problem?

33:22.400 --> 33:25.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And this is
unprompted or prompted?

33:25.337 --> 33:30.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER HART: Unprompted. In other
words, this
-- they can choose any word.
People say, I

33:30.175 --> 33:34.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to select a woman. They
like that very
much. They think she's
competent. But the

33:34.813 --> 33:37.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
biggest hurdle for her is
integrity.

33:37.682 --> 33:41.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ann Lewis, again,
as somebody
who has known Hillary Clinton
for a very long

33:41.720 --> 33:47.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time, why do you think -- how --
it's a recurring
issue. Why is that? How do you
see it?

33:47.926 --> 33:50.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANN LEWIS, Former Clinton
Adviser: Well, as
Hillary has said, she knows it.
She doesn't

33:50.528 --> 33:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like it. She knows it. She knows
she has to
work harder to earn people's
trust.

33:54.399 --> 33:59.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, look, Judy, it is not a
coincidence that
we're having this conversation
the day after

33:59.271 --> 34:06.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Benghazi committee report
comes out. We
have had 25 years of partisan
attacks on Hillary.

34:06.745 --> 34:11.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every one of them eventually is
disproved,
it's discharged. But they leave
a residue.

34:11.082 --> 34:16.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the Benghazi report, which
was the seventh,
looking at this tragedy where
people had died,

34:17.022 --> 34:21.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and yet it's being used for
partisan purposes,
really to bludgeon her. The
report comes out

34:21.459 --> 34:27.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and says, no, no wrongdoing,
front page, right,
cleared of any wrongdoing, and
yet her opponents

34:27.265 --> 34:29.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are using it again as a way to
attack her.

34:29.768 --> 34:34.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, yes, she has work to do, as
she has said.
She knows she's made some
mistakes, but the

34:34.205 --> 34:39.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most important thing she can do
is tell people,
I'm going to work hard on your
behalf. You

34:39.477 --> 34:41.313 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can count on me.

34:41.346 --> 34:44.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Peter, what do
you see, again,
in the research and the focus
groups that's

34:44.783 --> 34:48.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the source of this? What's
causing people
to have this lack of trust?

34:48.586 --> 34:53.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PETER HART: Well, what's
fascinating is exactly
what Ann says. It's not a single
event.

34:53.258 --> 34:59.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not as though Hillary
Clinton can go
to the nation and say, I want to
direct and

34:59.230 --> 35:04.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- address this directly. The
problem is there
are a host of things that go
back over 25

35:04.602 --> 35:06.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
years. So, there's not
necessarily...

35:06.104 --> 35:07.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Like what? I
mean, what...

35:07.238 --> 35:09.040 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

35:09.074 --> 35:11.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER HART: Well, you can go
back to Whitewater
that they talk about. They can
talk about

35:11.843 --> 35:19.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all of the elements, whether
it's Benghazi,
whether it's the speaking fees
at Wall Street.

35:19.651 --> 35:26.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of those things become
challenges, and
they build upon one another. So,
as Ann said,

35:26.191 --> 35:31.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
maybe she's answered each and
every one of
these things, but there's not a
sense of transparency.

35:31.763 --> 35:37.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's not a sense of she's
opened all the
books and done all those things.
So that's

35:37.435 --> 35:40.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what's hanging out there. It's
not a single
specific.

35:40.238 --> 35:43.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Anne Gearan, you
have also
talked to voters. You don't just
talk to people

35:43.708 --> 35:49.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the campaign. What do you see
coming through
voters and what is at the source
of this?

35:49.681 --> 35:54.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ANNE GEARAN: Well, it's
interesting that you
mention the speaking fee issue.

35:54.552 --> 35:58.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is something that we heard
an awful lot
about throughout the primary,
and it wasn't

35:58.690 --> 36:04.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a partisan attack, in the sense
that it didn't
come from Republicans primarily.
It came from

36:04.963 --> 36:09.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats. It came from Bernie
supporters.
It came from liberal Democrats
concerned that

36:09.768 --> 36:16.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton was revealing that she
was too close
to Wall Street, point one, and
that she felt

36:16.641 --> 36:21.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- it seemed to them that she
had something
to hide by not releasing the
transcripts of

36:21.112 --> 36:25.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those conversations and not
being willing
to talk in great detail about
what she had

36:25.383 --> 36:27.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said in those closed-door
sessions.

36:27.619 --> 36:35.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So that -- it's the two things.
It's that
she, you know, has made
decisions that people

36:35.527 --> 36:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disagree with, going back
decades, and, in
this case, not that long ago,
and whether

36:41.833 --> 36:48.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
she's being truthful and
forthcoming in the
aftermath in describing those.

36:48.573 --> 36:55.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That particular incident was of
great interest
to us, because it showed that
she, even at

36:55.213 --> 37:00.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a time when it was pretty
obvious that she
was going to run for president,
made decisions

37:00.485 --> 37:07.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that in -- really pretty clearly
were going
to make her look as if she could
potentially,

37:07.525 --> 37:10.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, have something to
hide, that there
was a political -- there was
going to be a

37:10.795 --> 37:12.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
political cost to that.

37:12.564 --> 37:16.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ann Lewis,
basically, your
point is that it's not fair,
it's just the

37:16.534 --> 37:19.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
accumulation of a number of
negative stories.

37:19.270 --> 37:25.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, having said that, does
Hillary Clinton,
do the people around her
understand or -- I

37:25.443 --> 37:28.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mean, how do they think they
turn this around?
How do they deal with it?

37:28.813 --> 37:33.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANN LEWIS: Let me be clear, life
may not be
fair, but you deal with what's
there.

37:33.351 --> 37:38.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Hillary says and knows she
has -- she
has to work hard in this
campaign, again,

37:38.089 --> 37:42.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to earn people's trust, to say
to them, here's
my record of what I have done.
You can count

37:42.760 --> 37:45.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on me. You can count on me to
fight for you.

37:45.830 --> 37:50.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, nobody I know would say,
honey, who
could you count on to fight for
children?

37:50.668 --> 37:55.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, look at Hillary Clinton's
record, and
here is what she will do. So,
this isn't something

37:55.607 --> 37:57.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you address with rhetoric.

37:57.442 --> 38:01.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You do it with action. You do it
with commitment,
and you do it in Hillary's case
by pointing

38:01.846 --> 38:04.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out what she has done throughout
her life.

38:04.749 --> 38:09.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Peter Hart,
again, as
somebody who has looked at a lot
of different

38:09.354 --> 38:13.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaigns, is this something
that a candidate
can turn around? Is this one of
those things

38:13.858 --> 38:19.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you can go out there and
make the opposite
argument? What are the options
for Hillary

38:19.197 --> 38:20.999 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton?

38:21.032 --> 38:23.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER HART: Well, I think the
options are
to get back to -- Hillary
Clinton, I see as

38:23.334 --> 38:29.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of a great antique desk
that has been
painted over a million times,
and if you could

38:29.474 --> 38:32.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just strip away all of that,
she'd have a
much better chance.

38:32.744 --> 38:38.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't think it's on
integrity. I think
it is on being easygoing and
likable, her

38:38.216 --> 38:43.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
friendships, her depth, all of
those things.
People think of her as
competent. They don't

38:43.655 --> 38:48.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trust her. But they don't like
her at this
stage of the game. That's the
thing that she

38:48.193 --> 38:49.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
needs to deal with.

38:49.961 --> 38:52.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So how does she
-- is this
the kind of thing a candidate
can change?

38:52.430 --> 38:58.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER HART: Of course they can.
I mean, it
just is, as much as anything,
all of her friendships.

38:58.069 --> 38:59.804 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Those things need to get across.

38:59.837 --> 39:06.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Somehow, she needs to be able to
have that
nice interchange, which she can
do so well.

39:06.544 --> 39:11.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everything is too much of a
platform. You
don't get that easygoing
qualities that you

39:11.583 --> 39:17.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can see. And if you create that,
then I think
integrity becomes a subpart,
instead of the

39:17.922 --> 39:19.691 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
major part.

39:19.724 --> 39:22.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Anne Gearan, in
talking to
the campaign, do you sense they
have a strategy,

39:22.327 --> 39:27.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they recognize -- as we
pointed out,
Hillary Clinton herself
addressed this, this

39:27.966 --> 39:29.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
week, but what do they do going
forward about
it?

39:29.901 --> 39:34.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE GEARAN: Well, I mean, the
strategy appears
to be two main things, talk
about it, confront

39:35.006 --> 39:40.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it, acknowledge it. It is a
problem, she's
saying, and here's what I'm
going to do about

39:40.411 --> 39:42.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it. I'm going to try to work
hard and earn
your trust.

39:42.847 --> 39:46.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's point one she's doing.
The other thing,
I think -- I have been surprised
we haven't

39:46.184 --> 39:50.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talked about yet, which is, yes,
people don't
like her. Yes, people say she is
untrustworthy,

39:50.922 --> 39:55.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but in the same polling, people
say they don't
like Donald Trump more.

39:55.727 --> 40:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the second part of that
strategy is to
play on people's dislike and
distrust of Donald

40:02.467 --> 40:07.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump, and to try to flesh that
out with data
points from his business
background, which

40:07.338 --> 40:12.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you see not only Clinton and her
campaign
doing, but all of the arrayed
super PACs doing

40:13.011 --> 40:17.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on her behalf right now, rolling
out people
who were victimized -- say they
were victimized

40:17.181 --> 40:23.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by Trump, trying to show where
he stiffed
contractors at his Atlantic City
hotels and

40:23.488 --> 40:25.189 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all the rest.

40:25.223 --> 40:31.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is a different way of
getting at the
question of trustworthiness and,
you know,

40:31.062 --> 40:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
believability, and that's how
they're going
to try to advance her, by
attacking him.

40:35.099 --> 40:37.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Compared to what?

40:37.335 --> 40:37.969 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

40:38.002 --> 40:39.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANNE GEARAN: Right. Exactly.

40:39.871 --> 40:42.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we have got
four-and-a-half
months to go. And we will
continue to watch

40:42.573 --> 40:43.141 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this unfold.

40:43.174 --> 40:43.708 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Anne Gearan.

40:43.741 --> 40:45.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANNE GEARAN: Thank you.

40:45.143 --> 40:45.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Peter Hart, Ann
Lewis, thank
you all. Appreciate it.

40:45.710 --> 40:49.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANN LEWIS: Thank you.

40:49.981 --> 41:00.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now the next
addition to
our summer reading list.

41:00.625 --> 41:05.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a look at some unsung
American heroes
in the space race, the women
behind the scenes.

41:05.863 --> 41:10.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the recent Los Angeles Book
Festival, Jeffrey
Brown sat down with Nathalia
Holt, the author

41:10.034 --> 41:14.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of "Rise of the Rocket Girls:
The Women Who
Propelled Us, from Missiles to
the Moon to

41:14.972 --> 41:16.040 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Mars."

41:16.074 --> 41:17.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Tell me, who were
the rocket
girls?

41:17.942 --> 41:19.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHALIA HOLT, Author, "Rise of
the Rocket
Girls: The Women Who Propelled
Us, from Missiles

41:19.744 --> 41:22.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the Moon to Mars": They are
these unsung
heroes who have touched just
about every NASA

41:22.146 --> 41:23.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
mission that you can think of.

41:23.948 --> 41:29.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And yet they were mostly
forgotten by NASA
and by the Jet Propulsion Lab,
which is where

41:29.053 --> 41:33.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they worked. These women worked
as computers.
And so, before all of the
digital devices

41:33.524 --> 41:35.259 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we have today...

41:35.293 --> 41:36.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, wait a
minute. Explain
that, because I know they're
called literally

41:36.494 --> 41:37.328 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
computers.

41:37.362 --> 41:38.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NATHALIA HOLT: This is their job
title.

41:38.696 --> 41:40.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

41:40.365 --> 41:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHALIA HOLT: You actually
needed humans
to be able to do the
calculations.

41:42.300 --> 41:47.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so this is what they started
out working
as. So, they only had pencil and
paper, and

41:47.572 --> 41:52.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these really loud mechanical
calculators that
couldn't do very much. And, from
that, they

41:53.010 --> 41:57.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were able to calculate an
incredible number
of trajectories for spacecraft,
propellants.

41:57.515 --> 42:01.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So they are
literally computing
and called computers.

42:01.419 --> 42:02.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATHALIA HOLT: Exactly, yes.

42:02.687 --> 42:05.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Before the age
that we are
now living in.

42:05.056 --> 42:09.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHALIA HOLT: But then, once
the first IBMs
came in, then they became the
first computer

42:09.594 --> 42:11.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
programmers in the lab.

42:11.362 --> 42:14.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What kind of
backgrounds did
they come from that brought them
into this?

42:14.565 --> 42:18.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHALIA HOLT: So, they come
from different
backgrounds. Many of them have
only had high

42:18.936 --> 42:22.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
school degrees. But they were
exceptionally
good at math. So, they were
often the only

42:22.974 --> 42:26.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
girls in their math classes, but
they would
-- they loved math. They would
take as much

42:26.844 --> 42:28.513 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as they could.

42:28.546 --> 42:32.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they're weren't very many
options for
women then. Mostly, if you loved
math, if

42:32.383 --> 42:38.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you loved science, your options
still were
nurse, teacher, secretary. And
so, by becoming

42:38.156 --> 42:41.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a computer, they could get
around this and
have a job in science.

42:41.626 --> 42:46.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Give us an
example, someone
that you came to know and love,
because you

42:46.631 --> 42:48.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
told these individual stories,
right?

42:48.166 --> 42:51.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NATHALIA HOLT: I did. I found
these women
and I loved speaking with them.

42:51.202 --> 42:53.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. Yes.

42:53.037 --> 42:57.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHALIA HOLT: A wonderful
example is Barbara
Paulson. Today, she is turning
88. She has

42:57.375 --> 43:03.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a birthday. And she started in
the lab when
she was 19. She had her high
school degree

43:03.080 --> 43:08.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and loved math. And she had an
incredible,
long career. She had a 45-year
career at NASA,

43:08.119 --> 43:09.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
working on all of these
different missions.

43:09.687 --> 43:13.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What kind of
limitations do
they run up against?

43:13.891 --> 43:18.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHALIA HOLT: These women, they
were obviously
paid less than the men, and
their responsibilities

43:18.963 --> 43:23.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
increased as the time went by,
but still they
had many setbacks.

43:23.167 --> 43:26.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, there was sexism
there, as
there is today in science, so
they had to

43:26.871 --> 43:33.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cope with that. But, in general,
they loved
their careers, they loved their
time at NASA,

43:33.211 --> 43:35.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and really had such a big
contribution.

43:35.112 --> 43:38.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You described
them sort of
joining -- sort of like forming
a club. I

43:38.583 --> 43:40.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
suppose that they almost had to.

43:40.051 --> 43:42.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NATHALIA HOLT: They really
relied on each
other.

43:42.253 --> 43:46.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They had -- so they became this
all-woman
group because of Macie Roberts.
So she was

43:46.991 --> 43:52.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the first supervisor of the
computers. She
was made supervisor in 1942, and
so she is

43:52.697 --> 43:57.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the one that decided it should
be all women,
even though men did apply, but
she wanted

43:57.435 --> 43:59.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it to be a close-knit group of
girls.

43:59.437 --> 44:01.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: She kept out the
men?

44:01.172 --> 44:02.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NATHALIA HOLT: She did, on
purpose.

44:02.974 --> 44:04.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, that's an
interesting
-- so a reverse discrimination
in a sense.

44:04.075 --> 44:05.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NATHALIA HOLT: Yes.

44:05.877 --> 44:10.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then this actually continued
for decades.
Then their friends, as well as
co-workers,

44:10.214 --> 44:14.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they had just spent so much time
together,
often all night during missions.
They were

44:14.318 --> 44:17.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there for days sometimes in some
of these
missions.

44:17.855 --> 44:23.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there were also some
concerns that a male
wouldn't do as well taking
directions from

44:23.761 --> 44:24.996 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a female boss.

44:25.029 --> 44:26.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But what kind of
things were
they working on?

44:26.497 --> 44:28.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NATHALIA HOLT: There are
thrilling moments.

44:28.733 --> 44:33.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of my favorite is during
Explorer 1, which
is the first American satellite.
And here

44:33.437 --> 44:37.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you have Barbara Paulson, who is
in the control
room that night. She has worked
in the lab

44:38.009 --> 44:42.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a decade already. And so she
had been
hard at work making this moment
possible,

44:42.580 --> 44:45.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
getting all of the rockets to
this point.

44:45.216 --> 44:49.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she is the one calculating
the trajectory
that night. So, when the first
American satellite

44:49.854 --> 44:54.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a success, its because of
her. She is the
one that found out it's actually
in orbit.

44:54.959 --> 44:59.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Did she get her
due? Did she
get -- did people understand it
at the time?

44:59.230 --> 45:04.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHALIA HOLT: This is a very
sad part of
the book, is that, although she
was celebrated

45:04.402 --> 45:09.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then, and she had a room full of
people who
were so excited by what she had
accomplished,

45:09.073 --> 45:11.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what I found is that much of
that was forgotten.

45:11.842 --> 45:18.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in 2008, NASA held a gala in
celebration
of Explorer 1 for the 50th
anniversary. And

45:18.549 --> 45:22.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
none of the women who worked on
that project,
who were even in mission control
that night,

45:22.954 --> 45:25.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were invited. And this is a very
sad thing.

45:25.222 --> 45:26.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This is in 2008.

45:26.324 --> 45:27.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NATHALIA HOLT: Yes.

45:27.491 --> 45:30.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So the awareness
has not changed
at all?

45:30.561 --> 45:32.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NATHALIA HOLT: Yes, it is very
sad.

45:32.263 --> 45:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But my hope is that, now, they
will finally
get the recognition that they
deserve.

45:36.334 --> 45:41.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We do a lot of
talking on our
program looking at the problem
of young girls,

45:42.006 --> 45:47.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
young women, women getting into
and then staying
in, staying with sciences.

45:47.878 --> 45:48.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NATHALIA HOLT: Yes.

45:48.813 --> 45:50.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What do you see
happening?

45:50.214 --> 45:52.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NATHALIA HOLT: It's a desperate
time for women
in technology.

45:52.917 --> 45:54.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A desperate time?

45:54.185 --> 45:55.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATHALIA HOLT: Absolutely.

45:55.987 --> 46:00.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in 1987 -- 1984 -- excuse me
-- 37 percent
of bachelor's degrees in
computer sciences

46:00.791 --> 46:05.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were awarded to women. And today
that number
is 18 percent. So it's a huge
drop.

46:05.997 --> 46:07.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Why do you think
that's happened?

46:07.898 --> 46:11.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHALIA HOLT: Some of the
reasons are education.
Some of them have to do with the
lack of role

46:11.702 --> 46:16.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
models that young women can see,
they can
see a reflection of themselves
in computer

46:16.407 --> 46:18.709 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
science.

46:18.743 --> 46:23.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's important that we
address this, because
even for the women in science
today, we're

46:23.547 --> 46:26.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seeing that about half of the
women leave
mid-career.

46:26.984 --> 46:33.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I like about the stories of
these women,
the Rocket Girls, is that they
were able to

46:33.190 --> 46:42.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get over many of these hurdles
through -- it
wasn't typical for women to be
mothers and

46:42.133 --> 46:44.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
scientist at this time. And they
were able
to accomplish that.

46:44.835 --> 46:48.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What about in the
space program
itself? The situation for women
has -- well,

46:48.973 --> 46:51.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it has changed dramatically from
the period
you're writing about.

46:51.242 --> 46:52.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NATHALIA HOLT: It has changed
dramatically.

46:52.343 --> 46:52.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

46:52.877 --> 46:54.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NATHALIA HOLT: Yes.

46:54.845 --> 46:59.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what we are seeing is that
for women astronauts,
this is an amazing time. We're
saying half

46:59.283 --> 47:01.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the class of astronauts at
NASA today are
women.

47:01.452 --> 47:03.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I read that half
of the class,
yes, yes. That's striking.

47:03.454 --> 47:05.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NATHALIA HOLT: Yes.

47:05.222 --> 47:08.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is an incredible
accomplishment.
And we should all be very proud
of this. But

47:08.659 --> 47:13.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the engineers who are part
of the space
agency, it is a different story.
And it's

47:14.031 --> 47:17.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one that we need to make sure
that we are
bolstering these women and
encouraging girls

47:17.601 --> 47:19.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
today to go into the sciences.

47:19.236 --> 47:21.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, the
"Rise of the
Rocket Girls."

47:21.939 --> 47:24.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nathalia Holt, thank you so
much.

47:24.608 --> 47:31.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATHALIA HOLT: Thank you.

47:31.415 --> 47:39.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to another in
our Brief
But Spectacular series, where we
ask interesting

47:39.190 --> 47:41.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people to describe their
passions.

47:41.225 --> 47:46.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from comedian
Tig Notaro,
who has used her performances to
overcome

47:46.797 --> 47:52.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enormous personal hurdles,
including a cancer
diagnoses and the loss of her
mother.

47:52.636 --> 47:56.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her memoir, "I'm Just a Person,"
came out
earlier this month.

47:56.507 --> 48:03.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIG NOTARO, Comedian: In 2012, I
was so busy.
I was filming a movie, shooting
a TV pilot.

48:03.848 --> 48:09.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then I started to get sick, and
I got diagnosed
with pneumonia. A few days
later, my mother

48:09.286 --> 48:12.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tripped and hit her head and
died.

48:12.390 --> 48:21.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My girlfriend at the time, she
and I split
up. And then I was diagnosed
with invasive

48:21.232 --> 48:23.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bilateral breast cancer.

48:23.334 --> 48:29.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During that time period, I kept
hearing, "God
never gives you more than you
can handle."

48:29.106 --> 48:33.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That was way more than I could
handle.

48:33.644 --> 48:44.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would hear brave and battling
and all of
these words that I didn't know
that I really

48:44.188 --> 48:52.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
related to. And I kept picturing
the military
hearing about this brave person
and just kicking

48:52.763 --> 49:00.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my door down and coming in to
find me just
crying on my couch for my mommy,
and them

49:00.905 --> 49:06.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being like: Yes, there she is.
We need you
on the front lines. There's the
brave one.

49:06.043 --> 49:14.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That diagnosis just sent me
spiraling, but
also I felt more prolific than
ever. I started

49:14.418 --> 49:21.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
writing nonstop. And I had a
show coming up.
I knew I need an opening line
that was going

49:21.058 --> 49:26.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to crack the tension. I had this
thought that
went through my head picturing
myself walking

49:26.197 --> 49:28.332 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out, saying:

49:28.365 --> 49:36.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Good evening. Hello. I have
cancer. How are
you? Hi. How are you? Is
everyone having a

49:36.540 --> 49:41.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
good time? I have cancer. How
are you?

49:41.879 --> 49:50.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There were so many mixed
responses, from just
stunned silence, to
uncomfortable laughing,

49:50.054 --> 49:51.755 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to crying.

49:51.789 --> 49:58.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To some degree, I was asking for
help, even
while I was trying to make light
of it.

49:58.195 --> 50:04.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I had a double mastectomy,
I didn't have
reconstructive surgery, and I
don't have nipples.

50:04.902 --> 50:09.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was -- you know, it was a
struggle
getting comfortable with myself.
But when

50:09.573 --> 50:21.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I really thought about how it
was just my
skin growing together with my
skin and healing

50:21.986 --> 50:29.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me, why is that uncomfortable or
shameful
or embarrassing or something to
hide?

50:29.927 --> 50:35.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If somebody has a scar on their
face, nobody's
like, hey, you need to cover
that. That's

50:35.432 --> 50:42.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hard to look at. After I really
healed and
was comfortable with my body and
was back

50:42.172 --> 50:46.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
touring in front of audiences, I
kept thinking,
oh, my God, I could take my
shirt off right

50:46.744 --> 50:48.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now and blow these people's
minds.

50:48.746 --> 50:53.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I couldn't take it any longer,
and I just
