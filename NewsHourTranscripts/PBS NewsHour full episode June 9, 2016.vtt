JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.843 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:09.877 --> 00:12.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
I know how hard this job will
be. That's why

00:12.446 --> 00:15.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I know Hillary will be so good
at it.

00:15.682 --> 00:20.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
officially
endorses Hillary Clinton shortly
after meeting

00:20.153 --> 00:26.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Bernie Sanders, who signals
he will support
Clinton, too, after the last
primary is over.

00:26.660 --> 00:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, we sit down with the
secretary of homeland
security, Jeh Johnson, to talk
airport security

00:33.433 --> 00:36.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the state of the terrorism
threat.

00:36.270 --> 00:42.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And how the musical classic
"Porgy and Bess"
is bringing a historical
perspective to the

00:42.175 --> 00:44.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
once segregated city of
Charleston, South
Carolina.

00:45.012 --> 00:49.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIAN GREENE THOMPSON, South
Carolina: This
production coming at this time,
it's needed.

00:49.983 --> 00:55.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to know history. There
are parts of
it that we don't like. But we
need to know,

00:55.455 --> 00:57.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so that that can help us move
forward.

00:57.224 --> 01:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:05.966 --> 01:08.735 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:08.769 --> 01:20.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: They were rivals
for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 2008.
Now President

01:20.247 --> 01:25.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama has formally announced his
support for
Hillary Clinton to be his
successor.

01:25.385 --> 01:31.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, Bernie Sanders
suggested
he's prepared to end his
campaign and work

01:31.158 --> 01:36.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Clinton once the final
primary takes place.
We will have a full report after
the news

01:36.863 --> 01:38.732 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
summary.

01:38.765 --> 01:43.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: Islamic
State suicide
attacks killed at least 31
people in and around

01:43.937 --> 01:50.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Baghdad. Dozens more were
wounded in the attacks.
One targeted a majority Shiite
neighborhood

01:50.210 --> 01:56.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and another an army checkpoint
12 miles outside
the capital. Iraqi officials
said the bombings

01:56.483 --> 02:02.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are counterattacks to the
government's military
offensive to recapture Fallujah.

02:02.756 --> 02:07.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Israel sent hundreds of
additional troops
into the West Bank today after
Palestinian

02:07.627 --> 02:13.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gunmen killed four people in Tel
Aviv. The
Israelis also revoked entry
permits for more

02:13.867 --> 02:20.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than 80,000 Palestinians to
cross into Israel.
Meanwhile, security forces
raided one of the

02:20.640 --> 02:26.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suspect's homes. and they
cracked down on
workshops suspected of making
homemade guns

02:26.313 --> 02:29.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like those used in yesterday's
attack.

02:29.916 --> 02:35.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, the House
of Representatives
moved to address Puerto Rico's
debt crisis.

02:35.222 --> 02:41.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A bipartisan bill will create an
independent
financial control board and
restructure some

02:41.461 --> 02:45.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the island's $70 billion in
debt.

02:45.265 --> 02:49.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Supporters, including Republican
Jim Sensenbrenner,
said it's the only option.

02:49.503 --> 02:54.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. JAMES SENSENBRENNER (R),
Wisconsin: Let's
get Puerto Rico back on track.
And this is

02:54.141 --> 03:00.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a way to do it with some help
from the oversight
board. Puerto Ricans are going
to have to

03:00.213 --> 03:05.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do this themselves. They haven't
been able
to do it without a tap on the
shoulder. Too

03:05.786 --> 03:09.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bad there's an oversight board
but that's
the only game in town.

03:09.589 --> 03:14.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Minority Leader
Nancy Pelosi
and other Democrats also backed
the bill.

03:14.828 --> 03:19.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But some conservatives
complained that it
amounts to a federal bailout.
Others, like

03:19.666 --> 03:26.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrat Luis Gutierrez, who's
of Puerto Rican
descent, argued that it takes
too much authority

03:26.373 --> 03:27.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from local officials.

03:27.974 --> 03:31.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REP. LUIS GUTIERREZ (D),
Illinois: Let me
suggest to you that, if you give
power to

03:31.812 --> 03:42.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a control board unelected and
unsupervised
by anyone here, be careful. Be
careful. Remember

03:42.956 --> 03:47.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Flint. Remember the poisoning of
the people
and what the control board did
there. That

03:47.594 --> 03:50.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is exactly we should suspect
will happen.

03:50.564 --> 03:57.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Puerto Rico has a
$2 billion
debt payment that's due on the
1st of July.

03:57.370 --> 04:02.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Change is coming to the
Pentagon's century-old
promotion system. Currently,
troops who don't

04:02.509 --> 04:07.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
advance to a higher rank within
a designated
time frame are pushed out.
Today, Defense

04:07.981 --> 04:13.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary Ash Carter called for
exceptions
to the timeline in order to keep
high-tech

04:13.086 --> 04:18.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
experts and other specialists.
He also wants
to let the services schedule
promotions on

04:18.692 --> 04:24.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
merit, rather than seniority.
Some of the
proposals will need
congressional approval.

04:24.131 --> 04:29.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thousands of people turned out
today in Louisville,
Kentucky, for a prayer service
for Muhammad

04:29.870 --> 04:36.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ali. Muslims and members of
other faiths gathered
in an arena to begin two days of
remembrances

04:36.743 --> 04:43.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the boxing legend. It's part
of a memorial
plan designed by Ali himself.
The three-time

04:43.450 --> 04:48.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heavyweight champion will be
laid to rest
tomorrow in an interfaith
service also in

04:48.522 --> 04:50.257 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Louisville.

04:50.290 --> 04:54.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial
average lost just under 20
points to close

04:54.694 --> 05:02.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at 17985. The Nasdaq fell 16
points, and the
S&amp;P 500 slipped three.

05:02.702 --> 05:07.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what's next
for Bernie Sanders after
President Obama endorses

05:07.874 --> 05:14.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton; the secretary
of homeland
security talks long airport
lines and terrorism

05:14.314 --> 05:25.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
threats; Making Sense of why
power corrupts;
and much more.

05:25.125 --> 05:36.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, President Obama made it
official, endorsing
Secretary Hillary Clinton to be
his choice

05:36.369 --> 05:41.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as the Democratic nominee. The
president also
met with Senator Bernie Sanders,
who didn't

05:41.741 --> 05:46.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drop out of the race, but did
pledge to work
toward party unity.

05:46.546 --> 05:52.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have our reporters at both
ends of Pennsylvania
Avenue tonight, political
director Lisa Desjardins

05:52.118 --> 05:55.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Capitol Hill, and John Yang
at the White
House.

05:55.855 --> 05:59.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, John, the president was all
in today,
wasn't he?

05:59.826 --> 06:01.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Absolutely, Judy.

06:01.728 --> 06:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His aides say he cannot wait to
get back out
onto the campaign trail. And
even though Senator

06:05.999 --> 06:12.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders wants to fight on for
one final primary,
it's clear that the delicate
dance of joining

06:12.505 --> 06:15.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
forces for the fall campaign is
under way.

06:15.308 --> 06:18.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Tens of millions of Americans
have made their

06:18.445 --> 06:22.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
voices heard. Today, I just want
to add mine.

06:22.048 --> 06:26.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The president made
his formal declaration
in a video released by the
Clinton campaign.

06:26.720 --> 06:32.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Look, I know how
hard this job
can be. That's why I know
Hillary will be

06:32.792 --> 06:38.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so good at it. In fact, I don't
think there's
ever been someone so qualified
to hold this

06:38.632 --> 06:40.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
office.

06:40.533 --> 06:44.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Within minutes, the
candidate tweeted
her response: "Honored to have
you with me.

06:44.037 --> 06:46.840 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm fired up and ready to go."

06:46.873 --> 06:52.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It came the same day the
president met with
Bernie Sanders at the White
House. The Vermont

06:52.512 --> 06:57.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
senator emerged to say he will
press on through
next week's Washington, D.C.,
primary. While

06:57.050 --> 07:00.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not endorsing Clinton, he
promised to work
with her in the fall campaign.

07:00.320 --> 07:03.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
I look forward to meeting with
her in the

07:04.024 --> 07:09.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
near future to see how we can
work together
to defeat Donald Trump.

07:09.429 --> 07:14.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Democrats have begun
the delicate
process of getting Sanders to
stand down without

07:14.401 --> 07:19.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
offending his supporters. Senate
Democratic
Leader Harry Reid met with the
candidate this

07:19.239 --> 07:20.974 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
afternoon.

07:21.007 --> 07:22.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. HARRY REID (D-NV), Minority
Leader: I
think he will, of course, be
involved in the

07:22.742 --> 07:31.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
process of what goes on in
coming up with
a party platform, processing
elections in

07:31.851 --> 07:37.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the future. He's not holding out
for anything,
other than what he believes is
principled.

07:37.290 --> 07:41.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since Tuesday, the president has
gone out
of his way to praise Sanders, as
in a taping

07:41.328 --> 07:44.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last night for NBC's "Tonight
Show" which
will air tonight.

07:44.764 --> 07:50.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: It was a healthy
thing for the
Democratic Party to have a
contested primary.

07:50.070 --> 07:57.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought that Bernie Sanders
brought enormous
energy and new ideas, and he
pushed the party

07:57.977 --> 08:01.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and challenged them. I thought
it made Hillary
a better candidate.

08:01.314 --> 08:06.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: As in today's
endorsement video,
Mr. Obama made note of Sanders'
legions of

08:06.186 --> 08:08.021 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
young voters.

08:08.054 --> 08:11.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: There are millions
of Americans,
not just Democrats, who've cast
their ballots

08:11.825 --> 08:17.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the very first time. And a
lot of that
is thanks to Senator Bernie
Sanders, who has

08:17.664 --> 08:19.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
run an incredible campaign.

08:19.399 --> 08:23.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: While Sanders ponders
his next
move, the president will join
Hillary Clinton

08:23.737 --> 08:29.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the campaign trail for the
first time next
week in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

08:29.075 --> 08:35.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Significantly, that event is the
day after
the final contest, the D.C.
primary. And,

08:35.048 --> 08:39.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tonight, Sanders kicks off his
D.C. campaign
with a big rally -- Judy.

08:39.152 --> 08:43.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, John, it
looks like the
White House, the president put a
lot of thought,

08:43.523 --> 08:47.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
took a lot of care in how they
dealt with
Bernie Sanders here at the end.

08:47.527 --> 08:51.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: As they have said all
through this,
or today, that they say that
Bernie Sanders

08:52.031 --> 08:56.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has earned the right through
what he's done
in this campaign season to end
this campaign

08:56.870 --> 09:01.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on his own time, on his own
schedule. They're
giving him the space to do that.

09:01.808 --> 09:06.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That endorsement video was taped
Tuesday here
in the residence of the White
House. The plan

09:06.846 --> 09:11.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was always to release it some
time after the
meeting, and the indications are
that the

09:11.084 --> 09:15.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
meeting went better than
expected, and they
actually moved up the release --
Judy.

09:15.822 --> 09:19.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, John, we
know the thinking
is, I think, among many
Democrats that it's

09:19.959 --> 09:24.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really important they treat
Sanders well because
of what's he's brought to the
party.

09:24.697 --> 09:26.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: They really do.

09:26.633 --> 09:31.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You will notice in all the
comments, as -- that
he's really been praising
Sanders for bringing

09:31.404 --> 09:37.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
young people in, first-time
voters. They want
him to keep that up, to keep
those people,

09:37.477 --> 09:41.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those young people in the fold,
so that they
will vote for Hillary Clinton in
the fall.

09:41.648 --> 09:44.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, John
at the White
House.

09:44.350 --> 09:47.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now let's turn over to Lisa
Desjardins,
who is at the Capitol.

09:47.854 --> 09:51.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lisa, you have been talking to a
lot of folks
up there today. They were
watching all this

09:51.691 --> 09:53.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
very closely, weren't they?

09:53.259 --> 09:55.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right,
Judy.

09:55.128 --> 09:58.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it looks like the
endorsements have not
ended yet. An important
endorsement is expected

09:58.698 --> 10:03.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tonight. The Boston Globe and
others report
that Elizabeth Warren is
planning to announce

10:03.903 --> 10:08.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her endorsement of Hillary
Clinton tonight,
her voice so important because
Sanders voters

10:08.475 --> 10:11.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may actually respect her voice
somewhat more
than the president's.

10:11.678 --> 10:16.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, Democrats here feel not
just relief,
Judy, but they moved right into
exuberance,

10:16.649 --> 10:20.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
almost, some of them telling
that they think,
if they can unify the Clinton
and Sanders

10:20.753 --> 10:24.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
camps, they have a shot at very
major gains
here at the Capitol.

10:24.290 --> 10:29.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Bernie
Sanders -- Lisa,
a Bernie Sanders was, as we
know, the Democratic

10:29.362 --> 10:36.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
socialist member of the Senate
from the state
of Vermont. He will come back to
the Senate

10:36.970 --> 10:43.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a different place, won't he?
How do members
of the Senate Democrats see what
he's done

10:43.076 --> 10:44.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in this campaign?

10:44.911 --> 10:47.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Democrats here
in the Senate
-- I talked to Senator Dick
Durbin earlier

10:47.514 --> 10:52.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tonight and he said that he
feels that Bernie
Sanders really played a key role
in marking

10:52.685 --> 10:57.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a major part of the Democratic
identity, an
important part of the Democratic
identity.

10:57.524 --> 11:01.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Democrats tonight here in
the Senate are
both figuratively and literally
embracing

11:01.895 --> 11:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders, Chuck Schumer
giving him a
hug, one of my colleagues
reported seeing

11:06.900 --> 11:11.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
earlier tonight. They want him
to feel that
they have his -- that they
respect him and

11:11.504 --> 11:13.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that he's a powerful figure.

11:13.473 --> 11:16.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But all that said, of course,
Judy, the questions
remain as to whether he will get
what he wants

11:16.843 --> 11:21.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the convention. All of this
good support
and nice talk, what does it
bring Bernie Sanders

11:21.481 --> 11:23.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the end? That's a question
for us to watch.

11:23.616 --> 11:27.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one other anecdote. Up here
at the Capitol,
Judy, Republicans, meanwhile,
they are not

11:27.987 --> 11:32.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
following the kind of
choreography we saw
from Democrats today. I ran into
Ted Cruz

11:32.191 --> 11:36.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coming up alone from the Senate
floor today,
asked him if he has heard from
the Trump campaign,

11:36.796 --> 11:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and he said, pause, "I decline
to comment
on that."

11:40.533 --> 11:43.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, not unity yet in the
Republican Party
on that front.

11:43.336 --> 11:47.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Lisa, just
quickly, I
did want to ask you about that.
So, Republicans

11:47.140 --> 11:49.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are not volunteering very much
right now about
Donald Trump?

11:49.809 --> 11:54.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: No, I spoke to
several offices
today, put in a lot of phone
calls to Republican

11:54.180 --> 11:55.982 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
members.

11:56.015 --> 11:58.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one after another, they told
me, we actually
don't want to talk about Donald
Trump right

11:58.952 --> 12:02.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now. They're in a very difficult
position,
and they know it.

12:02.488 --> 12:07.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa Desjardins
at the Capitol,
John Yang at the White House on
a momentous

12:08.027 --> 12:11.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
day here in Washington, thank
you both.

12:11.097 --> 12:18.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: You got it.

12:18.771 --> 12:25.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The first
official day of summer
is just around the corner, but
the summer

12:25.778 --> 12:31.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
travel season is well under way,
and travelers
at major airports across the
country are enduring

12:31.618 --> 12:34.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
record wait times at security
checkpoints.

12:34.754 --> 12:39.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, travel warnings have
been issued
for Americans heading to Europe,
over fears

12:39.659 --> 12:45.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of terrorist attacks there. All
this comes
as the threat of terrorism here
at home persists.

12:45.898 --> 12:51.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining me now to discuss all
this is the
man who oversees Homeland
Security, Secretary

12:51.304 --> 12:52.005 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Jeh Johnson.

12:52.038 --> 12:53.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And, Mr. Secretary, welcome.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEH JOHNSON, U.S. Secretary of
Homeland Security:
Thanks for having me, Judy.

12:55.508 --> 13:00.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So what is the
status of security
screening at American airports
right now?

13:00.380 --> 13:03.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We heard so much about it, about
the problems
a week or so ago.

13:03.850 --> 13:10.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEH JOHNSON: First, we are not
going to compromise
aviation security in order to
expedite wait

13:10.690 --> 13:14.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
times, in order to short-cut
wait times.

13:14.327 --> 13:19.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to keep passengers
moving, but
we're also going to keep them
safe. So, beginning

13:19.065 --> 13:25.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last year, we began to really
take a hard
look at aviation security and
refocus our

13:25.371 --> 13:31.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
efforts. And we knew then that
it would lead
to longer wait times for a lot
of travelers

13:31.277 --> 13:33.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the busiest airports.

13:33.479 --> 13:40.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Couple that with the travel
volume we're seeing
this summer, and that has led to
the wait

13:40.520 --> 13:45.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
times in some of the nation's
busiest airports
at particular times of the day,
like the situation

13:45.558 --> 13:47.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Chicago O'Hare a couple of
weeks ago.

13:47.393 --> 13:49.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

13:49.228 --> 13:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEH JOHNSON: In the meantime, we
have brought
on to full-time status a lot of
TSOs. We have

13:54.267 --> 13:55.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
authorized additional...

13:55.201 --> 13:56.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: These are your
officers.

13:56.602 --> 13:58.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEH JOHNSON: Yes, the TSA
officers that you
see at the airports.

13:58.571 --> 14:04.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We authorized a lot of overtime
for them.
We're using more canine teams.
And right now,

14:04.210 --> 14:11.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have pending in Congress a
request to do
what we call reprogramming of
more money to

14:11.417 --> 14:17.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bring on more and convert more
part-time to
full-time TSOs, which will add
to the screening

14:17.090 --> 14:20.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
capability and lower the wait
times.

14:20.193 --> 14:24.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How did it get to
this point?
TSA is what, now, 15 years old.

14:24.464 --> 14:31.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEH JOHNSON: We have rededicated
ourselves
to aviation security in response
to the world

14:31.904 --> 14:33.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
situation, frankly.

14:33.706 --> 14:39.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That is something that I
directed TSA to do
about a year ago. That has led
to added wait

14:39.679 --> 14:44.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
times, and you couple that with
the increased
travel volume we're seeing, and
it has led

14:44.317 --> 14:47.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to some of the very long lines
in the nation's
busiest airports.

14:47.220 --> 14:53.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, when you say
rededicate
yourself to -- yourselves at
homeland security

14:53.893 --> 14:58.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to figuring out what the
problems are and
dealing with them, does that
mean you found

14:58.931 --> 15:00.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
deficiencies, clear
deficiencies?

15:00.800 --> 15:04.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEH JOHNSON: Well, as a lot of
people know,
last summer, there was an
inspector general's

15:04.103 --> 15:13.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
report that, unfortunately,
leaked that revealed
certain flaws in a specific type
of screening

15:13.412 --> 15:16.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that we conduct at certain
airports.

15:16.182 --> 15:22.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that required us to take a
real hard look
at aviation security. And so the
new administrator

15:22.321 --> 15:26.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
took office, the new TSA
administrator, Pete
Neffenger, took office July 6.
On July 6,

15:26.859 --> 15:32.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I swore him in and I gave him a
10-point plan
for rededicating ourselves to
aviation security

15:32.231 --> 15:38.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in reaction to that I.G. report
and the world
situation that we're seeing with
some of the

15:38.037 --> 15:39.972 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
challenges across the globe.

15:40.006 --> 15:46.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the administrator has
implemented that,
and that has added to the
security at screening

15:46.345 --> 15:48.114 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
checkpoints.

15:48.147 --> 15:51.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In addition to
that, you have,
of course, the Brussels attack,
where what

15:51.450 --> 15:56.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the terrorist did was, they
attacked that
area outside the secure part of
the airport.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What has that meant here in the
U.S.?

15:58.391 --> 16:03.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEH JOHNSON: We have been
focused on airport
security now for almost two
years, really.

16:03.963 --> 16:09.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have directed continuous
random screening
of airport and airline
personnel.

16:09.902 --> 16:16.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have reduced the number of
access points
to sterile areas through which
airport airline

16:16.642 --> 16:22.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
employees pass. But, in general,
an airport,
before you go through security,
is a public

16:22.915 --> 16:27.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
area, just like a train station,
just like
a bus station, just like an
athletic event.

16:27.887 --> 16:34.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so there we need to work
with local authorities,
airport security, to ensure that
travelers

16:34.126 --> 16:37.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are safe when they're in these
public places.

16:37.129 --> 16:42.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We mentioned, as
part of all
this, that warnings have
recently been issued

16:42.401 --> 16:48.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Americans planning travel to
Europe, you
know, in connection with the
terrorist incidents

16:48.374 --> 16:52.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over there. What is -- how
worried, how concerned
should Americans be?

16:52.078 --> 16:57.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEH JOHNSON: My advice is,
Americans should
continue to travel. They should
continue to

16:57.583 --> 17:02.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
travel during the summer months,
but be vigilant,
be aware, pay attention to State
Department

17:02.555 --> 17:07.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
advisories about particular
countries, particular
places at particular times.

17:07.126 --> 17:12.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in general, we're not
discouraging people
from traveling, but they should
pay attention

17:12.131 --> 17:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to those State Department
advisories.

17:13.933 --> 17:19.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A couple of other
quick questions
about the terrorist aspect of
all this.

17:19.472 --> 17:24.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the criticisms that grew
out of the
attacks in Brussels and Paris
was the poor

17:24.110 --> 17:29.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
intelligence-sharing between
countries in
Europe, the members of the
Europe -- so-called

17:29.081 --> 17:31.217 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
European Union.

17:31.250 --> 17:34.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much of a problem is that,
and does that
affect the United States?

17:34.086 --> 17:37.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEH JOHNSON: I think we're
moving in the right
direction with our European
allies.

17:38.024 --> 17:43.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have spent a lot of time
personally with
my European counterparts,
ministers of the

17:43.529 --> 17:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interior, and those in the law
enforcement
intelligence community. And we
are seeing

17:48.034 --> 17:52.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in general a greater level of
information-sharing
with our European allies.

17:52.204 --> 17:59.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that European nations
realize now
the value of information
sharing, both with

17:59.045 --> 18:03.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
each other and with the United
States. And
just since I have been
secretary, I have seen

18:03.215 --> 18:06.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that level of cooperation
increase, and we're
going to keep at this.

18:06.118 --> 18:10.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just finally,
Mr. Secretary,
we have recently seen several
prosecutions

18:10.323 --> 18:13.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Americans who were trying to
join ISIS.

18:13.726 --> 18:18.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How big a problem right now does
this country
have with Americans who are
trying to join

18:18.531 --> 18:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIS or who are simply inspired
by ISIS?

18:20.933 --> 18:27.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEH JOHNSON: In this environment
of not only
the prospect of a
terrorist-directed attack,

18:27.073 --> 18:33.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like, you know, where somebody
is recruited
overseas and exported to another
country,

18:33.045 --> 18:37.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but we're also now dealing with
the prospect
of terrorist-inspired attacks,
as you just

18:37.083 --> 18:40.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mentioned, and this other
category called
terrorist-enabled attacks.

18:40.453 --> 18:45.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have got to focus on
countering violent
extremism here at home and
monitoring the

18:46.025 --> 18:52.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
travel of suspected terrorist
individuals.
There are two components to that
which I think

18:52.832 --> 18:56.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are two centerpieces of our
homeland security
efforts.

18:56.736 --> 19:01.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, what is
the -- what
are the -- what's the main thing
that keeps

19:01.340 --> 19:03.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you awake at night that has to
do with your
job?

19:03.642 --> 19:05.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEH JOHNSON: A lot of people ask
me that.

19:05.511 --> 19:09.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would say that there are a
lot of things
that keep me up at night.
Homeland security

19:09.582 --> 19:14.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is counterterrorism. It's
cyber-security.
It's border security, port
security, response

19:14.320 --> 19:19.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to natural disasters. And we
have got to keep
an eye on all of it, and I think
we do.

19:19.125 --> 19:22.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's a lot.

19:22.128 --> 19:23.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Secretary Jeh Johnson, thank you
very much.

19:23.696 --> 19:28.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEH JOHNSON: Thank you.

19:28.100 --> 19:36.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

19:36.976 --> 19:43.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
World Bank
president's take on Brexit and
concerns over

19:43.049 --> 19:49.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pandemics; an American opera
returns to the
city that inspired it; plus,
what it takes

19:49.388 --> 19:51.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to make a great podcast.

19:51.390 --> 19:58.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: In an era here in
the U.S. where
the inequality gap has become
ever more pronounced,

19:58.431 --> 20:02.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and people are much more
conscious of those
gaps, assumptions are frequently
made about

20:03.002 --> 20:05.404 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the behavior of the wealthier.

20:05.438 --> 20:10.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But recent work on understanding
power is
more complicated and the focus
of economic

20:11.010 --> 20:15.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
correspondent Paul Solman's
conversation tonight.
It's part of his weekly
reporting, Making

20:15.848 --> 20:17.616 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sense.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DACHER KELTNER, Author, "The
Power Paradox":
Power, new studies in economics
are showing,

20:19.919 --> 20:22.021 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
comes from sharing resources.

20:22.054 --> 20:27.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Power comes from
sharing, says
Professor Dacher Keltner, who
studies economic

20:27.093 --> 20:30.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
behavior. But the title of his
new book is
"The Power Paradox."

20:30.996 --> 20:36.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DACHER KELTNER: We gain power by
advancing
the welfare of other people, and
yet, when

20:36.469 --> 20:41.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we feel powerful, it turns us
into impulsive
sociopaths, and we lose those
very skills.

20:41.407 --> 20:48.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: This stretch of park
avenue, on the Upper
East Side of Manhattan is the
wealthiest neighborhood

20:48.447 --> 20:55.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in New York City. But this
street is about
a lot more than money. It's
about political

20:55.688 --> 20:57.423 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
power.

20:57.456 --> 21:04.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: We all know it.
Wealth buys us
what we want, and much of what
we want is

21:04.897 --> 21:12.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
power, over our own fate and
that of others.
A 2014 study found that
America's wealthiest

21:12.805 --> 21:19.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are the only group to influence
legislation.
But money isn't the only route
to clout, says

21:19.211 --> 21:21.013 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Keltner.

21:21.046 --> 21:24.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DACHER KELTNER: What studies
find is, if you're
enthusiastic and you're open to
new ideas

21:24.083 --> 21:30.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and you listen really well and
you express
gratitude and you share
resources, really

21:30.356 --> 21:35.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
simple strategies, you rise in
the ranks in
just about every context that's
been studied.

21:35.995 --> 21:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Well, nobody
studied Renaissance
Florence, right? It may not have
been true

21:40.766 --> 21:42.535 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the past.

21:42.568 --> 21:46.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DACHER KELTNER: Machiavelli
wrote in what
people think may have been the
most violent

21:46.305 --> 21:51.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time in human history, very
violent period
of Renaissance Italy. So, if you
wanted to

21:51.277 --> 21:54.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rise to power, you killed
people. Right?

21:54.046 --> 21:59.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as history's evolved in
those 500 years,
we have seen, and really even in
the last

21:59.418 --> 22:04.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
40 to 50 years, we have seen
this dramatic
shift in what it takes to get
power.

22:04.223 --> 22:07.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Why would there be
such a difference?
How is it that we have evolved?

22:07.426 --> 22:14.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DACHER KELTNER: One is, work has
changed.
Right? Most work today is much
more collaborative,

22:14.900 --> 22:18.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interdisciplinary, complex than
it was 40
to 50 years ago.

22:18.904 --> 22:24.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another reason power has changed
is the influx
of people from different
cultures in the United

22:24.310 --> 22:29.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States, much more multiethnic.
And that's
changed the face of power. And
then women,

22:29.949 --> 22:34.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there are more women in
leadership positions,
and they have a different way of
leading.

22:34.687 --> 22:38.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, evolution, but
only up to
a point.

22:38.057 --> 22:43.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DACHER KELTNER: When we feel
powerful, we
have these surges of dopamine
going through

22:43.062 --> 22:46.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our brain. And we feel like we
can accomplish
just about anything.

22:46.665 --> 22:52.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's where the power
paradox begins,
which is that very sense of
ourselves when

22:52.271 --> 22:55.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
feeling powerful leads to our
demise, leads
to the abuse of power.

22:55.808 --> 23:01.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In a series of
studies we featured
here on the "NewsHour" in 2013,
Keltner and

23:01.347 --> 23:06.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
colleagues at the University of
California,
Berkeley, showed that the
wealthier and therefore

23:06.418 --> 23:10.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more powerful tend to behave
like, well, jerks.

23:10.256 --> 23:16.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They help themselves to candy
meant for children,
cheat in Keltner's lab in a game
of chance.

23:17.029 --> 23:23.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those who drive pricey cars,
BMWs and
the like, are four times more
likely to speed

23:23.168 --> 23:27.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
through crosswalks with
pedestrians, even
though it's illegal in Berkeley.

23:27.239 --> 23:30.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DACHER KELTNER: Who's more
likely to think
that my time is more important
than the safety

23:30.476 --> 23:34.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the pedestrian? It's people
driving more
high-power, wealthier cars.

23:34.713 --> 23:40.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But it's not just
the more affluent
who act more entitled. It's also
those induced

23:40.352 --> 23:51.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to feel rich and powerful in the
lab, as I
experienced in a rigged game of
"Monopoly."

23:51.430 --> 23:56.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Researcher Paul Piff randomly
gave subjects
all sorts of advantages over
their randomly

23:56.835 --> 24:03.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disadvantaged opponents: more
money at the
start, twice as much for passing
Go, and yet,

24:03.575 --> 24:08.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Piff told us, despite their
presumably egalitarian
bent going in, this being
Berkeley:

24:08.547 --> 24:12.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL PIFF, University of
California, Berkeley:
When we asked them afterwards,
how much do

24:12.084 --> 24:16.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you feel like you deserved to
win the game,
the rich people felt entitled.

24:16.622 --> 24:21.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Entitlement, it was
demonstrated
in one of Keltner's favorite
experiments.

24:21.493 --> 24:25.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DACHER KELTNER: We brought three
people to
the lab. We pointed to one
person and said,

24:25.464 --> 24:28.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're in charge, right? So that
person kind
of felt powerful. And then they
had to do

24:28.801 --> 24:33.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this really boring task. And
they're getting
kind of bored. We bring a plate
of chocolate

24:33.539 --> 24:38.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chip cookies. Everybody takes
one cookie.
So the key question is, who
takes that fourth

24:38.377 --> 24:42.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cookie? And, indeed, it's our
person in the
position of power who reaches
out, grabs the

24:42.781 --> 24:45.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cookie and says, that's mine,
eats it.

24:45.084 --> 24:48.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, power corrupts,
and absolute
power corrupts absolutely?

24:48.921 --> 24:52.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DACHER KELTNER: Well, I mean, I
think Lord
Acton was on to something,
right, which is

24:52.257 --> 24:58.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that there are dozens of studies
showing who's
more likely to speak rudely in
an organization,

24:58.831 --> 25:03.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
high-power people or low-power
people? High-power
people. Who's more likely to
have sexual affairs?

25:03.535 --> 25:06.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
High-power people or low-power
people? High-power
people.

25:06.338 --> 25:10.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Who is likely to walk into the
store and pocket
something that they shouldn't --
that they

25:10.442 --> 25:15.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't pay for? And indeed it's
high-power,
wealthier people who are more
likely to shoplift.

25:15.047 --> 25:20.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And yet social
science research
on the benefits of generosity is
clear.

25:20.052 --> 25:26.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DACHER KELTNER: If I share
resources until
you prosper, I feel as much
pleasure as if

25:26.425 --> 25:32.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I were to keep those resources
for myself.
So, it's been built in to our
evolution to

25:32.398 --> 25:39.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
derive benefits from being
grateful or pro-social.
And when we abuse power, we lose
those benefits.

25:39.371 --> 25:45.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But if my group
becomes stronger
because I'm a good leader who
shares with

25:45.043 --> 25:46.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the other members of my group...

25:46.512 --> 25:48.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DACHER KELTNER: Yes.

25:48.380 --> 25:52.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: ... doesn't that
present a danger
to the world, in a sense that
you see in the

25:52.985 --> 25:58.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
countries of Europe and even
here in the United
States, people who are
specifically appealing

25:58.824 --> 26:08.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the group within the country
and excluding
quite explicitly people who are
not in the

26:08.200 --> 26:08.801 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
group?

26:08.834 --> 26:10.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DACHER KELTNER: Yes. Yes.

26:10.736 --> 26:13.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's worrisome. And I think that
people who
have thought deep about the
evolution of morality

26:13.839 --> 26:22.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say this is one blind spot in
our moral predilections,
is what makes us good for the
group may make

26:22.948 --> 26:26.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
us really antagonistic to the
other groups
that make up the world today.

26:27.019 --> 26:32.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But, hey, Dacher
Keltner runs
the Greater Good Science Center.
So doesn't

26:32.424 --> 26:34.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he have some solution to the
power paradox?

26:34.827 --> 26:36.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DACHER KELTNER: I always go back
to the science.

26:36.895 --> 26:38.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: So you can start the
video now.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GIRL: I'm 12 years old. It's a
very rare cancer.

26:40.098 --> 26:47.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DACHER KELTNER: We have done
studies, Paul,
in our lab. If I'm led to feel
compassion

26:47.873 --> 26:53.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and kindness, the divide between
us and them,
and I'm talking about between
Republicans

26:54.012 --> 26:58.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and Democrats, is smaller.

26:58.617 --> 27:05.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the same is true with
gratitude, which
is that, when people are shown
appreciation,

27:05.290 --> 27:10.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when then they are given gifts
and they get
to express gratitude, kind of
the basic metrics

27:10.362 --> 27:16.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of us vs. them tend to be lower.
Right? It
tends to work against this
us-vs.-them divide.

27:16.935 --> 27:22.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: To which many of us
would say
these days, we sure hope so.

27:22.274 --> 27:27.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
economics
correspondent Paul Solman,
trying to practice

27:27.746 --> 27:35.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kindness and gratitude as much
as I possibly
can. Not always easy.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: how the
World Bank is
changing its response to
fast-moving crises.

27:48.834 --> 27:55.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2014, it took months before
international
agencies ramped up their
approach to the Ebola

27:55.541 --> 28:00.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outbreak, and that included
getting money
to hard-hit countries.
Eventually, more than

28:00.312 --> 28:07.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
11,000 people died in West
Africa, and the
economic cost topped $10
billion.

28:07.719 --> 28:13.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now the bank is creating a
fast-disbursing
fund to provide assistance
during pandemics.

28:13.892 --> 28:18.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan spoke recently
with the bank's
president, Jim Yong Kim, about
that and other

28:18.897 --> 28:20.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
humanitarian crises.

28:20.098 --> 28:22.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Dr. Kim,
thanks for joining
us.

28:22.501 --> 28:26.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You recently launched something
called the
Pandemic Emergency Financing
Facility. What

28:26.705 --> 28:28.507 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is this?

28:28.540 --> 28:31.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JIM YONG KIM, President,
World Bank Group:
So, Hari, we were thinking, what
can we do

28:31.810 --> 28:34.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to prevent what happened with
Ebola from happening
again?

28:34.713 --> 28:38.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The response was too late. The
money didn't
start flowing really until about
October,

28:38.984 --> 28:42.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
10 months after we knew that
there was an
outbreak. So...

28:42.554 --> 28:44.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And during
that time, people
are getting infected.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DR. JIM YONG KIM: Absolutely.

28:46.825 --> 28:52.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we said, can we somehow
use our experience
with catastrophe bonds? We have
now developed

28:52.998 --> 28:57.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this way of pooling countries
together. So,
the Caribbean countries who
couldn't afford

28:57.169 --> 29:01.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get insurance policies on
their own, we
have pulled them together. And
when a catastrophe

29:01.573 --> 29:05.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happens, we have now got an
instrument that
immediately releases funds so
that they can

29:05.777 --> 29:07.479 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
respond.

29:07.512 --> 29:09.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We thought, can we do something
like that
for pandemics? And so we started
looking at

29:09.881 --> 29:13.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it. We started talking to
insurance companies.
Insurance companies had never
had an insurance

29:13.919 --> 29:18.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policy for pandemics before. But
they said
we have learned how to insure
lots of different

29:18.991 --> 29:20.826 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
things, let's give it a shot.

29:20.859 --> 29:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here's what it's going to do.
It's a $500
million instrument that has
attached to it

29:27.899 --> 29:32.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an additional $100 million that
will be used
right away whenever we see
anything going

29:32.871 --> 29:39.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on. The $500 million instrument
is for three
classes of diseases, the flu
orthomyxoviruses,

29:39.177 --> 29:45.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which are the flu pandemics, the
filoviruses,
which are the Ebola and Marburg
viruses, and

29:45.917 --> 29:51.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then also the coronaviruses,
SARS and MERS,
that we have experienced in the
past.

29:51.490 --> 29:59.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for those three, this $500
million instrument
will disburse immediately to the
poorest countries

29:59.765 --> 30:05.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in our group, the 77 poorest
countries. And
our hope is that the instrument,
the cash

30:05.671 --> 30:15.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
instrument plus the $500 million
pandemic
facility will go so far upstream
in tackling

30:15.614 --> 30:18.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pandemics that we will stop them
before they
become a big problem.

30:18.650 --> 30:22.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, $500
million sounds
like a ton of money, but
considering how much

30:22.621 --> 30:27.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it costs to deal with Ebola on a
global scale,
there's folks out there saying,
this is just

30:27.325 --> 30:29.227 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not enough.

30:29.261 --> 30:33.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JIM YONG KIM: We think it's
a -- we think
it's not enough for all the
different pandemics,

30:33.432 --> 30:36.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but it's really important that
we have got
a start.

30:36.101 --> 30:44.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, to give you a sense of
perspective, right,
you cannot change the force of a
hurricane.

30:44.543 --> 30:49.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You cannot change the force of a
tornado,
but you can change the force of
an epidemic,

30:49.281 --> 30:51.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and it's all about getting it as
early as
possible.

30:51.983 --> 30:57.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, days make a difference.
Certainly, weeks
and months make a difference.
So, you know,

30:57.589 --> 31:02.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
$50 million, $100 million six
months ahead
of when we actually started
making a major

31:02.294 --> 31:07.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
response to Ebola could have
kept the epidemic
much, much smaller. It's really
not the size

31:08.033 --> 31:12.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the money. It's how early you
can deploy
it that's important.

31:12.137 --> 31:16.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Almost 60
million people
are on the move around the
planet right now.

31:17.008 --> 31:22.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you solve some of these
deep, systemic
problems that are facilitating
this transfer

31:22.714 --> 31:24.516 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of humans?

31:24.549 --> 31:27.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JIM YONG KIM: What we're
seeing is that
these humanitarian crises are
stretching out

31:27.886 --> 31:33.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
10, sometimes 20 years. And what
we were told
by the United Nations High
Commissioner for

31:33.391 --> 31:37.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Refugees, Antonio Guterres, and
now Filippo
Grandi has taken over the role
-- they have

31:37.429 --> 31:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said, we have become development
actors. We're
doing development work. Most of
us are lawyers.

31:41.566 --> 31:46.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're not qualified to do this.
Can we change
the way this happens, so that
instead of waiting

31:46.171 --> 31:51.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the humanitarian response to
finish before
you come in as development
specialists, why

31:51.443 --> 31:53.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't we work together? We don't
we try to
go upstream?

31:53.712 --> 31:58.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, let's use institutions like
the World
Bank in the way that they were
supposed to

31:58.583 --> 32:03.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be used. We have capital. We can
go to the
capital markets and raise funds.
It starts

32:03.488 --> 32:09.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looking attractive if you say,
well, look,
why don't we try to develop a
business activity,

32:09.327 --> 32:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so that you can create jobs not
only for your
citizens, but for refugees?

32:14.833 --> 32:18.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That would create stability.
That would create
hope, less likely for them to
get on these

32:18.370 --> 32:22.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dangerous boats and try to make
their way
to Europe. So, that's what we're
doing. We're

32:22.073 --> 32:27.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to think out of the box,
and use our
capacity as a bank with a
balance sheet, but

32:27.546 --> 32:33.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
also marry that with our
mission, which is
to end poverty and boost shared
prosperity,

32:33.852 --> 32:38.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and tackle these problems
upstream, so that
it never gets to the 60 million
people who

32:38.723 --> 32:40.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are displaced today.

32:40.492 --> 32:43.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the
consequences
especially in Europe right now,
it has a lot

32:43.595 --> 32:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of countries questioning their
identity. And
one of those countries, Britain,
is thinking

32:48.099 --> 32:50.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about walking away from the E.U.

32:50.302 --> 32:53.705 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What are the practical
implications of that
happening?

32:53.738 --> 32:58.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JIM YONG KIM: We don't know
exactly what
the outcomes will be, but we can
take some

32:58.043 --> 32:59.845 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
good guesses.

32:59.878 --> 33:05.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.K. is 25 percent of
financial services
activity of all the E.U. as it
exists now.

33:05.483 --> 33:11.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's 30 percent of the stock
market capitalization,
so this is a huge blow for the
E.U.

33:11.389 --> 33:15.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And also what the U.K. is going
to have to
do is to renegotiate all their
trade agreements,

33:16.027 --> 33:22.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the hit on GDP is going to
be very serious.
Now, our -- we don't work
directly with the

33:22.400 --> 33:28.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.K. economy, but, of course,
the -- any uncertainty
in the global economy is going
to have an

33:28.039 --> 33:29.908 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
impact on developing countries.

33:29.941 --> 33:36.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So we really see that
uncertainty around Brexit
is already having an impact. And
if the U.K.

33:36.715 --> 33:40.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually leaves, we think that
the impact
on developing countries could be
quite substantial.

33:40.452 --> 33:48.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Dr. Jim Yong
Kim of the
World Bank, thanks so much for
joining us.

33:48.260 --> 33:54.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. JIM YONG KIM: Thank you,
Hari.

33:54.499 --> 34:00.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The annual
Spoleto music festival
in Charleston, South Carolina,
will wrap up

34:00.939 --> 34:07.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
this weekend. One of its
highlights, the staging
of a hometown classic, had
special meaning,

34:07.545 --> 34:10.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as the city approaches a tragic
anniversary.

34:10.582 --> 34:13.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our report.

34:13.718 --> 34:24.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Summertime,"
from the 1934
American opera classic "Porgy
and Bess." It's

34:24.963 --> 34:31.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a story set in Charleston and
now being performed
here as the centerpiece of the
40th anniversary

34:31.603 --> 34:34.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
celebration of the Spoleto
Festival USA.

34:34.773 --> 34:41.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The music was familiar, but as
the opera progressed,
it had a less familiar look,
just as visual

34:41.046 --> 34:42.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
director Jonathan Green wanted.

34:42.981 --> 34:47.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN GREEN, Artist: You have
to know what
the stereotypes are to move away
from the

34:47.085 --> 34:48.253 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stereotypes.

34:48.286 --> 34:50.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And what did you
see in the
stereotypes?

34:50.088 --> 34:59.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN GREEN: I saw in the
stereotypes a
complete disrespect of a
continent of Africa,

34:59.764 --> 35:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not being a part of the culture
of a people.

35:01.866 --> 35:06.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Green, one of
Charleston's
most prominent artists, is
himself from the

35:06.604 --> 35:12.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gullah community, descendants of
West African
slaves who lived in this area,
the very setting

35:12.177 --> 35:16.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of "Porgy and Bess," for which
he's imagined
a kind of alternative history.

35:16.648 --> 35:24.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN GREEN: What if West
Africans came
as immigrants? What would we be
looking at?

35:24.389 --> 35:30.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What would we see? And what are
we missing
because we haven't supported
that?

35:30.895 --> 35:36.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The bright
colors, patterns,
and vivid designs, Green
believes, fill in

35:36.935 --> 35:43.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a missing piece and offer a
greater truth
about both the opera and the
city.

35:43.875 --> 35:50.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Set in the 1920s, "Porgy and
Bess" is the
story of the disabled beggar
Porgy, sung by

35:50.348 --> 35:56.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lester Lynch, the beautiful
prostitute Bess,
Alyson Cambridge, and their life
in Catfish

35:56.588 --> 36:02.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Row, a Charleston tenement. It's
based on
the 1925 novel "Porgy" by DuBose
Heyward,

36:02.827 --> 36:06.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who lived near the real-life
tenement, then
called cabbage Row

36:06.364 --> 36:09.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARLAN GREENE, Historian: This
very picturesque
place was once a slum.

36:09.401 --> 36:13.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Local historian
Harlan Greene
has studied the period and the
people. He

36:13.938 --> 36:19.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even found this photo of the
real-life man,
Samuel Smalls, on whom Porgy is
based.

36:19.911 --> 36:23.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I asked him about the success of
Heyward's
original novel.

36:23.481 --> 36:27.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARLAN GREENE: What he did that
was truly
earth-shattering is that he
showed a love

36:27.719 --> 36:33.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
story between a black man and a
black woman,
and this -- a passionate love
affair. And

36:33.892 --> 36:39.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it wasn't Uncle Remus. It wasn't
Aunt Jemima.
He took real people, and it
wasn't a race

36:39.864 --> 36:41.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
novel. It wasn't a stereotype.

36:41.433 --> 36:44.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He shattered all sorts of
conventions at the
time.

36:44.202 --> 36:48.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It was George
Gershwin who
then created the musical
masterpiece. But,

36:48.873 --> 36:54.279 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
ever since, many
African-Americans and others
have seen stereotypes in the
characters and

36:54.312 --> 36:56.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the way they have been
portrayed.

36:56.081 --> 37:00.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the opera came up against
other harsh
realities in its long segregated
hometown.

37:00.985 --> 37:05.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARLAN GREENE: "Porgy and Bess"
and "Porgy"
has always been sort of a
lightning rod to

37:06.024 --> 37:10.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
give us reasons to discuss race
in this country.
They tried to do a version of it
in the '50s,

37:10.762 --> 37:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the play version of it. There
was going to
be a local production. It had
gone into rehearsal.

37:15.934 --> 37:20.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it was going to be in a
segregated hall.
And at first, that was OK. But
then, as people

37:20.572 --> 37:25.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
started thinking about it,
specifically the
local NAACP and the national
NAACP, they thought,

37:25.977 --> 37:29.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well, if African- Americans are
good enough
to be in the starring vehicle,
shouldn't they

37:29.948 --> 37:32.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be good enough to integrate the
hall?

37:32.684 --> 37:36.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And society had not caught up
with the arts
at that time period.

37:36.121 --> 37:37.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So it didn't
happen.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARLAN GREENE: So it didn't
happen.

37:39.390 --> 37:42.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It wasn't until
1970 that an
integrated performance could
take place in

37:42.327 --> 37:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Charleston, in the old Gaillard
Auditorium.
Spoleto's general director,
Nigel Redden,

37:48.700 --> 37:53.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wanted the new production to
open the newly-renovated
Gaillard Auditorium.

37:53.404 --> 37:55.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NIGEL REDDEN, General Director,
Spoleto Festival
USA: The 1970 production was a
kind of a landmark

37:55.940 --> 38:02.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the community, and I want
this to be another
landmark, and a landmark about
how we have

38:02.680 --> 38:09.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
evolved since 1970, how the city
has evolved,
how I hope that nation has
evolved.

38:10.021 --> 38:13.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's grand
terms for an opera
at an arts festival.

38:13.925 --> 38:19.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NIGEL REDDEN: I absolutely
believe that the
arts can and do change the way
we think about

38:19.964 --> 38:21.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
things.

38:21.766 --> 38:24.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One thing people
are thinking
about, the massacre of nine
people at the

38:24.636 --> 38:29.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nearby Emanuel AME Church, just
days after
the close of last year's
festival.

38:29.641 --> 38:33.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHARON RISHER, Daughter of
Shooting Victim:
Her work ethic was just
phenomenal.

38:33.411 --> 38:35.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: She was proud of
the work she
did here?

38:35.446 --> 38:37.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHARON RISHER: Yes, of course.

38:37.248 --> 38:40.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sharon Risher's
mother, Ethel
Lance, was one of those killed.
She'd been

38:40.285 --> 38:46.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a custodian at the theater
before retiring
in 2002. The Memorial Day
performance of "Porgy

38:46.858 --> 38:49.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and Bess" was dedicated to her.

38:49.561 --> 38:56.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHARON RISHER: To come to a
place where my
mom spent 32 years of her life
and to know

38:56.434 --> 39:05.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the performance took the
time to memorialize
her, it just did my heart good,
and I felt

39:05.710 --> 39:10.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like maybe now I have some
spiritual closure
with the auditorium.

39:10.982 --> 39:15.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right after the
shooting, some
victims' family members forgave
the alleged

39:15.687 --> 39:19.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
killer, Dylann Roof. Sharon
Risher doesn't
go that far.

39:19.457 --> 39:25.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHARON RISHER: There is still a
lot of anger.
There is still a lot of pain.
And I know I

39:25.296 --> 39:31.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will get to that point of
forgiveness. But
it just coming out there with me
not working

39:31.803 --> 39:35.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through is not something I have
been able
to do.

39:35.106 --> 39:40.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Spoleto's
producers were determined
that "Porgy and Bess," which
quickly sold

39:40.511 --> 39:46.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out, would be a community
affair. The performance
that honored Ethel Lance was
also simulcast

39:46.451 --> 39:50.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to nearby Marion Square, where
people watched
for free.

39:51.022 --> 39:52.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Marian Greene Thompson was one
of them.

39:52.857 --> 39:58.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIAN GREENE THOMPSON, South
Carolina: As
far as this production coming at
this time,

39:59.030 --> 40:04.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's needed. We need to know
history. There
are parts of it that we don't
like. But we

40:04.802 --> 40:07.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need to know, so that that can
help us move
forward.

40:08.006 --> 40:13.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And all over
town, one could
see so-called Porgy houses,
homes with ties

40:13.611 --> 40:19.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Charleston's African-American
history,
with African-inspired designs by
Jonathan

40:19.217 --> 40:20.985 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Green.

40:21.019 --> 40:25.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This has given you an
interesting canvas,
right? This is more than just
the theater,

40:25.189 --> 40:28.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than the stage. You get the
city.

40:28.559 --> 40:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN GREEN: I get the city,
but, more
importantly, I get the people's
attention

40:35.500 --> 40:40.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to want to know why that's
there, and to have
the opportunity to read about
these people,

40:40.872 --> 40:46.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and to know that it has nothing
to do with
anything, other than giving you
a little more

40:46.978 --> 40:53.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dimension into the history of
black people,
as to why there would be an
opera "Porgy and

40:53.084 --> 40:54.919 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Bess."

40:54.952 --> 41:01.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A wounded city,
with a rich
and often troubled history,
ready to celebrate

41:01.059 --> 41:05.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
anew one of the nation's
greatest works of
homegrown art.

41:05.363 --> 41:11.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From the Spoleto Festival in
Charleston, South
Carolina, I'm Jeffrey Brown for
the "PBS NewsHour."

41:11.035 --> 41:16.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Can't forget that
music.

41:16.808 --> 41:21.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Can't forget that
music.

41:49.841 --> 41:53.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Next, the latest in our Brief
But Spectacular
series.

41:53.678 --> 41:59.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Alex Blumberg has been
responsible for some
of the most innovative forms of
radio in recent

41:59.417 --> 42:05.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years, including NPR's "Planet
Money," along
with the podcast "StartUp," that
documented

42:05.189 --> 42:10.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his experience creating a
podcasting company,
which is now Gimlet Media.

42:10.294 --> 42:13.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He speaks to us now about
creating what he
calls good tape.

42:13.431 --> 42:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX BLUMBERG, Radio Journalist:
When I think
about good tape, what I think
about is some

42:16.134 --> 42:19.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- is tape that is arresting.
You don't want
to stop listening to it. You
can't stop listening

42:19.470 --> 42:26.144 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to it.

42:26.177 --> 42:31.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Great tape is tape where there's
a lot of
truth. There's a media study
where they were

42:31.449 --> 42:37.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to figure out, like,
through which
media is it easier to lie? And
so they planted

42:37.422 --> 42:43.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a false story in a TV program,
in a radio
program and in a print story.
The easiest

42:44.028 --> 42:48.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
medium through which to detect
the lie was
radio. You can hear authentic
emotion. You

42:48.900 --> 42:51.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can hear people telling the
truth.

42:51.602 --> 42:57.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have learned to try to create
the conditions
where good tape will occur. When
I was just

42:57.909 --> 43:01.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beginning, I would go out and I
would do an
interview, and I would have the
feeling like

43:01.612 --> 43:05.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something was there, but I
hadn't gotten it.
And then I would listen back to
my tape, and

43:05.049 --> 43:08.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would just hear myself ruining
moment after
moment.

43:08.753 --> 43:16.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was just learning to shut up
and just sort
of like not fill the silence.
Let people continue

43:16.160 --> 43:20.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to talk. We don't want to just
engage people
on a deep, emotional -- on a
deep, emotional

43:20.631 --> 43:23.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
level, you know, while we're
riding the elevator
with them or in the subway with
them.

43:23.868 --> 43:26.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so we develop these
defenses. And so a
lot of it is just sort of trying
to figure

43:26.838 --> 43:30.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out, like, no, no, no, don't go,
like, the
small talk route, which is,
like, sort of

43:30.575 --> 43:32.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
programmed into us.

43:32.343 --> 43:36.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you actually sit in the
silences,
it feels incredibly
uncomfortable. It just

43:36.914 --> 43:43.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feels like, oh, my God, I'm just
sitting here
and this person is like mad or
angry or upset

43:43.321 --> 43:45.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or -- and I should be saying
something.

43:45.790 --> 43:49.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that's the way we feel a
lot of time.
I don't think it's actually
true. If you are

43:49.293 --> 43:54.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comfortable with them sitting in
silence and
really experiencing an emotion,
they feel

43:54.332 --> 43:58.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comfortable, too. But it's just
-- when it's
happening, in the moment, it
just feels like

43:58.269 --> 44:00.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it's going on forever.

44:00.037 --> 44:04.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are the moments that are
amazing on
the air. Like, those are the
moments where

44:04.208 --> 44:10.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's just sort of, like, sort of
raw, electric
silence. You know, that's what
you're going

44:10.781 --> 44:12.450 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for.

44:12.483 --> 44:17.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My name is Alex Blumberg, and
this is my Brief
But Spectacular take on good
tape.

44:17.121 --> 44:23.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can watch
more of our

That's PBS.org/NewsHour/Brief.

44:27.198 --> 44:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will be back in a moment.

44:28.933 --> 44:33.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, take this time to
hear from your
local PBS station. It's a chance
to offer

44:33.271 --> 44:39.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your support, which helps keep
programs like
ours on the air.

(BREAK)

44:43.381 --> 44:58.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now for a
news update.

44:58.162 --> 45:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The House of Representatives
voted overwhelmingly
this evening to pass a bill to
help Puerto

45:03.134 --> 45:14.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rico out of its debt crisis. The
legislation
will create a federal oversight
board and

45:14.445 --> 45:23.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
restructure its $70 billion
debt. The bill
now heads to the Senate for a
vote.

45:23.054 --> 45:26.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Online, in our first episode of
something
we're calling Science Scope, our
producer

45:26.724 --> 45:37.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nsikan Akpan breaks down the
science of smell.
Scientists have designed an
experiment that

45:37.301 --> 45:47.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allows them to visualize odors
as they move
through space, an innovation
that could help

as they move
through space, an innovation
that could help

45:56.287 --> 46:02.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
train dogs or robots in rescue
missions.

46:02.126 --> 46:06.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
train dogs or robots in rescue
missions.

46:22.513 --> 46:27.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NSIKAN AKPAN: That

NSIKAN AKPAN: That

46:55.312 --> 47:05.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is an odor, or at least what an
odor looks
like. Odors are normally
invisible, swirling

47:05.423 --> 47:11.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is an odor, or at least what an

invisible, swirling

47:11.696 --> 47:21.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

the secret
behind why you can see this one.

47:21.739 --> 47:29.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
