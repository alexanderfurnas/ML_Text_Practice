JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.766 --> 00:06.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.766 --> 00:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.766 --> 00:09.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: We should hammer
this out, and get it done.

00:09.966 --> 00:12.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
Changing his tune.

00:12.066 --> 00:16.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The president calls
on Republicans not to
leave Washington until
a health care plan

00:16.333 --> 00:18.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is approved.

00:18.300 --> 00:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We talk with two senators,
Roberts of Kansas and Wicker
of Mississippi, about where the

00:23.866 --> 00:26.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
effort to repeal
Obamacare stands.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Then: New revelations of
an undisclosed meeting
between President Trump
and Russia's President

00:32.733 --> 00:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Putin at the G20 summit bring
the two leaders' relationship
back into the spotlight.

00:39.066 --> 00:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plus: With food stamps on the
president's chopping block,
we travel south to see what

00:45.166 --> 00:48.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these changes could mean for
a state that overwhelmingly
supported him in the election.

00:50.866 --> 00:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES JACKSON, Receives SNAP
Assistance: Give me a chance to
get off the very program that

00:53.333 --> 00:55.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you're trying to cut.

00:55.966 --> 00:57.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I want to get off.

00:57.433 --> 01:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But if you take away my ability
to get off, what can I do?

01:01.500 --> 01:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:09.133 --> 01:11.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:11.966 --> 01:16.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senate
Republicans are trying
again to see if there
is a way forward on

01:21.100 --> 01:23.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
health care reform.

01:23.133 --> 01:27.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their latest bill to replace
Obamacare collapsed yesterday,
but party leaders say it may not

01:29.233 --> 01:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be dead yet, after a repeal-only
option also ran into opposition.

01:34.900 --> 01:37.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Trump called the
caucus to the White House today.

01:37.166 --> 01:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said he is now ready
to act, and insisted that
inaction is not an option.

01:42.066 --> 01:46.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: Frankly, I don't
think we should leave town

01:46.566 --> 01:51.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
unless we have a health
insurance plan, unless
we can give our people
great health care,

01:53.333 --> 01:54.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
because we're close.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're very close.

01:56.433 --> 02:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Any senator who votes against
starting debate is really
telling America that you're fine

02:03.100 --> 02:05.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Obamacare.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Afterward,
Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell said he still aims

02:08.866 --> 02:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to hold a vote next week,
but it's not clear on what.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:14.300 --> 02:17.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: I think we all agree
it's better to both repeal

02:17.166 --> 02:19.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and replace.

02:19.933 --> 02:23.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But we could have
a vote on either.

02:23.200 --> 02:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if we end up voting on
repeal only, it will be fully
amendable on the Senate floor.

02:30.366 --> 02:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if it were to pass without
any amendment at all, there's
a two-year delay before it

02:35.133 --> 02:37.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
kicks in.

02:37.700 --> 02:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will be
talking to two Republican
senators about the
state of play on health

02:40.400 --> 02:43.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
care reform after
the news summary.

02:43.233 --> 02:48.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Separately, there's word
that President Trump is
ending a CIA program to
arm and train moderate

02:49.500 --> 02:51.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
rebels in Syria.

02:51.633 --> 02:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The goal was to fight the regime
of President Bashar al-Assad,
but it had only limited effects

02:57.200 --> 03:00.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
after Russia intervened
to aid Assad.

03:00.133 --> 03:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Washington Post reports
the president made the decision
nearly a month ago, before

03:04.800 --> 03:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he met with Russian's President
Putin at the G20 summit.

03:07.433 --> 03:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Afterward, the U.S. and
Russia announced a limited
cease-fire in Syria.

03:14.366 --> 03:18.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Post account says that
the aid decision is part of a
strategy to negotiate more such

03:19.133 --> 03:21.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
deals.

03:21.100 --> 03:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iran today stepped up its
defiant response to the latest
round of U.S. sanctions.

03:27.266 --> 03:30.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They target 18 individuals and
companies assisting the Iranian
ballistic missile program.

03:32.733 --> 03:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Tehran, President Hassan
Rouhani charged that the U.S.
measures are inconsistent with

03:38.033 --> 03:40.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the 2016 nuclear deal.

03:40.233 --> 03:42.666 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And he warned of
reciprocal acts.

03:42.666 --> 03:45.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HASSAN ROUHANI, Iranian
President (through
translator): If Americans
pass new sanctions

03:45.966 --> 03:50.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in any form, or under
any pretext in Congress
or elsewhere, the great
nation of Iran will

03:50.666 --> 03:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have an appropriate answer.

03:52.733 --> 03:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We won't ignore violations
by the United States, and
will stand up to them.

03:56.033 --> 04:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also, the head
of the hard-line Revolutionary
Guards warned that the U.S.

04:00.966 --> 04:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had better pull its military
forces back at least 1,000
kilometers, or 600 miles, from

04:07.900 --> 04:09.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Iran.

04:09.800 --> 04:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. Supreme Court has
issued a split ruling on
enforcing the president's travel

04:14.800 --> 04:16.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ban.

04:16.766 --> 04:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The court today allowed the
administration to strictly
enforce a ban on refugees while

04:21.433 --> 04:23.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an appeal moves
through lower courts.

04:23.566 --> 04:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the justices expanded the
list of people from six mostly
Muslim nations who are allowed

04:29.000 --> 04:31.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to visit the U.S.

04:31.366 --> 04:36.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in this country, the
Justice Department is restoring
authority to local police to

04:38.000 --> 04:41.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
seize money and property
on suspicion they come
from criminal activity.

04:41.166 --> 04:45.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The assets can be taken
even without criminal
charges being brought.

04:45.433 --> 04:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Obama administration
had curbed the practice,
but Attorney General
Jeff Sessions today eased

04:51.166 --> 04:53.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the restrictions.

04:53.200 --> 04:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Wall Street, tech and health
care stocks fueled a day of
record highs across the board.

04:58.900 --> 05:03.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Dow Jones industrial
average gained 66 points
to close at 21640.

05:04.400 --> 05:08.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Nasdaq rose 40, and
the S&amp;P 500 added 13.

05:08.466 --> 05:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Salem, Massachusetts,
today marked 325 years since
five women were hanged in the

05:16.133 --> 05:18.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
infamous witch trials.

05:18.266 --> 05:23.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were among 19 people
condemned and hanged for
witchcraft in Salem in 1692.

05:25.266 --> 05:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A descendant of one of them
said it brings justice to the
fact that they were wrongly

05:30.666 --> 05:32.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
accused.

05:32.700 --> 05:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
two Republican senators on
their party's efforts to repeal

05:38.733 --> 05:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obamacare; the president's
response to revelations
of his second conversation
with Vladimir Putin;

05:43.766 --> 05:48.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two state views on the
controversial voter fraud
commission; and much more.

06:00.466 --> 06:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now we return to the battle
over health care and President
Trump's meeting with Senate

06:05.033 --> 06:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Republicans at the White House.

06:07.200 --> 06:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We hear from two people
who were in the room, first
Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas.

06:11.500 --> 06:15.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He is a member of the
Health, Education, Labor
and Pensions Committee.

06:15.933 --> 06:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke with him a short time
ago and started by asking what
the president changed today

06:20.666 --> 06:22.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in his pitch to senators.

06:22.166 --> 06:24.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:24.200 --> 06:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAT ROBERTS (R), Kansas: We
had a meeting that I thought
was highly productive.

06:26.200 --> 06:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I thought the president made
a very good case that if you
simply have a repeal and, in two

06:32.333 --> 06:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years, you're going to see
further deterioration, if that's
the right word, for Obamacare.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In Kansas, our premiums
continue to soar.

06:43.100 --> 06:45.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're up now $3,000.

06:45.166 --> 06:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a little like being in
the back seat of a convertible
with Thelma and Louise and

06:51.000 --> 06:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we're headed toward the canyon.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're about at the edge.

06:53.133 --> 06:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, we have got to do something.

06:54.366 --> 06:56.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Number one, we have
to get out of the car.

06:56.866 --> 06:59.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Number two, we have got
to get into a new car.

06:59.300 --> 07:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what the
president was talking about.

07:01.866 --> 07:03.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We had the entire
Republican Conference.

07:03.866 --> 07:05.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think he did a good message.

07:05.100 --> 07:09.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There was a good -- I
think he did a good job.

07:09.300 --> 07:12.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But what
has changed with your
Republican colleagues?

07:12.533 --> 07:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because, yesterday,
there weren't going to be
enough votes to do this.

07:15.900 --> 07:17.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Today, there are?

07:17.433 --> 07:19.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that simply because of an
argument the president made?

07:19.200 --> 07:21.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

07:21.233 --> 07:23.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAT ROBERTS: Well, the first
thing is, Judy, is that we have
got to get over this business

07:23.900 --> 07:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of denying the leadership of
our party, Mitch McConnell,
at least a motion to proceed.

07:30.266 --> 07:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think the American people
want us to debate it.

07:32.300 --> 07:37.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think the American
people want us to vote
on several different
items that people would

07:37.700 --> 07:38.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be presenting.

07:38.633 --> 07:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a vote-a-rama anyway.

07:40.333 --> 07:43.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You're probably going
to have 150 votes,.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But we need a debate
and we need to vote.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, this business of
stopping the motion to
proceed, that has to quit.

07:48.900 --> 07:52.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that was one of the
main messages that the
president indicated,
to give Mitch McConnell

07:52.966 --> 07:57.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the -- obviously, the number
of votes he needed to go ahead
with this kind of an exercise.

07:59.066 --> 08:01.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think the president
really listened.

08:01.400 --> 08:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had at least 35 people,
maybe 40, make suggestions
with regards to the bill.

08:07.266 --> 08:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There was a lot of consensus.

08:08.066 --> 08:08.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

08:10.533 --> 08:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAT ROBERTS: And the other thing
-- and I think he mentioned
this is much larger than

08:12.766 --> 08:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
health care -- is whether or not
Republicans can actually govern.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you're
saying -- let me just clarify.

08:19.666 --> 08:24.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you're saying whether
Republicans can get together
as a group is more important

08:25.533 --> 08:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than health care legislation?

08:26.800 --> 08:28.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

08:28.033 --> 08:30.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAT ROBERTS: No, it's
not more important.

08:30.033 --> 08:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's another consideration,
that, if we can't do this, maybe
you can't do tax reform or,

08:35.266 --> 08:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for that matter, anything
else on the table.

08:36.533 --> 08:37.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Both are very important.

08:37.800 --> 08:40.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Obviously, you have to
get health care right.

08:40.033 --> 08:42.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That was the whole
intent of the meeting.

08:42.500 --> 08:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He listened very carefully.

08:43.933 --> 08:46.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He stated his position
very forcefully.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think it was
a good meeting.

08:48.633 --> 08:52.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me
ask you about the fact that the
criticisms of this legislation

08:52.566 --> 08:54.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are the same today as
they were yesterday.

08:54.833 --> 08:57.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I'm just looking
at the state of Kansas.

08:57.266 --> 09:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Your hospital association had
-- had looked at the changes
you had proposed directing

09:03.133 --> 09:05.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more money to the hospitals.

09:05.166 --> 09:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they said, that's great,
but they said, even with that,
it doesn't make up for the

09:08.366 --> 09:11.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deep cuts to Medicaid and
other problems with the bill.

09:11.833 --> 09:14.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What would you say today to
your hospital association?

09:14.066 --> 09:16.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAT ROBERTS: Well, as a matter
of fact, I'm meeting with them
just as I get through talking

09:17.566 --> 09:19.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with you.

09:19.233 --> 09:23.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I will point out to
them that Obamacare will
continue to deteriorate.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have already lost
one insurance company;
42,000 Kansans don't
have insurance anymore.

09:29.900 --> 09:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if we lose our remaining
insurer, we're really
going to be in trouble.

09:36.300 --> 09:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it isn't so much what we
would like to have as what
is happening to Obamacare.

09:39.933 --> 09:44.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, working with the
Kansas Hospital Association,
I think there are going
to be some new ideas

09:46.566 --> 09:49.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
presented in whatever
bill that comes up with
- - or we come up with.

09:49.333 --> 09:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the president was
doing a lot of listening.

09:52.200 --> 09:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House was doing a lot
of listening, Tom Price, Seema
Verma, all the people within

09:58.800 --> 10:00.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the administration, that
they're going to come
up with something new.

10:00.833 --> 10:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, I also
was reading that 70 percent
of all Medicaid enrollees

10:04.000 --> 10:05.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the state of
Kansas are children.

10:05.600 --> 10:06.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAT ROBERTS: Right.

10:08.100 --> 10:09.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Three hundred
thousand Kansas children.

10:09.666 --> 10:10.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's going to happen to them?

10:10.666 --> 10:12.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

10:12.100 --> 10:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAT ROBERTS: Well, they're
going to be covered.

10:13.333 --> 10:15.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We are increasing
Medicaid every year.

10:15.966 --> 10:20.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There may be some more
wrap-around amendments or
different opportunities
for Medicaid for

10:20.000 --> 10:21.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

10:21.166 --> 10:23.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we were a
non-Medicaid state.

10:23.200 --> 10:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think one of the reasons the
Kansas Hospital Association
was so upset with this is that,

10:29.066 --> 10:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
twice, they really supported
efforts on Medicaid funding, and
not to make it a non-Medicaid

10:36.933 --> 10:38.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
expansion state.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But that ship has sailed.

10:41.033 --> 10:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Kansas state legislature
didn't approve that, and
the governor vetoed it.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they were not able
to override the veto.

10:47.933 --> 10:49.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have to work
with what we have.

10:49.933 --> 10:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're going to be in my
office in about 30 minutes, and
we are going to go over that

10:53.233 --> 10:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and what the president said.

10:55.333 --> 10:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we look
forward to hearing about
the outcome of that meeting.

10:57.866 --> 11:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senator Pat Roberts of
Kansas, thank you very much.

11:00.266 --> 11:01.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

11:01.233 --> 11:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAT ROBERTS: My privilege.

11:02.233 --> 11:04.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

11:04.233 --> 11:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Senator
Roger Wicker of Mississippi was
also at the White House today.

11:07.233 --> 11:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I started by asking him if the
president's engagement adds
more pressure on Republicans.

11:12.700 --> 11:14.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROGER WICKER (R), Mississippi:
Well, I guess there is some
pressure on some of the people

11:17.933 --> 11:21.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who are sort of still
doubtful about this.

11:21.566 --> 11:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't feel the pressure,
because I have been a yes
vote for quite some time.

11:28.500 --> 11:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But let me tell you,
there are two schools of
thought on moving forward.

11:31.500 --> 11:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The majority leader, Senator
McConnell, would like to get to
a vote on the motion to proceed

11:37.633 --> 11:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and see where people are.

11:39.266 --> 11:41.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, if we win, great,
we proceed to the bill.

11:41.700 --> 11:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If not, at least people have
voted, and we know what the
target is, if we lose by two

11:47.333 --> 11:49.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or three votes.

11:49.400 --> 11:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president, on the other
hand, really thinks that, over
the next few days, we can get 50

11:54.766 --> 11:56.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
votes to yes.

11:56.966 --> 12:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he was all about today
getting into the details of
what's keeping various members

12:04.666 --> 12:09.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from being able to say 100
percent that they can support
this legislation and deciding

12:12.100 --> 12:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what levers to pull to
get the bill to a place
where 50 of us can say yes.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, the reason
I'm asking about pressure is
because, a couple of weeks

12:21.600 --> 12:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ago, when Senator Dean Heller of
Nevada indicated he was having
problems with the legislation,

12:28.566 --> 12:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there was a political action
group supporting the president
that ran ads against him.

12:33.533 --> 12:34.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that the kind of...

12:34.200 --> 12:35.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

12:35.100 --> 12:37.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

12:37.233 --> 12:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROGER WICKER: And I think that
was generally considered to be
bad form and counterproductive

12:40.666 --> 12:43.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
among people in the
Republican Conference.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let
me ask you a little bit
about the substance of this.

12:46.733 --> 12:51.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you know, a lot of discussion
about what this bill would
mean for coverage, including

12:52.366 --> 12:54.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Medicaid.

12:54.400 --> 12:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The vice president of your home
state -- a Mississippi state
hospital association quoted

12:58.433 --> 13:03.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
this week as saying they
are opposed to anything
that increases the
number of uninsured in

13:04.133 --> 13:05.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mississippi.

13:05.133 --> 13:07.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:07.233 --> 13:11.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROGER WICKER: Well, for
one thing, I don't think
it would increase the
number of uninsured.

13:13.033 --> 13:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These changes are based on
projections of people that will
be covered, if the estimates

13:20.133 --> 13:21.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are correct.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I would just challenge that.

13:23.233 --> 13:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But let me also say -- and I
don't mean to be critical, or
I don't mean this to be taken

13:30.266 --> 13:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wrong -- but there's never
been a provider who came to us
and said, we need you to slow

13:38.633 --> 13:41.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the growth rate of these
entitlement programs.

13:41.400 --> 13:44.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I mean, that's just
not something that
they're going to say.

13:44.500 --> 13:49.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the fact is we can
make health care better
for Mississippians, and
we can make coverage

13:51.866 --> 13:56.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
better for the average American,
while, at the same time,
saving a system that is not

13:58.166 --> 14:01.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sustainable for
future generations.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we can do that.

14:03.266 --> 14:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, at the end of the day,
I think people in the health
care business, in the hospital

14:09.400 --> 14:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
business in future years
will say, you have saved
the system and good for you.

14:15.600 --> 14:19.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, when
I read that there are
almost half-a-million
children in Mississippi

14:19.666 --> 14:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who depend on Medicaid, are
you saying they don't have
anything to worry about?

14:23.733 --> 14:25.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:25.766 --> 14:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROGER WICKER: I think -- well,
for one thing, we are not
a Medicaid expansion state.

14:29.433 --> 14:30.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

14:30.433 --> 14:31.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:31.933 --> 14:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROGER WICKER: Our state
didn't choose to do that.

14:34.033 --> 14:37.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so it's completely
inaccurate to say that
these 500,000 children
are going to lose their

14:37.333 --> 14:38.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coverage.

14:38.333 --> 14:40.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They're not.

14:40.400 --> 14:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As a matter of fact, there will
be a tradition - - I mean, there
will be a transition -- I'm

14:44.133 --> 14:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sorry -- and states that
expanded Medicaid will have a
seven-year period and there will

14:53.866 --> 14:58.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be an extra incentive for those
states who chose not to do that.

14:58.500 --> 15:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But those 500,000 children that
you talk about are not going to
have their coverage threatened.

15:05.266 --> 15:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senator Roger Wicker joining us
from the Capitol, we thank you.

15:09.933 --> 15:10.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:10.933 --> 15:12.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROGER WICKER: Thank you.

15:12.966 --> 15:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a quick
postscript: We don't know yet
what the latest revisions to

15:15.500 --> 15:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Senate bill to repeal and
replace the Affordable Care
Act will include, but, for

15:19.966 --> 15:24.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the record, the Congressional
Budget Office already estimated
what would happen with the

15:24.633 --> 15:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
first version of the bill.

15:26.633 --> 15:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It concluded there would be 15
million fewer Medicaid enrollees
in a decade than projected

15:32.600 --> 15:34.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
under current law.

15:34.633 --> 15:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It also said that, over the
long haul, states would likely
have to either spend more money,

15:40.566 --> 15:43.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
cut payments, eliminate
services or limit who's
eligible for Medicaid.

15:43.833 --> 15:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is not clear how many
children would be affected.

15:58.500 --> 16:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On July the 7th, President
Trump sat down for
a highly anticipated
meeting with Russia's

16:03.333 --> 16:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Vladimir Putin at the
G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany.

16:07.633 --> 16:12.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, last night, it was
disclosed that there
was a second lengthy
conversation later that

16:14.666 --> 16:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
day between the two leaders,
one that the White House had
not spoken of at the time.

16:18.333 --> 16:20.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Nick Schifrin reports.

16:20.300 --> 16:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: It was a
three-hour dinner party for the
world's most powerful people,

16:24.900 --> 16:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
20 leaders, and their spouses.

16:26.933 --> 16:31.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
On the menu, turbot fish
fillet, Friesian beef
cheeks, and chitchat.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Trump worked the
room, and then took his seat.

16:33.933 --> 16:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Diagonally across
the table, first lady
Melania Trump and Russian
President Vladimir Putin.

16:38.800 --> 16:41.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The two talked to each
other with the help
of Putin's translator.

16:41.833 --> 16:46.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as a dessert of raspberries
and cheese was served, Mr.
Trump walked over to Putin.

16:46.566 --> 16:49.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
White House spokeswoman Sarah
Sanders today called their
talk brief and informal.

16:49.966 --> 16:51.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, Deputy
White House Press Secretary:
To try to create that there

16:51.966 --> 16:56.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was some sort of private
conversation in a room
with 40-plus people
seems a little bit

16:57.300 --> 16:59.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ridiculous.

16:59.366 --> 17:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Nick Burns is
a former U.S. ambassador to
NATO and veteran diplomat who

17:01.533 --> 17:03.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
participated in dozens
of U.S.-Russia meetings.

17:03.600 --> 17:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICHOLAS BURNS, Former U.S.
Undersecretary of State for
Political Affairs: This is not

17:04.900 --> 17:06.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a bad thing.

17:06.833 --> 17:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Vladimir Putin and Donald
Trump are the two most
powerful people in the world.

17:10.100 --> 17:12.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They barely know each other.

17:12.066 --> 17:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They'd only met once before
this G20 dinner, and it's really
important that they get to

17:15.666 --> 17:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know each other and develop
some capacity to have an
effective relationship.

17:19.733 --> 17:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Last night, Trump
blasted the media coverage,
tweeting: "Fake news story

17:23.800 --> 17:26.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of secret dinner
with Putin is sick."

17:26.266 --> 17:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The pro-Kremlin Russian
lawmaker Alexei Pushkov
used the exact same
language, describing reports

17:32.266 --> 17:34.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about a -- quote --
"secret dinner" as sick.

17:34.266 --> 17:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, today, German Chancellor
Angela Merkel's spokesman called
these dinner conversations

17:38.133 --> 17:40.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
normal.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEFFEN SEIBERT, German
Government Spokesman
(through translator):
It is the fundamental

17:42.333 --> 17:46.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
point of the G20 meeting
that, alongside working
meetings, there is room
and opportunity for

17:46.700 --> 17:48.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
multiple informal contacts.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is certainly the
point of such a dinner.

17:51.366 --> 17:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But what
is unusual is that,
since there were no other
U.S. officials present,

17:55.000 --> 17:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the translator was Putin's,
the U.S. officials who work on
Russia have no official notes.

17:59.566 --> 18:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICHOLAS BURNS: The people down
the line cannot do their job if
they don't have an exact sense

18:04.233 --> 18:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of what our president said,
what the other guy said, and
how they can then pursue these

18:08.766 --> 18:10.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
issues with the
Russian government.

18:10.833 --> 18:14.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The dinner talk
came on the same day as Trump
and Putin's only official

18:14.066 --> 18:15.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
meeting.

18:15.266 --> 18:18.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That talk lasted
more than two hours.

18:18.933 --> 18:23.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The next day, having spoken
with Trump at least twice,
Putin praised Trump personally.

18:23.666 --> 18:27.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through translator):
As for personal relations, I

18:27.966 --> 18:29.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think that they have
been established.

18:29.966 --> 18:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know how this will
sound, but I will say it how I
see it: The Trump on television

18:33.633 --> 18:35.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is very different
from the real person.

18:35.733 --> 18:37.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's very direct.

18:37.066 --> 18:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He perceives his conversation
partner very well.

18:39.800 --> 18:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's a fairly quick thinker.

18:42.433 --> 18:46.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: It is that
kind of praise that many
here in Washington find
strange and concerning.

18:48.033 --> 18:49.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Multiple administration
officials tell the "NewsHour"
they have still not received a

18:49.966 --> 18:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
report from the official
Trump-Putin meeting, let
alone the dinner conversation.

18:54.533 --> 18:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That is not business as usual.

18:56.600 --> 19:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICHOLAS BURNS: President Trump
has put together, I think, the
weakest policy on Russia in 70

19:02.666 --> 19:04.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

19:04.700 --> 19:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's why you have seen
so many people concerned
by this one conversation.

19:07.266 --> 19:09.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What did President Trump
say to President Putin?

19:09.900 --> 19:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People in our government need
to know the answers to those
questions, and we as citizens

19:13.566 --> 19:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
need those answers as well.

19:16.033 --> 19:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: A dinnertime
conversation might not
be out of the ordinary,
except the president's

19:19.100 --> 19:23.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
2016 campaign is under
investigation for possibly
colluding with Russia.

19:23.900 --> 19:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the man he was talking to
is accused by U.S. intelligence
of ordering the covert effort

19:28.533 --> 19:30.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to help Trump get elected.

19:30.066 --> 19:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Nick Schifrin in Washington.

19:32.766 --> 19:37.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Late today, the
Senate Judiciary Committee said
that Donald Trump Jr. and former

19:39.733 --> 19:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump campaign manager Paul
Manafort will testify next
Wednesday about their meeting

19:44.533 --> 19:46.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with a Russian
lawyer last summer.

19:46.633 --> 19:51.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president's son-in-law,
Jared Kushner, goes before the
Senate Intelligence Committee

19:51.100 --> 19:55.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on Monday.

19:55.733 --> 20:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

20:04.966 --> 20:09.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the
"NewsHour": what proposed
cuts to food stamps could
mean for Trump voters;

20:11.833 --> 20:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how Tesla's new cheaper
electric car could shape the
industry's future; and "Devil's

20:17.533 --> 20:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bargain," a new book about White
House strategist Steve Bannon.

20:22.500 --> 20:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: President
Trump continues to repeat
the unsubstantiated
claim that millions of

20:28.666 --> 20:31.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
illegal votes were cast
in the 2016 election.

20:31.733 --> 20:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The commission he set
up to look into this has
sparked its own controversy.

20:36.233 --> 20:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham reports.

20:38.333 --> 20:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of
the United States: Every time
voter fraud occurs, it cancels

20:40.500 --> 20:44.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out the vote of a lawful citizen
and undermines democracy.

20:44.566 --> 20:48.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The first
meeting of the Commission on
Election Integrity convened

20:48.866 --> 20:50.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with a presidential
defense of its mission.

20:50.933 --> 20:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Throughout the
campaign, and even after,
people would come up to me and

20:58.200 --> 21:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
express their concerns
about voter inconsistencies
and irregularities
which they saw, in some

21:04.566 --> 21:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cases having to do with
very large numbers of
people in certain states.

21:08.466 --> 21:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So far, those
allegations remain unproven,
but the commission is pressing

21:13.166 --> 21:15.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ahead.

21:15.300 --> 21:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last month, it sent letters to
every state, asking for voter
information, including names,

21:20.500 --> 21:23.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
birthdays and partial
Social Security numbers.

21:23.066 --> 21:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Seventeen states, governed
by Republicans and Democrats,
as well as the District of

21:27.400 --> 21:29.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Columbia, refused to comply.

21:29.966 --> 21:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many others said they
will provide only limited
information that's already
publicly available.

21:34.400 --> 21:38.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the president
criticized those states
who've refused to go along.

21:38.366 --> 21:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: One has to wonder
what they're worried about.

21:42.800 --> 21:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I ask the vice president
and I ask the commission,
what are they worried about?

21:47.733 --> 21:49.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's something.

21:49.200 --> 21:51.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
There always is.

21:51.333 --> 21:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Just after
the election, when Hillary
Clinton won the popular vote

21:54.800 --> 21:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by 2.8 million votes, Mr. Trump
tweeted, again, with no evidence
whatsoever, that the vote

22:01.900 --> 22:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
count was skewed -- quote --
"I won the popular vote if you
deduct the millions of people

22:06.366 --> 22:08.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who voted illegally."

22:08.366 --> 22:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The commission co-chair,
Kansas Secretary of State Kris
Kobach, who is a Republican,

22:12.100 --> 22:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says the country deserves
a hard, dispassionate
look at the issue.

22:15.533 --> 22:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KRIS KOBACH (R), Kansas
Secretary of State: For a long
time, there has been lingering

22:17.500 --> 22:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doubt among many Americans
about integrity and
fairness of elections.

22:21.333 --> 22:23.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's not a new issue at all.

22:23.866 --> 22:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you look at polling
data, it goes back decades.

22:26.533 --> 22:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The panel is
chaired by Vice President Pence,
and in addition to Kobach,

22:30.900 --> 22:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
members include current and
former secretaries of state from
Indiana, New Hampshire, Maine

22:36.633 --> 22:38.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Ohio, among others.

22:38.633 --> 22:43.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But critics of the commission
warn that stoking fears of
alleged fraud will be used later

22:44.600 --> 22:46.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to justify a crackdown
on voting rights.

22:46.633 --> 22:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rick Hasen is a law professor
at the University of California,
Irvine, and an election law

22:50.900 --> 22:53.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
expert.

22:53.033 --> 22:55.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RICK HASEN, University
of California, Irvine:
I'm concerned that it's
going to be something

22:55.666 --> 22:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is just going to try
to support the president's
agenda, claiming that
there's a lot of voter

22:57.833 --> 23:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fraud, and use that to make
it harder for people to be
able to register to vote.

23:01.633 --> 23:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Already, the
commission is facing at least
seven lawsuits questioning

23:05.966 --> 23:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
its transparency, conduct
and even its existence.

23:10.733 --> 23:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We turn now to two
officials who actually run
elections in their states.

23:14.800 --> 23:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Matthew Dunlap is the
secretary of state for Maine.

23:17.033 --> 23:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is a Democrat, and
he's also a member of the
president's commission.

23:20.433 --> 23:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he was at today's meeting.

23:22.200 --> 23:23.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're also joined
by Michele Reagan.

23:23.933 --> 23:27.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She is a Republican and she is
Arizona's secretary of state.

23:27.366 --> 23:29.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

23:29.366 --> 23:31.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW DUNLAP (D),
Maine Secretary of State:
Thank you for having us.

MICHELE REAGAN (R),
Arizona Secretary of State:
Thank you for having us.

23:32.900 --> 23:34.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Matthew, I would love
to start with you first.

23:34.966 --> 23:36.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is your general hope that
this commission - - what do
you hope it will accomplish?

23:36.933 --> 23:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW DUNLAP: Well, my general
hope is that actually we do
something to bolster voter

23:40.233 --> 23:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
confidence in how we conduct
elections in this country.

23:42.500 --> 23:44.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think we have an awful
lot to be proud of.

23:44.633 --> 23:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No one is questioning the
legitimacy of the outcome
of the 2016 election.

23:48.100 --> 23:52.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are some lingering
questions about how
elections have been
conducted, who was able

23:52.666 --> 23:54.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to vote legally or not.

23:54.633 --> 23:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, and based on my
experience in the state of
Maine, I think we can very, very

23:58.833 --> 24:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
proud of what our local election
officials have done to make
sure that their neighbors

24:02.800 --> 24:06.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get to exercise their democratic
right of self-governance.

24:06.200 --> 24:10.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Michele
Reagan, I know you are
a supporter broadly
of this commission

24:10.966 --> 24:13.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and its aims.

24:13.033 --> 24:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you know, the commission
was set up in part because of
the president's concern that

24:16.033 --> 24:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there had been some voter
fraud in the past election.

24:20.233 --> 24:21.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm curious.

24:21.666 --> 24:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You were running the election
in Arizona back in 2016.

24:24.733 --> 24:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Did you have any instances
of fraud in your state?

24:27.733 --> 24:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHELE REAGAN: Well, I can't
speak, obviously, for other
states, but I know, in Arizona,

24:31.733 --> 24:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we have a number of measures
that we use to prevent fraud.

24:35.733 --> 24:38.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's not to say
fraud never happens.

24:38.100 --> 24:42.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Certainly, when we hear
allegations of that, we
take it very seriously.

24:42.800 --> 24:47.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But it's important to
note Arizona has some
laws on the books that
keep it very safe from

24:48.533 --> 24:50.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fraud, massive fraud.

24:50.566 --> 24:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One is the showing proof of
I.D. at the polling places.

24:54.766 --> 24:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Another is proof of citizenship
when registering to vote.

24:58.333 --> 25:00.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A lot of states don't
have these laws.

25:00.500 --> 25:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, speaking from Arizona's
point of view, coupled with the
fact that we also participate,

25:07.366 --> 25:11.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
already, in interstate
cross-check systems,
for instances, of
double voting or double

25:13.300 --> 25:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
registration, we're pretty
confident in Arizona that we
run a really good election.

25:16.933 --> 25:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Matthew
Dunlap, as I mentioned
in the report prior to
this, the commission

25:23.366 --> 25:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
asked all the states for some
types of voter information.

25:25.733 --> 25:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And there was a lot of concern.

25:27.266 --> 25:28.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Many states pushed back.

25:28.733 --> 25:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I understand Maine didn't
share its information.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Explain to me, what
is the concern?

25:33.000 --> 25:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are you worried about?

25:34.500 --> 25:35.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATTHEW DUNLAP: Well, we're not
really worried about anything.

25:35.766 --> 25:37.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We just follow the law.

25:37.766 --> 25:41.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The request that came from the
commission, which, as commission
members, we did not review

25:41.000 --> 25:43.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the full text of the
letter that went out.

25:43.533 --> 25:48.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We did agree that the
information that should
be requested should be
requested, not demanded,

25:50.933 --> 25:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it should only be that
information that would
be publicly available
to anyone legally

25:52.466 --> 25:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
entitled to obtain it under
those particular state laws.

25:55.133 --> 26:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When we got the request, the
letter said that be advised that
any information that you provide

26:01.500 --> 26:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will be made publicly available
for anyone to inspect.

26:04.533 --> 26:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maine election law specifies
that anyone who is qualified
to access the voter file must

26:09.400 --> 26:11.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
keep it confidential.

26:11.166 --> 26:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that is directory language.

26:13.466 --> 26:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Making the list available is
discretionary under the law.

26:16.600 --> 26:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, with that direction, it was
a mathematical equation for us.

26:20.100 --> 26:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We simply could not provide
it under those circumstances.

26:22.233 --> 26:24.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And so we didn't.

26:24.733 --> 26:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Michele
Reagan, do you have
concerns about this
database being compiled

26:26.733 --> 26:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
here in Washington, D.C.?

26:28.166 --> 26:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHELE REAGAN: Well,
absolutely we have concerns.

26:30.233 --> 26:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, again, in Arizona, we
just looked to the statutes
and the law to tell us exactly

26:34.733 --> 26:37.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what we were going to
have to do or not do.

26:37.866 --> 26:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the law is pretty clear
that, again, just like in Maine,
you can't take the information

26:45.366 --> 26:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
via a public records
request with the intent of
sharing it or posting it
publicly or disseminate,

26:50.600 --> 26:53.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you know, giving it out.

26:53.100 --> 26:56.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Matthew
Dunlap, what about this larger
concern that has been raised by

26:56.766 --> 27:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some people that this commission
and its mission is going to be
used to justify further national

27:04.133 --> 27:05.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
crackdown on voting rights?

27:05.566 --> 27:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you make of that?

27:07.633 --> 27:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW DUNLAP: That's one of
my favorite questions to get
out of all of this, is that

27:09.433 --> 27:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
somehow we're trying to
undo the electoral process.

27:14.133 --> 27:17.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My position is, is that you have
these lingering questions that
have been around for a while

27:17.866 --> 27:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now about illegal
activity around elections.

27:20.766 --> 27:23.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Sunshine is the
greatest disinfectant.

27:23.266 --> 27:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have full confidence
that everything that's
been claimed will probably
be largely debunked.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And what we will find
will probably be the
product of mistakes and
errors and unintended

27:34.433 --> 27:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
actions that were never
meant to become felonies.

27:36.733 --> 27:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think, you know, with that
understanding, I think we're
going to find that we have a

27:40.933 --> 27:45.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really pretty good system
that's very, very decentralized,
which actually adds to its

27:45.033 --> 27:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
level of security against some
of the allegations that we have
heard about, like the Russian

27:48.733 --> 27:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Federation getting involved
in hacking our elections.

27:51.800 --> 27:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the systems that we
have in place, which are run
by local election officials,

27:55.766 --> 27:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually will be found to
work very, very well, and that
American voters should feel

27:59.600 --> 28:03.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pretty good about the systems
that help us elect our
leadership and decide issues.

28:03.866 --> 28:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Michele Reagan, you heard
Matthew here say that he
believes the commission

28:08.733 --> 28:10.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will largely debunk
many of these claims.

28:10.833 --> 28:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But just today, the co-chairman
of the commission, Kris Kobach,
said on MSNBC that he says, we

28:17.800 --> 28:22.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may never know whether
or not Hillary Clinton in
fact won the popular vote.

28:22.266 --> 28:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is an implication that is
very likely the potential that
three million illegal votes

28:27.866 --> 28:29.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were cast.

28:29.933 --> 28:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is the head of the commission
is making that kind of a
statement, does that concern you

28:34.033 --> 28:37.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at all about the thrust
of this commission?

28:37.033 --> 28:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHELE REAGAN: What really
concerns me is the good work
that the commission could be

28:42.500 --> 28:45.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
doing.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I hope -- and I have
high hopes that they
will look forward to
some of these suggestions

28:48.833 --> 28:51.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that states are making.

28:51.333 --> 28:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would hope that this
commission takes what
states are doing and
determines what is working

28:57.066 --> 28:59.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
best, so they can share
it with other states.

28:59.033 --> 29:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Michele Reagan, Matthew Dunlap,
thank you both very much.

29:01.700 --> 29:06.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MATTHEW DUNLAP: Thank
you for having us.

29:06.500 --> 29:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressional
Republicans yesterday unveiled
a budget that would dramatically

29:18.166 --> 29:23.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
curb spending on a
host of social welfare
programs, including the
federal government's

29:25.133 --> 29:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program, or SNAP,
better known as food stamps.

29:30.433 --> 29:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president's budget released
earlier this year also included
deep cuts to the program.

29:33.666 --> 29:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To see how those proposals
might play out, "NewsHour"
special correspondent Cat Wise

29:40.500 --> 29:43.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
recently traveled to
Arkansas, a state that voted
heavily for Mr. Trump.

29:43.966 --> 29:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This report is part of Chasing
the Dream, our ongoing series
on poverty and opportunity

29:49.566 --> 29:52.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in America.

29:52.033 --> 29:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: In the small
town of Thornton, Arkansas,
Joannie Cayce fires up
her truck twice a month,

29:59.700 --> 30:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and drives to a Wal-Mart about
30 miles away to stock up on
fruits, vegetables, meat, milk

30:06.033 --> 30:09.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and other products
donated by the company.

30:09.200 --> 30:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When she returns to the local
food pantry her family has
run since the 1950s, some 200

30:17.300 --> 30:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
residents are waiting, and
a desperate rush begins.

30:20.500 --> 30:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: We get paid every two
weeks, and, by the end of the
week, it's like the cupboards

30:26.866 --> 30:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are bare, and we're
ramen noodling, you know?

30:28.900 --> 30:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: I got two kids at
the house and stuff that's
hungry that I have to feed.

30:32.533 --> 30:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Ms. Cayce, as she's
known here, says the number
of people she serves each

30:37.033 --> 30:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
month has nearly doubled in
the past year-and-a-half,
from 350 to 650, even
as the state's economy

30:44.733 --> 30:46.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has improved.

30:46.766 --> 30:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOANNIE CAYCE, Cayce Charities:
We see no employment, no
grocery stores, no craft stores.

30:52.300 --> 30:55.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Mostly, the families
are generationally poor,
and they can't move.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't have the money to
move or anywhere to go to move.

30:57.600 --> 31:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The day we
visited, Brittney Williams
came to Ms. Cayce's with
her two young daughters.

31:04.666 --> 31:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At mid-month, she's already
run out of the $231 a month
she receives in food stamps,

31:11.200 --> 31:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or SNAP, the federal
government's Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance
Program for the poor.

31:17.233 --> 31:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRITTNEY WILLIAMS, Receives
SNAP Assistance: I'm out of
food stamps within two weeks.

31:20.600 --> 31:25.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's another two weeks
week-and-a-half, two weeks,
that I'm sitting here, well, how

31:26.700 --> 31:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
am I going to feed my kids?

31:28.233 --> 31:30.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You know, what am
I going to do next?

31:30.633 --> 31:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

make less than $32,000

32:12.333 --> 32:14.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

32:14.366 --> 32:18.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last year, 14 percent of the
state's population was on
SNAP, or about 426,000 people.

32:20.133 --> 32:22.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That percentage mirrors
the national picture.

32:22.966 --> 32:27.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2016, 44 million
Americans were on SNAP,
receiving an average
benefit of $126 per person

32:30.800 --> 32:33.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

about $1.40 a meal.

32:33.433 --> 32:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For years, the program has
been in the crosshairs of
conservative lawmakers,
who say the government

32:39.700 --> 32:43.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
simply can't sustain a federal

Instead of lifting people
out of poverty, many of our

32:51.766 --> 32:54.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

33:05.400 --> 33:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's either do it the easy way
now, which may not seem easy
to some, or have the whole

33:12.466 --> 33:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

not be able to provide SNAP,

MICK MULVANEY, White House
Budget Director: We're no longer
going to measure compassion

33:27.466 --> 33:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the number of programs or
the number of people on those
programs, but by the number

33:31.233 --> 33:33.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of people we help get
off of those programs.

33:33.766 --> 33:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: In May, the
White House presented its
budget, which aimed to
slash federal spending

33:37.533 --> 33:41.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by $3.6 trillion
over the next decade.

33:41.400 --> 33:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If Congress were to pass that
budget, SNAP would lose $193
billion, around a quarter

33:47.600 --> 33:49.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of its funding.

33:49.666 --> 33:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The plan calls for tightening
standards on who qualifies
for the program, and, for the

33:56.200 --> 33:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first time, the budget shifts
a large chunk of the cost to
states, starting with 10 percent

34:00.466 --> 34:05.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in 2020 and rising to
25 percent in 2023.

34:05.300 --> 34:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For Arkansas, that would
mean $144 million added to
its state budget each year.

34:12.566 --> 34:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHY WEBB (D), Former

I don't see where we
would make up that $144

34:13.866 --> 34:15.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
million.

34:15.366 --> 34:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAT WISE: You don't think
the state can make that up?

34:17.800 --> 34:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

could not fill the gap.

34:33.233 --> 34:37.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KATHY WEBB: We cannot
make up the difference.

34:37.166 --> 34:42.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all of the charitable food
network put together is about
a 20th of what the federal

34:43.100 --> 34:45.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
safety net is.

34:45.100 --> 34:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

about the effect a SNAP cut
would have on grocery stores in

poor communities.

It takes everything to make it.

34:52.300 --> 34:54.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There is no slack.

Thornton.

35:01.033 --> 35:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's one of the few stores in

35:03.533 --> 35:05.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

35:05.566 --> 35:09.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

every little bit helps.

35:09.966 --> 35:14.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RANDY LINDSEY: If I
lost 25 percent of SNAP,
for me, it would mean
cutting 10 to 15 hours

35:16.400 --> 35:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a week, or roughly 40
hours a month off payroll.

35:19.733 --> 35:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAT WISE: So your employees
would be impacted?

35:21.933 --> 35:22.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RANDY LINDSEY: Yes.

35:22.933 --> 35:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It would impact employees.

35:24.133 --> 35:25.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's a pretty
good chunk to lose.

35:25.866 --> 35:28.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's not much gravy
in this operation.

35:28.800 --> 35:32.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We make less money, then
something has to be cut.

35:32.066 --> 35:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Conservatives often
point out that SNAP expanded
considerably under Presidents

35:36.533 --> 35:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
George W. Bush and Barack
Obama, and they are correct.

35:40.300 --> 35:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The rise was particularly
acute during the recession of
2008, when millions lost work

35:45.200 --> 35:47.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and joined SNAP's rolls.

35:47.433 --> 35:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Benefits were also increased as
part of the Stimulus Act, the
2009 law that pumped billions

35:52.100 --> 35:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in federal spending into
communities across the country.

35:55.300 --> 36:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yet, since late 2012, both
spending and the number of
people on SNAP have fallen, and

36:02.366 --> 36:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the nonpartisan Congressional
Budget Office estimates that,
if no changes were made, the

36:06.300 --> 36:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
share of the population
on SNAP would return to
pre-recession levels by 2027.

36:13.166 --> 36:16.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still, SNAP remains historically
high, as more working families
like the Williams, and

36:18.900 --> 36:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seniors like 63-year-old

that they're a pricey, niche

38:59.833 --> 39:03.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
product that only a
handful of people would
want or could afford.

But that reputation is

car advocates have been saying
for decades that these cars

39:39.566 --> 39:41.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are the future.

39:41.100 --> 39:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why has it taken them this long
to get to where they are today?

39:43.533 --> 39:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SONARI GLINTON: I would say low
gas prices, the pickup truck,
and America's sort of dependency

39:52.433 --> 39:54.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the status quo.

39:54.533 --> 39:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you look at an electric
car, if you drive one -- I used
to have a plug-in hybrid -- and

40:01.366 --> 40:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I got to a point where I
never went to the gas station,
and I never thought...

40:04.433 --> 40:05.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's
got to be a great feeling.

40:05.866 --> 40:07.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SONARI GLINTON: Yes, and
I never -- yes, exactly.

40:07.866 --> 40:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I -- when I switched --
I'm one of the few people to
switch, you know, from electric

40:12.233 --> 40:14.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to a gas-powered car.

40:14.666 --> 40:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I went to a gas-powered
car, it's a two-seater
convertible, so like
that's the reason I did

40:19.533 --> 40:21.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

40:21.500 --> 40:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I cannot imagine getting
-- I can't imagine not
having that convenience.

40:28.500 --> 40:32.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You always start the
day with a full tank.

40:32.066 --> 40:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a simpler drivetrain,
so it's easier to fix.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It has fewer problems.

40:37.766 --> 40:40.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's quiet like a luxury car.

40:40.166 --> 40:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The problem is, is that
the car companies, right,
are building trucks that...

40:44.700 --> 40:47.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
That the market wants.

40:47.366 --> 40:49.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SONARI GLINTON:
Desperately wants.

40:49.100 --> 40:53.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And people are buying
SUVs way more now than
they're buying cars.

40:53.066 --> 40:55.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The tipping point was
reached a few years ago.

40:55.466 --> 41:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now we're at about 60
-- depending on what month,
about 60/40 SUVs to cars.

41:02.466 --> 41:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's partially because
we're all realizing, like,
I want to sit up higher.

41:06.333 --> 41:07.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I want to...

41:07.333 --> 41:09.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

41:09.400 --> 41:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And if the
gas prices aren't killing you,
there's no reason to go into

41:10.533 --> 41:11.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an electric.

41:11.533 --> 41:13.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SONARI GLINTON: Yes.

41:13.600 --> 41:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, right now, to be
clear, there are a lot of
hurdles for electric cars.

41:16.733 --> 41:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And, mainly, it's the battery.

41:18.866 --> 41:22.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not necessarily figuring
out how to move the car.

41:22.166 --> 41:27.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's getting a lighter,
cheaper battery is what's
at the crux of this.

41:28.633 --> 41:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, the auto industry knows that
that's where it's going, right?

41:31.733 --> 41:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Wall Street and customers
say, well, we like those F-150s,
we like those Chevy Silverados

41:38.233 --> 41:41.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and those Dodge Rams, and
we're buying a lot of them.

41:41.000 --> 41:46.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're hugely, hugely
profitable, while electric car
profits are, A, they're about

41:47.200 --> 41:50.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
3.5 -- the volume
of electric cars...

41:50.400 --> 41:51.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: A tiny
sliver of the market.

41:51.900 --> 41:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SONARI GLINTON: Tiny,
like less than 4 percent.

41:54.033 --> 41:59.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it's been stagnant
for a few years because
of those gas prices.

41:59.933 --> 42:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, there's a lot of things.

42:02.033 --> 42:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, for the most part, in
many places in the country --
I live in California, where

42:05.300 --> 42:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there are many, many charging
stations and there's rebates
and things like that that

42:09.733 --> 42:11.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you can get.

42:11.800 --> 42:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if you're in the middle
of the country, the word
may not have gotten to you.

42:14.633 --> 42:17.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You know, there are
so many hurdles.

42:17.866 --> 42:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
incentives just aren't there.

42:19.333 --> 42:21.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SONARI GLINTON: The
incentives aren't there.

42:21.300 --> 42:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we haven't educated the
consumer about the difference.

42:25.733 --> 42:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you -- when people get into
electric cars, they love them.

42:29.566 --> 42:32.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When they use them in their
lives, they love them.

42:32.366 --> 42:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you look at the marketing
and you look at the car
companies, and your Super Bowl

42:36.100 --> 42:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
half-time commercial isn't
necessarily, you know,
the latest, lightest,
most fuel-sipping

42:43.600 --> 42:44.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
vehicle.

42:44.766 --> 42:46.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
No, it's the big trucks
and those things.

42:46.333 --> 42:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, right now, that's
important in the short term.

42:49.433 --> 42:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But every carmaker
understands that
electrification and autonomy
are definitely the future.

42:55.900 --> 42:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they're not the future
like 30 years from now.

42:58.133 --> 43:00.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're the future
really, really soon.

43:00.200 --> 43:02.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So
there are no Kodaks among
the car manufacturers.

43:02.866 --> 43:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They get that electric is
the future, but they're still
making a lot of money off big,

43:06.133 --> 43:07.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
heavy trucks.

43:07.300 --> 43:09.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And is there an
incompatibility there?

43:09.433 --> 43:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you make electric cars
and design and develop and
push them out at the same time

43:13.633 --> 43:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that you're making big,
heavy, gas-guzzling trucks?

43:16.366 --> 43:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SONARI GLINTON: Well, you can
make the argument that companies
like Ford or Chevy are already

43:20.300 --> 43:22.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
doing that.

43:22.400 --> 43:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chevy has the Volt, which
does what the Tesla Model
3 says it's going to do.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It goes over 200
miles per charge.

43:28.966 --> 43:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's under $40,000, which
is within range of the
average American consumer.

43:36.366 --> 43:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then they build --
some months, the Silverado
is really, really a
gangbuster for that company.

43:41.933 --> 43:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when we talk to executives,
you hear the pressure to keep
those trucks going, to pump

43:49.066 --> 43:51.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out those F-150 profits.

43:51.500 --> 43:56.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, studies show that,
for Ford, the F-150 is as much
as 90 percent sometimes of

43:59.500 --> 44:00.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
profitability.

44:00.533 --> 44:01.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Wow.

44:01.733 --> 44:03.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SONARI GLINTON: So, you
look at the F-150...

44:03.233 --> 44:04.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's a
hard thing to argue against.

44:04.466 --> 44:06.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SONARI GLINTON: Hard
to argue against.

44:06.966 --> 44:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As I
mentioned, Tesla is about
to roll out this Model
3, which, obviously,

44:09.000 --> 44:13.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the big question for them is
that they have been selling a
very small number of very pricey

44:13.566 --> 44:15.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cars.

44:15.700 --> 44:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now they want to sell a
lot of these cheaper cars to
appeal to a bigger audience.

44:17.433 --> 44:18.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What's the big
challenge for Tesla?

44:18.766 --> 44:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SONARI GLINTON: All the bets.

44:20.933 --> 44:24.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For Tesla, it's a bet inside
of a bet inside of a bet.

44:24.833 --> 44:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're betting that more people
are going to buy electric cars.

44:28.633 --> 44:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're betting on the battery
technology, which Tesla has
one of the biggest factories

44:33.433 --> 44:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the world making batteries.

44:35.466 --> 44:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They also bet on how they're
going to change the way people
-- how they sell the cars.

44:40.066 --> 44:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, you look all across
the board when it comes to
Tesla, there's this huge bet.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Right now, they make
4,400 cars a month or so.

44:48.266 --> 44:52.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they're looking to
sell 500,000 Model 3's.

44:52.200 --> 44:54.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
It's a huge scale-up.

44:54.266 --> 44:57.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SONARI GLINTON: And, at the
end of the month, Tesla says
it is going to deliver 30 cars

44:57.966 --> 45:02.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the buyers, and then
1,900, you know, later on.

45:04.966 --> 45:08.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The key is, how long are those
customers going to wait for that
car, and how long is it going

45:08.566 --> 45:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to take to get there, and they
are going to be able to scale
up, and can they keep that

45:12.966 --> 45:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quality that they were known for
when they were selling 4,400?

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know what the answer
to those things are, but I do
know that is going to be really

45:21.000 --> 45:22.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hard.

45:22.433 --> 45:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: NPR's Sonari
Glinton, thanks so much.

45:28.733 --> 45:33.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SONARI GLINTON:
Always a pleasure.

45:36.266 --> 45:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally
tonight: an inside look at the
relationship and the political

45:43.166 --> 45:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
partnership between President
Trump and his controversial
adviser Steve Bannon.

45:49.700 --> 45:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Joshua Green's new book,
"Devil's Bargain: Steve Bannon,
Donald Trump, and the Storming

45:55.100 --> 45:59.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the Presidency," he examines
how Bannon became a prominent
nationalist conservative

46:01.100 --> 46:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voice that helped create
one of the biggest upsets
in American politics.

46:06.466 --> 46:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Green is also a senior national
correspondent for Bloomberg
Businessweek, and he joins me

46:09.600 --> 46:10.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

46:10.600 --> 46:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to the "NewsHour."

46:12.666 --> 46:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSHUA GREEN, Author, "Devil's
Bargain: Steve Bannon, Donald
Trump, and the Storming of

46:13.600 --> 46:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Presidency": Thank you.

46:16.200 --> 46:17.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Josh
Green, you start the book
out saying Donald Trump
wouldn't be president

46:17.133 --> 46:18.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
if it weren't for Steve Bannon.

46:18.366 --> 46:20.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In a nutshell, who
is Steve Bannon?

46:20.600 --> 46:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSHUA GREEN: Bannon is
a guy who is very much an
outsider like Donald Trump is.

46:24.333 --> 46:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And although he doesn't come
from money -- he was raised in
a blue-collar Navy family in

46:29.100 --> 46:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Richmond, Virginia -- he has
the same basic outlook toward
life and toward elites that

46:34.833 --> 46:36.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump developed.

46:36.366 --> 46:40.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Bannon has a very
unusual background.

46:40.033 --> 46:41.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He joined the Navy.

46:41.833 --> 46:44.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He went from the Navy to
Harvard Business School.

46:44.500 --> 46:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He talked his way into a
job with Goldman Sachs as an
investment banker in the 1980s,

46:52.000 --> 46:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and moved from there to
Hollywood film financing,
and eventually became a
conservative documentarian,

46:57.866 --> 47:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
met the late conservative
provocateur Andrew
Breitbart, and wound up
in charge of Breitbart

47:02.733 --> 47:04.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
News, the right-wing news site.

47:04.366 --> 47:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what
brings these two men together?

47:08.000 --> 47:13.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are they the ideological,
philosophically similar
people some might think?

47:16.033 --> 47:18.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What is the magic that
brings them together?

47:18.066 --> 47:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSHUA GREEN: I think the magic
that brings them together is
that they have the same basic

47:21.633 --> 47:23.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
political outlook.

47:23.733 --> 47:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you look at Trump and what
he said about politics going
all the way back to the 1980s,

47:27.133 --> 47:29.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there have been several
clear populist themes.

47:29.633 --> 47:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He is against free trade.

47:31.666 --> 47:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He thinks the U.S. is
getting taken advantage
of by foreign governments.

47:35.833 --> 47:40.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Bannon's populism is
very much the same, but
he adds the element of
immigration, hostility

47:43.000 --> 47:45.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to immigrants, both
legal and illegal.

47:45.233 --> 47:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when Bannon met Trump in
2011 and began tutoring him
on politics, that was the idea

47:51.300 --> 47:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that he really put forward.

47:53.400 --> 47:57.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And if you look at the
politician Donald Trump
became, it's very much
a reflection of Steve

47:58.633 --> 48:00.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Bannon's politics.

48:00.733 --> 48:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is this -- so,
is this something that's driven
by being against outsiders?

48:04.233 --> 48:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOSHUA GREEN: It really is.

48:06.800 --> 48:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's driven by the idea that
the country is in decline and
needs to fundamentally return

48:13.800 --> 48:17.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to an earlier time, when people
like Steve Bannon were at the
heart of the American economy

48:20.033 --> 48:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and American story, so the
1950s, when you had a strong
manufacturing base, when there

48:26.966 --> 48:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were -- it was clear, the
forces of good and evil in the
world, communism vs. democracy.

48:32.933 --> 48:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both Trump and Bannon don't
like the rise of the younger,
multiethnic generations of

48:39.966 --> 48:44.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Americans that the Obama
coalition reflected,
and are doing everything
they can to fight

48:44.000 --> 48:46.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
against it.

48:46.033 --> 48:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, speaking
of that, what we have read
about Steve Bannon, Breitbart,

48:49.033 --> 48:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
elements of racism, the
so-called alt-right movement,
even anti-Semitism, how much of

48:57.366 --> 48:58.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that is a strain here?

48:58.833 --> 49:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOSHUA GREEN: It's a big strain.

49:01.000 --> 49:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one of the effects that
Bannon had on politics was to
open up a kind of sluice gate

49:07.200 --> 49:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of people who existed really
only on the fringes of American
and far-right talk radio and on

49:14.100 --> 49:18.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Internet boards and try and
bring them into the political
conversation, the mainstream

49:18.766 --> 49:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
political conversation,
by giving them a voice on
places like Breitbart News.

49:23.433 --> 49:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what Bannon thought he
was doing was marshaling
these hidden political
forces to go up against

49:31.633 --> 49:36.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
not Democrats, but the
establishment Republican
leaders, people like
Mitch McConnell, Paul

49:39.066 --> 49:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ryan and, before him,
House Speaker John Boehner,
who was Bannon's original
target and was forced

49:44.866 --> 49:47.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to resign in 2015, in
part because of the
energies that Bannon and
Breitbart News unleashed

49:49.433 --> 49:51.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Washington politics.

49:51.900 --> 49:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: OK,
on just as straight a
measurement as you can, how
successful has Steve Bannon

49:57.200 --> 50:00.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been in getting his ideas
across in this administration?

50:00.033 --> 50:05.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOSHUA GREEN: Well, it
would be hard to argue
that Bannon hasn't been
shockingly successful

50:05.500 --> 50:07.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
overall.

50:07.600 --> 50:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you go back three years --
and I tell this story in the
book -- Steve Bannon was very

50:10.500 --> 50:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
closely allied with Jeff
Sessions, who, at the time, was
the populist Republican senator

50:16.100 --> 50:18.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from Alabama.

50:18.633 --> 50:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Bannon tried to talk
Sessions into running for
president, not because
he thought he could

50:21.866 --> 50:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
win, but because he
thought Sessions could
elevate the issues of
immigration and antipathy

50:29.000 --> 50:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to free trade to the top
of the Republican agenda.

50:32.133 --> 50:35.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Sessions ultimately
decided not to do that.

50:35.266 --> 50:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But by linking up with Donald
Trump, Bannon was able to not
only get that on top of the

50:42.300 --> 50:45.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican agenda, but make
it all the way into the White
House and have real power to

50:45.333 --> 50:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
enact some of these policies,
in a way that he never did
as a conservative publisher.

50:50.066 --> 50:52.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is Bannon
involved in the Russian probe?

50:52.800 --> 50:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOSHUA GREEN: So far, he seems
not to be directly implicated.

50:56.633 --> 51:01.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I know he hasn't hired
a lawyer, as many people
in the Trump family and
the Trump administration

51:01.033 --> 51:04.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have to defend them against
potential investigation.

51:04.300 --> 51:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, as far as we know,
Bannon is not yet implicated
in the Russia scandal.

51:08.600 --> 51:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you have
reported, I know, in, I guess,
language that we can't use here,

51:12.633 --> 51:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Bannon is interested
in smearing Robert
Mueller as much as he can.

51:19.566 --> 51:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSHUA GREEN: Well, if you look
at what Steve Bannon really
does for Donald Trump, going

51:22.433 --> 51:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all the way back to
the beginning of their
relationship, it isn't
that he's a Machiavellian

51:26.733 --> 51:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
figure, as he's been portrayed.

51:28.766 --> 51:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's that Steve Bannon is the
guy who goes out and attacks
Trump's critics and his enemies,

51:34.833 --> 51:38.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether that's someone like
Megyn Kelly at FOX News, or the
mainstream media after Trump's

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
"Access Hollywood" tape
was released on the
eve of the debates.

51:43.000 --> 51:48.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Right now, Trump feels
like he needs someone
aggressively defending
him in the Russia probe.

51:50.100 --> 51:53.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he wasn't happy with the
way that his own White House
spokespeople were doing the

51:53.266 --> 51:55.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
job.

51:55.366 --> 51:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: If you look at
the polls right now, in -- I
guess, in large part, Donald

51:58.566 --> 52:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump seems to be holding
on to his base, but there is
some evidence of slippage.

52:02.433 --> 52:07.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And you have got, what,
40 percent of Americans
with a strong opposition
to Donald Trump.

52:08.900 --> 52:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If it continues this way, does
Steve Bannon stay where he is?

52:11.333 --> 52:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSHUA GREEN: I think it does,
because Bannon and Trump both
seem to believe that it is

52:16.133 --> 52:21.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
absolutely vital to keep
Trump's base angry and
riled up and active.

52:23.500 --> 52:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there is some pretty
interesting polling data to
indicate that that's working.

52:27.533 --> 52:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Washington Post/ABC had a
poll that came out this week
saying that only 9 percent of

52:34.466 --> 52:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans thought that
the Russia collusion
posed any sort of problem.

52:39.133 --> 52:41.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, to me, that's an
indication that Bannon's
methods are working.

52:41.433 --> 52:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And while he hasn't gotten
Trump anywhere near a majority
of popular support, he has

52:46.233 --> 52:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
managed to maintain that
critical 40 percent base that
Trump is going to rely on.

52:53.200 --> 52:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Josh Green,
nobody else has gotten this
deep a look at Steve Bannon.

52:57.033 --> 52:59.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, thank you very much.

52:59.166 --> 53:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Devil's Bargain" is the book,
"Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, and
the Storming of the Presidency."

53:03.100 --> 53:04.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

53:04.333 --> 53:09.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOSHUA GREEN: Thanks
so much for having me.

53:11.033 --> 53:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And online right
now: It took more than 2,500
cardboard tubes to build the

53:21.100 --> 53:25.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
latest exhibit at the
National Building Museum
here in Washington.

53:25.133 --> 53:28.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now you can see what's the
buzz, what is behind the buzz.
