JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:07.441 --> 00:12.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight, the
longest war
just got longer. President Obama
announces

00:12.646 --> 00:19.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a setback in withdrawals from
Afghanistan,
leaving 8,400 U.S. troops to
combat a resurgent

00:19.920 --> 00:21.622 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Taliban.

00:21.655 --> 00:27.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, we continue our series
Fault Lines,
an inside look at the crippling
challenges

00:27.060 --> 00:29.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
facing the government of
Ukraine.

00:29.396 --> 00:36.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And parents finally find
treatment for children's
epilepsy with medical marijuana,
but unclear

00:36.503 --> 00:39.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
science and stigma threaten this
source of
relief.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DR. ELIZABETH THIELE,
Massachusetts General
Hospital: Sometimes, the batch
will be effective,

00:42.809 --> 00:46.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will make the seizures better.
Sometimes,
the next month, it will be
worse, the seizures

00:46.413 --> 00:51.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will get worse. So, I don't feel
comfortable
prescribing something that I
don't understand

00:51.118 --> 00:52.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
better than that.

00:52.386 --> 00:59.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:59.760 --> 01:02.763 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:02.796 --> 01:11.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Republicans in
the U.S. House
of Representatives are going to
investigate

01:11.672 --> 01:18.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the FBI's inquiry into Hillary
Clinton's e-mail
practices. They announced today
that FBI Director

01:18.445 --> 01:25.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
James Comey will testify
tomorrow on why he
recommended no criminal charges
be filed.

01:25.452 --> 01:29.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Attorney General Loretta Lynch
will be called
before the Congress next week.
We will focus

01:29.723 --> 01:34.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the reasoning behind the
FBI's decision
later in the program.

01:34.461 --> 01:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A Republican gun and anti-terror
bill has
run into trouble in the House.
It bars gun

01:40.634 --> 01:46.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sales to anyone on a terror
watch list if
prosecutors can prove probable
cause of a

01:46.340 --> 01:52.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
potential crime. Some 40 members
of the Freedom
Caucus came out against it
today, even though

01:52.412 --> 01:57.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the National Rifle Association
endorsed a
similar bill in the Senate. That
leaves House

01:58.018 --> 02:01.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Speaker Paul Ryan without the
votes to pass
the measure for now.

02:01.722 --> 02:04.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House:
We have members from both sides
of the aisle

02:04.291 --> 02:07.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who want to make improvements,
who want to
make changes to the bill. We
want to make

02:07.361 --> 02:10.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sure we get it right. The last
thing we're
going to do is rush something to
the floor

02:10.931 --> 02:15.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we don't have right. And,
again, this
matters to us. This is the
Constitution. This

02:15.769 --> 02:20.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
means we get this right. We do
not want to
violate a citizen's due process
rights.

02:20.107 --> 02:25.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, House
Democrats
called again for much stronger
gun legislation.

02:25.512 --> 02:29.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congressman John Lewis of
Georgia spoke at
a Capitol rally today.

02:29.282 --> 02:35.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. JOHN LEWIS (D), Georgia: We
cannot be
patient. We have come to that
point where

02:35.789 --> 02:42.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're trying to say to members
of Congress,
all of our members, you must do
something.

02:42.729 --> 02:47.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You must act, and act now. Not
tomorrow, but
now.

02:47.067 --> 02:52.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Democrats staged
a sit-in on
the House floor last month, but
so far, Speaker

02:52.205 --> 02:56.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ryan has turned aside their
demands for votes.

02:56.243 --> 03:01.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A long-awaited report today
painted a damning
picture of Britain's march to
war with Iraq

03:01.748 --> 03:07.754 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
in 2003. The
government-commissioned probe
found the legal basis for
military action

03:07.788 --> 03:13.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was "far from satisfactory." It
concluded
that Britain joined the war
effort before

03:13.727 --> 03:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all peaceful options had been
exhausted, and
then Prime Minister Tony Blair
overestimated

03:19.699 --> 03:22.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his ability to influence U.S.
policy.

03:22.903 --> 03:25.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Blair today stood by his
decisions.

03:25.338 --> 03:28.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY BLAIR, Former British Prime
Minister:
Some of the intelligence has
turned out to

03:28.141 --> 03:31.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be wrong. The planning wasn't
done properly.
I have to accept those
criticisms. I accept

03:31.678 --> 03:37.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
responsibility for them, but I
think people
want me to go one step further,
and this is

03:37.050 --> 03:42.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
my problem. It's a very
fundamental problem,
and I know it causes a lot of
difficulty,

03:42.255 --> 03:47.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even with people who might
support me otherwise.
They say, no, we want you to
apologize for

03:47.260 --> 03:49.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the decision. I can't do that.

03:49.830 --> 03:57.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: British combat
forces left
Iraq in 2009, after losing 179
dead.

In Syria, the military announced
a unilateral
three-day truce to mark the end
of the Muslim

04:03.043 --> 04:09.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
holy month of Ramadan. State TV
showed Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad at
prayer services

04:09.583 --> 04:15.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Homs. Government forces
recaptured the
city earlier this year. Rebel
groups said

04:15.388 --> 04:17.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fighting continued elsewhere.

04:17.524 --> 04:24.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A judge in South Africa
sentenced Paralympian
Oscar Pistorius today to six
years in prison

04:24.664 --> 04:31.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for murdering his girlfriend in
2013. The
double amputee could have gotten
15 years.

04:31.304 --> 04:37.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pistorius stood silently in the
court in Pretoria,
as a judge handed down the
sentence. She called

04:37.244 --> 04:40.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
him -- quote -- "a fallen hero."

04:40.447 --> 04:45.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Back in this country, a
congressional commission
reports the Veterans Affairs
health care system

04:45.252 --> 04:51.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is still plagued by -- quote --
"profound
deficiencies." It finds quality
of care differs

04:51.091 --> 04:57.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
widely, and that veterans still
face long
waits. The findings come two
years after revelations

04:57.597 --> 05:03.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that VA officials falsified
paperwork about
wait times.

05:03.036 --> 05:09.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And European markets slipped
again, amid concerns
about Britain leaving the E.U.,
but Wall Street

05:09.209 --> 05:16.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made modest progress. The Dow
Jones industrial
average gained 78 points to
close at 17918.

05:17.017 --> 05:21.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 36 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added 11.

05:21.354 --> 05:27.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
protests
break out in Baton Rouge after
video of another

05:27.260 --> 05:34.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
police shooting emerges; what's
driving the
president to keep more troops in
Afghanistan;

05:34.234 --> 05:44.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a deeper look at the legal
standard used in
the Clinton e-mail
investigation; and much

05:44.578 --> 05:50.016 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

05:50.050 --> 05:55.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. Justice Department has
opened a civil
rights investigation into
another police shooting,

05:55.422 --> 06:01.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this time in Baton Rouge,
Louisiana. Yesterday,
37-year-old Alton Sterling was
confronted

06:01.528 --> 06:07.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and shot by an officer
responding to a disturbance
call. The city's police chief
said Sterling

06:07.534 --> 06:09.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
had a gun at the time.

06:09.836 --> 06:14.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a cell phone video that
caught part of
the altercation and was widely
viewed on social

06:14.874 --> 06:19.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
media led many to ask whether
the shooting
was justified.

06:19.246 --> 06:29.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here is some of what was seen.
And a warning:
The video is graphic.

06:29.289 --> 06:35.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here is some of what was seen.
And a warning:
The video is graphic.

06:35.128 --> 06:45.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a press conference today, the
mother of
one of Alton Sterling's children
spoke of

06:45.171 --> 06:52.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a press conference today, the
mother of
one of Alton Sterling's children
spoke of

06:52.412 --> 06:54.347 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his death.

06:54.381 --> 07:00.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUINYETTA MCMILLON, Had Child
With Alton Sterling:
It will not go unnoticed,
especially for the

07:00.053 --> 07:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
future. I, for one, will not
rest or not allow
him to be swept in the dirt.

07:13.166 --> 07:18.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The two officers
involved in
the incident are now on
administrative leave.

07:18.705 --> 07:23.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Louisiana's Governor John Bel
Edwards called
the video disturbing and said he
has a very

07:23.576 --> 07:25.612 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
serious concern.

07:25.645 --> 07:30.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kevin Litten is covering the
story for The
New Orleans Times-Picayune.

07:30.216 --> 07:34.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kevin Litten, tell us exactly
what is known
about what happened to Alton
Sterling early

07:34.154 --> 07:35.355 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Tuesday morning.

07:35.388 --> 07:37.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEVIN LITTEN, The New Orleans
Times-Picayune:
Hi, Judy.

07:37.891 --> 07:45.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what we know now is that
Alton Brown -- or
-- I'm sorry -- Alton Sterling
was in a parking

07:45.298 --> 07:51.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot of a convenience store in
North Baton
Rouge. It's a well-traveled area
both night

07:51.104 --> 07:57.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and day, and someone called the
police and
said that someone was
threatening someone

07:57.544 --> 07:59.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in that parking lot with a gun.

07:59.346 --> 08:06.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When police responded, they made
contact with
Mr. Sterling and an altercation
ensued. From

08:06.086 --> 08:12.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what you can see on the video,
they apparently
had Mr. Sterling on the ground.
And during

08:12.759 --> 08:19.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that altercation on the ground,
shots were
fired at Mr. Sterling, and he
died very soon

08:19.199 --> 08:20.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after of his injuries.

08:20.967 --> 08:26.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's unclear right now is
whether or not
Mr. Sterling actually did have a
gun. There

08:26.072 --> 08:32.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was a witness report that said
that police
removed the gun from him, but at
a press conference

08:32.312 --> 08:37.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
later today, the police wouldn't
confirm whether
he had a weapon. So I believe
it's going to

08:37.250 --> 08:41.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
be a key part of the
investigation that the
FBI is looking at.

08:41.521 --> 08:47.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other thing we learned today
is that there's
some questionable video from the
body cameras

08:47.460 --> 08:50.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the police had. There is
questions about
whether or not it's actually
going to be able

08:50.964 --> 08:57.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be used. Apparently, both
officers lost
the body cam or it fell off
during that altercation,

08:57.837 --> 09:03.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but we obviously had the video
that you just
showed, and that is what is
really driving

09:03.410 --> 09:05.044 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
much of the anger in this city.

09:05.078 --> 09:08.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly,
you have
done some reporting about Alton
Sterling,

09:08.348 --> 09:10.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his life, who he was?

09:10.850 --> 09:18.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN LITTEN: Yes, I just got
back from meeting
with someone who runs a
transitional housing

09:18.858 --> 09:24.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
complex that's for -- many
times, for offenders
that are being released from
prison or trying

09:24.097 --> 09:25.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to get back on their feet.

09:25.899 --> 09:31.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So my understanding is Mr.
Sterling was a
sex offender. He had been
released for about

09:31.237 --> 09:36.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
six months. But he really was on
the right
track. The person that I spoke
to said Mr.

09:36.910 --> 09:41.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sterling was one of the good
ones and never
had issues with him, rent was
always on time,

09:41.881 --> 09:46.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
loved to cook for the men that
he lived with.
Red beans and rice was his
favorite dish to

09:46.986 --> 09:48.788 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cook.

09:48.822 --> 09:52.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he was spending time with
his children.
That was really, it sounded,
Brooke, to me,

09:52.091 --> 09:56.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what he was up to in the six
months that he
had been released. He was
working a part-time

09:56.362 --> 10:01.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
job as a cook. He was selling
these C.D.s
sort of as a little side
entrepreneurial gig.

10:01.367 --> 10:04.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in the other time that he
had, he was
trying to see his kids.

10:04.704 --> 10:09.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as you can see from the
emotional reaction
from his son in that
heartbreaking press conference

10:09.509 --> 10:14.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today, there was certainly a
closeness that
he was able to have with his
children. And

10:14.280 --> 10:19.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I believe he wanted to stay on
the right track
to continue to be a part of
their lives.

10:19.085 --> 10:23.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, Kevin
Litten with
The New Orleans Times-Picayune,
we thank you.

10:23.523 --> 10:28.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KEVIN LITTEN: Thank you.

10:28.828 --> 10:40.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Our nation's
longest war just
got longer. The Obama
administration had hoped

10:40.940 --> 10:46.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to cut the number of U.S.
service personnel
in Afghanistan, currently at
10,000, in half

10:46.913 --> 10:48.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by the end of the year.

10:48.548 --> 10:52.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, today, the president said
increased threats
will put the number at 8,400.

10:52.519 --> 10:56.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
We have to deal with the
realities of the

10:56.155 --> 10:59.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
world as it is. And we can't
forget what's
at stake in Afghanistan.

10:59.726 --> 11:06.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is where al-Qaida is trying
to regroup.
This is where ISIL continues to
try to expand

11:06.065 --> 11:10.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
its presence. If these
terrorists succeed
in regaining areas and camps
where they can

11:10.937 --> 11:17.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
train and plot, they will
attempt more attacks
against us. We cannot allow that
to happen.

11:17.744 --> 11:22.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hari Sreenivasan
is in our
New York studios to explore why
this decision

11:22.415 --> 11:24.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was made and what it means.

11:24.484 --> 11:28.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And we get
that from Seth
Jones, director of the
International Security

11:28.688 --> 11:33.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Defense Policy Center at the
RAND Corporation.
He's written extensively about
the Afghan

11:33.660 --> 11:37.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conflict, and has served as an
adviser to
the special operations forces
commander in

11:37.363 --> 11:38.998 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Afghanistan.

11:39.032 --> 11:44.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Seth, the difference between
the numbers,
8,400 to 5,500, why the decision
now?

11:44.304 --> 11:47.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SETH JONES, Senior Political
Scientist, RAND
Corporation: Well, I think it
reflects a bit

11:47.106 --> 11:51.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a collaboration between the
military, which
wanted higher numbers -- the
numbers came

11:51.978 --> 11:56.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down from just under 10,000.
They wanted those
roughly the same or something
close to that

11:56.783 --> 12:02.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- and the president, which had
asked for
about 5,500 or so. This largely
meets up somewhere

12:02.622 --> 12:04.424 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the middle.

12:04.457 --> 12:08.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, didn't go down to the levels
the military
feared, but it gives the
president an argument

12:08.061 --> 12:12.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
politically that he continues to
end the U.S.
involvement in the war.

12:12.632 --> 12:16.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What's that
difference in
real, practical terms? If we
have another

12:16.636 --> 12:21.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
couple thousand troops on the
ground in different
parts of Afghanistan, what does
that mean

12:21.441 --> 12:23.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to Afghan forces?

12:23.242 --> 12:28.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SETH JONES: Well, I think the
biggest issue
is if the U.S. had gone down to
5,500, it

12:28.181 --> 12:33.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would have been mostly what we
call kinetic
operations, strikes against
al-Qaida, Islamic

12:33.286 --> 12:36.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
State and other groups, a little
bit of Taliban.

12:36.122 --> 12:41.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With the numbers we're talking
about now,
8,400, there's an ability to do
train, advise

12:41.361 --> 12:46.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and assist of Afghan forces out
in the field,
so this gives the military a
little bit more

12:46.132 --> 12:50.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wiggle room to train Afghan
forces out in
the field and back in their
barracks.

12:50.837 --> 12:54.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This is not --
as you said,
this isn't what the military
wanted, so does

12:54.641 --> 12:59.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that end up compromising the end
goal here
to get the Afghan forces
standing up as fast

12:59.879 --> 13:01.614 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as possible?

13:01.648 --> 13:05.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SETH JONES: Well, look, I think
this is one
of many factors. This is about a
number of

13:05.718 --> 13:09.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forces. There are a lot of other
things, the
posture of U.S. forces, which
forces you're

13:09.088 --> 13:11.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to put in, whether it's
special operations
or conventional.

13:11.958 --> 13:18.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think at this number, it does
allow the
U.S. to do some
training-advising, some strikes

13:18.898 --> 13:23.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against the Taliban, but a lot
of this is
going to be also outside the
U.S.' control.

13:23.202 --> 13:26.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's going to be about the
quality of the
Afghan government. And that's
something the

13:26.072 --> 13:27.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
military won't be able to
control.

13:27.740 --> 13:31.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And haven't we
recently
kind of loosened the
restrictions on what

13:31.744 --> 13:36.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American forces are allowed to
do if they're
engaged in combat with the
Taliban or other

13:36.816 --> 13:38.151 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forces?

13:38.184 --> 13:40.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SETH JONES: There have been
restrictions at
least in two senses.

13:40.253 --> 13:45.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is who the U.S. can target
on the ground.
For a while, it was largely just
al-Qaida

13:45.925 --> 13:51.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forces. The U.S. loosened that a
couple of
months ago to include Islamic
State operatives,

13:51.330 --> 13:56.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mostly in Eastern Afghanistan.
And then also
now to include some senior
Taliban officials.

13:56.269 --> 13:59.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And we saw that with the
targeting of Mullah
Mansour recently.

13:59.372 --> 14:05.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There have been a little bit
loosening of
what the U.S. can do in putting
U.S. forces

14:05.344 --> 14:08.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the ground in or near a
combat area.

14:08.848 --> 14:13.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, the
president said
this is going to be able to
tailor to help

14:13.686 --> 14:17.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Afghan forces. Is there
something special
that some of our troops are
engaged in when

14:17.857 --> 14:20.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it comes to training Afghan
military forces?

14:20.426 --> 14:24.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SETH JONES: Well, forces that
have done the
vast majority of the training,
particularly

14:24.230 --> 14:29.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the high-end forces in
Afghanistan, like the
commandos, have been U.S.
special forces.

14:29.635 --> 14:34.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Operational Detachment Alpha is
the ground.
So, having this number, more
than the 5,500

14:34.273 --> 14:38.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the president initially
said he wanted
to get down to at the end of
2016, does allow

14:38.778 --> 14:43.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him to tailor some of the
training to the
higher-end forces who are going
to be really

14:43.116 --> 14:49.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
important in case the Taliban
try to storm,
take and hold a major Afghan
provincial or

14:49.055 --> 14:50.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
even district capital.

14:50.757 --> 14:53.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And let's talk
a little
bit about the sort of
geopolitical aspect

14:53.392 --> 14:56.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of it. This comes before the
NATO summit.

14:56.062 --> 15:01.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SETH JONES: Yes. I think the
timing is a good
one, just before Warsaw.

15:01.901 --> 15:07.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What this sends is a message to
America's
NATO allies that the U.S. is
going to be committed

15:07.607 --> 15:13.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at roughly decent levels through
the next
administration. And there are
German forces,

15:13.112 --> 15:17.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for example, operating in
Northern Afghanistan,
Italians in the west. They're
going to keep

15:17.316 --> 15:20.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their forces roughly the same
numbers with
the U.S. commitment now.

15:21.020 --> 15:26.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, also,
let's take a
look at the counterweight here.
The president

15:26.592 --> 15:32.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says that this should indicate
to the Taliban
that really your only way
through this, especially

15:32.465 --> 15:36.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if we're going to leave more
forces on the
ground, is to get back to the
negotiating

15:36.202 --> 15:37.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
table. Where are those talks
now?

15:37.503 --> 15:42.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SETH JONES: The negotiations are
still a pretty
infant stage.

15:42.775 --> 15:47.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Taliban has not been willing
to do a lot
of serious discussions like what
we have seen

15:47.513 --> 15:52.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in other conflicts. It's unclear
whether we're
really going to get to this end.
In fact,

15:52.752 --> 15:56.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only about a quarter or so of
insurgencies
end by a negotiated settlement.
It's clear

15:56.923 --> 16:00.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.S. would like it to end
this way, but
we have to got to really get to
a stalemate,

16:00.893 --> 16:03.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, I think before sides
can actually
get to a settlement.

16:03.229 --> 16:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, finally,
how much is
the shadow of Iraq looming over
these sorts

16:07.533 --> 16:12.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of decisions, especially in the
last few weeks
and months, where we have seen
such incredible

16:12.705 --> 16:14.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
violence in Iraq?

16:14.540 --> 16:18.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SETH JONES: I think there's no
question that
the shadow of Iraq hangs over
Afghanistan.

16:18.344 --> 16:23.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. decision, sort of black
and white,
to just pull out forces in 2011,
and then

16:23.349 --> 16:27.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
what happens after that
eventually with the
Islamic State takeover of Mosul
and other

16:27.553 --> 16:32.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
places, I think the U.S. is
operating a lot
more cautiously here in
incrementally pulling

16:32.458 --> 16:34.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out forces, so as to not take
too much risk.

16:34.861 --> 16:38.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Seth Jones from
the RAND Corporation, thanks so
much.

16:38.231 --> 16:43.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SETH JONES: Thank you.

16:43.202 --> 16:55.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There is some
breaking news
this evening related to Hillary
Clinton's

16:55.448 --> 16:59.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
handling of e-mails while she
was secretary
of state.

16:59.118 --> 17:04.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Attorney General Loretta Lynch
will follow
the FBI's recommendation to not
pursue criminal

17:04.790 --> 17:06.592 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
charges.

17:06.626 --> 17:11.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She said in a statement -- quote
-- "I received
and accepted their unanimous
recommendation

17:11.297 --> 17:16.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the thorough, year-long
investigation
be closed and that no charges be
brought against

17:17.003 --> 17:20.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
any individuals within the scope
of the investigation."

17:20.806 --> 17:26.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While that appears to put an end
to the prospect
of legal action, Lisa Desjardins
reports on

17:26.045 --> 17:27.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the political fallout.

17:27.880 --> 17:32.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Candidate
Hillary Clinton
was out stumping for the
presidency on the

17:32.518 --> 17:38.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jersey coast today. But the
Democrat was still
taking heat for her time as
secretary of state.

17:38.391 --> 17:43.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This morning, House Speaker Paul
Ryan slammed
the FBI decision to not
recommend charges

17:43.329 --> 17:49.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in its probe of Clinton's
private e-mail use,
suggesting the nominee-to-be not
get classified

17:49.201 --> 17:51.003 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
briefings.

17:51.037 --> 17:54.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House:
I think the DNI, Clapper, should
deny Hillary

17:54.807 --> 18:00.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton access to classified
information during
this campaign, given how she so
recklessly

18:00.980 --> 18:02.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
handled classified information.

18:02.481 --> 18:05.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: He was asked,
did Clinton
get preferential treatment?

18:05.551 --> 18:08.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN: I will let
everybody be the
judge of that. It looks like it
to me.

18:08.321 --> 18:12.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: FBI Director
James Comey
is also in Republicans' sights.
The House

18:12.358 --> 18:16.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Oversight Committee quickly set
up a hearing
for tomorrow where Comey will
testify about

18:17.029 --> 18:21.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the e-mail case. Attorney
General Loretta
Lynch will appear before another
panel next

18:21.767 --> 18:23.636 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
week.

18:23.669 --> 18:26.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican presidential hopeful
Donald Trump
pressed the issue on the trail
in North Carolina.

18:26.839 --> 18:31.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I always felt that Hillary
Clinton would escape

18:31.143 --> 18:37.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
criminal charges for her
dangerous and illegal
behavior, because I always knew,
and I always

18:37.850 --> 18:42.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see, and it's so sad, that our
system is in
fact rigged. It's totally
rigged, OK?

18:42.788 --> 18:46.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As for team
Clinton, their
day today was spent on offense,
bidding to

18:46.592 --> 18:51.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
move the focus off the e-mail
story. Part
one of her game plan, tackling
student loans.

18:51.964 --> 18:56.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement, Clinton said she
has taken
a page from Bernie Sanders,
proposing to make

18:56.168 --> 19:00.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
public universities tuition-free
for most
American families.

19:00.473 --> 19:05.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Part two, confronting Trump's
business record
head-on in a place he knows,
Atlantic City.

19:05.811 --> 19:11.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
We're standing in front of old
Trump Plaza

19:11.717 --> 19:23.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Casino and Hotel. Donald Trump
once predicted
it will be the biggest hit yet.
Now it's abandoned.

19:23.162 --> 19:32.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's fair to ask, since he's
applying
for a job, what in the world
happened here?

19:32.171 --> 19:37.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But as Clinton
and her campaign
fired off their broadsides,
Trump responded

19:37.176 --> 19:42.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right away in kind. He issued a
statement
saying it was common practice to
-- quote

19:42.081 --> 19:48.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- "use bankruptcy proceedings
to ultimately
save jobs." He continued:
"Nobody understands

19:48.421 --> 19:53.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the economy like I do and no
one, especially
not crooked Hillary Clinton,
will do more

19:53.259 --> 19:55.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the economy than I will."

19:55.694 --> 20:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, there's one fewer
person on Trump's
possible V.P. list, the man he
campaigned

20:00.699 --> 20:06.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with last night. Tennessee
Senator Bob Corker
took himself out of the running.
And amidst

20:06.138 --> 20:11.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all this, Bernie Sanders met
today behind
closed doors with Democrats in
Congress, pushing

20:11.410 --> 20:16.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to change the party's
priorities. Some reportedly
booed him for not yet endorsing
Clinton.

20:17.016 --> 20:19.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

20:19.318 --> 20:24.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we move from
the politics
back to the legal questions
raised by the

20:24.123 --> 20:30.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FBI's and now the attorney
general's decision
not to recommend criminal
charges be filed.

20:30.329 --> 20:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we do that with Shannen
Coffin. He is
an attorney in private practice.
He previously

20:34.934 --> 20:39.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
served as a deputy assistant
attorney general
for the Civil Division at the
Department of

20:39.171 --> 20:45.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Justice and as counsel to Vice
President Cheney.
And Stephen Vladeck, he's a
professor at the

20:45.778 --> 20:51.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
University of Texas School of
Law, where he
focuses on federal jurisdiction,
constitutional

20:51.550 --> 20:53.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
law, and national security law.

20:53.986 --> 20:56.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

20:56.622 --> 21:02.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let me start with you, Shannen
Coffin. Do
you agree with the
recommendation of the FBI

21:03.028 --> 21:08.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
director and now the attorney
general that
there not be a criminal
prosecution of Hillary

21:08.200 --> 21:09.702 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton?

21:09.735 --> 21:11.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHANNEN COFFIN, Former U.S.
Deputy Assistant
Attorney General: No, I don't.

21:11.637 --> 21:19.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you watched Jim Comey's
press conference,
you will see quite a disconnect
between the

21:19.044 --> 21:27.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
10 minutes of discussion of fact
and the recommendation.
What Jim Comey set up was a
violation of federal

21:27.820 --> 21:40.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
law that prohibits the misuse or
mishandling
of classified information
through gross negligence,

21:40.099 --> 21:41.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and he himself said...

21:41.534 --> 21:43.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're saying he
made that
case of gross negligence?

21:43.369 --> 21:50.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHANNEN COFFIN: He made that
case, and he
himself said that this was
extreme negligence,

21:50.576 --> 21:56.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
extreme recklessness in handling
this information.
That is exactly what federal law
prohibits

21:56.282 --> 21:58.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and criminalizes as a felony.

21:58.083 --> 22:03.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, to you now,
Stephen Vladeck.
If that's what the federal law
prohibits,

22:03.822 --> 22:08.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if it's just -- or if the
standard is extreme
negligence, why wasn't that
enough?

22:09.028 --> 22:11.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN VLADECK, University of
Texas School
of Law: Well, I think the
problem is that

22:11.197 --> 22:16.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shannen is leaving out the rest
of that same
statute, which doesn't just say
it's a crime

22:16.101 --> 22:21.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for an official like Secretary
Clinton to
exercise gross negligence in the
handling

22:21.373 --> 22:23.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of classified information.

22:23.175 --> 22:28.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's actually much more
specific. That gross
negligence must somehow lead to
the loss of

22:28.147 --> 22:32.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
classified information,
basically the same
thing as if a courier left a
briefcase full

22:32.885 --> 22:36.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of classified documents in a
public place.
That's not what happened here.

22:36.722 --> 22:41.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we may very well think
that what Hillary
did should be illegal. The
problem is, is

22:41.227 --> 22:45.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the law we're talking
about, Judy, is
99 years old and was not written
to address

22:45.397 --> 22:47.132 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this situation.

22:47.166 --> 22:51.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But your point is
that what
happened here didn't result in
the loss of

22:51.837 --> 22:53.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
classified information?

22:53.639 --> 22:55.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN VLADECK: Well, at the
very least,
we didn't hear anything to that
effect from

22:55.975 --> 23:00.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Director Comey. And I would like
to think
that if the FBI had discovered
that Secretary

23:00.946 --> 23:06.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton's servers had been
hacked, that through
her, in Director Comey's words,
extreme carelessness,

23:06.852 --> 23:10.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some classified information had
fallen into
the wrong hands, I have to think
we would

23:10.189 --> 23:11.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have heard about that.

23:12.024 --> 23:15.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Short of that, we may still
think that what
Hillary Clinton did was
careless. We may still

23:15.828 --> 23:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think it was pretty darn stupid,
but the actual
federal statute requires that
the gross negligence

23:21.333 --> 23:25.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lead to the loss of information.
There's no
claim here, there's no proof
here that that's

23:25.771 --> 23:27.506 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what happened.

23:27.539 --> 23:31.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHANNEN COFFIN: That's simply
not correct.
The law actually only requires
removal of

23:31.410 --> 23:35.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the document from its proper
place of custody.

23:35.981 --> 23:38.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN VLADECK: That's not
true. You're conflating
two different statutes.

23:38.350 --> 23:42.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHANNEN COFFIN: I'm looking at
the statute
right here, Professor Vladeck.

23:42.121 --> 23:49.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The statute actually says,
through gross negligence,
permitting a document to be
removed from its

23:49.094 --> 23:53.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
proper place of custody
delivered to anyone
in violation of the...

23:53.098 --> 23:54.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

23:54.833 --> 23:56.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me just let
-- let him
finish that point, and I then I
will come

23:56.769 --> 23:58.504 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
back to you.

23:58.537 --> 24:02.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHANNEN COFFIN: So, lost -- lost
-- losing
a document certainly can be a
basis for a

24:02.608 --> 24:07.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
violation, but there are other
things that
can happen. Simply removing --
this is 793-F

24:07.146 --> 24:08.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the Espionage Act.

24:08.814 --> 24:11.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: OK. And we're not
going to
be able to get into all the --
because we

24:11.717 --> 24:14.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can't follow that while we're
here.

24:14.153 --> 24:15.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHANNEN COFFIN: Right.

24:15.954 --> 24:17.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But I do want to
come back
to both of you on the standard
that Director

24:17.923 --> 24:22.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Comey seemed to use yesterday,
and that is
there was no clear evidence that
Secretary

24:22.795 --> 24:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton or her colleagues
intended, intended
to violate the laws. What about
that?

24:27.966 --> 24:32.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SHANNEN COFFIN: Utterly
irrelevant. Under
this particular statute, gross
negligence

24:32.638 --> 24:33.672 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is the standard.

24:33.706 --> 24:36.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that means extreme lack of
care.

24:36.675 --> 24:41.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So you're saying
the FBI director
and now the attorney general
have misinterpreted

24:41.847 --> 24:42.815 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the law?

24:42.848 --> 24:44.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHANNEN COFFIN: Absolutely. It's
plain language.

24:44.650 --> 24:47.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN VLADECK: And I think the
problem with
that, Judy, is that it's plain
language of

24:47.386 --> 24:49.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a small part of a much larger
provision.

24:49.988 --> 24:55.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think the issue is,
there is no precedent,
none, for prosecuting, for
convicting a U.S.

24:55.594 --> 25:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government employee because they
discussed
classified information in an
unsecure system

25:00.766 --> 25:02.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and nothing else.

25:02.668 --> 25:06.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unless that information is
somehow lost, unless
it is removed from the
government's possession,

25:06.572 --> 25:08.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the government has never
prosecuted anyone
under the statute.

25:08.874 --> 25:10.776 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

25:10.809 --> 25:12.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHANNEN COFFIN: ... the entire
purpose of
the server was to remove this
from the government's

25:12.911 --> 25:13.746 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
possession.

25:13.779 --> 25:14.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask you
both...

25:14.513 --> 25:15.848 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

25:15.881 --> 25:17.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me move
on to another
related question.

25:17.683 --> 25:20.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is, what has been
raised today is
whether there is a double
standard, whether

25:20.986 --> 25:26.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there was one standard for
secretary of state
and another for other people.
And, in fact,

25:26.592 --> 25:30.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jim Comey said yesterday, the
FBI director,
he said this is not to suggest
that in similar

25:30.863 --> 25:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
circumstances a person who
engaged in this
activity would face no
consequences.

25:35.033 --> 25:41.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says, to the contrary, those
individuals
are often subject to security or
administrative

25:41.039 --> 25:41.940 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sanctions. So...

25:41.974 --> 25:43.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHANNEN COFFIN: Right, and there
have been.

25:43.876 --> 25:49.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Members of the military --
Sergeant Ricky
Roller (ph) was a sergeant at
Marine headquarters

25:50.015 --> 25:55.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here in town. He removed a
document, accidentally
stuffed it in a bag and
discovered it later

25:55.788 --> 26:02.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and decided to keep it in a
drawer at his
house and never returned it. He
was prosecuted

26:02.094 --> 26:04.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
under this very statute. He
didn't intend
anything.

26:04.530 --> 26:08.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about that,
Stephen Vladeck?
Is there a double standard at
work here?

26:08.767 --> 26:11.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN VLADECK: Well, Judy, I
do think there
is a double standard, but I'm
not sure Hillary's

26:11.570 --> 26:13.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is the case to make that point.

26:13.505 --> 26:17.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shannen's right. We're talking
about a different
section than the one that the
government used

26:17.443 --> 26:22.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to go after leakers and putative
whistle-blowers.
So I think we can make a very
strong argument

26:22.681 --> 26:27.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the government is much
harder on line
officers who disclose classified
information

26:27.286 --> 26:31.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to someone not authorized to
receive it than
senior officials like General
Petraeus, who

26:31.490 --> 26:36.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got a slap on the wrist for
disclosing classified
information to his mistress qua
biographer.

26:36.361 --> 26:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is clearly a double
standard at play
here, but I'm not sure it's
evident, it's

26:41.099 --> 26:43.101 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
applicable here.

26:43.135 --> 26:48.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask you
both of, finally,
do you see this as the end of
this legal pursuit?

26:48.574 --> 26:50.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you see this case as closed
right now?

26:50.409 --> 26:54.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHANNEN COFFIN: Certainly as to
classified
information. The attorney
general's decision

26:54.279 --> 26:55.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not to prosecute ends this.

26:56.014 --> 26:58.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, no other, no
further recourse?

26:58.350 --> 26:59.218 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

26:59.251 --> 27:00.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHANNEN COFFIN: No, I don't
think so.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what about
that, Stephen?

27:02.321 --> 27:06.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN VLADECK: I completely
agree. I think
the real question is Congress,
which has been

27:06.058 --> 27:10.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
urged for the better part of 60
years now
to revisit the legal regime
governing mishandling

27:10.662 --> 27:15.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of classified information, is
finally impelled
to actually look at this
carefully, or whether

27:15.267 --> 27:17.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's simply being used to score
political
points.

27:17.269 --> 27:20.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes. And I know
you were telling
us earlier today you think far
more information

27:21.006 --> 27:24.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is classified than should be,
but that's another
topic of discussion.

27:24.142 --> 27:25.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SHANNEN COFFIN: That's a
discussion for another
day. That's right.

27:26.011 --> 27:27.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It is.

27:27.913 --> 27:31.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, for now, we want to thank
you, Stephen
Vladeck from the University of
Texas Law School,

27:31.049 --> 27:36.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Shannen Coffin here in
Washington. Thank you
both.

27:36.555 --> 27:41.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEPHEN VLADECK: Thank you.

27:41.260 --> 27:44.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

27:44.396 --> 27:50.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
clean coal
facility fraught with
complications; and the

27:50.168 --> 27:54.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need for more medical studies on
marijuana.
Ukraine

27:54.306 --> 27:58.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But first to our series this
week on the conflict
in eastern Europe.

27:58.610 --> 28:03.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, we reported from the
self-declared
Donetsk People's Republic, where
Moscow-backed

28:03.749 --> 28:06.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
separatists have been fighting
to join Russia.

28:06.685 --> 28:12.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we move inside Ukraine,
where the
government face two fronts,
internal corruption

28:12.691 --> 28:15.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the separatists in the east.

28:15.227 --> 28:19.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Nick
Schifrin, with
the help of the Pulitzer Center
on Crisis

28:19.598 --> 28:23.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reporting, begins in the Black
Sea port city
of Odessa.

28:23.802 --> 28:29.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: On the streets of
Odessa, there's
a new sheriff in town and the
new squad car

28:29.474 --> 28:35.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a Prius. Their sirens wail
when they see
a routine traffic violation.

28:35.814 --> 28:37.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN (through translator): What
is that?

28:37.282 --> 28:39.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But these days,
nothing about
Ukraine is routine.

28:39.785 --> 28:41.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): What
are you doing,
brother?

28:41.253 --> 28:43.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: What are you
doing? What are
you doing?

28:43.055 --> 28:44.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN (through translator): What
is that?

28:44.156 --> 28:45.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: We're with them.
Relax.

28:45.357 --> 28:47.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
They're filming
me, not you.

28:47.192 --> 28:51.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: They really don't
like our
cameras. The police try and calm
them down.

28:51.330 --> 28:52.297 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It doesn't work.

28:52.331 --> 28:53.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN (through translator): What
is that then?

28:53.665 --> 28:55.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
They're filming
my work.

28:55.100 --> 28:57.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): So,
why are they
looking at me?

28:57.869 --> 29:02.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Odessa's been
compared to Chicago
under al Capone, full of a shady
underworld,

29:02.841 --> 29:04.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a former police force in bed
with the
mafia.

29:04.977 --> 29:07.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. OLEKSANDR HRECHANYK, Police
Officer (through
translator): The old police was
an obsolete

29:08.013 --> 29:12.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
version of law enforcement.
There were some
problems, which we're trying to
correct.

29:12.718 --> 29:17.422 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
NICK SCHIFRIN:
Twenty-nine-year-old Oleksandr
Hrechanyk and his police force
are brand-new,

29:17.456 --> 29:22.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clothed and paid for by the
West. The old
police force was so corrupt, it
was entirely

29:22.260 --> 29:24.029 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
replaced.

29:24.062 --> 29:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You look like a New York City
cop. Do you
see the New York Police
Department as a kind

29:28.333 --> 29:30.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of model for what you're doing?

29:30.168 --> 29:33.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. OLEKSANDR HRECHANYK (through
translator):
Yes, we do. What we're trying to
do is facilitate

29:33.772 --> 29:36.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
people's lives, and help
citizens as much
as we can.

29:37.009 --> 29:41.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But not all
citizens agree
or welcome the change. This man
said officers

29:41.780 --> 29:46.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
roughed him and falsely accused
him of stealing
this bicycle. Alexander
Smolianinov rushed

29:46.818 --> 29:48.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to film the cops.

29:48.854 --> 29:51.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXANDER SMOLIANINOV, Ukraine
(through translator):
We do not entirely trust the
police structure.

29:51.623 --> 29:55.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some of the old people have
remained, so the
system hasn't entirely changed.

29:55.093 --> 30:00.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But the police
accuse Smolianinov
of being part of Odessa's
decades-old mafia

30:00.165 --> 30:01.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
underworld.

30:01.933 --> 30:04.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. OLEKSANDR HRECHANYK (through
translator):
These people often perform
illegal affairs

30:04.169 --> 30:08.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in buildings and in business.
They're trying
to use this situation here to
throw their

30:08.473 --> 30:10.242 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
weight around.

30:10.275 --> 30:13.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Do you think that
there's an
element of this city that
resists the change

30:13.412 --> 30:15.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that you and your uniform
represents?

30:15.547 --> 30:19.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. OLEKSANDR HRECHANYK (through
translator):
There are people who would like
to keep the

30:19.284 --> 30:21.086 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
old system.

30:21.119 --> 30:24.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKHEIL SAAKASHVILI, Odessa
Governor: This
country had had unchanged elite
for 25 years.

30:24.489 --> 30:29.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These guys, they miserably
failed the country.
They turned it into the poorest
country in

30:29.628 --> 30:31.430 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Europe.

30:31.463 --> 30:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: That slightly
awkward trainee
with the new police is Odessa
Governor Mikheil

30:35.000 --> 30:42.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Saakashvili. One year ago, he
received Ukrainian
citizenship and was appointed to
fight corruption.

30:42.741 --> 30:46.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He made his name as the
president of the former
Soviet state Georgia, fighting
Russian President

30:46.878 --> 30:51.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vladimir Putin. Today, he is
still a thorn
in Russia's side, but his most
pointed criticism

30:51.883 --> 30:53.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is for fellow Ukrainians.

30:53.652 --> 30:57.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKHEIL SAAKASHVILI: I don't
think Putin can
defeat Ukraine. I think Ukraine
can snatch

30:57.322 --> 31:00.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
defeat out of the jaws of
victory. It can
only defeat itself.

31:00.959 --> 31:04.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Oh, what are you doing here?
Let's go inside.

31:04.763 --> 31:09.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Saakashvili likes
to give off
a laid-back vibe. He and his
family have embraced

31:09.601 --> 31:11.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their Ukrainian lives.

31:11.336 --> 31:17.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Ukraine's president hired
him to breathe
fire. He accuses the politicians
who have

31:17.042 --> 31:21.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been running the country of
widespread corruption.
Last December in a cabinet
meeting, he called

31:21.747 --> 31:23.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the interior minister a thief.

31:23.548 --> 31:26.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKHEIL SAAKASHVILI (through
translator):
I'm not going to let some thief
who the country

31:26.284 --> 31:29.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
knows is a thief...

31:29.521 --> 31:38.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: What he lacks in
diplomacy,
he makes up for with media
stunts. On a poorly

31:38.263 --> 31:42.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
built road, he set up a tent, so
he could
hold cabinet meetings that
pressure the national

31:42.534 --> 31:44.302 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government to pay for road
construction.

31:44.336 --> 31:47.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKHEIL SAAKASHVILI: Why it's so
important
to build this road? Because we
-- people have

31:47.939 --> 31:52.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not seen any difference. If you
in one place
show a difference, it's a window
of opportunity

31:52.177 --> 31:54.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that will -- is going to kill
the whole corrupt
system.

31:54.412 --> 31:56.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And what happens
if you fail?

31:56.281 --> 31:59.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKHEIL SAAKASHVILI: Ukraine has
no option
to fail, because it will lead to
the disintegration

31:59.151 --> 32:00.886 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the country.

32:00.919 --> 32:04.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YULIA MARUSHEVSKA, Ukrainian
Civil Servant:
If you have a will from the top,
then it is

32:04.856 --> 32:07.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
possible to fight the
corruption.

32:07.626 --> 32:11.530 align:left position:25%,start line:66.67% size:75%
NICK SCHIFRIN:
Twenty-six-year-old Yulia
Marushevska
is one of Saakashvili's
lieutenants. She's

32:11.563 --> 32:16.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a political novice, with
Odessa's hardest
job, cleaning up a notoriously
corrupt customs

32:16.768 --> 32:18.537 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
house.

32:18.570 --> 32:21.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YULIA MARUSHEVSKA: The Odessa
customs was
the most corrupt customs. The
intelligence

32:21.673 --> 32:25.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
forces, the police, the
prosecutors, they
were just using the possibility
to ask for

32:25.811 --> 32:27.445 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
money.

32:27.479 --> 32:30.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: So, arms of law
enforcement
were becoming tools of
corruption?

32:30.182 --> 32:31.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
YULIA MARUSHEVSKA: Yes.

32:31.149 --> 32:31.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Tools of the
corrupt society.

32:31.716 --> 32:33.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
YULIA MARUSHEVSKA: Yes.

32:33.051 --> 32:37.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am the Ukrainian, a native of
Kiev. And
I am now on Maidan.

32:37.055 --> 32:41.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Two years ago,
she and hundreds
of thousands of Ukrainians
filled Independence

32:41.793 --> 32:46.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Square, known as the Maidan, to
protest that
old, corrupt society. Her
anti-corruption

32:46.298 --> 32:49.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
call to arms was viewed almost
nine million
times.

32:49.501 --> 32:54.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YULIA MARUSHEVSKA: We want to be
free from
the politicians who work only
for themselves.

32:54.372 --> 33:03.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Maidan, I thought that
everything can be
done only with your will and
wish to change.

33:03.181 --> 33:08.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now I understood that it is
a huge work,
a huge job to do.

33:08.119 --> 33:15.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: A huge job
because of the scale
of corruption. This is Ukraine's
largest port.

33:15.060 --> 33:20.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
About $40 million per month was
being stolen
by local mafia, local officials,
and national

33:20.932 --> 33:22.167 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
politicians.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is going to be the open
customs?

33:24.135 --> 33:28.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YULIA MARUSHEVSKA: Yes, the new
attitude to
business.

33:28.106 --> 33:32.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: To try and fix
that, Marushevska
will soon inaugurate a new
customs terminal

33:32.244 --> 33:36.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with more automation and
streamlined procedures.
But when you fight corruption,
corruption

33:36.948 --> 33:38.750 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fights back.

33:38.783 --> 33:43.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
YULIA MARUSHEVSKA: The
simplification of the
procedures faced great
resistance, and even

33:43.955 --> 33:49.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
persecution from the central
government. It's
war of past and future. We want
future to

33:50.028 --> 33:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happen, and they want to live in
the past.
I think we are fighting two
wars, one war

33:55.433 --> 33:58.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
inside the country, and the
other war in the
east of the country.

33:58.270 --> 34:03.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: So, you have got
enemy forces
this way and right about that
way. So you're

34:03.375 --> 34:04.576 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fighting kind of on two sides.

34:04.609 --> 34:06.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LT. YAN FIDREA, Military
Commander: yes.

34:06.478 --> 34:09.681 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
NICK SCHIFRIN:
Twenty-two-year-old Lieutenant
Yan Fidrea is a platoon
commander in Ukraine's

34:09.714 --> 34:17.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other war, on the front lines
near Donetsk.
We are 350 miles east of Odessa.
They fight

34:17.188 --> 34:19.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in trenches against an enemy
1,500 feet away.

34:19.491 --> 34:23.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LT. YAN FIDREA (through
translator): Those
woods in front of us, they're
shooting at

34:23.528 --> 34:25.230 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
us from there.

34:25.263 --> 34:28.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Their enemy are
Ukrainians
who want to separate from
Ukraine and join

34:28.633 --> 34:30.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russia. But they don't call this
a civil war.

34:30.702 --> 34:33.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LT. YAN FIDREA (through
translator): This
is not a civil war. This is like
a war between

34:33.338 --> 34:39.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ukraine and Russia. It's my
country. I'm defending
my country.

34:39.511 --> 34:44.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Just a few miles
away, the
area known as the Industrial
Zone is the hottest

34:44.616 --> 34:49.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
front. Ukrainian soldiers hide
in a basement
from mortars.

34:49.387 --> 34:54.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
They're aiming directly
at us.

34:54.192 --> 34:58.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The next morning,
all that's
left of this former industrial
company is

34:58.363 --> 35:03.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
used as cover from bullets. This
front hasn't
moved in more than a year. And
that's left

35:03.435 --> 35:05.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
soldier Masi Nayyam frustrated.

35:05.370 --> 35:08.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MASI NAYYAM, Ukrainian Soldier
(through translator):
Our guys here are being wounded.
For what?

35:08.640 --> 35:10.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Since we're being ordered not to
advance.

35:10.408 --> 35:14.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Those orders are
from Ukraine
and Russia's political
negotiations known

35:14.179 --> 35:18.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as the Minsk Agreement. They
prevent Ukraine
from advancing, but on the
front, that lack

35:18.650 --> 35:21.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of progress perpetuates the war.

35:21.052 --> 35:25.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MASI NAYYAM (through
translator): I don't
see any strategy or planning
about what happens

35:25.657 --> 35:28.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
next. The people don't
understand what we're
doing.

35:28.393 --> 35:32.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Just a few miles
away, the
town of Avdiivka looks bombed
out. It was

35:32.597 --> 35:37.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seized by the separatists, and
then taken
back by the Ukrainian military.

35:37.068 --> 35:43.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nearby, locals try and maintain
some normalcy.
And the Dikhtyaryov family shows
their support

35:43.308 --> 35:48.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Ukraine, and desire to ally
with the West,
on the children's clothes. But
this war has

35:48.446 --> 35:52.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
taken a heavy toll on 9-year-old
Diana and
her mother, Nataliya.

35:52.450 --> 35:57.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you hear the bangs and the
noises at
night, are you scared?

35:57.155 --> 36:00.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATALIYA DIKHTYARYOV, Ukraine
Resident (through
translator): If I'm awake, I'm
scared, yes.

36:00.992 --> 36:05.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that they don't have any
future here.
I know it sounds really sad. But
the only

36:05.130 --> 36:09.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
major city around here was
Donetsk, which
had all the universities. Now
there's nowhere

36:09.367 --> 36:11.136 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to go.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: For more than two
years, this
region has been at war. Ukraine
believes it

36:13.805 --> 36:19.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has no choice. It has to fight
Russia and
corruption simultaneously. But
wars do not

36:19.911 --> 36:24.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
discriminate. They steal
soldiers and children's
futures.

36:24.149 --> 36:27.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Nick
Schifrin
in Avdiivka, Ukraine.

36:27.452 --> 36:32.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tomorrow night,
the series
continues with a report from
Estonia, the

36:32.791 --> 36:46.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NATO nation most vulnerable to
Russian aggression.

36:46.471 --> 36:52.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The technology known as clean
coal, along
with solar and wind energy, is
central to

36:52.043 --> 36:55.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Obama administration's plans
for combating
climate change.

36:55.980 --> 37:01.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a new investigation by The
New York Times
questions the ability of this
technology and

37:01.586 --> 37:05.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a high-profile coal plant to
deliver on its
promise.

37:05.890 --> 37:07.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the story.

37:07.826 --> 37:11.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The New York
Times investigation
published this week examines
problem at the

37:11.463 --> 37:15.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kemper power plant in Central
Mississippi.
The plant is still under
construction, but

37:15.600 --> 37:19.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its price tag has run billions
of dollars
over budget. It's the subject of
two federal

37:19.804 --> 37:24.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investigations and a lawsuit by
Mississippi
rate payers who say they have
been defrauded.

37:24.876 --> 37:29.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problems at Kemper also call
into question
the Obama administration's
reliance on this

37:29.114 --> 37:32.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
clean coal technology to fight
climate change.

37:32.283 --> 37:36.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New York Times investigative
reporter Ian
Urbina wrote the story about
Kemper. And he

37:36.121 --> 37:37.555 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
joins me now.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So what is clean coal?

37:39.357 --> 37:41.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IAN URBINA, The New York Times:
It's sort
of the promising notion that we
could still

37:41.960 --> 37:45.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
burn coal, but without so much
pollution.

37:45.697 --> 37:51.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And behind the promise is
technology that
would allow you in different
versions to pull

37:51.669 --> 37:55.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
carbon out of the emissions from
coal plants.

37:55.673 --> 37:58.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So that it
doesn't get up
into the atmosphere and drive
climate change?

37:58.610 --> 38:00.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
IAN URBINA: Correct.

38:00.411 --> 38:03.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And was the --
is the idea
that the technology is proven,
but we just

38:03.648 --> 38:07.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
don't know how to do it
economically? What's
the question been about it?

38:07.819 --> 38:12.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
IAN URBINA: Yes, so the
technology, as you
say, is proven, and we know how
to make it

38:12.090 --> 38:17.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work. The challenge is, can we
scale it up,
so to move it from the model
stage to big

38:17.295 --> 38:22.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
enough plants to make a
difference, and can
we do so affordably?

38:22.467 --> 38:27.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The affordably is really where
it gets complicated,
because that means can we do so
in a fashion

38:27.605 --> 38:34.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's cheaper than natural gas?
Can we do
so quickly enough so that the
prices don't

38:34.579 --> 38:39.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change and then, by the time you
get the plant
online, it's no longer the same
price tag?

38:39.684 --> 38:42.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this has been the big
stumbling block,
with Kemper included.

38:42.120 --> 38:45.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, your
reporting focuses
on this plant in Mississippi.
It's owned by

38:45.323 --> 38:48.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Southern Energy. What is it
that's gone wrong
down there?

38:48.893 --> 38:51.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IAN URBINA: A bunch of things.

38:51.462 --> 38:57.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mostly, it's way over budget and
past deadline.
There was a certain amount of
hubris, it seems,

38:57.835 --> 39:03.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on the front end of this
project, where they
promised the moon, and -- in
terms of how

39:03.975 --> 39:08.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quickly they could build a plant
of this size,
and they quickly fell behind
schedule and

39:08.947 --> 39:15.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
overbudget. And that problem got
compiled
by their competitor, which is
natural gas.

39:15.887 --> 39:20.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The price for it fell through
the floor and
just kept falling, and so this
plant became

39:20.892 --> 39:25.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
less and less attractive with
time. And then
what our investigation revealed
was that the

39:25.697 --> 39:33.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problems ran deeper inside the
plant, ranging
from mismanagement and
potentially fraud,

39:33.037 --> 39:39.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the sense that the managers
who ran the
plant were covering up problems
as they encountered

39:39.310 --> 39:43.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them and continuing to promise
things that
they couldn't provide.

39:43.181 --> 39:48.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Some of your
reporting comes
via a whistle-blower named Brett
Wingo. What

39:48.286 --> 39:50.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is it that he is alleging that
was the problem?

39:50.922 --> 39:56.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IAN URBINA: So, Brett Wingo is a
mid-level
manager who was hired by the
company back

39:56.861 --> 39:59.464 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in 2008-2009.

39:59.497 --> 40:05.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the beginning, he was sort of
a real loyal
pitch man for the project. With
time, Brett

40:05.236 --> 40:13.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
became frustrated with what he
says was mismanagement
and overstated promises on how
quickly and

40:13.511 --> 40:16.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how affordably the project could
be accomplished.

40:16.914 --> 40:23.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he attempted to work from
inside the project
in the plant to raise these
concerns, and

40:23.421 --> 40:25.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after a while, he decided to go
public.

40:25.390 --> 40:30.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Is Kemper
really emblematic
of the problems of clean coal,
or is this

40:30.194 --> 40:32.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just an isolated case?

40:32.063 --> 40:38.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IAN URBINA: Every president
going back roughly
back to Reagan has had sort of a
pet project

40:38.269 --> 40:43.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they dumped a lot of
federal subsidies
into, and sort of hoping that
they could burn

40:43.574 --> 40:50.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coal cleaner, and all of them
have turned
out to be boondoggles.

40:50.682 --> 40:55.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, this one, the jury's
still out. The
plant may still come online in
the next couple

40:55.920 --> 41:00.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of months, and, ultimately, they
could pay
down their debt and produce
cheap electricity

41:00.858 --> 41:07.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and clean electricity. But, so
far it's, again,
two years past deadline, $4
billion over budget,

41:07.365 --> 41:10.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and still not online. So it's
not looking
good.

41:10.268 --> 41:15.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What do these
problems specifically
at this plant mean for the Obama
administration

41:15.406 --> 41:19.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in their attempt to fight
climate change partly
through this type of technology?

41:19.243 --> 41:25.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
IAN URBINA: Well, so the
administration put
a lot of political Capitol into
this project.

41:25.149 --> 41:30.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The EPA administrator, the
current EPA administrator,
has pointed to this project as a
poster child

41:30.955 --> 41:38.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of what we should hope for. So,
politically,
it's embarrassing. But, just
more practically,

41:38.863 --> 41:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if we're going -- we being the
country -- are
going to achieve the goals that
were set out

41:42.834 --> 41:49.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Paris in our climate change
goals, we have
to figure out how to handle the
fact that

41:49.907 --> 41:52.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
25 percent of the world's
electricity comes
from coal plants.

41:52.610 --> 41:57.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we can't pull those offline
tomorrow. And
we have to figure out how to
make them burn

41:57.682 --> 42:02.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cleanly. And so this was the
sort of shining
hope that we might have figured
that out,

42:02.787 --> 42:04.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and it doesn't seem to be
panning out.

42:04.856 --> 42:09.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We reached out
to Southern
Company for a comment, and a
spokesperson

42:09.360 --> 42:14.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
told us that your article was a
-- quote -- "negative
recap of old news," that you
were set on creating

42:14.599 --> 42:18.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a -- quote -- "preconceived
narrative" and
that Southern Company was trying
to finish

42:18.469 --> 42:21.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this in a right way, and you
didn't address
that.

42:21.172 --> 42:24.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
With regards to the
whistle-blower, Brett
Wingo, they said that they, the
company, had

42:24.776 --> 42:29.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
done two investigations into his
claims, one
internally, one externally, and
that -- quote

42:29.914 --> 42:35.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
-- "His concerns were
unsubstantiated and
not otherwise supported by the
facts."

42:35.753 --> 42:37.688 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's your response to that?

42:37.722 --> 42:41.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IAN URBINA: So, there are two
federal investigations
under way, one of them quite
serious about

42:41.959 --> 42:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
potential corporate fraud, by
the Securities
and Exchange Commission on these
various issues.

42:48.199 --> 42:50.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's ongoing.

42:50.067 --> 42:57.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are two lawsuits, rather
large lawsuits.
The project and the company have
had two major

42:57.141 --> 43:04.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
credit downgrades. So I think
the reality
is that this is not The New York
Times raising

43:04.882 --> 43:10.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these concerns. It's more The
New York Times
attempting to figure out what
actually went

43:10.354 --> 43:12.089 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wrong.

43:12.123 --> 43:16.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everyone knows that things have
gone wrong.
Now, again, whether Southern can
pull this

43:16.727 --> 43:22.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
project out of its nosedive and
turn things
around, that remains to be seen.
But the question

43:22.300 --> 43:27.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even then still remains, will
they be able
to keep the plant online? Will
they be able

43:27.738 --> 43:33.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to capture as much carbon as
they promised?
And who's going to pay for the
$4 billion

43:33.611 --> 43:36.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
tab that's still there,
taxpayers, investors,
the company?

43:36.781 --> 43:40.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, Ian
Urbina of
The New York Times, thank you
very much.

43:40.051 --> 43:43.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
IAN URBINA: Thank you.

43:43.454 --> 43:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A big question:
What are the
benefits or drawbacks of medical
marijuana?

43:54.899 --> 43:58.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In some cases, the law is ahead
of the research.

43:58.369 --> 44:04.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Miles O'Brien explores. It's
part of our weekly
reports on the Leading Edge of
science.

44:04.475 --> 44:11.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: A sunny day, a
scooter, and
a little boy tearing up the
driveway, a simple

44:11.983 --> 44:15.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pleasure for him, a cherished
moment for his
parents.

44:15.953 --> 44:19.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LENNY LOPEZ, Father: I see him
do it, and
I said, I can't believe he's
riding a scooter

44:19.991 --> 44:25.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by himself. It's not a big deal
for most people.
That's what kids do. But for us
that's a big

44:25.463 --> 44:27.298 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
deal.

44:27.331 --> 44:32.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Lenny And Amy
Lopez's adopted
5-year-old son, Isaias, has
epilepsy Dravet's

44:32.703 --> 44:37.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
syndrome, which besets its young
victims with
incessant seizures.

44:37.108 --> 44:38.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How often would that happen?

44:38.910 --> 44:41.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LENNY LOPEZ: In the beginning,
it happened
all the time. He would have
hundreds. So...

44:41.913 --> 44:43.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY LOPEZ, Mother: And it's all
day long.

44:43.581 --> 44:46.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LENNY LOPEZ: He wouldn't be able
to play.
He wouldn't be able to eat. He
would just

44:46.217 --> 44:50.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fall. And then when he would
have like the
more severe ones, he would
literally just

44:50.788 --> 44:53.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like shut off and fall down and
smack his
head.

44:53.524 --> 45:00.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Amy and Lenny
noticed a near-instant
improvement for Isaias after
this became a

45:00.097 --> 45:09.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
part of their daily routine, a
squirt of cannabis
oil. It is mostly CBD, a
chemical in marijuana

45:09.574 --> 45:12.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that doesn't alter
consciousness.

45:12.176 --> 45:17.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Isaias' seizures have reduced in
intensity
and frequency by about 80
percent.

45:17.782 --> 45:19.617 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY LOPEZ: What about Rocky?

45:19.650 --> 45:23.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We went through a couple of
different strains,
and then just the dose, how much
do you give,

45:23.821 --> 45:26.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what time of day do you give it,
so definitely
trial and error.

45:26.824 --> 45:31.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: For all intents
and purposes,
Amy and Lenny are experimenting
with their

45:31.529 --> 45:38.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
sick little boy. It is a
calculated risk born
of desperation and fear.

45:38.970 --> 45:40.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
911 OPERATOR: Nine-one-one
recorded line.

45:40.504 --> 45:44.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LENNY LOPEZ: Hi. I'm calling
about -- my son
is having a seizure.

45:44.208 --> 45:49.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's a helpless feeling,
because, no matter
what you do, nothing seems to be
working.

45:49.714 --> 45:55.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY LOPEZ: When your child is
turning blue,
and he's not responding to you,
and you know

45:55.953 --> 46:07.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's not getting any air, like
my husband
said, you don't know if that's
-- that's it,

46:07.632 --> 46:12.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's the last one. So you just
hope and
pray that he pulls through it.

46:12.403 --> 46:17.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: They tried
conventional pharmaceuticals
designed to curb the seizures.
But the side

46:17.241 --> 46:22.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
effects were horrible. They made
him either
unresponsive, or caused him to
act out and

46:22.513 --> 46:25.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hurt himself. It wasn't a real
solution.

46:25.383 --> 46:30.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN: Our
journey begins
here in this small-town home.

46:30.121 --> 46:34.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Then, one day,
they saw the
CNN documentary "Weed." It told
the story

46:34.959 --> 46:40.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a family in Colorado using a
high CBD strain
of cannabis to treat their
daughter's Dravet's

46:40.931 --> 46:43.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
epilepsy. The marijuana was
working.

46:43.634 --> 46:46.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAIGE FIGI, Mother: She didn't
have a seizure
that day, and then she didn't
have a seizure

46:46.904 --> 46:50.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that night, and then she didn't
have one the
next day, and then the next day.

46:50.374 --> 46:52.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Was it like a
revelation?

46:52.243 --> 46:56.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY LOPEZ: Yes, I was like, we
have to get
this. I knew it wasn't legal
here at the time,

46:56.480 --> 46:58.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but we have to get this.

46:58.315 --> 47:02.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Easier said than
done. The
doctor they had at the time
would have nothing

47:02.286 --> 47:06.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of it. So they found their way
to a more sympathetic
ear.

47:06.390 --> 47:11.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DR. ELIZABETH THIELE,
Massachusetts General
Hospital: For the past three
years, I don't

47:11.529 --> 47:17.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think there's been a single
patient I have
seen that hasn't asked about CBD
or medical

47:17.068 --> 47:19.003 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
marijuana.

47:19.036 --> 47:23.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Dr. Elizabeth
Thiele is director
of the pediatric epilepsy
program at Massachusetts

47:23.107 --> 47:24.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
General Hospital.

47:24.875 --> 47:26.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. ELIZABETH THIELE: When this
first came
up, I think that there were a
lot of -- I

47:26.844 --> 47:33.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sometimes use the word haters,
as the medical
profession, I think, wasn't
necessarily welcoming

47:33.217 --> 47:35.052 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this at first.

47:35.086 --> 47:38.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But Dr. Thiele
shared in the
Lopezes' frustration, even
though the number

47:38.456 --> 47:43.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of conventional medications
aimed at treating
epilepsy has more than doubled
in the past

47:43.594 --> 47:45.329 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
few decades.

47:45.362 --> 47:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. ELIZABETH THIELE: Most
children with Dravet
don't respond to the medications
we have.

47:49.366 --> 47:53.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there continues to be a
significant unmet
need for epilepsy therapies.

47:53.070 --> 47:57.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: While there is
plenty of anecdotal
evidence that cannabis helps
children with

47:57.708 --> 48:03.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dravet's, the Drug Enforcement
Administration
classifies marijuana among the
most dangerous

48:03.714 --> 48:07.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
drugs, a Schedule 1 controlled
substance.

48:07.251 --> 48:12.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As far as the federal government
is concerned,
cannabis has no currently
accepted medical

48:12.256 --> 48:19.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
use and a high potential for
abuse. As a result,
scientists have trouble
accessing the drug

48:19.130 --> 48:24.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
legally to do the research, and
so we know
precious little about the
medicinal value

48:24.168 --> 48:29.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of marijuana to treat epilepsy,
or anything
else.

48:29.440 --> 48:35.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's starting to change. The
British pharmaceutical
company GW is testing a version
of cannabis

48:35.412 --> 48:41.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
oil called Epidiolex. Designed
for children
with seizure disorders, it is
nearly pure

48:41.685 --> 48:48.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CBD. It's early, but the results
are promising.
If they can be repeated in
larger studies,

48:48.392 --> 48:52.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dr. Thiele says it could be a
breakthrough.

48:52.263 --> 48:57.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For now, she can't even be sure
precisely
what is in the cannabis her
patients are taking.

48:57.434 --> 49:00.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. ELIZABETH THIELE: Sometimes,
the batch
will be effective, will make the
seizures

49:00.838 --> 49:04.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
better. Sometimes, the next
month, it will
be worse, the seizures will get
worse. So,

49:04.608 --> 49:08.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I don't feel comfortable
prescribing something
that I don't understand better
than that.

49:08.946 --> 49:12.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NORTON ARBELAEZ, Consultant, New
England Treatment
Access: To grow the
pharmaceutical-grade cannabis

49:12.716 --> 49:15.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we're growing, it takes
quite a bit of
effort.

49:15.085 --> 49:20.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Norton Arbelaez
is on a mission
to change this. He is a
consultant for New

49:20.257 --> 49:26.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
England Treatment Access in
Massachusetts,
one of 25 states and the
District of Columbia

49:26.397 --> 49:30.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that have voted to make
medicinal marijuana
legal.

49:30.067 --> 49:34.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He gave me a tour of NETA's
cultivation and
manufacturing facility, where
they grow about

49:34.772 --> 49:41.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
60 distinct strains of
marijuana. At any given
time, there are 14,000 plants
here at various

49:41.812 --> 49:47.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stages of development. They work
hard to maintain
precise, consistent conditions.

49:47.451 --> 49:53.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NORTON ARBELAEZ: So, these are
clones. Initially,
we grew it from seed.

49:53.991 --> 49:56.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: What's the
advantage of cloning,
as opposed to planting seeds?

49:56.760 --> 50:00.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NORTON ARBELAEZ: Well, that we
have control
of the genetic stock. The
patients are looking

50:00.898 --> 50:06.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a very specific strain to
deal with a
very specific type of illness,
so we want

50:06.070 --> 50:09.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be able to reproduce that
each and every
time.

50:09.173 --> 50:14.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Strains are
identified by color.
And every bar coded batch is
tested by a third

50:14.645 --> 50:17.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
party before it is sold to
patients.

50:17.948 --> 50:25.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But analyzing batches of
marijuana for a handful
of chemicals only scratches the
surface. A

50:25.189 --> 50:29.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Massachusetts-based genomic
testing firm,
Courtagen Life Sciences, is
trying to learn

50:29.727 --> 50:32.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the genetic makeup of various
strains of marijuana.

50:32.463 --> 50:36.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN MCKERNAN, Courtagen Life
Sciences: What
we do down here in the
laboratory is run some

50:36.300 --> 50:41.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
robotics that then go into the
genome and
extract the regions that we want
to sequence.

50:41.272 --> 50:46.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Kevin McKernan is
the chief
scientific officer. He hopes to
inject some

50:46.410 --> 50:48.779 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
objective science into the
conversation.

50:48.812 --> 50:52.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN MCKERNAN: It's about as
scientific as
a wine, oaky, woody, earthy. And
if we want

50:53.017 --> 50:56.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
medicine to absorb this, we need
to start
talking about the cannabis in
the language

50:56.186 --> 51:00.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that physicians like, which is
about genotypes,
not woody, earthy, oaky smells.

51:00.491 --> 51:04.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: They have
sequenced 600 strains
of marijuana so far.

51:04.595 --> 51:06.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But what are we seeing here?

51:06.330 --> 51:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN MCKERNAN: So what you're
looking at
is the genetic distance between
different

51:09.767 --> 51:16.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cannabis strains and the length
of this line.
If you follow this in and out is
the length

51:16.240 --> 51:21.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the genetic distance between
these. And
then each of these names are the
names of

51:21.078 --> 51:22.813 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the strains.

51:22.846 --> 51:27.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: After all these
years, this
familiar plant remains a
mystery. Marijuana

51:27.418 --> 51:32.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
contains more than 400
chemicals, including
80 cannabinoids.

51:32.923 --> 51:37.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scientists are not sure how they
may interact
with each other to provide some
medicinal

51:37.561 --> 51:42.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
benefit. They are trying to
understand if
isolating the compounds works,
or if there

51:42.433 --> 51:45.069 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is a so-called entourage effect.

51:45.102 --> 51:48.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN MCKERNAN: I think it's
this entourage
effect, that the other compounds
that are

51:48.572 --> 51:52.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there in the whole plant extract
are doing
something we don't understand
yet. There's

51:52.843 --> 51:57.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something about isolating the
compounds that
seems to not replicate what the
plant does

51:57.848 --> 51:59.717 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on its own.

51:59.750 --> 52:03.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The real answers
won't be forthcoming
unless research dollars flow and
more human

52:03.887 --> 52:08.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trials begin. But that won't
happen until
the federal government
reconsiders whether

52:08.993 --> 52:14.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
marijuana appropriately belongs
in the same
category as heroin.

52:14.732 --> 52:19.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention
says there has never been a
documented overdose

52:19.670 --> 52:21.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
death from marijuana.

52:21.872 --> 52:26.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Amy and Lenny Lopez see much
more benefit
than risk.

52:26.643 --> 52:27.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY LOPEZ: He makes us...

52:27.945 --> 52:28.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LENNY LOPEZ: It's definitely
worth it.

52:28.912 --> 52:29.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY LOPEZ: He makes my blood
flow.

52:30.014 --> 52:31.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LENNY LOPEZ: Yes.

52:31.382 --> 52:34.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY LOPEZ: That kid make me
breathe. I would
do anything for him.

52:34.451 --> 52:38.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The proof is in
the scooter.

Miles O'Brien, the "PBS
NewsHour," Lowell,
Massachusetts.

52:42.059 --> 52:47.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The DEA has been
evaluating
proposals to loosen the
classification of

52:47.965 --> 52:53.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cannabis, which would make it
easier for scientists
and doctors to do research. But
the agency

52:53.303 --> 52:58.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
missed its own July deadline,
and it is not
clear when there will be a
decision.

52:58.675 --> 53:03.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In his next piece, Miles will
speak with the
Israeli chemist whose pioneering
work into

53:03.781 --> 53:10.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
medical cannabis 30 years ago is
now being
embraced by the scientific
mainstream.

53:10.888 --> 53:12.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:12.823 --> 53:14.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:14.691 --> 53:19.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening. For all of us at the
"PBS NewsHour,"

53:19.396 --> 53:24.935 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.

53:24.935 --> 53:29.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.
