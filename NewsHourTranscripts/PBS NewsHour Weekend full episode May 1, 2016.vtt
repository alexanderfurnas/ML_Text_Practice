>> IT SEEMS LIKE IT HAS.

02:54.533 --> 02:57.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW IT WAS JUST LAST WEEK

SUSPENDING HIS INDIANA CAMPAIGN.

03:01.733 --> 03:04.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THEN JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS

03:04.400 --> 03:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

VOTERS WANT TO VOTE FOR HIM

03:08.533 --> 03:10.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE MORE THAN WELCOME TO

VOTE FOR HIM AND TED CRUZ SAID

03:13.000 --> 03:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S NO ALLIANCE BETWEEN HIM

03:14.633 --> 03:15.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND KASICH.

03:15.467 --> 03:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE SEEMS TO BE A BIT OF A

03:18.200 --> 03:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BACKLASH FROM THE ALLIANCE THAT

03:19.033 --> 03:20.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK.

03:20.467 --> 03:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE SAID IT MADE CRUZ LOOK

03:23.033 --> 03:24.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRETTY DESPERATE AND IT SEEMS

03:24.667 --> 03:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE HE WANTED TO BACK AWAY FROM

03:26.600 --> 03:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT AND THERE WASN'T AN

03:28.533 --> 03:31.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLIANCE AND HE WAS TRYING TO

03:31.167 --> 03:32.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WIN INDIANA ON HIS OWN.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ENDORSEMENTS BEEN?

03:36.033 --> 03:37.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT'S HARD TO SAY.

03:37.867 --> 03:42.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBVIOUSLY THE ARE ENDORSEMENT OF

03:42.467 --> 03:45.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE, HE SAID HE

03:45.567 --> 03:48.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD BE VOTING FOR CRUZ.

03:48.567 --> 03:53.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S HARD TO SEE THE ENDORSEMENT

03:53.300 --> 03:58.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF PENCE, WHETHER VOTING FOR

03:58.900 --> 03:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP OR CRUZ ALREADY.

03:59.933 --> 04:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THIS RACE IS PRETTY MUCH A

04:11.633 --> 04:11.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOSSUP.

04:11.967 --> 04:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK IF VOTER TURNOUT IS

04:15.533 --> 04:19.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRETTY BIG ON TUESDAY, SANDERS

HAS A CHANCE TO WIN, BUT IT

04:22.733 --> 04:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEMS MORE AND MORE LIKELY THAT

04:24.333 --> 04:26.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO LOCK

04:26.867 --> 04:28.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

LAWYERS THAT REPRESENT THEM,

16:33.367 --> 16:34.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY

BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE DANGEROUS

16:36.533 --> 16:38.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

16:42.033 --> 16:43.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND LOOK, IT'S BASIC TO OUR

16:43.467 --> 16:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

16:44.733 --> 16:46.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
