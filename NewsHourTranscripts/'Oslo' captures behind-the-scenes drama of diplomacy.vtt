JUDY WOODRUFF: The Tony Awards
are this Sunday, and one of the
Broadway shows nominated for

00:04.866 --> 00:06.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
best play is "Oslo."

00:06.833 --> 00:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a drama that takes a deeper
look at what went into the
historical Middle East peace

00:12.833 --> 00:14.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
accords and their
relevance today.

00:14.700 --> 00:17.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has the
story from New York.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: The world
saw this, the historic
1993 handshake between
Israeli Prime Minister

00:24.100 --> 00:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yitzhak Rabin and PLO leader
Yasser Arafat, brought together
at the White House by President

00:30.233 --> 00:31.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Bill Clinton.

00:31.600 --> 00:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What we didn't see was this:

00:33.600 --> 00:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: You will achieve nothing
because your negotiating
model is fundamentally flawed.

00:37.300 --> 00:42.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: The nine
months behind-the-scenes
secret negotiations
that led up to the Oslo

00:43.900 --> 00:45.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
accords.

00:45.400 --> 00:47.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: This is our chance
to make a difference.

00:47.466 --> 00:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In the play
"Oslo," playwright J.T. Rogers
has taken real people and events

00:53.933 --> 00:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and, with dramatic license,
imagined his way into history.

00:56.900 --> 00:59.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
J.T.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROGERS, Playwright,
"Oslo": Sneaking into
the royal households in
Norway, the Palestine

01:00.966 --> 01:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Liberation Organization
illegally meeting with Israelis,
drinking together, talking

01:04.600 --> 01:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about their children in the
middle of winter, and you think,
as a storyteller, that's manna

01:10.200 --> 01:12.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from heaven.

01:12.233 --> 01:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTRESS: A million Palestinians,
most of them without regular
electricity or water, crammed

01:15.200 --> 01:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into an area 25 miles long,
but only a few miles wide.

01:19.233 --> 01:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Roger's way in
was through the little-known
behind-the-scenes role of

01:23.133 --> 01:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Norwegian couple,
social scientist Terje
Rod-Larsen played by
Jefferson Mays, and diplomat

01:29.300 --> 01:31.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mona Juul played
by Jennifer Ehle.

01:31.966 --> 01:36.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They served as facilitators in
a series of high-stakes, highly
secret talks between Israelis

01:37.700 --> 01:39.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Palestinians.

01:39.200 --> 01:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTRESS: There, in that
moment, for us, it began.

01:42.933 --> 01:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The real Mona
Juul is now Norway's ambassador
to the United Kingdom.

01:49.966 --> 01:52.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Her husband, the real
Terje Rod-Larsen, now
heads the International
Peace Institute and

01:54.400 --> 01:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
continues to work on various
crises around the world.

01:57.200 --> 02:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He joined us in New York on
stage recently at Lincoln Center
Theater, where Oslo is being

02:02.800 --> 02:04.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
performed.

02:04.900 --> 02:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TERJE ROD-LARSEN, International
Peace Institute: Just a handful
of people knew about what was

02:06.400 --> 02:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happening on the Palestinian,
Israeli and the Norwegian side.

02:08.533 --> 02:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think most people had the
impression at the time that
this was something which was

02:12.200 --> 02:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very quickly concocted in the
White House, and not something
which was created laboriously,

02:18.366 --> 02:21.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
seven days a week, 24
hours over nine months.

02:21.533 --> 02:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Does it capture
the art of negotiating and
of your role pulling together

02:27.600 --> 02:29.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the negotiations?

02:29.733 --> 02:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TERJE ROD-LARSEN: Yes, I think
it does, actually, because we
defined very strictly our role

02:35.500 --> 02:39.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be the facilitator of the
talks and the go-between between
the parties, and basically

02:40.733 --> 02:42.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
telling the parties,
it's your problems.

02:42.866 --> 02:44.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have to find
a solution to it.

02:44.666 --> 02:45.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not our job.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's your job.

02:47.933 --> 02:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We watch the
face-off between Ahmed Qurei and
Uri Savir, the top Palestinian

02:54.100 --> 02:57.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and Israeli negotiators,
played by Anthony Azizi
and Michael Aronov.

02:57.333 --> 03:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: In my country, we see
you as terrorists and murderers
who wish to drive us into the

03:06.600 --> 03:08.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sea.

03:08.733 --> 03:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: In my country, we see
you as a savage nation whose
army shoots our children for

03:15.633 --> 03:17.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sport!

03:17.733 --> 03:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Over time,
the two slowly get to know
and respect one another.

03:21.400 --> 03:24.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ACTOR: Thank you.

03:24.533 --> 03:26.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I admire your passion.

03:26.766 --> 03:31.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The so-called
Oslo accords agreed to by
the real negotiators included

03:33.666 --> 03:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the first formal mutual
recognition between Israel and
the PLO, and set the guidelines

03:39.066 --> 03:43.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of what to this day is referred
to as the peace process.

03:45.433 --> 03:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the play, the two Norwegians,
their actions at times secret
even from their own government,

03:49.133 --> 03:51.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
keep the talks going.

03:51.200 --> 03:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And under director Bartlett
Sher, the actors literally keep
the play moving along, 60 scenes

03:56.566 --> 03:59.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
through several cities
all on one stage set.

03:59.233 --> 04:02.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFERSON MAYS, Actor:
Welcome to backstage
at the Vivian Beaumont.

04:02.033 --> 04:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I spoke to
Jefferson Mays and Jennifer Ehle
before a recent performance.

04:06.400 --> 04:11.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFERSON MAYS: Terje Rod-Larsen
came in to speak to the company
about the double, sometimes

04:13.200 --> 04:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
triple game of diplomacy.

04:15.966 --> 04:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when he was talking
about it, it struck me
as being very theatrical.

04:21.833 --> 04:23.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the diplomats are as much...

04:23.366 --> 04:24.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Really, not
far from what you do, huh?

04:24.566 --> 04:25.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERJE ROD-LARSEN: No, no.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There were diplomats.

04:27.733 --> 04:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A good diplomat is, I think,
very much like a good actor,
in that extremely sensitivity

04:33.933 --> 04:38.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the other people in the
room, and is called upon to
play-act at certain points.

04:40.566 --> 04:43.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JENNIFER EHLE, Actress: It has
an element of a spy thriller.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think people come in sometimes
thinking, I don't know what
I'm going to see, three

04:46.133 --> 04:49.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hours of a historical
political drama.

04:49.600 --> 04:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And -- but it's got a sort of
binge-watch sort of hook that
gets in you, and you really

04:55.333 --> 04:57.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just want to keep going.

04:57.400 --> 05:01.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFERSON MAYS: You said
every character in this
play speaks their subtext.

05:01.900 --> 05:03.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There is no subtext.

05:03.066 --> 05:03.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JENNIFER EHLE:
There is no subtext.

05:03.866 --> 05:05.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is about ideas.

05:05.933 --> 05:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's about facts and it's
about narrative, an incredible
narrative drive, when you have

05:11.200 --> 05:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
characters who are only
saying exactly what they mean.

05:13.066 --> 05:16.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFERSON MAYS: I will
tell you a secret.

05:16.366 --> 05:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was nervous at first to meet
those two, first members of
the PLO I had ever been face

05:23.900 --> 05:25.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to face with.

05:25.066 --> 05:26.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're not the demons
I was expecting.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: An agreement and
great hope, but it didn't last.

05:28.566 --> 05:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The following years brought
more suffering, death and enmity
that continue to this day.

05:35.033 --> 05:38.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But Terje Rod-Larsen,
the ever-optimistic
peace negotiator, says
the Oslo accords did

05:40.800 --> 05:43.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a lasting impact,
including the establishment
of the Palestinian
Authority, a peace between

05:45.133 --> 05:47.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Israel and Jordan that
has held, and more.

05:47.333 --> 05:51.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TERJE ROD-LARSEN: What we are
seeing today is difficult, but
without these institutions,

05:51.166 --> 05:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it would have been gangland
and complete chaos today.

05:54.500 --> 05:58.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So it has benefited
Palestinian and Israelis alike.

05:58.366 --> 06:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When President Trump visited
the Palestinians, he visited
the Palestinian president, which

06:02.500 --> 06:04.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
springs out of the Oslo accords.

06:04.566 --> 06:09.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If he brings the parties
together again, a
premise for any talk has
to be the only signed

06:10.766 --> 06:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agreements which are there,
which are the Oslo accords.

06:12.933 --> 06:17.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: As for
"Oslo" the play taking
on such world-shaking
history, playwright

06:18.433 --> 06:20.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
J.T. Rogers cited a
pretty good precedent.

06:20.433 --> 06:22.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
J.T.

06:22.533 --> 06:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROGERS: Shakespeare's plays
are entertaining and bawdy and
sexy and politics and life and

06:25.300 --> 06:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
death, and he's pretty good.

06:27.033 --> 06:28.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

06:28.033 --> 06:30.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
J.T.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROGERS: I think that -- I think
it's odd to me that current
events or larger political

06:36.066 --> 06:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things are not approached more
in the American theater, only
because it's such great red

06:39.433 --> 06:44.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
meat for us; 1,200 people a
night sit here like around a
campfire and hear the same story

06:45.600 --> 06:47.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and ask themselves
the same questions.

06:47.566 --> 06:51.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's -- only the
theater can do that, no TV,
no Netflix, only the theater.

06:53.366 --> 06:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: During the demonstration
in support of the Oslo
accords, Prime Minister Yitzhak

06:59.566 --> 07:01.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Rabin is assassinated.

07:01.633 --> 07:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Oslo" received
seven Tony nominations in
all, including for its two

07:07.266 --> 07:09.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lead actors and as
the year's best play.

07:09.500 --> 07:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jeffrey Brown at Lincoln
Center Theater in New York.
