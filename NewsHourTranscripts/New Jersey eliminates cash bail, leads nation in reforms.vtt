HE DIDN'T COMMIT.

07:43.596 --> 07:44.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE NEW "NO BAIL" SYSTEM HAS

07:44.897 --> 07:46.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOCAL OPPONENTS.

07:46.332 --> 07:47.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BAIL BONDSMEN SAY IT'S PUTTING

07:47.867 --> 07:49.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ON RELEASE.

08:03.382 --> 08:06.118 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I'VE NOT HEARD ONE CHIEF SAY

08:06.118 --> 08:07.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYTHING POSITIVE ABOUT THIS

08:07.353 --> 08:08.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BAIL REFORM.

08:12.558 --> 08:14.994 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT TREATS OFFENDERS AS IF

08:14.994 --> 08:16.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WERE VICTIMS.

08:16.629 --> 08:17.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY HAVE NO CONCERN FOR THE

08:17.663 --> 08:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VICTIMS THAT WE ARE SWORN TO

08:19.866 --> 08:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTECT AND SERVE.

08:21.133 --> 08:22.068 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SUSPECTS THEY ARREST BACK OUT ON

08:25.371 --> 08:26.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE STREETS SO SOON.

08:26.873 --> 08:28.341 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT'S A SHAME THAT WE WASTE

08:28.341 --> 08:29.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIME ARRESTING PEOPLE OVER AND

08:29.842 --> 08:31.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVER AGAIN, AND THEY KEEP ON

08:31.677 --> 08:32.645 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELEASING THEM.

08:32.645 --> 08:34.080 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, OUR OFFICERS FEEL LIKE

08:34.080 --> 08:36.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S A SLAP IN THE FACE BECAUSE

08:36.148 --> 08:37.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE WORKING HARD TO DO A

08:37.483 --> 08:39.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOOD CASE, WHETHER IT BE DRUGS,

08:39.819 --> 08:41.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR CAR BURGLARIES, OR WHATEVER.

08:41.754 --> 08:42.588 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY GET DOWN THERE, AND THEY

08:42.588 --> 08:43.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GET RELEASED.

08:43.789 --> 08:44.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEN, THEY'RE OUT PROBABLY DOING

08:44.724 --> 08:45.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT AGAIN.

08:45.491 --> 08:46.125 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: UNDER THE OLD

SYSTEM, THAT PERSON COULD'VE

08:47.894 --> 08:49.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POSTED BAIL AND ALSO BEEN

08:49.428 --> 08:50.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELEASED, RIGHT?

08:50.296 --> 08:52.031 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YEAH, BUT IF HE WAS RELEASED

08:52.031 --> 08:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND RE-ARRESTED, THE BAIL THAT

08:54.600 --> 08:55.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WAS RELEASED ON WOULD BE

08:55.835 --> 08:56.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REVOKED.

08:56.969 --> 08:58.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THERE'S A MONETARY PENALTY

08:58.638 --> 08:59.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

08:59.672 --> 09:00.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, THEY DON'T HAVE TO POST

09:00.506 --> 09:01.173 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYTHING.

09:01.173 --> 09:01.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DON'T HAVE TO SECURE

09:01.941 --> 09:02.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYTHING.

09:02.642 --> 09:04.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY JUST WALK FREE.

COMMITTING CRIMES, LIKE THE CASE

09:08.214 --> 09:09.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF A RELEASED MAN WHO ALLEGEDLY

09:09.849 --> 09:11.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MURDERED HIS GIRLFRIEND BEFORE

09:11.717 --> 09:13.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMITTING SUICIDE.

09:13.052 --> 09:14.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE STATE HAS NO DATA YET ON HOW

09:14.820 --> 09:15.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANY PEOPLE HAVE COMMITTED

09:15.888 --> 09:18.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRIMES WHILE OUT BEFORE TRIAL.

09:18.491 --> 09:19.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES OF

09:19.458 --> 09:21.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE WHO'VE GOTTEN OUT UNDER A

09:21.827 --> 09:23.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BAIL REFORM AND COMMITTED SOME

09:23.396 --> 09:25.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY SERIOUS CRIMES.

09:25.131 --> 09:25.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

09:26.399 --> 09:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUBLIC SAFETY?

09:27.266 --> 09:29.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE ANSWER IS: NO MORE THAN

09:29.635 --> 09:35.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MONETARY BAIL BECAUSE, ONE,

09:35.041 --> 09:36.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE MONITORING THESE FOLKS.

09:36.475 --> 09:37.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WE HOPE THAT THE PUBLIC,

09:37.677 --> 09:38.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONCE THEY START TO UNDERSTAND

09:38.511 --> 09:41.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT, WILL, YOU KNOW, APPROVE OF

09:41.847 --> 09:43.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT AND BECOME ACCEPTING OF IT.

09:43.883 --> 09:46.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE DID NOT INSTITUTE CRIMINAL

09:46.619 --> 09:48.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUSTICE REFORM TO PUT BAIL

09:48.754 --> 09:50.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BONDSMEN OUT OF BUSINESS AND TO

09:50.690 --> 09:51.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLEAR OUT THE JAILS.

09:51.891 --> 09:53.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS TO RESPECT THE

09:53.392 --> 09:55.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE, TO

09:55.795 --> 09:57.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DESIGN, YOU KNOW, A SYSTEM THAT

09:57.797 --> 09:58.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS FAIR AND HONEST.
