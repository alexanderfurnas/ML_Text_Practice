Judy Woodruff.

00:06.039 --> 00:07.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:07.741 --> 00:11.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
the biggest test yet in the
Midwest for both

00:11.578 --> 00:17.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican and Democratic
candidates, as voters
in Michigan, along with three
other states,

00:17.351 --> 00:19.119 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
decide.

00:19.152 --> 00:23.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead this
Tuesday: Vice
President Joe Biden tries to
mend relations

00:23.223 --> 00:28.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Israel, one day after Prime
Minister
Netanyahu canceled his trip to
the U.S.

00:28.862 --> 00:34.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus, a look at
what Washington
politicians could learn from
smaller cities,

00:34.501 --> 00:40.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and why communities in the
so-called flyover
states shouldn't be so easily
dismissed.

00:40.140 --> 00:44.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBORAH FALLOWS, "The Atlantic":
When we touched
down in some of these small
communities, you

00:44.311 --> 00:48.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would think, how can all this be
going on
here, and we never knew about
any of it?

00:49.016 --> 00:55.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:55.923 --> 00:58.258 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:58.292 --> 01:09.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Four more states
are having
their say today in the
presidential race of

01:09.903 --> 01:14.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2016. Front-runners in both
parties, Donald
Trump and Hillary Clinton, are
working to

01:14.675 --> 01:21.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pad their delegate leads, while
rivals try
to gain a little ground or at
least hang on.

01:21.315 --> 01:25.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michigan is the day's main
attraction, and
we will hear from a reporter on
the scene

01:25.252 --> 01:27.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after the news summary.

01:27.187 --> 01:32.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the day's other
news: An American
tourist was killed and a dozen
Israelis wounded

01:32.259 --> 01:38.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a fresh wave of Palestinian
attacks. The
tourist, identified as a
Vanderbilt University

01:38.365 --> 01:43.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
student, died in Jaffa, where an
assailant
stabbed seven people, before
being killed

01:43.804 --> 01:45.572 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by police.

01:45.605 --> 01:50.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another Palestinian shot and
wounded several
people in Jerusalem. He, too,
was killed,

01:50.544 --> 01:54.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
along with two others involved
in stabbing
incidents. We will take a closer
look at the

01:54.748 --> 01:57.951 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Israeli-Palestinian divide later
in the program.

01:57.985 --> 02:03.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Iran's hard-line
Revolutionary
Guard has test-fired another
round of ballistic

02:03.657 --> 02:07.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
missiles, challenging the United
Nations and
the United States.

02:07.761 --> 02:13.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iranian state TV today showed a
medium-range
missile being launched
overnight. It said

02:13.500 --> 02:19.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
several others were fired in
recent days.
U.S. officials said that could
violate a U.N.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.241 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
prohibition.

02:21.274 --> 02:23.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
There's at least one specific
United Nations

02:23.110 --> 02:29.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Security Council resolution that
could apply
here, and the truth is, we're
still reviewing

02:29.883 --> 02:38.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Iranian launch to assess
whether it is
necessary for this matter to be
raised before

02:38.525 --> 02:40.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the United Nations Security
Council.

02:40.360 --> 02:44.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.N.
resolution warns against
launching anything that can
carry a nuclear

02:44.865 --> 02:51.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
warhead. In addition, the U.S.
announced sanctions
earlier this year after Iran
launched a long-range

02:51.038 --> 02:52.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
missile last fall.

02:52.839 --> 02:57.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: South Korea today
imposed new
penalties on North Korea for
recent nuclear

02:57.511 --> 03:03.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and missile tests. The sanctions
ban financial
dealings with 40 individuals and
30 organizations

03:03.950 --> 03:07.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with suspected links to the
North's weapons
program.

03:07.454 --> 03:13.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Seoul, a top official also
announced new
rules designed to cut off
traffic by sea.

03:13.260 --> 03:16.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEE SUK-JOON, South Korean
Minister of Government
Policy Coordination (through
translator):

03:16.396 --> 03:21.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will strengthen sanctions on
shipping related
to North Korea. We will entirely
ban foreign

03:21.068 --> 03:25.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vessels that are stopped in a
North Korean
port within 180 days and we will
also continue

03:25.839 --> 03:30.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the measures prohibiting the
vessels of third
countries from sailing the sea
route between

03:30.143 --> 03:31.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
South and North Korea.

03:31.812 --> 03:37.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: In a related
development, South
Korea's spy agency accused North
Korea of

03:37.117 --> 03:41.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hacking the cell phones of
dozens of top South
Korean officials.

03:41.288 --> 03:46.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Somalia, the
Islamist group
Al-Shabaab confirms the U.S.
bombed one of

03:46.660 --> 03:53.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its camps on Saturday, but it
disputes claims
that the strike killed 150
fighters. American

03:53.867 --> 03:59.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officials say the coordinated
drone and manned
aircraft attacks hit a training
site 120 miles

03:59.840 --> 04:05.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
north of Mogadishu. The Pentagon
says it was
aimed at preventing a
large-scale attack by

04:05.445 --> 04:07.314 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the militants.

04:07.347 --> 04:11.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The European Union
moved closer
today to a deal to reverse the
exodus of migrants

04:11.885 --> 04:17.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Turkey. In return, the
Turks would get
well over $6.5 billion in aid,
among other

04:17.491 --> 04:19.259 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
things.

04:19.292 --> 04:22.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jonathan Rugman of Independent
Television
News reports from Greece, where
growing numbers

04:22.429 --> 04:24.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of migrants are stranded.

04:24.231 --> 04:31.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN RUGMAN: There are now
around 14,000
people living like this in
Idomeni, and yet

04:31.071 --> 04:36.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Greek authorities are
predicting even
more will now rush to join them
before any

04:36.309 --> 04:42.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deal sealed with Turkey at the
end of next
week seals them out of Europe as
well.

04:42.682 --> 04:49.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over 700 migrants came ashore on
Greek islands
this morning alone. These
arrived on Lesbos,

04:49.956 --> 04:57.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with many more on the way,
adding to the 37,000
already in Greece. So it's no
wonder Turkey's

04:57.330 --> 05:02.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
offer to take them all back
comes with strings
attached, chiefly, that one
Syrian should

05:02.869 --> 05:07.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be granted asylum in Europe for
every Syrian
returned across this water.

05:07.541 --> 05:13.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AHMET DAVUTOGLU, Turkish Prime
Minister: I
want to make it clear, we are
demanding fair

05:13.380 --> 05:16.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
burden-sharing for Syrian
refugees.

05:16.917 --> 05:22.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN RUGMAN: Then there are
the unwritten
demands. At least one person was
killed today

05:22.756 --> 05:30.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by rockets fired into Turkey
from Syria, possibly
by so-called Islamic State.

05:30.864 --> 05:37.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Turkey expects not just
sympathy, but support,
above all in battling Kurdish
militancy along

05:37.270 --> 05:42.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this border. Human rights groups
will bridle
at that.

05:42.209 --> 05:42.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where are you from?

05:42.842 --> 05:44.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRAVELERS: Afghanistan.

05:44.678 --> 05:48.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN RUGMAN: And they're
already bridling
at the prospect of people like
these Afghans

05:48.248 --> 05:54.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we encountered in Lesbos
yesterday being forcibly
returned, because their legal
rights to shelter

05:54.554 --> 05:56.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are so few on the Turkish side.

05:56.556 --> 05:58.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VINCENT COCHETEL, United Nations
High Commissioner
for Human Rights: An agreement
that would

05:58.491 --> 06:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be tantamount to a blanket
return of any foreigners
to a certain country is not
consistent with

06:06.600 --> 06:12.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
European law, is not consistent
with international
law. Now, we need to see what
would be the

06:12.272 --> 06:14.040 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
safeguards.

06:14.074 --> 06:17.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN RUGMAN: These migrants
apparently
set to become part of the
biggest expulsion

06:17.677 --> 06:21.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of people since Greece and
Turkey were at
war.

06:21.448 --> 06:26.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: More than one
million people have
flooded into the E.U. since
early last year,

06:26.820 --> 06:28.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
mainly by way of Turkey.

06:28.688 --> 06:34.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Several major
corporate sponsors
cut or suspended ties today with
tennis star

06:34.427 --> 06:40.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maria Sharapova. The five-time
Grand Slam
winner admitted Monday that she
tested positive

06:41.001 --> 06:47.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a newly banned drug at the
Australian
Open. The drug, meldonium, can
improve endurance.

06:47.974 --> 06:52.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sharapova says she's used it
periodically
over the past 10 years for
various medical

06:53.013 --> 06:54.781 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
problems.

06:54.814 --> 06:58.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And Wall Street gave
ground after
China announced its exports fell
in February

06:58.752 --> 07:04.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the most in more than six
years. The Dow
Jones industrial average lost
nearly 110 points

07:04.924 --> 07:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to close at 16964. The Nasdaq
fell 59 points,
and the S&amp;P 500 slipped 22.

07:12.899 --> 07:17.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
how Michigan's
election affects the future of
the presidential

07:17.103 --> 07:23.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
race; a renewed effort for peace
in Israel;
the launch of the new SAT test;
a journalist's

07:23.843 --> 07:33.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take on what motivates Americans
to jihad;
and much more.

07:33.887 --> 07:40.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take on what motivates Americans
to jihad;
and much more.

07:40.927 --> 07:42.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And now to politics.

07:42.696 --> 07:47.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Four states are holding contests
today, both
parties in Mississippi and
Michigan, plus

07:47.367 --> 07:50.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republican races in Idaho and
Hawaii.

07:50.270 --> 07:55.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On the campaign trail,
Republican John Kasich
was in Michigan, drumming up
support for today's

07:55.942 --> 08:00.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
primaries, while others, like
Ted Cruz, turned
their attention to states voting
next week.

08:00.780 --> 08:03.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate:
You know the whole country is
watching Michigan

08:03.683 --> 08:05.652 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now. The whole country is.

08:05.685 --> 08:07.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

08:07.554 --> 08:14.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. JOHN KASICH: And what
they're wondering,
what they're wondering, is a guy
who has labored

08:14.761 --> 08:22.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in obscurity rising in this
state? And can
a positive message of hope, of
opportunity,

08:22.335 --> 08:30.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of confidence, of innovation, of
youthfulness,
can somebody with that message
finally overcome

08:30.243 --> 08:32.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the bad mood that we seem to
have been in?

08:32.178 --> 08:36.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
To all of you who are voting

08:46.459 --> 08:52.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We welcome you with open arms.
If you don't
want to see Donald Trump as the
nominee, and

08:52.399 --> 08:56.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you don't want to see Hillary
Clinton as
the president, which is the
inevitable result

08:56.169 --> 09:00.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Donald Trump being the

us. Let us stand together.

09:00.540 --> 09:06.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The top prize for
both parties
tonight, Michigan. For some GOP
candidates

09:06.112 --> 09:11.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there, the fight for first is
almost as meaningful
as the fight for second place.

09:11.151 --> 09:15.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for more on that, we're
joined by Kathy

09:16.389 --> 09:17.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Kathy, thank you for joining us.

09:17.757 --> 09:20.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a nutshell, why is Michigan
so important
to these candidates?

09:20.994 --> 09:25.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHY GRAY, The Detroit Free

it propels them into the next
states, Ohio,

09:25.965 --> 09:28.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Florida, the big states on
October (sic) 15.

09:28.902 --> 09:33.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all of them are hoping that
they get some
big numbers here so they have
some momentum

09:33.373 --> 09:35.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going into those states.

09:35.275 --> 09:39.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We have seen the
Trump steamroller
going through a lot of the early
primary states.

09:39.612 --> 09:42.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How is it going? How is it
rolling through
Michigan?

09:42.348 --> 09:49.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHY GRAY: Well, he has been
here twice.
He had big, big rallies in
Michigan, and all

09:49.489 --> 09:51.424 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the polls show him in the lead.

09:51.458 --> 09:55.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But some of the polls in more
recent days
have had the race tightening up
a little bit.

09:55.695 --> 10:00.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Kasich seems to be rising a
little bit.
Ted Cruz is in second place.
Marco Rubio seems

10:00.500 --> 10:03.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be kind of dropping off the
-- dropping
off the slate.

10:03.470 --> 10:08.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Some of the early
exit polls which
are coming out tonight suggest
that voters

10:08.041 --> 10:15.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Michigan are just as -- are
less angry
than voters in, say,
Mississippi, and that

10:15.515 --> 10:20.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they are more mainstream
perhaps. How does
that translate? Or does that
translate? Does

10:20.453 --> 10:22.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that match up with what you have
been seeing?

10:22.522 --> 10:26.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHY GRAY: Well, there is some
anger out
there, too. There are a lot of
people who

10:26.125 --> 10:31.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are either unemployed or
underemployed. There's
a lot of wage stagnation there,
so the message

10:31.798 --> 10:36.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Donald Trump is sending has
kind of resonated
with people here in Michigan.

10:36.569 --> 10:41.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are wide swathes of
moderate voters,
moderate Republican voters and
independents

10:41.975 --> 10:47.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the state as well, and those
are the folks
who John Kasich is hoping to
attract, and

10:47.714 --> 10:50.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's been here almost nonstop
for the past
week.

10:50.517 --> 10:53.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk about
Ohio Governor
John Kasich, who is trying to
make a dent

10:53.853 --> 10:56.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the Rust Belt somewhere.

10:56.222 --> 11:01.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Did he benefit at all from that
really raucous
debate last week where everybody
was throwing

11:01.995 --> 11:04.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mud and he was kind of trying to
rise above?

11:04.264 --> 11:06.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KATHY GRAY: I think he did.

11:06.132 --> 11:09.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of people that I have
talked to, I have
been at several of Kasich's
event here's in

11:09.936 --> 11:15.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michigan, have said that they
appreciated
a person who is a little less
blustery, a

11:15.708 --> 11:22.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
little less fiery. And he seemed
to be kind
of the grownup on the stage, and
people in

11:22.815 --> 11:29.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michigan who were tuning in very
much so to
the debate in Detroit I think
appreciated

11:29.622 --> 11:31.391 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

11:31.424 --> 11:34.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: One of the things we
have seen
in other states as well is that
a lot of early

11:34.894 --> 11:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters, people who cast their
vote some time
in the past, came out for Trump,
but, in the

11:40.466 --> 11:46.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
end, the turn was toward other
candidates,
even though not enough to
overtake the front-runner.

11:46.573 --> 11:48.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How has early voting been in
Michigan?

11:48.308 --> 11:50.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KATHY GRAY: It's been huge.

11:50.143 --> 11:56.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just talked with the secretary
of state's
office late this afternoon, and
the absentee

11:56.449 --> 12:04.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ballots are up by -- it's going
close to 200,000
more than in 2012. Early voting,
we had a

12:04.057 --> 12:09.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
poll last week, shows that the
early voting
is benefiting both Donald Trump
and Hillary

12:09.629 --> 12:12.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Clinton to a very large degree.

12:12.632 --> 12:17.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the voter turnout on today is
going to
be key for the rest of the
candidates.

12:17.403 --> 12:20.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You mentioned
Hillary Clinton.
It allows me to move to the
Democrats. There's

12:20.506 --> 12:25.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been a lot of discussion about
the situation
in Flint, the poisoned,
lead-taunted water

12:25.278 --> 12:29.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Flint, Michigan. And of
course, there was
a Democratic debate there
recently.

12:29.649 --> 12:35.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How has that issue resonated,
either on the
Democratic side or on the
Republican side?

12:35.622 --> 12:40.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KATHY GRAY: It's really
resonated on the Democratic
side. Hillary Clinton was the
first one in

12:40.226 --> 12:46.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to call -- talk about it. She
talked about
it first at a debate way back in
January.

12:46.599 --> 12:53.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She came to -- she came to Flint
in early
February. She's been pounding on
it relentlessly

12:53.906 --> 12:58.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the past couple of months.
Bernie Sanders
has also been to Flint. He came
and did a

12:58.311 --> 13:02.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
town hall meeting in Flint. And
it is really
resonating.

13:02.315 --> 13:09.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's kind of a narrative of how
inner cities,
inner urban cities have been
kind of left

13:10.023 --> 13:15.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
behind by Republican policies,
and so they're
definitely playing big on that.

13:15.628 --> 13:21.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Flint also has a very large
African-American
population, so both of the
candidates have

13:21.801 --> 13:25.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been trying to attract those
voters as well.

13:25.138 --> 13:30.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let me try two
numbers on you.
This is on the Republican side,
delegate -- adding

13:30.410 --> 13:35.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up the delegates at stake.
Fifteen percent
is one number. Fifty percent is
the other.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Explain how that's going to play
out.

13:37.083 --> 13:42.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KATHY GRAY: Well, on the
Republican side,
we have 59 delegates at stake.
You have to

13:42.221 --> 13:47.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get at least 15 percent of the
vote to get
that. So there's a very real
possibility that

13:47.126 --> 13:50.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one of the Republicans won't
meet that threshold.

13:50.730 --> 13:55.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Democratic side, you have
to get -- it's
a winner -- it's a not a
winner-take-all.

13:55.802 --> 14:02.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's proportional. There's 130
delegates at
stake, another 17
superdelegates. Those 130

14:02.608 --> 14:08.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are divided up proportionately.
And we expect
that both Clinton and Sanders
will get some

14:08.848 --> 14:10.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
delegates out of Michigan.

14:10.616 --> 14:14.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: OK. Kathy Gray of
The Detroit
Free Press, thank you. Long
night ahead.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KATHY GRAY: Thank you.

14:15.888 --> 14:19.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Get the latest on

14:19.425 --> 14:34.340 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
night. That's at
PBS.org/NewsHour.

14:34.373 --> 14:46.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We return to the
Israeli-Palestinian
conflict, and tonight begin a
series of occasional

14:46.953 --> 14:50.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conversations we're calling The
Long Divide.

14:50.623 --> 14:56.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vice President Joe Biden was in
Israel today,
not far from the scene of one
stabbing attack,

14:56.329 --> 15:02.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where he began two days of
meetings with Israeli
and Palestinian leaders mired in
a deep and

15:02.135 --> 15:04.003 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
violent impasse.

15:04.036 --> 15:09.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Biden is also the latest top
American official
trying to repair relations
between the Obama

15:09.342 --> 15:12.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
White House and Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.

15:13.012 --> 15:17.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We launch this series now with
New York Times
foreign affairs columnist Thomas
Friedman.

15:17.984 --> 15:19.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tom Friedman, welcome back to
the program.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THOMAS FRIEDMAN, The New York
Times: Great
to be with you, Judy. Thank you.

15:21.320 --> 15:25.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you wrote a
column saying
flatly that the peace process is
dead. Why

15:25.792 --> 15:28.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
do you believe that?

15:28.594 --> 15:30.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Because it's
dead.

15:30.329 --> 15:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's actually been dead for a
while. I just
called it by its real name. It's
clear to

15:34.333 --> 15:39.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me, Judy, that both sides have
conspired.
This was like "Murder on the
Orient Express."

15:39.672 --> 15:43.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were so many stab wounds
in this body,
hard to tell exactly which one
was the fatal

15:43.442 --> 15:45.311 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
blow.

15:45.344 --> 15:51.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But you now have near
approaching 500,000
Jewish settlers in the West
Bank, and depending

15:51.584 --> 15:56.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on where you define the border.
Remember,
it took 50,000 Israeli soldiers
and police

15:56.923 --> 16:00.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to remove peacefully 8,000
settlers from Gaza.

16:00.593 --> 16:06.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, imagine if you're talking
about, you know,
400,000 to 500,000. And on the
Palestinian

16:06.833 --> 16:11.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
side, you have had some really
bad developments.
In the last Israeli-Palestinian
war, Hamas

16:11.237 --> 16:16.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fired a rocket that landed
basically on the
outskirts of Israel's only
international airport,

16:16.242 --> 16:19.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
basically, or major
international airport,
Lod.

16:19.145 --> 16:25.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the U.S. FAA ordered for one
day all American
flights canceled. That was a
message to all

16:25.618 --> 16:29.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Israelis. Imagine if the
Palestinians had
the West Bank and could close
their only airport.

16:29.655 --> 16:34.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, also, Salam Fayyad or the
-- sorry -- the
-- Abu Mazen, the Palestinian
president, he

16:34.861 --> 16:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
released -- he fired, basically,
Salam Fayyad,
the one Palestinian prime
minister who said,

16:40.600 --> 16:44.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we need to build our
institutions, and if
we do what the Zionists did and
we build our

16:44.837 --> 16:48.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
state institutionally, getting a
state will
just be a formality.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.343 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He got fired.

16:50.376 --> 16:52.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you're saying
there are
a few people trying to do the
right thing,

16:52.778 --> 16:55.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but they're not being listened
to? What's
the problem?

16:55.448 --> 16:59.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Yes. There are
a lot of people
trying to do the right -- wrong
thing, and

16:59.619 --> 17:02.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they have been really empowered
lately.

17:02.455 --> 17:07.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My criticism of Netanyahu is not
that Israel
should get out of the West Bank
tomorrow.

17:07.493 --> 17:11.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I get it. It's a dangerous
neighborhood. You
know, I have always felt, to
understand Israel,

17:11.664 --> 17:15.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to write about Israel, you have
to keep three
thoughts in your head at the
same time and

17:15.334 --> 17:17.103 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their intention.

17:17.136 --> 17:21.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is that Israel is an amazing
place. It's
really built an amazing society
in its short

17:21.641 --> 17:26.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
history. Second, Israel does
some bad stuff
in the West Bank. And, third,
Israel lives

17:26.078 --> 17:29.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in a really dangerous
neighborhood. And you
have got to keep all three of
those in your

17:29.282 --> 17:31.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
head at the same time.

17:31.050 --> 17:35.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My critique of Netanyahu is
this. Why would
you make a bad situation worse
by putting

17:35.087 --> 17:40.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Jews in the middle of
Palestinian areas in
the West Bank, highly densely
populated Palestinian

17:40.593 --> 17:45.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
areas, that if there were to be
a deal, that
would have to be ceded to a
Palestinian state?

17:45.631 --> 17:51.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And where is the Israeli
creativity? We see
Israeli creativity in cyber, in
technology,

17:51.704 --> 17:52.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all of these things.

17:52.338 --> 17:54.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

17:54.173 --> 17:57.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: When was the
last time you
read a story about Netanyahu
where you said,

17:57.276 --> 18:00.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
wow, now, that's really
interesting, there's
a really creative idea?

18:00.880 --> 18:06.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on the Palestinian side, you
have got
a fractured Palestinian society,
one in Gaza,

18:06.452 --> 18:11.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one in the West Bank. So nobody
can actually
say yes for the Palestinians
anymore in a

18:11.290 --> 18:13.292 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unified way.

18:13.326 --> 18:15.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the meantime,
you have American
politicians, many Republican
prominent politicians

18:15.728 --> 18:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
running for president who are
praising Benjamin
Netanyahu, saying Barack --
President Obama

18:21.334 --> 18:25.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has been -- has made all the
wrong moves when
it comes to Israel.

18:25.304 --> 18:29.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is the U.S. a player or not?
There's a story
today in The Wall Street Journal
saying that

18:29.709 --> 18:34.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the White House is trying to
come up with
a U.N. resolution maybe or some
other gesture

18:34.046 --> 18:36.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to get the peace process moving
again.

18:36.315 --> 18:38.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Well, that
story is a bit
of an evergreen. Maybe it's true
now. But

18:38.784 --> 18:43.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's always, we're going to tell
them. We're
just -- we're going to tell them
we're tired

18:43.622 --> 18:48.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this. We're going to -- and
then it never
happens, because a Democrat
comes along, like

18:48.194 --> 18:51.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, and says, geez,
I wish you
wouldn't do that. Now that's
going to affect

18:51.297 --> 18:52.999 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Jewish voters.

18:53.032 --> 18:56.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's going on in the campaign,
that's a
gravity-free zone. It has
nothing to do with

18:56.569 --> 19:01.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the reality of the Middle East
whatsoever.
That is people looking for votes
and funding.

19:01.340 --> 19:03.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It has nothing to do with the
region.

19:03.175 --> 19:06.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How much of the
problem here,
Tom, is due to the fact that the
rest Middle

19:06.879 --> 19:12.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
East is virtually on fire,
overshadowing the
Palestinians and the Israelis?

19:12.685 --> 19:14.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: There's no
question.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're sitting in Israel
today, Israel
has a real strategic dilemma. It
has nonstate

19:17.723 --> 19:24.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actors dressed as civilians,
armed with rockets,
nested among civilians on four
out of five

19:24.397 --> 19:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
borders, Sinai, Gaza, Lebanon
and Syria.

19:27.066 --> 19:31.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we're at a stage today
where a lot
of artificial states, states
whose borders

19:31.904 --> 19:35.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are primarily straight lines,
they're actually
blowing up all over the world
under the pressure

19:35.775 --> 19:40.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of globalization, technology,
climate. It's
different things in different
places.

19:40.079 --> 19:43.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These states, Judy, they're like
caravan homes
in a trailer park. They're built
on slabs

19:44.016 --> 19:48.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of cement with no basement and
no foundation.
And these big global forces
today, they're

19:49.021 --> 19:53.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like a tornado going through a
trailer park.
And a lot of them happen to be
around Israel.

19:54.026 --> 19:59.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: If solutions are
out there,
and the people who have tried to
float them

19:59.498 --> 20:03.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just get knocked down, where is
an answer
going to come from? You're
saying it waits

20:03.402 --> 20:07.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the next president. Does it
wait even
longer? And where does it?

20:07.540 --> 20:11.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: You know,
Netanyahu and Abbas
can almost see each other from
their offices.

20:11.610 --> 20:15.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The idea that they need John
Kerry or any
American secretary of state to
come over,

20:15.748 --> 20:19.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if they had the will, they would
have the
way. It's got to start with
them. I think

20:19.819 --> 20:24.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the most constructive thing
President Obama
could do would -- say, we tried.
It's over.

20:24.290 --> 20:26.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's going to be a one-state
solution.

20:26.425 --> 20:29.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what would shock the
system, not, here's
our plan. But then they just
start making

20:29.862 --> 20:34.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it about us. They start picking
apart our
plan. They say, it's about you.
It's over.

20:34.800 --> 20:39.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We really wish you well. Sorry
it didn't work
out, because what happens
otherwise is Netanyahu

20:39.872 --> 20:43.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will always say, Kerry's coming.
Kerry -- there's
a plan.

20:43.709 --> 20:49.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or Abbas will say, don't worry.
The Americans
are -- no, no, nobody's coming.
It's over.

20:49.915 --> 20:55.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's yours. You own it. Now you
live with
it. And that's the beginning of
wisdom.

20:55.387 --> 20:59.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But can any
American president
really do that, given the
political pressure

20:59.391 --> 21:00.793 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this country?

21:00.826 --> 21:02.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Obama has sort
of been doing
it for the last year.

21:02.161 --> 21:03.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But he hasn't
made that declaration.

21:03.929 --> 21:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: He hasn't said
that. But
he's basically -- he's basically
told Kerry,

21:07.366 --> 21:10.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you know, I don't want you
messing around
there anymore.

21:10.436 --> 21:14.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, it's very hard, but,
actually, it would
be -- you know, friends don't
let friends

21:14.573 --> 21:18.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drive drunk, and we have been
letting a lot
of people drive drunk.

21:18.811 --> 21:24.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tom Friedman, on
that note,
we thank you.

21:24.250 --> 21:33.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: A pleasure,
Judy. Thank you.

21:33.125 --> 21:40.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: This past Saturday,
high school
students preparing for college
took a brand-new

21:40.065 --> 21:45.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAT test, with the first major
changes in
more than a decade. The scores
will be part

21:45.404 --> 21:48.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of many college applications,
but not all.

21:48.574 --> 21:53.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
April Brown reports for our
latest Tuesday
evening Making the Grade series.
It's part

21:53.679 --> 21:57.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Public Media's American
Graduate Project.

21:57.216 --> 22:00.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICK BOCK, SAT Tutor: So,
we're going to
do quadratics today. We're going
to start

22:00.719 --> 22:02.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
quadratics anyway.

22:02.655 --> 22:05.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: For decades, many
students like
junior Carson Goettlicher of
Annandale, Virginia,

22:05.925 --> 22:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have set aside extra time
preparing for a
pre-college ritual, taking the
ACT or the

22:14.433 --> 22:20.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAT test, or both. Carson has
been studying
with tutor Patrick Bock for the
new SAT, the

22:20.839 --> 22:23.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first major changes to the test
since 2005.

22:23.275 --> 22:27.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARSON GOETTLICHER, Student: We
took a pretest
in the SAT class which was based
off the old

22:28.013 --> 22:33.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one. And I did pretty well on
that, so I -- then
I thought about how I'm taking
the new one,

22:33.852 --> 22:35.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and I'm like, I'm going to do
terrible now.

22:35.654 --> 22:38.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: There are many
changes to the
new version, including a focus
on materials

22:38.524 --> 22:43.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
students are likely to find in
college and
careers. Some test prep
professionals believe

22:43.462 --> 22:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it now looks more like the ACT,
which more
students have taken in recent
years, than

22:48.334 --> 22:50.236 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the SAT.

22:50.269 --> 22:55.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anyone who has taken the old SAT
might remember
the arcane vocabulary that even
the test creators

22:55.307 --> 23:01.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
admit engendered prodigious
vexation. Those
words are now gone, as is the
penalty for

23:01.247 --> 23:07.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
guessing. The top score on the
test is again
1,600. The essay is now
optional.

23:07.453 --> 23:10.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The test designers say the
overhaul is meant
to keep the SAT relevant.

23:10.923 --> 23:15.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MONTOYA, College Board:
The old test
was working, but this is a
better test.

23:15.594 --> 23:20.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: James Montoya is a
senior vice
president at the College Board,
which oversees

23:20.099 --> 23:21.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the SATs.

23:21.934 --> 23:28.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MONTOYA: We focus on those
skills that
are most important, and
evidence-based reading

23:28.574 --> 23:34.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and writing is a great example.
If we look
at mathematics, one of the
things that we

23:34.179 --> 23:37.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
look at, the importance of
algebraic equations.

23:37.583 --> 23:42.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Montoya says the
test is also
more closely aligned to what
students are

23:42.421 --> 23:44.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
learning in school.

23:44.223 --> 23:48.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carson Goettlicher is take the
SAT because
the colleges she's applying to
require it,

23:48.627 --> 23:53.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but since the 1970s, a growing
number of colleges
and universities have made their
admissions

23:53.499 --> 23:55.334 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
test optional.

23:55.367 --> 24:00.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bates College, a liberal arts
school in Maine,
went test-optional in 1984. And
North Carolina's

24:00.806 --> 24:06.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wake Forest became one of the
first major
universities to do so in 2008.
Last year,

24:06.679 --> 24:11.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
George Washington University in
Washington,
D.C., became one of the largest
institutions

24:11.183 --> 24:16.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the country not requiring SAT
or ACT scores
during the application process.

24:16.889 --> 24:22.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
George Washington vice provost
Laurie Coaler
says test-optional was part of a
plan to help

24:22.227 --> 24:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
improve diversity because
studies have revealed
first-generation college-goers,
as well as

24:27.666 --> 24:33.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
minority and female students,
are more likely
to apply if they don't have to
provide standardized

24:33.472 --> 24:35.374 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
test scores.

24:35.407 --> 24:37.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURIE KOEHLER, Vice Provost,
George Washington
University: We did see a more
than 28 percent

24:37.209 --> 24:43.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
increase in our applications,
but what was
striking was the numbers of
first-generation

24:43.849 --> 24:49.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
students, of under-represented
multicultural
students who submitted
applications, nearly

24:49.955 --> 24:53.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
1,100 more in each of those
populations.

24:53.359 --> 24:58.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: But before the
decision was made,
Koehler says, G.W. looked at
research from

24:58.464 --> 25:03.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bates and consulted officials at
Wake Forest
about why standardized test
results may not

25:03.936 --> 25:06.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be the best predictor of college
success.

25:06.772 --> 25:11.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They found looking at high
school work holistically
and a student's grade point
average are better

25:11.910 --> 25:13.746 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
indicators.

25:13.779 --> 25:17.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURIE KOEHLER: If you have
earned C's in
high school, and even if you
test really well,

25:17.750 --> 25:20.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're probably going to have
the work habits
that are going to earn you C's
in college.

25:20.753 --> 25:23.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT SCHAEFFER, National
Center for Fair
and Open Testing: The changes to
the SAT are

25:23.822 --> 25:29.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
largely cosmetic. They make it a
little bit
more consumer-friendly, but they
don't deal

25:29.061 --> 25:32.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with any of the fundamentally
flawed characteristics
of the test.

25:32.765 --> 25:36.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Robert Schaeffer of
the National
Center for Fair and Open Testing
says there

25:36.635 --> 25:41.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are now more than 850 colleges
and universities
nationwide on the test-optional
bandwagon.

25:41.874 --> 25:47.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT SCHAEFFER: It remains a
weak predictor
of how well a student will do in
college.

25:47.212 --> 25:51.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's biased in many ways, and
it's susceptible
to high-priced coaching.

25:51.049 --> 25:58.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: The coaching he
refers to can
cost hundreds or even thousands
of dollars

25:58.056 --> 26:03.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an hour. Carson Goettlicher
found her SAT
tutor Patrick Bock through her
school. It's

26:03.262 --> 26:05.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something Carson's mother,
Debbie, is thankful
for.

26:05.631 --> 26:10.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBBIE GOETTLICHER, Mother: I'm
trying to
prepare my kids for their
future. And, unfortunately,

26:10.102 --> 26:14.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have to take this test in
order for them
to be successful. So, yes, I'm
going to give

26:14.339 --> 26:18.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them every tool I can. We were
fortunate that
the school actually offered the
program and

26:19.011 --> 26:23.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made it affordable for us,
because it can
get quite expensive.

26:23.182 --> 26:28.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: The SAT is changing in
March 2016. Which
SAT do you want to practice for?

26:28.821 --> 26:33.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: In anticipation of
the new SAT,
the College Board partnered with
Khan Academy,

26:33.592 --> 26:37.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a nonprofit online educational
service, to
provide free test prep.

26:38.030 --> 26:42.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Founder Sal Khan says it's a way
to level
the playing field for those who
may not be

26:42.501 --> 26:44.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
able to afford extra help.

26:44.336 --> 26:47.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAL KHAN, The Khan Academy: The
software in
Khan Academy will immediately
know where you

26:47.573 --> 26:50.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are strong and where you are
weak, so it can
really do weak-point training.
So, that's

26:50.809 --> 26:55.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one option. But the number one
thing is not
to pull an all-nighter the night
before the

26:55.581 --> 26:57.316 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
exam.

26:57.349 --> 27:00.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Tutor Patrick Bock
and others
have pointed out the new SAT
comes at a time

27:00.052 --> 27:03.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when the test has been losing
market share
to competitor ACT.

27:03.622 --> 27:08.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICK BOCK: They can say that
test changes
are motivated by sort of closer
alignment

27:08.560 --> 27:16.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with state standards or sort of
more rigorous
analytics into the test, but
it's purely a

27:16.134 --> 27:19.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
money thing, right? Like, if
you're losing
students every single year, you
want to make

27:19.438 --> 27:21.240 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that up.

27:21.273 --> 27:23.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Nevertheless, on
Saturday, tens
of thousands of high school
students around

27:23.509 --> 27:25.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the country woke up early to
take the new
SAT.

27:25.978 --> 27:29.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JACQUEZ LYKES, Student:
Honestly, I came in
not knowing that it was a
different test.

27:29.615 --> 27:34.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Jacquez Lykes is a
senior and
took the test in Fairfax County,
Virginia.

27:34.419 --> 27:35.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Have you taken the SAT before?

27:35.554 --> 27:37.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACQUEZ LYKES: Yes. I took it
like three weeks
ago.

27:37.623 --> 27:41.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: What was different
on this new
SAT vs. the old one you took?

27:41.994 --> 27:46.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACQUEZ LYKES: The other version
had 10 sections,
and it felt like you were in the
class for,

27:46.164 --> 27:50.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like, hours or whatnot, and this
one only
had four, which was, like, a
major relief.

27:50.335 --> 27:53.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Junior Kayla Ramsay
also took
it.

27:53.105 --> 27:54.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you feel like you were
prepared for this?

27:54.973 --> 28:00.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAYLA RAMSAY, Student: I do.
Like, I did a
lot of studying and just
recalling stuff from

28:00.045 --> 28:01.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
freshman year, sophomore year.

28:01.914 --> 28:05.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: And we caught up
with Carson
Goettlicher after she finished.

28:05.083 --> 28:09.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CARSON GOETTLICHER: I'm
relieved. I guess
it felt like pretty much like
any other standardized

28:09.888 --> 28:14.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
test, other than the fact that
there's -- this
is basically our future.

28:14.593 --> 28:19.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Carson is also
taking the ACT
next month and is planning to
take the new

28:19.398 --> 28:21.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SAT again in May.

28:21.533 --> 28:32.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
April Brown in
Fairfax County, Virginia.

28:32.411 --> 28:46.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: With all the
noise on the campaign
trail this year about what's
wrong with America,

28:46.091 --> 28:51.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
it caught our eye when
journalist James and
Deborah Fallows filed a report
on places that

28:51.597 --> 28:55.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seem to be getting things right,
even across
partisan divides.

28:55.934 --> 29:00.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To find out more, I caught up
with the Fallows
in Greenville, South Carolina.
This story

29:00.639 --> 29:06.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is part of our collaboration
with "The Atlantic"
magazine.

29:06.778 --> 29:11.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the past three years,
husband and wife
journalists James and Deborah
Fallows have

29:11.783 --> 29:17.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been exploring parts of America
sometimes
referred to as flyover country,
places often

29:17.956 --> 29:21.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ignored by the East and West
Coast news media.

29:21.693 --> 29:27.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But instead of just flying over,
the Fallows
have been landing over and over
again.

29:27.232 --> 29:30.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBORAH FALLOWS, "The Atlantic":
When we touched
down in some of these small
communities, you

29:30.802 --> 29:34.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would think, how can all this be
going on
here, and we never knew about
any of it?

29:34.940 --> 29:38.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES FALLOWS, "The Atlantic":
The country
is full of people doing things,
which you

29:38.377 --> 29:43.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wouldn't necessarily assume from
the tone
of political discourse or news
coverage.

29:43.649 --> 29:48.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In a search for
places that
have grappled with challenges,
economic or

29:48.920 --> 29:55.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
political, the Fallows have made
extended
visits to about 25 cities for
the project,

29:55.160 --> 30:01.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including Greenville, South
Carolina; Burlington,
Vermont; Allentown,
Pennsylvania; Duluth,

30:01.400 --> 30:08.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Minnesota; Sioux Falls, South
Dakota; Redlands,
California, and so many more.

30:08.740 --> 30:15.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You found that there were a
number of things
that these cities have in common
that make

30:15.313 --> 30:17.115 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
things work.

30:17.149 --> 30:20.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES FALLOWS: You see across
the country,
there's a surprising amount of
the good bones

30:20.352 --> 30:24.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of downtown that are still left
that people
are trying to use.

30:24.089 --> 30:31.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You see, very crucially, the
fact that national
politics, which are so divisive
and so poisonous

30:31.463 --> 30:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now, just don't come into the
local discourse.

30:34.199 --> 30:37.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why is having a
downtown important?

30:37.569 --> 30:42.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES FALLOWS: To a surprising
degree, just
the identity of this is a place
where there's

30:42.240 --> 30:48.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a there there depends on having
a downtown
with restaurants and with not
just a shopping

30:48.547 --> 30:56.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mall. It was amazing to go see
how many parts
of the country are attracting
really ambitious,

30:56.655 --> 31:02.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really well-educated, really
first-rate people
who think that the best arena
for their ambitions

31:02.494 --> 31:08.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and their whole life prospect is
someplace
where they can do work of the
very first tier,

31:08.867 --> 31:10.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but also have some effect on the
local community.

31:10.836 --> 31:15.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The falls are a really nice way
to link the
past and the present.

31:15.540 --> 31:20.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A prime example,
Greenville,
South Carolina. Once known for
the textile

31:20.412 --> 31:26.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
industry, its mills lined the
Reedy River
in the heart of the city. Now
the mills are

31:26.852 --> 31:33.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
long gone or repurposed, but the
river remains
at the center of the community,
lined by hotels

31:33.992 --> 31:39.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and restaurants, as it flows
through a stunning
urban park that's a magnet for
tourists and

31:39.831 --> 31:41.399 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
locals alike.

31:41.433 --> 31:43.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The evolution was no accident.

31:43.301 --> 31:46.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KNOX WHITE, Mayor of Greenville,
South Carolina:
We reinvented the downtown, just
as we reinvented

31:46.138 --> 31:47.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the local economy.

31:48.006 --> 31:52.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Knox White, mayor
of Greenville
for more than 20 years, and a
chief architect

31:52.344 --> 31:58.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the city's redevelopment,
says city fathers
set out decades ago to plan for
the future.

31:58.183 --> 32:04.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KNOX WHITE: In the 1970s, when
textiles were
still very viable, the
leadership in Greenville

32:04.322 --> 32:08.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very intentionally decided that
we needed
to diversify. They brought in
and recruited

32:08.326 --> 32:13.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
companies like General Electric,
and today
GE is a major presence here. And
that put

32:13.098 --> 32:16.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us in a really good stead,
because, later,
the textile industry would
collapse.

32:16.468 --> 32:20.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBORAH FALLOWS: I think they're
very self-conscious
about what they're doing in
Greenville and

32:20.672 --> 32:25.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also aware that these things
aren't going
to be decreed from on high.

32:25.577 --> 32:26.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY WHITWORTH, Director of
Economic Development,
Greenville, South Carolina: It's
just in part

32:27.012 --> 32:28.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of our DNA of how we operate.

32:28.880 --> 32:34.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Remaking
Greenville took government
and business working together,
says Nancy

32:34.386 --> 32:36.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whitworth, Greenville's director
of economic
development.

32:36.888 --> 32:42.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NANCY WHITWORTH: The
public-private partnership
of working together, the city
and the county,

32:42.694 --> 32:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you see that every day in sort
of how we approach
dealing with companies that we
try to bring

32:48.166 --> 32:50.001 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into Greenville.

32:50.035 --> 32:54.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: An active local
government
pushing incentives like tax
breaks and favorable

32:54.472 --> 33:00.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
zoning have made so-called
public-private
partnerships possible, both in
developing

33:00.245 --> 33:07.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the downtown, and in luring
major manufacturers
to the area, like BMW and
Michelin.

33:07.452 --> 33:13.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These companies provide tens of
thousands
of jobs, and bring an
international influence

33:13.058 --> 33:14.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to this small Southern city.

33:14.726 --> 33:18.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DANIELLE VINSON, Furman
University: It is
definitely conservative, by and
large.

33:18.630 --> 33:23.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Danielle Vinson
teaches political
science at nearby Furman
University.

33:23.535 --> 33:28.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIELLE VINSON: We have pockets
of Democrats
in the city limits particularly.
But everywhere

33:28.940 --> 33:35.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
else is very Republican. And so
our senators
are Republican. Our -- all of
our congressional

33:35.747 --> 33:37.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
delegation up here is
Republican.

33:37.816 --> 33:42.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Vinson says the
government's
partnership with business may
seem inconsistent

33:42.988 --> 33:46.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Republican philosophy, but
it's a way
to make things work.

33:47.025 --> 33:52.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIELLE VINSON: When you start
talking about
ideology, it's good in theory,
and you can

33:52.664 --> 33:57.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
argue about it at the national
level. But
when you get to the local city
and county

33:57.469 --> 34:02.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
level, you have got tangible
issues that have
to be addressed.

34:02.073 --> 34:07.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There's no
question Greenville's
economy is booming. Half-a-dozen
cranes dot

34:07.946 --> 34:13.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the skyline, as new hotels,
condos and office
buildings multiply.

34:13.985 --> 34:20.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But some are asking if the
benefits have reached
all of Greenville's residents,
about 15 percent

34:20.392 --> 34:22.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of whom are poor.

34:22.193 --> 34:24.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How fast is gentrification
happening here?

34:24.729 --> 34:27.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHANDRA DILLARD (D), South
Carolina State
Representative: It's happening
very rapidly,

34:27.098 --> 34:28.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
even in my neighborhood.

34:28.867 --> 34:31.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Chandra Dillard
is a Democratic
state representative from
Greenville.

34:31.937 --> 34:37.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHANDRA DILLARD: I have received
letters at
my home saying, do you want to
sell? There

34:37.142 --> 34:38.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is pressure against the
neighborhood.

34:38.877 --> 34:41.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So how is the
community dealing
with that?

34:41.313 --> 34:45.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHANDRA DILLARD: Well, I think
you must be
intentional, Judy. We must be
intentional

34:45.650 --> 34:50.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about making sure that people
are trained,
that they're ready, that there
is policy to

34:50.622 --> 34:54.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
protect people who currently
live in these
neighborhoods, so that they will
be able to

34:54.526 --> 34:56.261 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stay there.

34:56.294 --> 35:00.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How would you
describe today
the racial relationships in this
community,

35:00.265 --> 35:02.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the context of the history of
this part
of the state?

35:02.734 --> 35:08.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHANDRA DILLARD: I think there
is racial harmony
in our city. Again, I believe
the challenge

35:08.606 --> 35:13.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now is economic disparity that
separates us,
and not the races.

35:13.912 --> 35:20.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The congregation
at Greenville's
Redemption Church would seem to
confirm that.

35:20.151 --> 35:27.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sixty percent of its 20,000
members are African-American,
the rest mainly white. Most of
the whites

35:27.292 --> 35:34.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are Republicans, most of the
blacks Democrats.
On politics, they disagree
fiercely. But each

35:34.299 --> 35:36.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Sunday, they worship as one.

35:36.534 --> 35:39.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The reverend Ron Carpenter is
their pastor.

35:39.037 --> 35:42.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. RON CARPENTER, Redemption
Church: In
our world, we call it a culture
of honor.

35:42.574 --> 35:50.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is such a culture of
disrespect that
prevails in society, I think,
through media,

35:50.715 --> 35:56.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through government, through
politics, that
I tell people that, no matter if
you disagree

35:56.721 --> 36:03.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with this person's politics,
whether or not
you agree with their position,
honor the person.

36:03.328 --> 36:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES FALLOWS: It's easier to
treat that person
as somebody who has good parts
and bad parts,

36:08.099 --> 36:12.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and you disagree on some things,
and you will
try to contain those, where you
can come to

36:12.303 --> 36:14.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
kind of practical solutions.

36:14.272 --> 36:20.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One such solution
addresses
the education gap that keeps
many African-Americans

36:21.012 --> 36:25.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from sharing in the wealth of
high-tech jobs
in and around Greenville.

36:25.417 --> 36:32.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the Whittenberg Elementary
School of Engineering
-- you heard that right,
elementary school

36:32.290 --> 36:35.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- these kids get a head start
on math and
science.

36:35.960 --> 36:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBORAH FALLOWS: These were the
tiniest little
engineers from pre-K through
grade five. And

36:42.167 --> 36:51.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they were starting off in
technology and engineering
infused into their baby
curriculum.

36:51.443 --> 37:00.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the South
Carolina Governor's
School for the Arts and
Humanities, a public

37:01.019 --> 37:05.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
boarding school, gives high
school students
from across the state an
opportunity to pursue

37:05.557 --> 37:08.126 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
excellence.

37:08.159 --> 37:16.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, much work remains to
spread the new
opportunities and benefits among
all of Greenville's

37:16.768 --> 37:20.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
residents. And much of that work
falls to
the church.

37:20.105 --> 37:25.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. RON CARPENTER: What I do
is, I usually
try to bring businesses and
bring our government

37:25.944 --> 37:30.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officials to the table and say,
I can't take
care of all of them, but I can
help with this

37:30.248 --> 37:35.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
child care issue if we can get
the Greenville
transit system operating in this
community,

37:35.687 --> 37:37.422 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
too.

37:37.455 --> 37:40.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Greenville and
in so many
other cities the Fallows
visited, they found

37:40.992 --> 37:46.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pockets of genuine optimism in a
nation that
often seems filled with fear and
loathing.

37:46.931 --> 37:52.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES FALLOWS: They have a
shared story about
the way that the city government
works to

37:52.570 --> 37:57.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bring in some international
corporations,
works with local start-ups,
works with the

37:57.175 --> 38:02.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
diversity of the community
there, works with
religious organizations, and
having some collective

38:02.881 --> 38:10.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sense that it matters to us to
make this city
attractive, make it inclusive,
make it growing,

38:10.522 --> 38:12.190 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
make it strong.

38:12.223 --> 38:17.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And did you see
anything that
could be transplanted to
Washington?

38:17.395 --> 38:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES FALLOWS: In contrast to
the apparent
hopelessness of the national
perspective,

38:21.866 --> 38:26.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there is some attempt to grapple
with these
things locally.

38:26.070 --> 38:30.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I guess we came across almost
nothing you
could directly say, OK, the
Greenville City

38:30.208 --> 38:36.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Council works this way. Why
doesn't the U.S.
Senate work this way too? But,
in the meantime,

38:36.848 --> 38:42.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people in Greenville and Fresno
and Dayton
and Duluth and Allentown and
Central Oregon

38:42.787 --> 38:47.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and all the rest can learn from
what each
other are doing, and get greater
strength

38:47.325 --> 38:49.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from that sense of network.

38:49.160 --> 38:54.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so James and
Deborah Fallows
continue their journey, in the
belief that

38:54.532 --> 39:00.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these places and others like
them are the
real story of America today,
even more than

39:00.805 --> 39:04.709 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what's going on in Washington.

39:04.742 --> 39:18.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We will be back to
talk with journalist
Peter Bergen about his new book,
"The United

39:18.356 --> 39:20.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
States of Jihad."

39:20.158 --> 39:24.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, take this moment to
hear from
your local PBS station. It's a
chance to offer

39:24.963 --> 39:29.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your support, which helps keep
programs like
ours on the air.

39:29.734 --> 39:31.502 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

39:31.536 --> 39:41.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now the newest
addition to
the "NewsHour" Bookshelf, a look
at Americans

39:41.579 --> 39:47.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now the newest
addition to
the "NewsHour" Bookshelf, a look
at Americans

39:47.619 --> 39:49.420 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
inspired by radical jihadism.

39:49.454 --> 39:51.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Margaret Warner has that.

39:51.456 --> 39:58.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Terrorism
expert Peter Bergen
has spent two years studying
hundreds of radicalized

39:58.529 --> 40:05.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Americans, seeking to understand
what drives
a minority of U.S. Muslims to
wage terror

40:05.370 --> 40:07.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attacks against their fellow
citizens.

40:07.639 --> 40:15.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also takes a hard look at how
law enforcement
has done in identifying and
averting this

40:15.380 --> 40:18.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
danger. The result is his new
book, "The United
States of Jihad: Investigating
America's Homegrown

40:18.650 --> 40:20.518 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Terrorists."

40:20.551 --> 40:24.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's being released, along with
an HBO documentary
based on it, "Homegrown: The
Counter-Terror

40:24.122 --> 40:24.656 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Dilemma."

40:24.689 --> 40:25.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Peter Bergen, welcome.

40:25.923 --> 40:31.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, how big a threat is this,
this homegrown
terrorism?

40:31.162 --> 40:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER BERGEN, Author, "United
States of Jihad:
Investigating America's
Homegrown Terrorists":

40:35.400 --> 40:38.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, I think it's a persistent
low-level
threat.

40:38.770 --> 40:43.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have been in the United
States quite lucky;
45 Americans have been killed by
jihadi terrorists

40:43.074 --> 40:47.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the United States, all by
homegrown militants,
since 9/11. Each one of those
deaths, of course,

40:47.679 --> 40:53.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a tragedy, but it's not a
national catastrophe
anything on the scale of 9/11.

40:53.685 --> 40:59.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, to some degree, the threat
has been managed,
but it will persist at a low
level for a long

40:59.357 --> 41:01.192 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

41:01.225 --> 41:05.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Was there one
thing you found
in your reporting that united
all these cases,

41:05.930 --> 41:10.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where you have an American
Muslim who decides
that he wants to kill other
Americans?

41:10.768 --> 41:14.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER BERGEN: One of the things
that's striking
is they're overwhelmingly
Americans. They're

41:14.439 --> 41:16.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not foreigners coming into this
country to
do terrorist attacks.

41:16.774 --> 41:20.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They tend to be middle class,
average income,
similar to the average American.
They tend

41:20.611 --> 41:25.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be as well-educated as the
average American.
A third are married. A third are
kids, average

41:25.783 --> 41:29.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
age 29. These are not the young
hotheads of
popular imagination.

41:29.821 --> 41:35.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, if you look at the
San Bernardino
case, which, of course, the most
lethal terrorist

41:35.593 --> 41:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attack in the United States
since 9/11, they
were married. They had a child.
The guy was

41:41.399 --> 41:43.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
earning $70,000 a year. They
were basically
living the American dream.

41:43.835 --> 41:51.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's a big puzzle. Why would
you then
kill your fellow Americans? And
I can't say,

41:51.576 --> 41:59.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even after two-and-a-half years'
study, that
I can answer that question. I
try, but each

41:59.784 --> 42:00.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
case is individual.

42:00.418 --> 42:01.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Yes.

42:01.552 --> 42:04.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, let's take a couple of the
more obscure
cases.

42:04.455 --> 42:06.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PETER BERGEN: Yes.

42:06.424 --> 42:09.260 align:left position:0%,start line:66.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: There was a
young man named
Carlos Bledsoe,
African-American, from a
conservative

42:09.293 --> 42:13.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Christian upbringing, shoots and
kills a U.S.
soldier at a military recruiting
base in Little

42:13.831 --> 42:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Rock. It seems so unlikely.

42:15.566 --> 42:19.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER BERGEN: He was typical in
the sense
that he comes from a relatively
prosperous

42:19.036 --> 42:20.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
family in Memphis.

42:20.972 --> 42:24.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He went to college. He dropped
out. He adopted
a very fundamentalist form of
Islam. He decided

42:24.175 --> 42:27.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to go to Yemen, which is a
hotbed of jihadism.
He seems to have got radicalized
there in

42:27.779 --> 42:31.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prison, came back, and killed an
American
soldier.

42:31.983 --> 42:37.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said in court to the judge
that, you know,
he was guilty, he was sort of
objecting to

42:37.655 --> 42:39.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
American foreign policy.

42:39.524 --> 42:42.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, is that an adequate excuse?
Of course
not, because lots of people
don't like American

42:42.994 --> 42:45.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
foreign policy. They don't kill
people as
a result.

42:45.496 --> 42:46.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Zachary
Chesser.

42:46.631 --> 42:48.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PETER BERGEN: Yes.

42:48.433 --> 42:51.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: I had never
heard of him.
He starts out -- as a kid, he
wants to be

42:51.669 --> 42:55.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a U.S. soldier. He ends up
finally being arrested
and convicted of trying to
threaten the creators

42:55.440 --> 42:59.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of "South Park." But he seemed
to follow a
similar pattern, especially on
the isolation.

42:59.911 --> 43:05.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER BERGEN: There is a sort of
pattern where
people adopt these
fundamentalist views, and

43:06.017 --> 43:09.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they kind of increasingly seek
out like-minded
people. They kind of withdraw
from society.

43:09.754 --> 43:15.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They often marry somebody who
shares exactly
their views outside their
previous social

43:15.393 --> 43:17.028 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
circle.

43:17.061 --> 43:21.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They -- you know, they basically
are part
a self-reinforcing echo chamber
of people

43:21.432 --> 43:25.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who share their own views, and
then some may
turn to violence.

43:25.736 --> 43:28.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, Zachary Chesser, he was
inciting violence
in a very real way against the
creators of

43:28.473 --> 43:32.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"South Park." He could have been
something
very different. He could have
been a Silicon

43:32.577 --> 43:41.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Valley kid. He was one of the
first people
to really use the Internet for
jihadist purposes.

43:41.853 --> 43:48.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: That's right.
He became a
big English-language jihadist
blogger. And...

43:48.359 --> 43:51.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETER BERGEN: Right. Yes.

43:51.462 --> 44:04.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he hadn't had a Somali
girlfriend and got
interested in Islam, he could
have had a very

44:04.775 --> 44:06.511 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
trajectory.

44:06.544 --> 44:10.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: This book
focuses a lot on
homegrown and self-radicalized
terrorists.

44:10.214 --> 44:15.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there are Americans who are
actively recruited.

44:15.920 --> 44:24.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER BERGEN: Well, luckily,
it's not very
big now, but we have had lots of
Americans

44:24.228 --> 44:26.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
who have gone and become
important members
of al-Qaida.

Think about Anwar al-Awlaki, who
was a well-known
community leader and mosque
leader in Northern

44:35.139 --> 44:40.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Virginia, who went on to become
a leader of
al-Qaida in Yemen.

44:40.044 --> 44:41.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Right.

44:41.946 --> 44:46.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER BERGEN: There are several
examples of
people who have taken senior
leadership positions

44:46.050 --> 44:48.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in these groups who happen to be
American.

44:48.452 --> 44:52.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was an American at the
first meeting
of al-Qaida in 1988 who was a
person taking

44:52.823 --> 44:57.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
notes. He was a guy from Kansas
city. So,
there have been Americans in
al-Qaida or these

44:57.662 --> 44:59.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
groups from the beginning.

44:59.630 --> 45:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: How effective
has U.S. intelligence
and law enforcement been in
containing, of

45:02.266 --> 45:04.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thwarting this threat?

45:04.101 --> 45:06.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER BERGEN: We have not had
any kind of
major terrorist attack in the
United States

45:06.904 --> 45:08.639 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
since 9/11.

45:08.673 --> 45:12.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But people get through. Major
Nidal Hasan
at Fort Hood, who was sort of on
the radar

45:12.843 --> 45:20.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the FBI, the FBI sort of
dropped the ball.
Carlos Bledsoe, the guy who
killed a soldier

45:20.084 --> 45:27.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Arkansas, he was also on the
FBI's radar.

45:27.191 --> 45:38.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the FBI, they can't keep
cases against
people open indefinitely.

45:39.003 --> 45:43.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Just for what
they say.

45:44.008 --> 45:47.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETER BERGEN: Just for what they
say.

45:47.144 --> 45:59.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And unless we have a machine
that can read
people's souls, we're not going
to know when

45:59.090 --> 46:05.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
somebody who is an
ultra-fundamentalist becomes
a militant who is going to take
the law into

46:05.930 --> 46:09.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
somebody who is an
ultra-fundamentalist becomes
a militant who is going to take
the law into

46:34.558 --> 46:38.029 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their own hands.

46:38.062 --> 46:48.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: One of the
little-known facts
is that FBI and law enforcement
and intelligence

46:48.105 --> 46:58.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: One of the
little-known facts
is that FBI and law enforcement
and intelligence

46:58.549 --> 47:07.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have concocted more terrorist
plots in this
country than all the outside
organizations

47:07.124 --> 47:14.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like al-Qaida combined.

47:14.532 --> 47:23.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PETER BERGEN: Yes.

47:23.174 --> 47:30.915 align:left position:0%,start line:60% size:100%
The FBI has done 30. Al-Qaida
and other associated
groups have done 10. And
depending on
your perspective, you can say
that's law enforcement

47:30.915 --> 47:33.184 align:left position:0%,start line:60% size:100%
The FBI has done 30. Al-Qaida
and other associated
groups have done 10. And
depending on
your perspective, you can say
that's law enforcement

47:57.708 --> 47:59.610 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
overkill.

47:59.643 --> 48:09.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: What's the
evidence on whether
these alleged perpetrators were
really committed

48:09.754 --> 48:21.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: What's the
evidence on whether
these alleged perpetrators were
really committed

48:21.465 --> 48:35.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
terrorists or on a path to go
there?

48:35.946 --> 48:45.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER BERGEN: Some of these
cases look a little
like entrapment to, I think, the
outside observers.

48:45.990 --> 48:53.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER BERGEN: Some of these
cases look a little
like entrapment to, I think, the
outside observers.

48:53.264 --> 48:59.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the FBI is pretty careful to
always say,
are you really sure you want to
go through

48:59.170 --> 49:01.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with this? And the perpetrator
usually says
yes.

49:01.705 --> 49:06.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Well, Peter
Bergen, author

thank you.

For artist
Lisa Friedrich, playing with
fire is just

49:21.392 --> 49:33.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a part of the artistic process.

on paper and setting it aflame
to create a
unique pattern. We have video of
how this

49:45.816 --> 49:47.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fiery process works.

resume with key words that you
think employers

53:06.150 --> 53:12.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are looking for is a losing
strategy for job-seekers.
