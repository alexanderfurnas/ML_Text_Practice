pioneer in his field, often

rock 'n' roll who influenced
a generation of musicians.

JEFFREY BROWN, PBS NEWSHOUR
CORRESPONDENT: You know
it when you hear it.

00:25.366 --> 00:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Beginning in the mid-1950s,
Chuck Berry helped define the
sound and look, the attitude and

00:33.833 --> 00:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
raw power of rock 'n' roll.

00:37.933 --> 00:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The man is now gone, but his
music lives on, in a new album,
titled "Chuck," berry's first

00:44.700 --> 00:47.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
album since 1979.

00:47.166 --> 00:52.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He'd worked on the project off
and on for several decades,
and on his 90th birthday,

00:53.833 --> 00:55.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
five months before his
death, had announced
its imminent release.

00:55.866 --> 00:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So,
here's one of his Cadillacs.

00:58.833 --> 01:00.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.

BROWN: I was joined recently
by the star's son Charles and
grandson Charlie at the National

01:06.733 --> 01:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Museum of African-American
History and Culture for some
personal memories of the man and

01:09.933 --> 01:11.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his music.

CHARLES BERRY, JR., SON OF
CHUCK BERRY: This was a guy
when he was a little boy he sold

01:14.733 --> 01:17.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
vegetables off a
cart with his father.

01:17.966 --> 01:22.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a man that worked
at a General Motors
plant, not assembling the
cars, but as a janitor.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He heard from other people the
significance that he brought
to the table, but my -- he

01:31.666 --> 01:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
didn't really dwell on that.

01:33.733 --> 01:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLES BERRY III, GRANDSON
OF CHUCK BERRY: I remember in
elementary school, I'd have

01:35.266 --> 01:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
teachers coming up to me
like, who's your grandfather?

01:37.566 --> 01:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'd be like, pawpaw (ph).

01:39.366 --> 01:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They were like, that's so cool.

01:41.400 --> 01:46.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN (on camera): Did
you have any idea who your
grandfather was in history?

01:46.200 --> 01:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLES BERRY III: I always
knew he played the guitar,
but I didn't think he was like

01:50.900 --> 01:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this bigger than life
person to everybody else
because he was just pawpaw.

01:54.966 --> 01:56.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
BROWN: Yes.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Oh, boy, did he play
the guitar, huh?

01:57.666 --> 01:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHARLES BERRY III: Oh, yes.

01:59.800 --> 02:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN (voice-over): In fact,
both Charles and Charlie play
the guitar and had the chance

02:06.533 --> 02:08.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to play with Chuck.

02:08.466 --> 02:11.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Charles is part of the
band for many years.

02:11.200 --> 02:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Since Chuck's death, they've
played on, here just recently
promoting the new album on "The

02:15.600 --> 02:17.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Tonight Show".

02:17.600 --> 02:22.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The album charts Chuck
Berry's life in stages,
an autobiographical
epitaph of sorts.

02:24.533 --> 02:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the song "Big Boys," he
returns to his childhood with
the ambitions of a teenager,

02:32.800 --> 02:37.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
while "The Eyes of Man"
describes the wisdom
of women in his life.

02:39.833 --> 02:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLES BERRY JR.: It's almost
to the point that he was being
philosophical over his life

02:44.966 --> 02:48.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and letting everybody
else knows, like, hey,
from a wonderful woman
to a big boy to an

02:51.100 --> 02:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
eye of a man, here's my book.

02:55.400 --> 03:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here's the next chapter of
my life that you get to have,
and I hope you enjoy it.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: Berry continued to
perform into his late '80s,
including his renowned monthly

03:04.966 --> 03:09.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
gig at Blueberry Hill,
a diner and music venue
in his native St. Louis.

03:12.033 --> 03:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC CLAPTON, MUSICIAN: He's
really laid the law down for
playing that kind of music.

03:14.966 --> 03:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, MUSICIAN:
When I'm 65 or 70, I've
got to tell my grandkids.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Yes, I met Chuck Berry.

03:22.200 --> 03:25.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As a matter of fact, I backed
up Chuck Berry one night.

03:25.766 --> 03:26.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
You did?

03:26.800 --> 03:28.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

03:28.766 --> 03:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LITTLE RICHARD, MUSICIAN:
My favorite song with
Chuck is all of 'em.

03:34.233 --> 03:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: His influence is
everywhere in rock music.

03:39.900 --> 03:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The initial cultural jolt was
jokingly portrayed in the 1985
hit movie, "Back to the Future."

03:51.933 --> 03:54.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And honored nine years
later in" Pulp Fiction."

03:54.466 --> 03:59.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEVIN STRAIT, MUSEUM CURATOR:
Rock and roll has such a firm
place in our cultural memory.

04:03.466 --> 04:07.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BROWN: Kevin Strait is
a musical historian and
curator at the museum.

04:07.300 --> 04:10.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
STRAIT: He's one of the
primary sonic architects
of rock and roll.

04:10.233 --> 04:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he helped establish this
art form that we all know and
love, and that really sort

04:15.066 --> 04:16.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of took over the world.

04:16.633 --> 04:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Its helm really was this
young musician from St. Louis.

04:20.866 --> 04:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, he really sort
of helped to sort of establish
the template for how rock

04:27.166 --> 04:29.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and roll should sound.

04:29.033 --> 04:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, he's a
phenomenal guitar player,
phenomenal showman.

04:31.433 --> 04:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: Strait acquired objects
from Berry for the museum's
musical crossroads collection,

04:37.300 --> 04:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
including this prized guitar.

04:38.533 --> 04:39.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STRAIT: This guitar
is pretty special.

04:39.866 --> 04:41.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a Gibson ES-350T.

04:41.933 --> 04:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it's one of his early
touring and recording guitars
that he used, and it's nicknamed

04:48.233 --> 04:49.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Maybellene after his first hit.

04:49.666 --> 04:51.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BROWN (on camera):
Yes, quite a first hit.

04:51.333 --> 04:55.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Quite a name, right?

04:55.433 --> 04:57.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(MUSIC)

04:57.033 --> 05:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN (voice-over): And that
red 1973 Cadillac Eldorado?

05:12.400 --> 05:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Berry drove it on stage in
1986 for his 60th birthday and
the filming of the documentary

05:18.266 --> 05:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"Hail, Hail Rock 'n' Roll".

05:20.500 --> 05:25.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was at the Fox Theater
in St. Louis, which had denied
him entry as a child because

05:25.266 --> 05:27.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he was black.

05:27.400 --> 05:31.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHUCK BERRY, MUSICIAN:
And my forefathers a few
blocks away were sold
on the civil courthouse

05:35.700 --> 05:40.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
steps, sold, and
that's a big change.

05:43.133 --> 05:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES BERRY JR.: It was
difficult, absolutely,
but as opposed to,
man, these white people

05:47.733 --> 05:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are just, they're playing me.

05:49.100 --> 05:51.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My God, I can't -- nope.

05:51.100 --> 05:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My dad took it as, oh, so you're
telling me I can't go in the
front of this venue to play

05:57.700 --> 05:59.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in front of this crowd.

05:59.666 --> 06:04.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
OK, I'm going to keep
writing my music.

06:05.700 --> 06:07.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're going to change.

06:07.666 --> 06:09.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm going to make it.

06:09.666 --> 06:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm going to make a scenario
where the people that are
listening to my music are having

06:16.066 --> 06:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
such a blast that skin
color becomes irrelevant.

06:19.933 --> 06:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN (on camera): How do you
see what your grandfather,
what he went through and what

06:25.533 --> 06:27.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he achieved?

06:27.533 --> 06:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLES BERRY III: That you
could go from selling out a
packed house to then being told

06:30.400 --> 06:32.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you can't stay in
this hotel room.

06:32.433 --> 06:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is like I that probably
would have left me pretty
bitter throughout the rest of my

06:36.000 --> 06:38.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

06:38.033 --> 06:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I don't know because what
he's done with his music and
everything, it's just that much

06:44.766 --> 06:49.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more amazing because he was
able to do it during that time.

06:51.333 --> 06:55.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BROWN: A pioneering life
that had dramatic ups
and downs, for sure.

06:57.633 --> 07:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, "Chuck" the album
adds new music to what was
already an enormous legacy.

07:04.100 --> 07:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour", I'm
Jeffrey Brown in Washington.
