THING IS TO AGREE WITH THE      
FACT THERE'S A REAL PROBLEM.    

32:40.505 --> 32:41.632
THING IS TO AGREE WITH THE      
FACT THERE'S A REAL PROBLEM.    
AND THAT THE BEST SOLUTION      

32:41.634 --> 32:42.928
FACT THERE'S A REAL PROBLEM.    
AND THAT THE BEST SOLUTION      
WOULD BE BETTER STRATEGIES
