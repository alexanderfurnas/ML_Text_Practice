JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.272 --> 00:06.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.273 --> 00:07.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: And I'm Steve
Inskeep.

00:07.574 --> 00:10.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
What to do about Russia?

00:10.177 --> 00:15.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president-elect's picks to
head the Pentagon
and the CIA face senators'
questions over

00:15.482 --> 00:17.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
future relations with Moscow.

00:17.251 --> 00:20.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Also ahead, Judy
sits down
with one of the president's
closet advisers,

00:20.921 --> 00:24.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Valerie Jarrett, and asks about
Mr. Obama's
life after the Oval Office.

00:24.691 --> 00:27.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VALERIE JARRETT, Senior
Presidential Adviser:
He will speak out when he
believes his voice

00:27.995 --> 00:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can move the needle, make a
difference and
be an inspiration to those who
are looking

00:33.100 --> 00:35.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for positive change in our
country.

00:35.035 --> 00:40.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And how one
sculptor is breaking
down barriers with art that
questions identity

00:40.841 --> 00:42.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a globalized, modern world.

00:42.910 --> 00:48.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YINKA SHONIBARE, Sculptor: A lot
of the figures
are of a mixed race.

00:48.649 --> 00:51.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are neither white nor
black.

00:51.952 --> 00:58.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that also I wanted
to get away
from the binary, the dividing of
people.

00:58.492 --> 01:01.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:01.762 --> 01:05.065 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:05.098 --> 01:18.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tough talk on
Russia today
from the Trump nominees to run
the Pentagon

01:18.478 --> 01:20.280 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and the CIA.

01:20.314 --> 01:24.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At their Senate confirmation
hearings, both
men took a harder line than the
president-elect

01:24.584 --> 01:26.954 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has on dealing with the Kremlin.

01:26.987 --> 01:31.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The defense secretary-designate,
retired Marine
General James Mattis, minced no
words.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.627 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

01:33.660 --> 01:34.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATTIS (RET.), Secretary
of Defense
Nominee: We have a long list of
times that

01:34.895 --> 01:38.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we have tried to engage
positively with Russia.

01:38.632 --> 01:42.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have a relatively short list
of successes
in that regard.

01:42.035 --> 01:48.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think right now, the most
important
thing is that recognize the
reality of what

01:48.041 --> 01:53.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we deal with Mr. Putin and we
recognize that
he is trying to break the North
Atlantic Alliance.

01:53.547 --> 01:59.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At a separate
hearing, the
CIA nominee, Kansas Congressman
Mike Pompeo,

01:59.353 --> 02:04.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
accused the Russians of
aggressive action
in meddling in the U.S.
presidential election.

02:04.791 --> 02:09.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will take a deeper look at
today's statements
by both of these key Trump
advisers right

02:09.663 --> 02:11.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after the news summary.

02:11.465 --> 02:16.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news, the
first of 3,500
U.S. troops arrived in
southwestern Poland

02:16.970 --> 02:19.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a NATO buildup to deter
Russia.

02:19.873 --> 02:25.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Armored Brigade Combat Team
was met with
fanfare from the Polish military
and public.

02:25.445 --> 02:30.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. now plans to keep
troops in Poland
on an ongoing basis.

02:30.350 --> 02:33.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia charged that the U.S.
move threatens
its own security.

02:33.186 --> 02:37.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: FBI Director
James Comey will
face an investigation of his
investigation

02:37.991 --> 02:40.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of Hillary Clinton's e-mails.

02:40.093 --> 02:43.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Justice Department's
inspector general
says he will examine what the
bureau did and

02:43.497 --> 02:45.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what it said before the
election.

02:45.699 --> 02:50.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That includes Comey's disclosure
in late October
that agents were reviewing
e-mails again.

02:50.771 --> 02:54.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nothing came of that review, but
Clinton says
it hurt her chances.

02:54.041 --> 02:58.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The nominee for
U.S. housing
secretary defended his
qualifications for

02:58.478 --> 03:01.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the job today at his
confirmation hearing.

03:01.248 --> 03:08.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Dr. Ben Carson, a former
pediatric neurosurgeon,
said after growing up poor in
inner-city Detroit,

03:08.155 --> 03:11.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's committed to affordable
housing for the
poor.

03:11.124 --> 03:17.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Democrat Elizabeth Warren
pressed Carson
to guarantee that federal
housing funds won't

03:17.097 --> 03:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go to help the Trump family's
real estate
business.

03:19.766 --> 03:21.568 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

03:21.601 --> 03:22.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN CARSON, Housing and Urban
Development
Secretary Nominee: It will not
be my intention

03:22.602 --> 03:25.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to do anything to benefit any --
any American.

03:25.338 --> 03:26.540 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:26.573 --> 03:28.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH WARREN (D),
Massachusetts: I understand
that

03:28.308 --> 03:29.543 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

03:29.576 --> 03:30.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BEN CARSON: It's for all
Americans, everything
that we do.

03:30.310 --> 03:32.212 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:32.245 --> 03:36.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WARREN: But do I take
that to mean
that you may manage programs
that will significantly

03:36.049 --> 03:37.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
benefit the president-elect?

03:37.951 --> 03:39.619 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

03:39.653 --> 03:42.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN CARSON: You can take it to
mean that I
will manage things in a way that
benefits

03:42.756 --> 03:44.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the American people.

03:44.257 --> 03:46.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That is going to be the goal.

03:46.193 --> 03:50.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also today, the
president-elect
tapped Rudy Giuliani to advise
his administration

03:50.397 --> 03:52.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on cyber-security.

03:52.199 --> 03:56.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The former New York City mayor
is a long Trump
friend who campaigned for him.

03:56.603 --> 03:59.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He currently heads a
cyber-security consulting
firm.

03:59.773 --> 04:04.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Giuliani was considered for
several Cabinet
jobs, but ultimately pulled
himself out of

04:04.511 --> 04:06.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the running for those.

04:06.413 --> 04:11.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is also word this evening
that President
Obama will scrap a policy
allowing any Cubans

04:11.585 --> 04:14.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who get to U.S. soil to stay.

04:14.688 --> 04:19.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House announcement
follows months
of negotiation, and it means
that Cubans trying

04:19.426 --> 04:22.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to flee the communist island
could be sent
back.

04:22.395 --> 04:25.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The existing policy had been in
effect since
1995.

04:25.465 --> 04:30.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Baltimore has
committed to
changing the way its police do
business.

04:30.537 --> 04:33.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The city reached agreement today
with the
U.S. Justice Department.

04:33.306 --> 04:37.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were responding to the case
of Freddie
Gray, who died after being taken
into police

04:37.878 --> 04:39.079 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
custody.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Baltimore cops will have to work
the streets
differently.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have to change the way they
stop suspects.

04:43.717 --> 04:47.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And an independent monitor will
check on their
process.

04:47.087 --> 04:50.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The agreement is one of the
final acts for
Attorney General Loretta Lynch.

04:50.123 --> 04:54.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORETTA LYNCH, U.S. Attorney
General: This
consent decree is going to
empower the community

04:54.461 --> 05:01.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it will also strengthen the
police force
in their pure crime-fighting
role, as well

05:01.101 --> 05:03.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the role that engages the
community in
that.

05:03.370 --> 05:07.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with that, we hope that we
will have a
reduction in crime in Baltimore,
but more

05:07.541 --> 05:12.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
importantly an increase in the
participation
of the community in this entire
process.

05:12.879 --> 05:16.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: The agreement
comes after the
Justice Department found
Baltimore police

05:16.650 --> 05:20.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
commonly stopped poor or black
residents without
good cause.

05:20.287 --> 05:24.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Environmental
Protection
Agency accused Fiat Chrysler
today of cheating

05:24.791 --> 05:26.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on emissions testing.

05:26.660 --> 05:32.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It involves software that lets
some Ram pickups
and Jeep Grand Cherokees emit
more pollution

05:32.933 --> 05:34.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than federal law allows.

05:34.301 --> 05:38.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just yesterday, Volkswagen
pleaded guilty
to emissions cheating.

05:38.271 --> 05:43.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Americans who
really want Obamacare
repealed started to get what
they want this

05:43.210 --> 05:44.744 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
morning.

05:44.778 --> 05:48.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republican-led Senate passed
a budget
rule that amounts to a first
step.

05:48.215 --> 05:51.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Americans who want to know what
replaces Obamacare
still don't know.

05:51.585 --> 05:55.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans don't agree what to
do with millions
who gained insurance under the
law.

05:55.422 --> 06:00.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To finish the job, Republicans
need Democrats
and also president-elect Trump,
who's said

06:00.627 --> 06:04.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he wants replacement nearly
simultaneously
with repeal.

06:04.464 --> 06:09.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The storms that
brought a deluge
to parts of California are
moving on, and

06:09.369 --> 06:11.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leaving some good news in their
wake.

06:11.471 --> 06:16.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Federal officials announced
today that 42
percent of the state has now
emerged from

06:16.142 --> 06:19.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a five-year drought, thanks to
all that rain.

06:19.412 --> 06:23.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still, some Northern California
communities
remain paralyzed by flooding.

06:24.017 --> 06:27.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In towns like Hollister, the
surge took people
by surprise.

06:27.254 --> 06:31.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD SANCHEZ, California
Resident: House
is OK, but all around me, my
cars, we're stranded

06:31.992 --> 06:34.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in, unless I get like carried
out or driven
out.

06:34.694 --> 06:38.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My yard is just an ocean, but I
don't really
do agriculture or nothing.

06:38.265 --> 06:42.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's just kind of a -- until
it flows
out, man, I just got a big lake
in my backyard

06:42.402 --> 06:44.204 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for now.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Forecasters
expect the rainfall
in Northern California to taper
off after

06:47.173 --> 06:49.209 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

06:49.242 --> 06:53.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Amazon says it
plans to hire
100,000 full-time workers over
the next year-and-a-half.

06:53.513 --> 06:58.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The company intends to open
pop-up retail
stores, largely in Texas and
California.

06:58.785 --> 07:04.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amazon will grow, as traditional
brick-and-mortar
retailers like Macy's are
cutting thousands

07:04.257 --> 07:06.026 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of jobs.

07:06.059 --> 07:10.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And on Wall
Street, a drop
in bond yields sent bank stocks
into a slump,

07:10.196 --> 07:11.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and pushed down the broader
market.

07:11.765 --> 07:15.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 63 points
to close at 19891.

07:15.969 --> 07:22.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 16 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
slipped almost five.

07:22.275 --> 07:28.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
President
Obama's most trusted adviser,
Valerie Jarrett;

07:28.615 --> 07:33.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
economists grade the president's
record on
job growth; one artist's quest
to break down

07:33.653 --> 07:43.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stereotypes through dynamic
sculptures; and
much more.

07:43.930 --> 07:52.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEVE INSKEEP: Now,
President-elect Trump
has said he would like to
improve relations

07:52.305 --> 07:53.807 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Russia.

07:53.840 --> 07:58.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His choice for defense secretary
views Russia
as America's number one threat.

07:58.712 --> 07:59.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's listen to General James
Mattis at his
hearing today.

07:59.779 --> 08:01.614 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATTIS (RET.), Secretary
of Defense
Nominee: I would consider the
principal threats

08:04.050 --> 08:07.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to start with Russia.

08:07.721 --> 08:14.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it would certainly include
any nations
that are looking to intimidate
nations around

08:14.594 --> 08:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their periphery, regional
nations nearby them,
whether it be with weapons of
mass destruction

08:20.467 --> 08:27.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or I would call it unusual,
unorthodox means
of intimidating them.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Well, let's talk
about this
with Michael McFaul, who served
as ambassador

08:30.777 --> 08:33.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Russia for the United States
from 2012
to 2014.

08:33.947 --> 08:38.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is now a political science
professor at
Stanford University and senior
fellow at the

08:38.918 --> 08:40.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Hoover Institution.

08:40.787 --> 08:45.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're also joined by Evelyn
Farkas, who served
as deputy assistant secretary of
defense for

08:45.225 --> 08:48.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia from
2012 to 2015.

08:48.561 --> 08:52.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's now a senior fellow at the
Atlantic
Council, which is a Washington
security think

08:52.699 --> 08:53.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tank.

08:53.700 --> 08:54.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome to you both.

08:54.834 --> 08:56.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, Evelyn, let's start with
you.

08:56.236 --> 08:58.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is Mattis right, Russia is the
number one
threat?

08:58.972 --> 09:01.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not China, it's not North
Carolina, it's
not ISIS?

09:01.307 --> 09:03.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EVELYN FARKAS, Former Defense
Department Official:
Nope, it's not the others.

09:03.510 --> 09:06.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Actually, what is interesting
is, he mentioned
Russia by name.

09:06.613 --> 09:08.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He didn't mention the others by
name.

09:08.648 --> 09:12.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The second category he gave, of
course, could
have included Russia.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
STEVE INSKEEP: Countries
threatening their
neighbors.

09:14.020 --> 09:18.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EVELYN FARKAS: Country
threatening using unorthodox
means, like cyber-attacks,
cyber-operations,

09:19.025 --> 09:22.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
strategic communications, fake
news, et cetera.

09:22.195 --> 09:26.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it also could have included
and probably
does include North Korea, as
well as China

09:26.199 --> 09:32.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and other actors, so other
actors that decide
to emulate, to copy Russia.

09:32.505 --> 09:36.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Russia is the biggest one,
because they're
really trying to rewrite the
rules of the

09:36.109 --> 09:40.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
international order far more
than China, although
China is pushing the envelope as
well.

09:40.079 --> 09:43.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: I want the bring
Ambassador
McFaul into the conversation,
but first let's

09:43.917 --> 09:47.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hear a contrary view here, what
sounds like
a contrary view.

09:47.487 --> 09:50.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know that the president-elect
seems to
want Russia as a friend.

09:50.757 --> 09:56.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama arguably has not
wanted to
say that Russia is that great of
a threat.

09:56.529 --> 09:58.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He doesn't seem all that worried
about them.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And let's listen a little bit of
the president
in December.

10:01.000 --> 10:07.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
The Russians can't change us or
significantly

10:07.574 --> 10:09.976 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
weaken us.

10:10.009 --> 10:11.277 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They are a smaller country.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They are a weaker country.

10:13.146 --> 10:17.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their economy doesn't produce
anything that
anybody wants to buy, except oil
and gas and

10:17.917 --> 10:21.621 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
arms.

10:21.654 --> 10:26.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They don't innovate.

10:26.826 --> 10:32.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they can impact us if we
lose track of
who we are.

10:33.032 --> 10:35.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Ambassador
McFaul, that's your
former boss.

10:35.668 --> 10:37.403 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is Russia really that dangerous?

10:37.437 --> 10:40.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MCFAUL, Former U.S.
Ambassador to
Russia: Well, I think Russia is
dangerous,

10:40.039 --> 10:41.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not a superpower.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I know what the president is
trying to say.

10:43.009 --> 10:46.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I worked for him for five years,
not just
two.

10:46.446 --> 10:48.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He doesn't want us to overreact.

10:48.681 --> 10:52.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He doesn't want to go back to
the Cold War
and some superpower competition.

10:52.819 --> 10:57.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But my own view, and I think
General Mattis
stated something similar today,
is that Russia

10:57.390 --> 10:59.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is a challenge for the United
States.

10:59.259 --> 11:02.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is a threat to some of our
allies.

11:02.996 --> 11:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what means they have,
they're prepared
to use them.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's the big difference.

11:08.868 --> 11:11.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Take cyber-capabilities.

11:11.070 --> 11:13.773 align:left position:25%,start line:80% size:75%
We have way more
cyber-capability than they
do.

11:13.806 --> 11:17.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We could intervene in their
elections easily.

11:17.377 --> 11:20.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We choose not to do so because
we're a different
country.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's what Obama was trying to
say.

11:22.148 --> 11:25.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The means that Mr. Putin has,
he's not afraid
to use them.

11:25.952 --> 11:30.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: I'm remembering
the word asymmetric,
which we all had to learn after
9/11, when

11:30.823 --> 11:36.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we heard about asymmetric
threats, that al-Qaida
wasn't that large, not
conventionally powerful,

11:36.095 --> 11:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't control territory, but
they found new
ways to project power that were
extraordinarily

11:40.533 --> 11:42.268 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
dangerous.

11:42.302 --> 11:46.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this an asymmetric situation
with Russia,
where they are a relatively weak
country in

11:46.506 --> 11:49.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many ways, but they have found
new ways to
strike out at their neighbors
and at the United

11:50.009 --> 11:51.311 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States?

11:51.344 --> 11:55.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MCFAUL: I believe so, I
think in a
couple of instances.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Number one, I just mentioned
cyber.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have kinds of capabilities.

11:59.652 --> 12:04.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They use those capabilities in
different ways,
political ways, than we're
prepared to do

12:04.824 --> 12:06.526 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
so.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With respect to their military,
of course
they don't have the military
means at all

12:09.896 --> 12:12.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
compared to the United States of
America.

12:12.565 --> 12:17.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they were prepared to use
their military
to annex territory on their
neighbor and then

12:17.737 --> 12:19.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
intervene in Eastern Ukraine.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.908 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're not prepared to do that.

12:21.941 --> 12:28.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, number three, I think
something
that's really understudied and
misunderstood

12:28.081 --> 12:31.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is their use of information.

12:31.684 --> 12:37.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are very bold in the world
of information,
propagating their ideas, using
companies like

12:37.323 --> 12:39.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
R.T. and Sputnik to do that.

12:39.525 --> 12:42.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, again, they don't play by
the same rules.

12:42.295 --> 12:49.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we call news, fact vs.
fiction, they're
a lot more loose in terms of
those definitions.

12:49.135 --> 12:53.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that has a greater effect,
therefore,
because they play by different
rules.

12:53.039 --> 12:57.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Evelyn Farkas,
the Republican
critique here is that Russia is
in a weak

12:58.011 --> 13:02.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
situation, but has been
emboldened by a weak
response from the United States,
that in Ukraine,

13:02.682 --> 13:05.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that in other places, the United
States has
not stepped forward.

13:05.351 --> 13:07.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is there some justice in that
view?

13:07.086 --> 13:13.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVELYN FARKAS: I regretfully say
there is
some justice in the view,
because the only

13:13.359 --> 13:18.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thing that the Kremlin, this
cadre of people
supporting Vladimir Putin, and
Vladimir Putin

13:18.398 --> 13:22.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
himself understand is strength,
is resolve.

13:22.035 --> 13:27.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they will not stop until
they are given
the sense that the costs will be
too high

13:27.340 --> 13:29.042 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and they will have gone too far.

13:29.075 --> 13:35.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other part of this is that
Putin himself
is a bit of a risk taker, so the
invading

13:35.381 --> 13:40.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Ukraine, in the east in
particular -- Crimea
was risky, but then the east was
risky.

13:40.853 --> 13:43.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And actually then he didn't pull
it off completely.

13:43.456 --> 13:45.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And then Syria was very risky.

13:45.625 --> 13:49.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both these operations, as Mike
pointed out,
were using their military, but
they actually

13:49.495 --> 13:51.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
didn't use their whole military
either.

13:51.864 --> 13:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were pretty much economies
of force.

13:53.766 --> 13:56.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think, yes, of course we
need to be
stronger.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.304 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We need to deter the Russians.

13:58.337 --> 14:02.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to show resolve, which
is why cooperating
with them on the other hand can
be more difficult.

14:02.475 --> 14:06.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Well, let's talk
explicitly
about Russian President Vladimir
Putin and

14:06.813 --> 14:08.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
president-elect Trump.

14:08.347 --> 14:11.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President-elect Trump talked
about Putin at
his news conference yesterday.

14:11.250 --> 14:13.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's listen to a little bit of
that.

14:13.119 --> 14:17.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: If Putin
likes Donald Trump, I consider
that an asset,

14:17.457 --> 14:21.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not a liability, because we have
a horrible
relationship with Russia.

14:21.094 --> 14:24.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia can help us fight ISIS,
which, by the
way, is, number one, tricky.

14:24.797 --> 14:28.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: And I want to add
one other
thing, Ambassador McFaul,
because Donald Trump

14:28.701 --> 14:30.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sent out a tweet the other day.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm sure you noticed it.

14:32.105 --> 14:36.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He said: "Having a good
relationship with
Russia is a good thing, not a
bad thing.

14:36.809 --> 14:41.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Only stupid people or fools
would think it
was bad."

14:41.414 --> 14:42.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MCFAUL: Felt that was
directed at
me.

14:42.515 --> 14:43.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: You think it was
directed at
you?

14:43.750 --> 14:44.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's wrong with having a good
relationship
with Russia?

14:44.617 --> 14:46.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL MCFAUL: Well, first, two
things.

14:47.019 --> 14:52.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to be clear that when you
mention the
Republican critique of President
Obama, that

14:52.291 --> 14:55.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is not president-elect Trump's
critique, right?

14:55.194 --> 15:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So you have a real clash within
the Republican
Party, and I think within the
Trump administration,

15:00.767 --> 15:03.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about how to develop policy
toward Russia.

15:03.302 --> 15:08.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But here's what I would say to
that tweet:
It should never be the goal of
U.S. foreign

15:08.608 --> 15:13.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
policy towards any country to
have a -- quote,
unquote -- "good relation."

15:13.279 --> 15:14.313 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Then what?

15:14.347 --> 15:16.249 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do we get out of that?

15:16.282 --> 15:20.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We get -- Trump is helping the
approval ratings
amongst Russians.

15:20.086 --> 15:23.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How does that advance American
national security
interests?

15:23.289 --> 15:25.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think you have got to flip it
around.

15:25.191 --> 15:31.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has got to define what he
seeks to achieve
with Russia, and then use
diplomacy and sometimes

15:31.430 --> 15:33.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
coercion to achieve those ends.

15:33.633 --> 15:38.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, aside from this fight
with ISIS,
which I would just underscore,
you know, the

15:38.805 --> 15:43.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama administration has been
trying to fight
ISIS with Russia for several
years now.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no disagreement there.

15:45.778 --> 15:49.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They just have not been useful,
because the
Russians don't want the fight
ISIS in Syria.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They want to leave that to us.

15:51.250 --> 15:55.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Aside from that, I don't know
what are the
objectives that Mr. Trump seeks
in having

15:56.022 --> 15:57.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a good relationship with Mr.
Putin.

15:57.790 --> 16:01.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Well, that leads
to one more
point, Evelyn Farkas, because in
the Senate

16:01.494 --> 16:06.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hearing today, Senator John
McCain said Russia
is not going to be our friend.

16:06.332 --> 16:09.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, he said Russia wants
and needs to
be our enemy.

16:09.101 --> 16:10.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EVELYN FARKAS: Right.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: And they're not
going to cooperate
even on ISIS.

16:12.171 --> 16:14.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, what can the United States
achieve, then?

16:14.473 --> 16:18.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVELYN FARKAS: I mean, we can
try to get them
to cooperate on ISIS, but, as
Mike pointed

16:18.411 --> 16:22.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out, we spent months in the
administration
trying to get them to cooperate
on terrorism,

16:22.315 --> 16:25.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually starting with the Sochi
Olympics,
where it was on their territory.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You would have thought they
would have wanted
to cooperate.

16:27.520 --> 16:31.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think you pointed to a
very important
point we need to bear in mind,
which is the

16:31.524 --> 16:33.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Russian domestic situation.

16:33.559 --> 16:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2018, Vladimir Putin will be
up for reelection,
and he has shifted his whole
political strategy

16:41.067 --> 16:45.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inside of Russia from one where
he promised
the Russians pretty much a
chicken in every

16:45.271 --> 16:47.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pot, a better economic way of
life.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's now nationalist.

16:49.709 --> 16:53.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what he does is, he tells
the Russian
people, OK, you may have a
little less chicken

16:53.179 --> 16:56.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in your pot, but I'm making
Russia great again.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Look what we're doing all other
the world.

16:58.050 --> 16:59.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Everyone is paying attention to
us.

16:59.986 --> 17:03.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Russia is a great power, on
par with the
United States and others.

17:03.923 --> 17:08.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And he -- and the
anti-Americanism is rampant
in Russia right now.

17:08.227 --> 17:09.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He can tone it back.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's going to have to tone it
back if he wants
a good relationship with Donald
Trump, but

17:12.698 --> 17:16.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's going to have to probably
shift back
to that again, because the
Russian people

17:16.502 --> 17:20.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are not going to be interested
in having a
guy give them a raw economic
deal for another

17:20.539 --> 17:22.241 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
term.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Ambassador
McFaul, is there
just one thing you can name that
the United

17:24.477 --> 17:26.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
States could deal with Russia
on?

17:26.145 --> 17:29.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MCFAUL: Well, of course
we can deal
with them on counterterrorism.

17:29.415 --> 17:31.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have and I think we are right
now.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.718 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's easy.

17:32.752 --> 17:38.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think in other economic and
trade issues,
under the right conditions.

17:38.424 --> 17:41.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, again, I guess I want to
really emphasize
this point.

17:41.894 --> 17:46.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Vladimir Putin knows exactly
what he wants
from this relationship.

17:46.232 --> 17:52.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In return for good relations, he
wants lifting
of sanctions, ratification,
approval of his

17:52.071 --> 17:57.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wars in Ukraine and Syria, and
his dream of
dreams, an acknowledgment of his
sphere of

17:57.243 --> 18:00.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
influence in Ukraine and the
former Soviet
Union.

18:00.212 --> 18:03.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That, to me, is a bad deal.

18:03.115 --> 18:06.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once he understands that we're
not going to
take that deal, then we can move
on to these

18:06.619 --> 18:10.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other things, but, first and
foremost, he
wants to test that proposition.

18:10.823 --> 18:15.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's waiting to see what
President Trump
will do when given that deal on
offer.

18:15.895 --> 18:18.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Michael McFaul is
a former
U.S. ambassador to Russia.

18:19.031 --> 18:22.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Evelyn Farkas is a former
Pentagon official
here in our studios.

18:22.969 --> 18:26.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks to you both.

18:26.706 --> 18:32.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EVELYN FARKAS: Thank you very
much.

18:32.278 --> 18:38.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Moving away from
Russia, Mr.
Trump's picks to lead the CIA
and Department

18:38.084 --> 18:43.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Defense shed light on where
the new administration
stands on a number of other
fronts.

18:43.389 --> 18:44.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Margaret Warner has the story.

18:44.590 --> 18:45.791 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN MCCAIN (R), Arizona: I for
one, could
not be happier.

18:47.693 --> 18:51.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Retired General
Mattis was
clearly in friendly territory
before the Senate

18:51.831 --> 18:53.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Armed Services Committee.

18:53.799 --> 18:59.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the conversation turned
deadly serious
on the many non-Russia threats
to the U.S.

18:59.605 --> 19:01.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Committee Chairman John McCain
on China:

19:01.474 --> 19:03.242 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

19:03.275 --> 19:06.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MCCAIN: We see a new
assertiveness in
China to confront U.S. allies
and partners,

19:06.312 --> 19:12.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make vast territorial claims
with no basis
in international law, carve out
spheres of

19:12.251 --> 19:13.185 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
influence.

19:13.219 --> 19:14.954 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATTIS (RET.), Secretary
of Defense
Nominee: And I would just say
that what we

19:16.922 --> 19:21.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have got to do is maintain a
very strong military,
so our diplomats are always
engaging from

19:21.594 --> 19:25.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a position of strength when we
deal with a
rising power.

19:25.331 --> 19:29.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: On Syria and
efforts to retake
the Islamic State stronghold
there:

19:29.869 --> 19:31.637 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

19:31.670 --> 19:38.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MCCAIN: Do you believe that
we have a
strategy that will allow us to
regain control

19:38.611 --> 19:39.578 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Raqqa?

19:39.612 --> 19:40.579 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES MATTIS: I believe we do,
sir.

19:42.314 --> 19:49.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, I believe that strategy
needs to
be reviewed and perhaps
energized on a more

19:49.822 --> 19:51.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
aggressive timeline.

19:51.557 --> 19:56.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: And on a
long-contentious
topic, Mattis' opposition
post-retirement

19:56.362 --> 19:59.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to letting women serve in combat
roles, as
they do today.

19:59.398 --> 20:01.267 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:01.300 --> 20:03.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D), New
York: Do you plan
to oppose women serving in these
combat roles?

20:03.335 --> 20:04.837 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

20:04.870 --> 20:07.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES MATTIS: I have no plan to
oppose women
in any aspect of our military.

20:07.840 --> 20:12.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The panel's top
Democrat,
Rhode Island's Jack Reed, noted
Mattis has

20:12.478 --> 20:17.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
publicly supported sticking with
the Iran
nuclear deal that
president-elect Donald Trump

20:17.349 --> 20:18.317 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has derided.

20:18.350 --> 20:19.718 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:19.752 --> 20:20.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACK REED (D), Rhode Island: We
have to essentially
stay the course.

20:20.319 --> 20:21.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that still your view?

20:21.387 --> 20:22.721 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

20:22.755 --> 20:25.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES MATTIS: I think it is an
imperfect arms
control agreement.

20:25.991 --> 20:28.360 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not a friendship treaty.

20:28.394 --> 20:31.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when America gives her word,
we have to
live up to it.

20:31.597 --> 20:35.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The Iran deal
also came up
in the Intelligence Committee's
hearing for

20:35.267 --> 20:39.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Congressman Mike Pompeo as CIA
chief.

20:39.338 --> 20:40.906 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrat Martin Heinrich of New
Mexico:

20:40.940 --> 20:42.708 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:42.741 --> 20:45.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN HEINRICH (D), New Mexico:
I know that
the day before you were
nominated to be the

20:45.177 --> 20:50.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
director, you said that you
looked forward
to -- quote -- "rolling back the
Iran deal."

20:50.483 --> 20:52.318 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

20:52.351 --> 20:53.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE POMPEO (R), Kansas: It was
my view that
the JCPOA was a mistake for
American national

20:53.886 --> 20:55.654 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
security.

20:55.688 --> 20:59.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now, if I'm confirmed, I
will continue
to do that in my role as
director of the CIA.

20:59.592 --> 21:04.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will endeavor to provide
straight information
to you all about the progress
that the JCPOA

21:04.096 --> 21:06.031 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has made.

21:06.065 --> 21:09.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: California
Democrat Dianne
Feinstein brought up the CIA's
brutal interrogations

21:09.869 --> 21:13.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of suspected terrorists, now
outlawed by Congress.

21:13.072 --> 21:14.940 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:14.974 --> 21:18.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D),
California: If you were
ordered by the president to
restart the CIA's

21:18.677 --> 21:24.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
use of enhanced interrogation
techniques that
fall outside of the Army Field
Manual, would

21:24.583 --> 21:25.551 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you comply?

21:25.584 --> 21:26.552 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

21:26.585 --> 21:29.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE POMPEO: Senator, absolutely
not.

21:29.155 --> 21:33.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Moreover, I can't imagine that I
would be
asked that by the
president-elect.

21:33.893 --> 21:39.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The committee
will vote recommending
Pompeo's confirmation to the
full Senate.

21:39.431 --> 21:44.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Mattis, the Senate voted
overwhelmingly
for a waiver to allow him to
serve as secretary

21:44.537 --> 21:48.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of defense less than seven years
after retiring
from the military.

21:48.607 --> 21:55.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

21:55.214 --> 22:06.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we continue
our look at
the Obama years.

22:06.458 --> 22:10.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the president had a
surprise parting
gift for Joe Biden.

22:10.796 --> 22:15.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He presented the vice president
with the highest
award a civilian can receive:
the Presidential

22:16.001 --> 22:17.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Medal of Freedom.

22:17.870 --> 22:22.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Behind the scenes, Joe's candid,
honest counsel

22:22.408 --> 22:26.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has made me a better president
and a better
commander in chief.

22:26.045 --> 22:31.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From the Situation Room, to our
weekly lunches,
to our huddles after, when
everybody else

22:31.917 --> 22:38.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has cleared out of the room, he
has been unafraid
to give it to me straight, even
if we disagree,

22:38.958 --> 22:42.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in fact, especially when we
disagree.

22:42.394 --> 22:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all of this makes him, I
believe, the
finest vice president we have
ever seen.

22:47.266 --> 22:50.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I also think he has been a
lion of American
history.

22:50.869 --> 22:55.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Another person
who has been
by the president's side for the
entire ride

22:55.307 --> 22:58.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is his senior adviser, Valerie
Jarrett.

22:58.210 --> 23:02.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We sat down at the White House
earlier today,
and I began by asking what it
will feel like

23:02.681 --> 23:04.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to walk away after eight years.

23:04.450 --> 23:06.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
VALERIE JARRETT, Senior
Presidential Adviser:
Oh, my gosh.

23:06.585 --> 23:08.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, there's an enormous amount
of emotion.

23:08.387 --> 23:13.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, it's been the
privilege of a
lifetime to be able to serve our
country from

23:13.125 --> 23:17.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the White House, to serve this
president,
who I have now known for 26
years.

23:17.763 --> 23:20.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's hard to leave.

23:20.132 --> 23:21.967 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But it's fine.

23:22.001 --> 23:25.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you're
turning the White
House over to someone who has
said he wants

23:25.170 --> 23:30.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to undo, dismantle most of what
happened during
the Obama administration.

23:30.643 --> 23:36.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just last night, the United
States Senate
took another step toward repeal
of Obamacare,

23:36.215 --> 23:39.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Affordable Care Act.

23:39.285 --> 23:44.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a budget vote, which
is going to
lead to other steps, which will
lead to repeal.

23:44.923 --> 23:50.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Just yesterday, the
president-elect called
Obamacare a complete and total
disaster.

23:50.362 --> 23:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALERIE JARRETT: I would really
look at the
Affordable Care Act through the
lens of the

23:54.166 --> 23:58.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many, many people across our
country who I
have had the privilege of
meeting, many of

23:58.904 --> 24:01.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who wouldn't be here were it not
for the Affordable
Care Act.

24:01.140 --> 24:05.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think it's very easy to
say repeal
and replace, but we have been
encouraging

24:05.377 --> 24:09.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Republicans, since the
president first
started embarking on this
effort, to put in

24:09.715 --> 24:14.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
place a plan for affordable care
to come up
with their best ideas.

24:14.320 --> 24:20.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have had, what, 50, 60
votes to repeal,
and not a single replacement
plan.

24:20.159 --> 24:21.493 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
So...

24:21.527 --> 24:23.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, they say
that's what
they're going to do.

24:23.329 --> 24:25.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're going to get rid of
what's there now
and replace it with something
much better.

24:25.397 --> 24:27.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VALERIE JARRETT: Well, what's
the something
much better?

24:27.399 --> 24:28.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's my question.

24:29.001 --> 24:31.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's the question the
president has been
asking for eight years right
now.

24:31.337 --> 24:33.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if there is a something
better, let's
hear it.

24:34.006 --> 24:35.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's the secret?

24:35.674 --> 24:39.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As he said last week when we had
an event
focusing just on the Affordable
Care Act,

24:39.244 --> 24:40.212 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
show me.

24:40.245 --> 24:41.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Show us all the plan.

24:41.447 --> 24:43.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have had eight years to come
up with a
replacement.

24:43.782 --> 24:45.551 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Where is it?

24:45.584 --> 24:49.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there any
other piece of
the Obama legacy, whether it's
immigration,

24:49.655 --> 24:56.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether it's the executive
orders that the
president implemented, any other
issue or

24:56.795 --> 25:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
step taken that you think stands
a good chance
of surviving under the Trump
administration?

25:01.734 --> 25:03.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VALERIE JARRETT: Well, you
mentioned immigration.

25:03.569 --> 25:08.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, obviously, the president
granted relief
to the young people who entered
our country

25:08.374 --> 25:12.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through no fault of their own,
who have grown
up as American citizens, and who
he thinks

25:12.778 --> 25:14.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have a right to stay here.

25:14.913 --> 25:17.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we would hope that they
would allow that
to move forward.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think campaigns are one thing.

25:19.651 --> 25:24.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And let's just see what happens
after the
president-elect takes office and
the realities

25:24.857 --> 25:28.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the plight of so many people
around our
country really begin to sink in.

25:28.394 --> 25:32.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
has said he
doesn't view the election result
as a personal

25:32.731 --> 25:39.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
repudiation, but how is it not,
when he campaigned
around the country saying, this
is about what

25:39.405 --> 25:40.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have done, this is about my
work?

25:40.773 --> 25:43.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VALERIE JARRETT: Well, he wasn't
actually
on the ballot.

25:43.308 --> 25:48.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we did learn is that his
popularity, which
is at a high, wasn't
transferable.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, obviously, that's
disappointing to him.

25:50.949 --> 25:57.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He and the first lady worked
really hard to
help Secretary Clinton win, and
they were

25:57.055 --> 25:58.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not successful in that event.

25:58.323 --> 26:00.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I don't think that that
really reflects
a repudiation.

26:00.659 --> 26:06.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is so much about what's
happened over
the last eight years that I
think has the

26:06.064 --> 26:09.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
support of the American people,
that I think
it will be harder than it looks
to reverse

26:09.868 --> 26:11.603 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that progress.

26:11.637 --> 26:14.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president has
said that
he believes race relations in
America are

26:14.840 --> 26:17.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
better than when he took office.

26:17.509 --> 26:19.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's clearly some debate
about that.

26:19.945 --> 26:20.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Some don't agree.

26:20.946 --> 26:22.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you see that?

26:22.748 --> 26:26.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALERIE JARRETT: I think what
the president
said is race relations are
better when you

26:26.185 --> 26:32.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look at the arc of our history,
that we have
constantly been making
improvements.

26:32.224 --> 26:36.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we have seen since he was
elected is,
thanks to the video camera, a
lot more evidence

26:36.762 --> 26:38.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of tensions that still exist.

26:38.764 --> 26:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those tensions were there before
we had a
video camera.

26:40.999 --> 26:45.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We just didn't see them on the
news and in
the social media the way we are
today.

26:45.737 --> 26:50.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it takes time to change our
culture, and
it's a work in progress.

26:50.209 --> 26:55.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And simply by electing an
African-American
president doesn't suddenly make
our election

26:55.113 --> 26:57.015 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
post-racial.

26:57.049 --> 27:00.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In his farewell
address this
week in Chicago -- you were
there -- the president

27:00.319 --> 27:04.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talked about threats to American
democracy
now.

27:04.723 --> 27:06.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is he referring to Donald Trump?

27:06.592 --> 27:09.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALERIE JARRETT: No, I think
what he is saying
is, look, in order for us to
make our country

27:09.895 --> 27:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as strong as it has to be, the
founding fathers
understood that democracy means
we have to

27:15.033 --> 27:16.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all participate in it.

27:16.768 --> 27:22.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those self-evident principles of
life and
liberty, pursuit of happiness,
they're not

27:22.040 --> 27:23.375 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
self-executing.

27:23.408 --> 27:25.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They require each of us to get
engaged.

27:25.544 --> 27:30.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what he is really concerned
about is to
ensure that the American people
appreciate

27:31.016 --> 27:33.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their power to influence the
democracy.

27:33.252 --> 27:39.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president is
leaving office
with a high approval rating,
over 50 percent.

27:39.157 --> 27:41.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's getting credit from many
quarters.

27:41.426 --> 27:46.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is also criticism out
there, including
from Democrats, that he didn't
do enough to

27:46.398 --> 27:50.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reach out to members of Congress
to get his
agenda accomplished, that he
should have done

27:50.269 --> 27:53.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more, gone the extra mile.

27:53.305 --> 27:55.073 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that a fair criticism?

27:55.107 --> 27:58.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALERIE JARRETT: Well, you know,
Judy, I have
been here since day one, January
20 of 2009.

27:58.377 --> 28:01.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have watched how hard the
president
has worked.

28:01.146 --> 28:05.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have watched how every single
day, he comes
to the office focused on one
thing, and that's

28:05.951 --> 28:08.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what's in the best interest of
the American
people.

28:08.186 --> 28:09.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He has rolled up his sleeves.

28:09.755 --> 28:12.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's worked as hard as I have
ever seen a
president work.

28:12.658 --> 28:15.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that includes his outreach
the members
of Congress.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, should we have done more?

28:17.029 --> 28:19.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, of course, you always wish
you could
do more.

28:19.398 --> 28:20.999 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The work is never finished.

28:21.033 --> 28:22.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think he's proud of his
record.

28:22.901 --> 28:29.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You have been at
moments critical
of Republicans for not attending
state dinners,

28:29.374 --> 28:34.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for not participating in some of
the events
that they were invited to by
this White House,

28:34.980 --> 28:38.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for not engaging more in the
other direction.

28:38.116 --> 28:41.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Right now, the Democrats are on
the outs.

28:41.119 --> 28:42.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Should they engage?

28:42.321 --> 28:44.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VALERIE JARRETT: Well, I think
they will.

28:44.389 --> 28:49.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I think part of what we
have learned
certainly over the course of the
last eight

28:49.494 --> 28:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years is, if the Republicans had
engaged,
even though we're very proud of
the progress

28:54.633 --> 28:56.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we have made, we would be so
much further.

28:56.768 --> 29:00.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what I observed in my
criticism really,
Judy, was much deeper than
whether or not

29:00.739 --> 29:04.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they attend a state dinner,
although I can't
imagine why anyone wouldn't want
to come and

29:04.109 --> 29:07.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
represent our country when we
are inviting
foreign dignitaries here.

29:07.879 --> 29:13.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the real point is, they put
their short-term
political interests ahead of
what was best

29:13.452 --> 29:15.253 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for our country.

29:15.287 --> 29:18.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Vice President
Biden said the
other day, when I spoke with
him, he said:

29:18.724 --> 29:25.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were not clear enough in this
election
that we understood the pressure
working people,

29:25.097 --> 29:29.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
working Americans were under,
and that we
had concrete solutions to that.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We never got that across to
them.

29:31.970 --> 29:35.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VALERIE JARRETT: Yes, we had a
hard time getting
that message out.

29:35.607 --> 29:39.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there was -- it's troubling,
Judy, because
there was a disconnect between
the policies

29:39.444 --> 29:47.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the president has embraced
since he was
first campaigning back in 2007
and '8, and

29:47.185 --> 29:51.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the feeling that many people
have that those
policies were not meant for
them.

29:51.723 --> 29:53.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But they certainly were.

29:53.558 --> 29:57.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The president has always
believed in growing
the middle class, providing room
for everybody.

29:57.663 --> 29:59.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so it's certainly what the
president believes.

29:59.998 --> 30:04.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think what the vice
president said and
what the president believes is,
is that the

30:04.169 --> 30:06.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democratic Party has to do a
better job of
reaching out.

30:06.071 --> 30:10.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Donald Trump has
tweeted a
few times in December about the
economy.

30:10.676 --> 30:14.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At one point, he wrote: "The
world was gloomy
before I won.

30:14.579 --> 30:15.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There was no hope.

30:15.580 --> 30:18.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now the market is up nearly 10
percent.

30:18.116 --> 30:20.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Christmas spending is over $1
trillion."

30:20.485 --> 30:23.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In another tweet, he took credit
for rising
consumer confidence.

30:23.188 --> 30:28.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALERIE JARRETT: I think that,
if you look
at what has happened over the
last eight years,

30:28.660 --> 30:33.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in large part due to the grit
and determination
of the American people, we have
rebuilt our

30:33.665 --> 30:35.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
economy, and it is strong.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're real proud that we're
going to turn
it over in as good a shape as
it's in.

30:38.003 --> 30:41.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, no particular
reaction
to what he said?

30:41.073 --> 30:42.941 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He was wrong?

30:42.974 --> 30:48.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALERIE JARRETT: Well, what
incoming president
who is enjoying a good economy
wouldn't want

30:48.847 --> 30:50.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to figure out how they can take
credit for
it?

30:50.782 --> 30:52.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that's par for the
course.

30:52.651 --> 30:57.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As new
information is coming
out about Russian interference
in the election,

30:57.489 --> 31:01.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in retrospect, should President
Obama have
called out the Russians earlier?

31:01.059 --> 31:03.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had information earlier that
this was going
on.

31:03.695 --> 31:07.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALERIE JARRETT: You know, he --
the one thing
I can say to you about the
president is that

31:07.999 --> 31:09.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he is thoughtful.

31:09.634 --> 31:11.303 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's deliberate.

31:11.336 --> 31:14.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He takes in all the information
he has, and
then he makes the best judgment
he can.

31:14.573 --> 31:17.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's very comfortable with
the decision
he made.

31:17.542 --> 31:23.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Has his thinking
changed about
what he's going to do after
being president,

31:23.048 --> 31:25.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after being in office, given the
result?

31:25.350 --> 31:28.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Does he feel more of a
responsibility now
to go out and defend his legacy?

31:28.286 --> 31:33.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALERIE JARRETT: I think he will
speak out
when he thinks his voice can
move the needle,

31:33.492 --> 31:38.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make a difference, and be an
inspiration to
those who are looking for
positive change

31:39.030 --> 31:39.998 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in our country.

31:40.031 --> 31:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what about
Valerie Jarrett?

31:41.867 --> 31:46.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I saw you quoted as saying you
were going
to be moving between your
hometown of Chicago,

31:46.438 --> 31:49.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Washington, where your daughter
is, and some
other places.

31:49.274 --> 31:50.242 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What about you?

31:50.275 --> 31:51.743 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VALERIE JARRETT: Lots of sleep.

31:51.777 --> 31:55.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, after I have had some
rest, I will
make some decisions.

31:55.046 --> 31:58.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you think you
will continue
to work with President Obama and
Mrs. Obama?

31:58.350 --> 32:02.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALERIE JARRETT: Oh, I will help
President
Obama and Mrs. Obama for the
rest of my life

32:02.921 --> 32:04.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in any way that I can.

32:04.122 --> 32:06.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Run for public
office?

32:06.458 --> 32:07.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VALERIE JARRETT: You know what?

32:07.926 --> 32:10.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're not first person who has
asked me that
question.

32:10.629 --> 32:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I toyed with it, as you would
probably remember,
when the president was elected
and there was

32:14.933 --> 32:16.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a vacancy in his seat.

32:16.735 --> 32:20.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he appealed to me and said:
You know,
I know what it's like in the
Senate.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know what I want to do
here in the White
House.

32:23.108 --> 32:24.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think you will be happier
here.

32:24.910 --> 32:25.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And, boy, was he right.

32:25.911 --> 32:26.878 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, we will see.

32:26.912 --> 32:28.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you're not
ruling it out?

32:28.713 --> 32:33.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALERIE JARRETT: I'm not ruling
out anything
right now, because I know, after
eight years

32:33.418 --> 32:41.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here, you are not in a position
to make any
really important, long decisions
that affect

32:41.493 --> 32:42.460 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your life.

32:42.494 --> 32:43.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I know that I need some rest.

32:43.495 --> 32:45.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I need to gain some perspective.

32:45.230 --> 32:49.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I still want to continue to work
on issues
that I care a great deal about,
and to be

32:49.501 --> 32:51.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as helpful as I can.

32:51.336 --> 32:56.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, whether that leads me to
elected office,
or whether it leads me to help a
not-for-profit

32:56.041 --> 32:58.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's trying to do something
important, we
will see.

32:58.343 --> 33:05.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Valerie Jarrett,
thank you
so much.

33:05.717 --> 33:19.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: We're going to
dig a little
deeper now into the economic
legacy of President

33:19.364 --> 33:21.132 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Obama.

33:21.166 --> 33:24.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He came into office at a
desperate moment,
amid a financial crisis and the
great recession.

33:24.836 --> 33:28.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's gotten some of the credit
for a long
and sustained recovery.

33:28.240 --> 33:32.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are just as many
questions about
whether he took the right steps
and helped

33:32.244 --> 33:33.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the right people.

33:33.545 --> 33:36.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For many people, wages are only
now starting
to climb.

33:36.848 --> 33:40.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Economics correspondent Paul
Solman has the
story, part of his weekly series
on Thursdays,

33:40.986 --> 33:43.655 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Making Sense.

33:43.688 --> 33:49.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
And it is good to be back in
Chicago.

33:49.794 --> 33:51.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

33:51.229 --> 33:52.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: President Obama in
2010 at Ford's
Chicago assembly plant.

33:53.031 --> 33:58.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: The year before I
took office,
this industry lost hundreds of
thousands of

33:58.536 --> 34:00.539 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
jobs.

34:00.572 --> 34:05.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sales plunged 40 percent -- 40
percent.

34:05.977 --> 34:11.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two of the big three automakers,
GM and Chrysler,
were on the brink of
liquidation.

34:11.383 --> 34:13.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

34:13.318 --> 34:19.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: And I'm convinced
-- I'm convinced
we're going to rebuild not only
the auto industry,

34:19.958 --> 34:23.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but the economy better and
stronger than before.

34:23.161 --> 34:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at its heart is going to be
three powerful
words: Made in America.

34:28.400 --> 34:29.367 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Made in America.

34:29.401 --> 34:31.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

34:31.236 --> 34:35.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And, indeed, say
local union
officials, nine years after the
crash of '08:

34:35.206 --> 34:38.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS PENA, Union President: We
have more
people working in our facility
than we ever

34:38.076 --> 34:39.411 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have now.

34:39.444 --> 34:42.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have also been working
24/7 on three
production shifts.

34:42.714 --> 34:46.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT HOULDIESON, UAW Local 551:
There wouldn't
be an auto industry that looks
like what we

34:46.318 --> 34:48.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have today had it not been for
the bailout.

34:48.887 --> 34:53.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Ever since Obama
then, the U.S.
auto industry has been going
gangbusters,

34:53.992 --> 34:55.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the stock market too.

34:55.827 --> 34:58.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDY WILLIAMS JR., Foreclosure
Activist: You
will see a lot of houses will be
boarded up.

34:58.096 --> 35:02.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But when it comes
to victims
of the housing collapse, says
foreclosure

35:02.500 --> 35:04.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
activist Andy Williams Jr.:

35:04.202 --> 35:05.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDY WILLIAMS JR.: Look at our
conditions
in our neighborhood.

35:05.603 --> 35:06.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's still terrible.

35:06.604 --> 35:08.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It still needs to be
revitalized.

35:08.740 --> 35:13.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So what is the
economic legacy
of Barack Obama?

35:13.912 --> 35:17.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Robust recovery, or too little,
too late?

35:17.615 --> 35:23.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the shadow of Chicago's Trump
Tower, at
the annual convening of the
economics profession,

35:23.955 --> 35:27.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we assembled a panel to assess
the record.

35:27.459 --> 35:31.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cecilia Rouse served on the
president's Council
of Economic Advisers from 2009
to 2011.

35:31.629 --> 35:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CECILIA ROUSE, Former Council of
Economic
Advisers Member: I think that
what President

35:35.166 --> 35:39.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama did was, he rescued an
economy that
was in freefall.

35:39.037 --> 35:41.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that he saved us
from a great
depression.

35:42.007 --> 35:46.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, we would love for
economic growth
to have been more robust in the
years since.

35:46.511 --> 35:48.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think it has been a
success.

35:48.046 --> 35:50.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Alan Krueger also
served on the
Council.

35:50.515 --> 35:51.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN KRUEGER, Former Chairman,
White House
Council of Economic Advisers: We
have had

35:51.750 --> 35:53.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
75 straight months of job
growth.

35:53.618 --> 35:58.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over 15 million jobs have been
added; 22 million
more people have health
insurance coverage

35:58.256 --> 36:00.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than they did before.

36:00.091 --> 36:04.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's in spite of the fact that
many of the
tools that President Obama
requested to help

36:04.529 --> 36:09.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strengthen the recovery, like
investing more
in infrastructure or raising the
minimum wage,

36:09.601 --> 36:11.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Congress refused to act on.

36:11.603 --> 36:16.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But from the left,
Darrick Hamilton,
president of the mostly
African-American National

36:16.341 --> 36:18.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Economic Association, begged to
differ.

36:18.676 --> 36:21.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARRICK HAMILTON, President,
National Economic
Association: I would say it was
a missed opportunity.

36:22.013 --> 36:27.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He certainly faced a catastrophe
when he came
into office, but nothing
fundamentally changed

36:27.285 --> 36:29.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the trajectory towards
inequality.

36:29.254 --> 36:34.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we characterize an economy as
being in
a catastrophe at unemployment
rates greater

36:34.826 --> 36:38.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than 8 percent, the black
unemployment rate
is still above 8 percent.

36:39.030 --> 36:44.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, frankly, black Americans are
still in
a great depression, or great
recession at

36:44.869 --> 36:46.704 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the very least.

36:46.738 --> 36:50.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Glenn Hubbard, who
ran President
George W. Bush's economic
council, differed

36:50.942 --> 36:52.710 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from the right.

36:52.744 --> 36:53.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GLENN HUBBARD, Former Chairman,
White House
Council of Economic Advisers: I
think there

36:53.611 --> 36:55.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
were two very big missed
opportunities.

36:55.246 --> 36:58.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The first was a failure by the
Obama administration
to focus on economic growth.

36:58.850 --> 37:03.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's a second missed
opportunity that's
really bipartisan, and I think
Republicans

37:03.188 --> 37:06.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
share blame in as well, which is
the failure
to support work.

37:06.991 --> 37:10.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need to support work by
low-skilled people.

37:10.261 --> 37:12.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's not a free lunch.

37:12.063 --> 37:16.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is a dramatic expansion in
the Earned
Income Tax Credit, particularly
for childless

37:16.568 --> 37:20.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
workers, who would typically be
younger men
and women entering the labor
force.

37:20.672 --> 37:26.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Let's take these
alleged missed
opportunities in turn, starting
with continuing

37:26.111 --> 37:28.813 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inequality, especially for
African-Americans.

37:28.847 --> 37:34.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CECILIA ROUSE: In fact,
President Obama has
put in more policies to try to
pull that back,

37:34.719 --> 37:37.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through increased improvements
in the EITC,
through the Affordable Care Act.

37:38.022 --> 37:40.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: That's the Earned
Income Tax
Credit.

37:40.325 --> 37:43.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CECILIA ROUSE: The tax credit,
so that we
actually saw more progress on
reducing inequality

37:43.361 --> 37:46.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than had been made in -- since I
think the
Johnson administration.

37:46.798 --> 37:52.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN KRUEGER: Last year, we saw
the strongest
median income growth since the
Bureau of Labor

37:52.770 --> 37:54.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Statistics has been collecting
data.

37:54.839 --> 37:58.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw the biggest drop in
poverty since they
started collecting, since the
1960s.

37:58.943 --> 38:03.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CECILIA ROUSE: Yes, the
African-American unemployment
rate is unacceptably high.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It came down from a high of 16.8
percent.

38:05.850 --> 38:07.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's down to 7.9 percent.

38:07.852 --> 38:09.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do we need to do more?

38:09.387 --> 38:10.855 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Absolutely.

38:10.889 --> 38:12.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there has been progress, and
I think it's
important to recognize that.

38:12.891 --> 38:13.858 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PAUL SOLMAN: No?

38:13.892 --> 38:15.660 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's not true?

38:15.693 --> 38:18.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARRICK HAMILTON: Well, we
consider the types
of jobs and the fact that it is
still 7.9

38:18.229 --> 38:20.064 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
percent.

38:20.098 --> 38:23.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then if we invoke the
paramount indicator
of economic security, wealth,
then we know

38:23.801 --> 38:27.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's virtually no progress
that's been
made under the Barack Obama
administration.

38:27.071 --> 38:29.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So I'm looking at
the numbers
here.

38:29.941 --> 38:38.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since 2007, November of 2007,
jobs added by
race or ethnicity, Hispanic,
five million,

38:38.383 --> 38:44.589 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
almost, black,
two-point-something million,
Asians, same, white down by a
million jobs,

38:44.622 --> 38:46.391 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
just about.

38:46.424 --> 38:51.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, wouldn't you, if you were a
rural white
American, think this
administration simply

38:51.829 --> 38:53.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
didn't do anything for me?

38:53.464 --> 38:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DARRICK HAMILTON: That's a
delusion.

38:55.366 --> 39:00.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The notion that white Americans
are suffering,
well, they're facing greater
competition than

39:00.371 --> 39:01.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they have perhaps in the past.

39:01.940 --> 39:04.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It still doesn't fundamentally
change the
structure of where we are.

39:04.876 --> 39:13.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But hasn't white
America under
the Obama administration been
left behind,

39:13.885 --> 39:16.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or certainly feel that it's been
left behind?

39:16.821 --> 39:21.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN KRUEGER: Look, we lost over
eight million
jobs in 2008 and 2009.

39:21.993 --> 39:25.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was a very big hole to dig
our way out
of.

39:25.563 --> 39:28.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The trend would've been much
worse if we'd
not -- had not started on the
recovery.

39:28.900 --> 39:33.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, the president proposed
in the American
Jobs Act additional
infrastructure spending,

39:34.005 --> 39:39.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
support for state and local
governments, which
Congress only enacted a small
part of.

39:39.410 --> 39:41.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Still, said the
critics from
the left and right:

39:41.980 --> 39:46.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GLENN HUBBARD: A long-term
infrastructure
program would have made a great
deal of sense,

39:46.384 --> 39:48.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and frankly still does today.

39:48.686 --> 39:50.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that's not what the Obama
administration
proposed.

39:50.788 --> 39:56.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we need to have a more
holistic structural
agenda for lower-income
Americans, rather

39:56.761 --> 40:00.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than just treating it as a
problem of recession
and recovery.

40:00.164 --> 40:05.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The advice would be to focus on
skill development
and on support for work.

40:05.136 --> 40:07.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DARRICK HAMILTON: And Glenn --
Glenn actually
proposed Something.

40:07.872 --> 40:13.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said, had the original jobs
bill around
infrastructure had been targeted
to be more

40:13.478 --> 40:16.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
permanent, that that could've
fundamentally
changed the structure of the
economy.

40:17.015 --> 40:21.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CECILIA ROUSE: I want to just
jump in on the
skills development, because
there was increases

40:21.286 --> 40:24.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the Pell Grant to make them
more available
to more students.

40:24.722 --> 40:26.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There were investments in
student loans.

40:26.891 --> 40:28.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALAN KRUEGER: And record high
school graduation.

40:28.259 --> 40:30.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CECILIA ROUSE: And record high
school graduation
rates last year.

40:30.695 --> 40:33.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the administration was
focused on skills
development.

40:33.298 --> 40:36.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we would have liked to
have done more,
but, again, we were working with
a Congress

40:36.434 --> 40:37.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that wasn't so cooperative.

40:37.835 --> 40:39.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Isn't that fair?

40:39.737 --> 40:42.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GLENN HUBBARD: I think the Obama
administration
did make several efforts in
skill development.

40:42.507 --> 40:45.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just don't think there was
enough of a structural
focus.

40:45.677 --> 40:51.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We just had a presidential
election that shook
the country, because I think the
view that

40:51.282 --> 40:56.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many economic elites had on both
sides of
the aisle wasn't that connected
with the skills

40:56.387 --> 40:58.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and employment prospects of many
Americans.

40:58.823 --> 41:02.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I think, while the
administration made
some progress, it clearly wasn't
enough.

41:02.627 --> 41:05.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN KRUEGER: Don't forget, it
wasn't the
president who was on the ballot.

41:05.596 --> 41:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Democratic candidate did
receive three
million more votes.

41:09.267 --> 41:13.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think it's difficult to
interpret the
election as a reflection of the
president's

41:13.604 --> 41:15.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
economic agenda and his economic
results.

41:15.707 --> 41:16.874 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PAUL SOLMAN: No?

41:16.908 --> 41:18.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GLENN HUBBARD: I disagree with
that.

41:18.376 --> 41:22.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Republicans control the
Congress and the
White House.

41:22.180 --> 41:26.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't think history will
be that kind
to the latter part of the
administration's

41:26.317 --> 41:27.418 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
legacy.

41:27.452 --> 41:28.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DARRICK HAMILTON: I mean, I
would agree with
Glenn.

41:28.619 --> 41:30.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I can't believe I keep saying
that.

41:30.121 --> 41:31.856 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:31.889 --> 41:34.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARRICK HAMILTON: I would agree
with Glenn,
in that Obama's economic legacy
was on the

41:34.359 --> 41:35.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
table in this election.

41:35.993 --> 41:39.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump put it on the table, front
and center,
along with a lot of other
things.

41:39.464 --> 41:42.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think Obama actually
campaigned to defend
his economic legacy.

41:42.900 --> 41:48.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We needed bolder, stronger, more
fundamental,
not tinkering, ideas to really
structurally

41:48.906 --> 41:49.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
change the U.S. economy.

41:50.007 --> 41:51.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CECILIA ROUSE: Absolutely, the
bolder the
better.

41:52.009 --> 41:57.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, the president is
not king,
and he can't just wave a magic
wand and do

41:57.248 --> 41:59.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all that he wants to do.

41:59.083 --> 42:01.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Like help many of
the people
who lost their homes in the
financial crisis.

42:01.919 --> 42:03.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANDY WILLIAMS JR.: I think it
was backwards.

42:03.888 --> 42:07.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the money should have
been given to
the people to revitalize the
community, and

42:07.792 --> 42:11.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not help the ones who were part
of the problem
and not the solution.

42:11.295 --> 42:14.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Again, both the
left and right
had a similar prescription.

42:14.665 --> 42:16.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GLENN HUBBARD: A mass
refinancing of home
mortgages.

42:16.834 --> 42:18.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DARRICK HAMILTON: As opposed to
thinking about
banks.

42:18.569 --> 42:22.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, I put the final
question
to one of the president's former
chief economic

42:22.507 --> 42:24.142 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
advisers.

42:24.175 --> 42:28.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN KRUEGER: Which is, wasn't
it unfair that
the banking system got
rescued...

42:28.913 --> 42:30.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Yes.

42:30.681 --> 42:33.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN KRUEGER: ... auto sector
got rescued,
and a lot of the rest of the
U.S. economy

42:33.251 --> 42:35.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was left to fend for its own?

42:35.286 --> 42:36.287 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Absolutely.

42:36.320 --> 42:38.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was fundamentally unfair.

42:38.222 --> 42:43.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was necessary, however,
because the consequences
would've been much worse for the
U.S. economy

42:43.294 --> 42:45.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if the financial sector was
allowed to implode.

42:45.663 --> 42:47.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, certainly, there's much
more to be done.

42:47.465 --> 42:51.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And it will be up
to a new administration
to do it.

42:51.335 --> 42:57.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reporting from Chicago, this is

correspondent Paul Solman.

43:11.389 --> 43:14.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
history and identity in today's

43:14.792 --> 43:16.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our story.

JEFFREY BROWN: On a recent
morning in Washington,
D.C., this wind sculpture was
lifted in and

43:22.834 --> 43:27.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
installed outside the
Smithsonian National
Museum of African Art.

43:27.638 --> 43:32.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the latest in a series of
public art
works on display around the
world by the artist

43:32.443 --> 43:34.278 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Yinka Shonibare.

43:34.312 --> 43:39.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YINKA SHONIBARE, Sculptor: It's
a freestanding
sculpture, but it's a very
dynamic sculpture,

43:39.317 --> 43:41.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and it's very colorful.

43:41.486 --> 43:48.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, also, it's deceptive,
because, from a
distance, it feels like it's
actually soft

43:48.259 --> 43:50.061 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
material.

43:50.094 --> 43:54.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Playful,
deceptive, full of
contradiction, the stuff of
Shonibare's works,

43:54.799 --> 44:00.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most of all the sculptures for
which he's
best known, colonial-style
figures, some headless,

44:00.671 --> 44:05.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some with globes for heads, in
brightly colored
African-style costumes.

44:05.076 --> 44:11.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YINKA SHONIBARE: Actually, my
work is really
breaking down stereotypes,
saying, you know

44:11.849 --> 44:12.817 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
what?

44:12.850 --> 44:15.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What you see is not necessarily
what you get.

44:15.887 --> 44:22.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you might actually want to
take time to
find out more about something
before you then

44:22.860 --> 44:24.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
start to make assumptions about
it.

44:24.795 --> 44:27.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Shonibare himself
is a mix
of identities.

44:27.999 --> 44:34.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Born in London in 1962, he moved
to his family's
homeland in Nigeria at 3 years
old, and then

44:34.405 --> 44:36.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
returned to London to study fine
art.

44:36.707 --> 44:42.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At 19, he contracted a viral
infection in
his spine that left him
partially paralyzed.

44:42.880 --> 44:47.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also began to see his way
forward as an
artist, through an
unintentionally provocative

44:47.718 --> 44:49.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
question that came from a
teacher.

44:49.554 --> 44:54.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YINKA SHONIBARE: One of my
teachers said,
why aren't you making authentic
African art?

44:54.592 --> 45:05.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I felt that, actually, what's
authentic African
art, or what's authentic
identity in a global,

45:05.503 --> 45:07.939 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
modern world?

45:07.972 --> 45:10.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so those questions have been
with me since.

45:10.942 --> 45:14.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have explored those
questions in many
ways.

45:14.712 --> 45:20.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For example,
those so-called
African fabrics he uses,
Shonibare actually

45:20.184 --> 45:25.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
found them in the Brixton area
of London,
but they were originally batik
patterns from

45:25.423 --> 45:28.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Indonesia brought by the Dutch
to West Africa.

45:28.726 --> 45:34.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YINKA SHONIBARE: So, the fabric
is really
an expression of the kind of
hybrid identity.

45:34.065 --> 45:39.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I'm suggesting that it's
African, and it's
also Dutch.

45:39.203 --> 45:41.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's also Indonesian.

45:41.305 --> 45:42.707 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And that's OK.

45:42.740 --> 45:45.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Why are so many
of them headless
or have globes as heads?

45:45.676 --> 45:50.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YINKA SHONIBARE: First of all, I
wanted to
produce figures that didn't
belong to one

45:50.848 --> 45:51.949 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
particular race.

45:51.983 --> 45:54.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You wanted to
take race out
of it?

45:54.218 --> 45:57.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YINKA SHONIBARE: Yes, I wanted
to take race
out of the picture.

45:57.054 --> 46:03.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A lot of the figures are of a
mixed race.

46:03.461 --> 46:06.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are neither white nor
black.

46:06.764 --> 46:13.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that, also, I wanted
to get away
from the binary, the dividing of
people.

46:13.404 --> 46:16.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I felt that we're all one
humanity.

46:16.574 --> 46:24.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I wanted to find a way to
represent one
humanity, and to also take the
race equation

46:24.715 --> 46:26.517 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out of it.

46:26.550 --> 46:30.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But while ideas
run throughout
his work, there's also that
playfulness and

46:30.221 --> 46:32.156 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a concern for beauty and color.

46:32.189 --> 46:38.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YINKA SHONIBARE: I think it's
very important
for the audience to be able to
actually engage

46:38.262 --> 46:39.463 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with the work.

46:39.497 --> 46:42.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't want people to run away
from my work,
you know?

46:42.333 --> 46:44.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want people to be attracted to
the work.

46:44.201 --> 46:46.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I want to draw them in.

46:46.270 --> 46:50.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think color is one way of
doing that.

46:50.741 --> 46:57.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then you can, if you wish to
say something,
people might be more sympathetic
or be willing

46:57.515 --> 47:00.351 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to engage and listen to you.

47:00.384 --> 47:06.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: A recent
sculptural installation,
titled the British Library,
6,000 books with

47:06.457 --> 47:10.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the names of immigrants who've
contributed
to British society, is a more
direct kind

47:10.995 --> 47:13.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of commentary on contemporary
issues.

47:13.164 --> 47:19.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
YINKA SHONIBARE: I don't
necessarily think
that artists can single-handedly
change the

47:19.070 --> 47:20.771 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
world.

47:20.805 --> 47:23.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that if you really
wanted to do that,
I think you should go into
politics.

47:23.941 --> 47:29.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that, as an artist, you
have different
concerns.

47:29.947 --> 47:37.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The work can be funny, it can be
ironic, it
can be engaging, it can be dark,
it can be

47:37.388 --> 47:43.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
entertaining, it can provoke,
but not -- it
should never be an instruction.

47:43.661 --> 47:47.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Can I just ask
you finally
a personal question about your
disability?

47:47.932 --> 47:50.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It obviously changed your life.

47:50.234 --> 47:52.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Did it change your art?

47:52.069 --> 47:58.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YINKA SHONIBARE: It took me a
long time to
try to recover and get back to
my profession.

47:58.109 --> 48:00.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have devised ways of working.

48:00.377 --> 48:08.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have a studio with a lot of
assistants,
and I design a lot of things,
and I also paint.

48:09.019 --> 48:12.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I developed a way of working
that I'm
used to.

48:12.957 --> 48:18.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You don't see an
impact on
the content or the work itself?

48:18.329 --> 48:24.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YINKA SHONIBARE: I don't see an
impact on
the content or the work itself,
but perhaps

48:24.135 --> 48:31.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my level of empathy has actually
increased
as a result of what I have
experienced personally.

48:31.275 --> 48:36.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yinka Shonibare's
latest wind
sculpture is his seventh on
display.

48:36.313 --> 48:41.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's now creating a new series
that will begin
in the spring of 2018 at the
entrance of Central

48:41.886 --> 48:44.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Park in New York City.

48:44.088 --> 48:48.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From the Smithsonian National
Museum of African
Art in Washington, D.C., I'm
Jeffrey Brown

48:48.993 --> 48:57.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the "PBS NewsHour."

48:57.568 --> 49:05.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: And finally
tonight, another
installment in our Brief But
Spectacular series,

49:05.409 --> 49:08.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where we ask interesting people
to describe
their passions.

49:08.412 --> 49:10.881 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tonight, pianist Jeanne Stark.

49:10.915 --> 49:16.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her career spans seven decades,
from sold-out
performances at Carnegie Hall to
venues around

49:16.187 --> 49:17.488 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Europe.

49:17.521 --> 49:20.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Stark turns 91 this month and
shares what
keeps her playing.

49:20.691 --> 49:24.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEANNE STARK, Classical Pianist:
I am born
in Belgium.

49:24.862 --> 49:28.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what do you want to know
about this?

49:28.098 --> 49:30.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: Well, when did music
first enter
your life?

49:30.534 --> 49:34.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEANNE STARK: Music entered my
life before
I knew it.

49:34.505 --> 49:43.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My father, he walked around with
me and sang,
and then I stopped crying, and I
smiled.

49:43.447 --> 49:53.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He made up his mind, hmm, see,
this is a musician.

49:53.958 --> 49:58.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Queen Elizabeth in Belgium was
very fond of
music.

49:58.529 --> 50:04.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She decided that I should have a
special scholarship
because she felt that there was
a lot of potential

50:04.602 --> 50:05.903 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

50:05.936 --> 50:12.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I made my debut in the Carnegie
Recital Hall
in the year 1959.

50:12.209 --> 50:14.578 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My teacher was Edwina Bear (ph).

50:14.612 --> 50:17.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She never charged me for
anything.

50:17.281 --> 50:20.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I remember, I said: "Thank
you.

50:20.084 --> 50:23.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now I got this big concert
because of
you."

50:23.254 --> 50:26.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she said, "You proved me
right."

50:26.257 --> 50:40.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been so lucky, where all
these great
artists, Geoff Leigh, who was a
friend of

50:40.771 --> 50:42.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Bartok, I got them all.

50:42.806 --> 50:47.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To learn from people like that,
it takes you
years to understand what they
were saying.

50:47.745 --> 50:51.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But once you get it, you get
something very
precious.

50:51.615 --> 50:53.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not interpret.

50:53.350 --> 50:58.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's understand how music is
made, how it's
put together.

50:58.822 --> 51:05.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: Has your understanding
of certain
pieces evolved over the years?

51:05.129 --> 51:07.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEANNE STARK: Oh, yes,
enormously.

51:07.131 --> 51:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I will tell you one example.

51:09.533 --> 51:14.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I played Mozart's sonatas,
Beethoven's sonatas,
and I was never happy with my
adagios.

51:14.204 --> 51:17.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I did it with the metronome.

51:17.274 --> 51:19.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I tried everything.

51:19.343 --> 51:21.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I came to the States.

51:21.578 --> 51:27.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, by accident, my friend took
me to hear
Ray Charles.

51:27.384 --> 51:31.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I thought, now I know an
adagio.

51:31.789 --> 51:37.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Classical music is not being
really promoted
these days.

51:37.127 --> 51:39.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When I was young, it was a
golden time.

51:39.596 --> 51:46.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were fantastic players,
Rachmaninoff
and Prokofiev.

51:46.303 --> 51:49.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, my goodness, the
inspiration was unbelievable.

51:49.974 --> 51:57.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I was little, I was in a
theory class
two, three times a week.

51:57.648 --> 51:59.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You learn to sing.

51:59.116 --> 52:00.985 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's a great thing.

52:01.018 --> 52:04.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you learn to sing, you start
to hear.

52:04.488 --> 52:06.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I am 90 years old.

52:06.924 --> 52:09.059 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't know why I am here.

52:09.093 --> 52:12.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I should be dead, because most
people are.

52:13.030 --> 52:16.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My mind is, as you can see, very
sharp.

52:16.934 --> 52:21.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I don't understand, but I
love the day.

52:21.472 --> 52:22.706 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I love music.

52:22.740 --> 52:24.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How I adore music.

52:24.408 --> 52:29.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I love to hear great music,
well-played as
