THERE HAD BEEN SO MANY-- HAD

MANY YEARS.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.715 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE

05:23.690 --> 05:24.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DANGEROUS DRUGS NOW.

05:24.524 --> 05:26.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOCTORS ARE SORT OF HOLDING BACK

05:26.726 --> 05:28.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ARE THESE DATABASES THAT SOME

PRESCRIPTION DRUG DATABASE SORT

05:50.483 --> 05:52.652 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF TRACKING SYSTEMS.

05:52.652 --> 05:54.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOST STATES HAVE THOSE NOW.

05:54.287 --> 05:55.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN A NUMBER OF STATES, DOCTORS

05:55.555 --> 05:57.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE REQUIRED TO CHECK THEM IT

05:57.390 --> 05:58.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAKE SURE THAT PATIENTS AREN'T

05:58.825 --> 06:00.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALSO GETTING AN OPIOID

DOCTOR.

06:01.695 --> 06:02.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THAT HAS HELPED BRING

06:02.929 --> 06:04.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESCRIPTIONS DOWN.

06:04.297 --> 06:05.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR MANY, MANY YEARS, ACTUALLY,

06:05.365 --> 06:07.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES

06:07.067 --> 06:09.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE ARGUING THAT THE REASON WHY

06:09.369 --> 06:11.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE EPIDEMIC WAS RAGING WAS

06:11.838 --> 06:12.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THERE WERE A FEW BAD

06:12.973 --> 06:15.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOCTORS GOING FROM STATE TO

06:15.041 --> 06:16.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATE, KIND OF, YOU KNOW, GIVING

06:16.943 --> 06:18.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT PRESCRIPTIONS LIKE THEY WERE

06:18.311 --> 06:19.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CANDY.

06:19.179 --> 06:21.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT ESSENTIALLY, YOU KNOW, THE

06:21.147 --> 06:23.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESCRIPTIONS HAD RISEN SO MUCH,

06:23.450 --> 06:29.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, GOTTEN UP TO SORT OF

06:29.222 --> 06:31.925 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
250, 260 MILLION PRESCRIPTIONS A

PILLS.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.163 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASICALLY, THE EXPERTS CAME TO

06:37.163 --> 06:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CONCLUSION THAT THIS WAS A

06:39.666 --> 06:40.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HABIT AND CULTURE THAT HAD

06:40.934 --> 06:42.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

>> Stewart: SABRINA, HAS THE

06:49.342 --> 06:49.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECLINE IN PRESCRIPTIONS

06:49.943 --> 06:51.645 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRANSLATED TO A DECLINE IN

06:51.645 --> 06:53.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEATHS DUE TO OPIOIDS?

06:53.313 --> 06:54.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO FAR, NO.

06:54.814 --> 06:57.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DEATHS HAVE STILL BEEN

06:57.350 --> 06:58.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RISING.

06:58.518 --> 07:02.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LATEST WE HAVE IS 2014, AND

07:02.222 --> 07:05.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S A BIT MORE THAN 28,000

07:05.025 --> 07:05.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPIOID DEATHS.

07:05.992 --> 07:07.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT 18,000 ARE PRESCRIPTION

07:07.227 --> 07:09.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND 10,000 ARE HEROIN AND OTHER

ILLEGAL DRUGS.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND OVER-PRESCRIBING HAD BEEN

07:11.698 --> 07:15.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE

07:15.001 --> 07:16.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RISE IN DEATHS AND THE RISE IN

07:16.536 --> 07:17.671 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVERDOSES.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.839 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE HOPE IS THAT THE DECLINE

07:19.839 --> 07:22.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN PRESCRIBING IS SORT OF A
