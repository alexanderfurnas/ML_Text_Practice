BREXIT, WE SHOULD EXPECT G.D.P.

04:03.243 --> 04:06.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO DECLINE 1% TO 3%.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
1% DECLINE MEANS 720 POUNDS

04:09.182 --> 04:10.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOWER INCOME PER HOUSEHOLD PER

04:10.817 --> 04:11.118 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEAR.

04:11.118 --> 04:12.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THIS IS A PERMANENT EFFECT

04:12.385 --> 04:13.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU WILL SEE.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE ARE NOT TRIVIAL EFFECTS.

04:15.188 --> 04:16.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE ARE GOING TO AFFECT THE

04:16.289 --> 04:18.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIVES OF PEOPLE, THE ECONOMIC

04:28.869 --> 04:29.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT ARE THOSE?

>> SO WHAT WE KNOW FROM SORT OF

04:31.104 --> 04:32.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORK WHICH HAS MAINLY BEEN DONE

04:32.973 --> 04:35.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THE U.S., DURING THE

04:35.242 --> 04:38.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS, THE COHORTS

04:38.145 --> 04:39.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENTERING THE JOB FORCE AT THE

04:39.746 --> 04:42.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIME, THEY TEND TO EARN LOWER

04:42.182 --> 04:45.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAGES THIS YEAR, OF COURSE,

04:45.452 --> 04:46.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THERE IS LOWER DEMAND

04:46.553 --> 04:48.688 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UPON THAT IS A 6% TO 8% TROP IN

04:48.688 --> 04:50.924 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAGES IF YOU ENTER DURING AN

04:50.924 --> 04:52.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ECONOMIC DOWNTURN-- BY ECONOMIC

04:52.726 --> 04:55.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOWNTURN I MEAN 1% HIGHER THAN

04:55.428 --> 04:55.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
USUAL.

04:55.862 --> 04:58.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT EFFECT DOESN'T GO AWAY.

04:58.064 --> 05:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LARGE, PERSISTENT NEGATIVE

05:00.100 --> 05:01.301 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EFFECTS OF WAGES ON YOUNG

05:01.301 --> 05:04.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COLLEGE GRADUATES IF THEY ENTER

05:04.004 --> 05:09.009 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DURING A DOWNTURN, EVEN 15 YEARS

05:09.009 --> 05:12.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFTERWARDS, THEY HAVE 2.5% LOWER

05:12.045 --> 05:12.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCOME.

05:12.646 --> 05:13.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE THE ONES WHO WILL BE

05:13.947 --> 05:15.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROWING UP WITH THAT.

05:15.448 --> 05:17.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITHIN THE U.K. I THINK WHAT IS

05:17.017 --> 05:17.851 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPORTANT IS THE LIFE OF

05:17.851 --> 05:19.219 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNIVERSITY WILL BE UNDER THREAT.

05:19.219 --> 05:20.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THE MOMENT, WHAT THE U.K. HAS

05:20.820 --> 05:22.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THE REST OF THE EUROPEAN

05:26.593 --> 05:28.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE ARE GOING TO COME INTO

05:28.662 --> 05:29.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

AS THE UNCERTAINTY DEVELOPS, I

05:36.770 --> 05:38.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE ON

05:38.238 --> 05:40.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A HIRING FREEZE, AND IT IS GOING

05:40.941 --> 05:42.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE POOL OF

SKILLED WORKERS AVAILABLE IN THE

05:43.743 --> 05:44.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRY.

05:44.144 --> 05:45.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

LAWYER FROM ANYWHERE IN THE E.U.

05:49.416 --> 05:51.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT POOL WILL GET MUCH SMALLER

05:51.318 --> 05:53.186 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT WILL IMPOSE COSTS ON

05:53.186 --> 05:54.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUSINESSES IN TERMS OF WHO THEY

05:54.287 --> 05:56.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE ABLE TO HIRE.

COMPANIES USE BRITAIN PRECISELY

ECONOMIC PARTNER THAT IS.

MUCH OF THAT PARTNERSHIP IS

09:41.147 --> 09:42.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT BRITAIN AND HOW MUCH OF

THAT IS ABOUT EUROPE.

09:43.483 --> 09:44.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY A

09:44.884 --> 09:47.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOT OF THAT IS ABOUT USING

09:47.554 --> 09:49.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

IT'S NOT PART OF THAT MARKET--

09:54.694 --> 09:56.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR AT LEAST TEMPORARILY WON'T BE

09:56.696 --> 09:58.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

10:00.366 --> 10:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO

10:02.569 --> 10:03.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

I MEAN, THAT WAS WHAT HE SAID

10:34.968 --> 10:36.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM THE OUTSET WAS THE MOST

10:36.469 --> 10:37.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPORTANT THING ON HIS AGENDA.

10:37.770 --> 10:39.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ANYONE WOULD ACTUALLY USE THAT.

WHETHER IT'S GOING TO BE A

13:23.836 --> 13:25.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE REASONING FOR THAT WOULD

BE, WELL, WE WANT TO-- EUROPEAN

13:31.110 --> 13:32.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT MAY

13:32.311 --> 13:34.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE TO PUNISH BRITAIN ON THE WAY

16:35.628 --> 16:36.562 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT, YOU KNOW, VINTAGE.

16:36.562 --> 16:37.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S NOT BAD.

16:37.597 --> 16:38.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S TOO THIN.

16:38.865 --> 16:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SOMETHING MAGICAL HAPPENED

16:40.600 --> 16:42.101 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFTER THEY STARTED TO PLAN THE

16:42.101 --> 16:43.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEW CANAL THAT IS REALLY GOING

16:43.970 --> 16:45.538 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO HELP, I THINK, PANAMA.

16:45.538 --> 16:48.207 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH IS THE ENERGY BOON IN THE

16:48.207 --> 16:49.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNITED STATES.

16:49.308 --> 16:51.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRACKING PRODUCED A LOT OF

16:51.077 --> 16:52.078 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATURAL GAS, A LOT OF

16:52.078 --> 16:53.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIQUIFIED NATURAL GAS.

16:53.913 --> 16:55.848 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASIAN CUSTOMERS LOVE THAT STUFF.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TANKERS THAT CARRY OUR

16:57.717 --> 16:59.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIQUIFIED NATURAL GAS FROM THE

16:59.418 --> 17:01.187 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GULF DON'T FIT, DON'T FIT,

17:01.187 --> 17:03.389 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE JUST TOO BIG, SO

17:03.389 --> 17:04.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NEW CANAL WILL ACCOMMODATE

17:04.557 --> 17:05.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEM.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SHIPS HAVE GOTTEN BIGGER AND

17:07.126 --> 17:08.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIGGER IN THE 100 YEARS SINCE

17:08.995 --> 17:11.497 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OLD CANAL, 102 YEARS SINCE

17:11.497 --> 17:13.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OLD CANAL OPENED UP.

17:13.065 --> 17:15.434 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE SUEZ CANAL WAS TAKING

17:15.434 --> 17:17.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AWAY A LOT OF PANAMA'S BUSINESS.

17:17.536 --> 17:20.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE BIGGEST POSSIBLE CARGO

17:20.339 --> 17:21.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHIPS IN THE WORLD, STILL WON'T

17:21.707 --> 17:23.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIT THE NEW PANAMA CANAL, BUT

17:23.910 --> 17:25.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAY BIGGER ONES WILL.

17:25.144 --> 17:26.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN FACT, THEY'RE SO BIG THAT WE

17:26.812 --> 17:28.080 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE TO UPGRADE OUR PORTS HERE

17:28.080 --> 17:29.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE UNITED STATES.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.851 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN AS WE SPEAK, IN THE PORT OF

17:31.851 --> 17:34.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEW YORK, NEWARK, THEY HAVE TO

17:34.120 --> 17:37.857 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RAISE A HUGE BRIDGE TO LET THE

THEY'RE CALLED, GET IN.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THOSE INFRASTRUCTURE

17:42.094 --> 17:44.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UPGRADES WON'T BE READY FOR A

17:44.463 --> 17:44.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

BURY THE LEAD HERE.

17:46.999 --> 17:49.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU WENT TO PANAMA.

17:49.368 --> 17:52.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU GOT TO SEE IT UP CLOSE.

17:52.338 --> 17:54.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLEASE EXPLAIN THE GEE-WHIZ PART

17:54.040 --> 17:55.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF IT AND THE HIGHS OF AND LOWS

17:55.775 --> 17:56.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF GETTING THIS DONE.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

17:58.911 --> 18:01.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TUG BOAT CAPTAIN AND THERE WAS

18:01.747 --> 18:04.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NEW ONE READY TO OPEN.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.152 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OLD ONES HAVE THESE

18:06.152 --> 18:07.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAWS, AND OPEN UP FOR THE LOCKS.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.323 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NEW ONES HAVE KIND OF A

SLIDING PATIO DOOR.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THEY'RE JUST MUCH, MUCH

18:13.859 --> 18:14.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LARGER.

18:14.226 --> 18:15.594 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT

18:15.594 --> 18:16.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSERVATION, PARTICULAR HE

18:16.796 --> 18:18.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WATER CONSERVATION, AND THEY'VE

18:18.164 --> 18:21.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRIED TO REFOREST WHERE THEY

18:21.367 --> 18:23.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEFORESTED, AND IT CREATED

18:23.102 --> 18:24.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT 40,000 JOBS.

18:24.971 --> 18:25.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERESTINGLY, GIANT

INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS TEND TO

18:28.107 --> 18:30.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GO WILDLY OVER-BUDGET.

THE PANAMANIANS KEPT A LID ON

18:32.278 --> 18:32.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS.

18:32.611 --> 18:35.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S A VERY INTERESTING CASE

18:35.214 --> 18:37.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

RISKY BET."

18:45.925 --> 18:47.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT'S RISKY ABOUT IT?

18:47.259 --> 18:48.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF RISKS.

18:48.894 --> 18:51.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIRST OF ALL, THE THING SPRUNG A

18:51.030 --> 18:52.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEAK DURING ITS CONSTRUCTION, I

18:52.531 --> 18:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AM TOLD BY AUTHORITIES, THEY

18:54.433 --> 18:55.101 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIXED THAT.

18:55.101 --> 18:56.202 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE HOPES THEY DID.

18:56.202 --> 18:58.304 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE SOME OTHER RISKS.

18:58.304 --> 18:59.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APPARENTLY EARTHQUAKE RISK WAS

18:59.739 --> 19:01.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RAISED AS AN ISSUE IN THE "NEW

19:02.775 --> 19:03.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND OTHERS.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BIGGEST RISK-- SOMEHOW THE

19:06.512 --> 19:08.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"NEW YORK TIMES" MISSED, BUT WE

19:08.981 --> 19:10.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRIED TO FOCUS ON OUR COVERAGE--

19:10.683 --> 19:12.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORLD TRADE, PLANET EARTH, THE

19:12.985 --> 19:13.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHOLE WORLD.

19:13.886 --> 19:16.288 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRADE HAS ACTUALLY TAPERED OFF

19:16.288 --> 19:20.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE YEARS SINCE THE

19:20.693 --> 19:21.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
2008-2009 FINANCIAL COLLAPSE.

19:21.494 --> 19:24.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S NOT ANYTHING DOWN, BUT

19:24.930 --> 19:26.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRADE GROWTH IS MUCH SLOWER THAN

19:26.665 --> 19:27.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS.

19:27.299 --> 19:28.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD BE A CYCLE.

19:28.267 --> 19:29.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAIT A LITTLE WHILE, IT WILL

19:29.869 --> 19:30.503 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COME BACK.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARGUE THAT

19:31.303 --> 19:32.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THE CASE.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND CHINA, IT'S RESTRUCTURING

19:34.874 --> 19:35.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ITS ECONOMY.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MESS IN EUROPE.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THIS, TOO, SHALL PASS.

19:38.611 --> 19:39.879 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRADE WILL COME BACK.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHERS TELL US, MAYBE ALL THIS

19:42.081 --> 19:43.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GLOBALIZATION THAT WE'VE TALKED

19:43.849 --> 19:45.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT, ALISON, FOR 30 YEARS NOW,

19:45.418 --> 19:46.652 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAYBE IT'S KIND OF RUN ITS

19:46.652 --> 19:47.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COURSE.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRADE WILL STILL GROW A LITTLE

19:48.521 --> 19:48.788 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIT.

19:48.788 --> 19:49.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WILL BE SIGNIFICANT.

19:49.955 --> 19:52.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT WON'T BE THE BIG STORY IT

19:52.358 --> 19:53.225 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
USED TO BE.

19:53.225 --> 19:54.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THAT DYNAMIC HAS TO PLAY OUT.

19:54.827 --> 19:57.029 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG RISKS.

>> Stewart: WHAT DO YOU THINK

19:57.963 --> 19:59.265 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD BE AN UNINTENDED

CONSEQUENCE OF THIS?

19:59.932 --> 20:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE KNOW WHY THEY DID IT, WHAT

20:01.333 --> 20:03.069 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH.

20:03.069 --> 20:04.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM YOUR REPORTING, IS THERE

20:04.236 --> 20:05.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYTHING YOU THINK THAT COULD BE

20:05.838 --> 20:07.807 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AN OUTGROWTH OF THIS THAT NO ONE

20:07.807 --> 20:08.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPECTED?

>> WHEN I WAS IN PANAMA I DIDN'T

20:10.676 --> 20:12.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST STARE AT THE CANAL.

20:12.144 --> 20:13.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I LOOKED AT THE COUNTRY.

20:13.412 --> 20:15.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT'S A KIND OF SINGAPORE IN

20:15.114 --> 20:15.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A WAY.

20:15.681 --> 20:17.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE ALL THESE FINANCIAL

20:17.283 --> 20:17.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SERVICES.

20:17.683 --> 20:20.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CANAL IS CERTAINLY NOT THE

20:20.019 --> 20:21.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONLY GAME IN TOWN.

20:21.487 --> 20:22.688 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROWTH OF PANAMA HAS BEEN DOUBLE

20:22.688 --> 20:24.356 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RATE OF THE SURROUNDING

20:24.356 --> 20:24.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRIES.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE GAP BETWEEN RICH AND

POOR REMAINS VERY WIDE IN

20:28.928 --> 20:29.295 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PANAMA.

20:29.295 --> 20:30.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME

20:30.996 --> 20:31.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPROVEMENTS IN PANAMA IN

20:31.997 --> 20:33.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RECEIPT YEARS.

20:33.199 --> 20:35.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'VE NARROWED THE GAP A BIT,

20:35.134 --> 20:36.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT SOME CRITICS SAY NOT NEARLY

20:36.702 --> 20:39.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENOUGH, AND MANY PANAMANIANS

20:39.305 --> 20:39.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY THAT.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WAS TALKING TO A VERY

20:42.208 --> 20:43.075 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPERIENCED JOURNALIST WHO

20:43.075 --> 20:46.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STARTED A BIG NEWSPAPER IN

20:46.512 --> 20:48.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PANAMA CITY AND SAID I GOT A

20:48.047 --> 20:50.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRAZY IDEA, SORT OF A QUIXOTIC

20:50.116 --> 20:51.016 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUEST HE HAS.

20:51.016 --> 20:52.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU COULD NARROW THE GAP

20:52.618 --> 20:54.687 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETWEEN RICH AND POOR-- WHICH IS

20:54.687 --> 20:56.288 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO STRIKING WHEN YOU TRAVEL

20:56.288 --> 20:57.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGH PANAMA CITY-- YOU COULD

20:57.923 --> 20:59.425 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NARROW IT BY TAKING ALL OF THE

20:59.425 --> 21:00.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROFITS OF THE CANAL EACH YEAR

21:00.893 --> 21:03.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND DEDICATING IT TO IMPROVING

21:03.229 --> 21:04.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PANAMA'S SCHOOLS.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WOULD DOUBLE THE PANAMANIAN

21:06.432 --> 21:07.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCHOOL BUDGET.

21:07.399 --> 21:09.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO ONE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE IS

21:09.502 --> 21:12.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERHAPS IF A-- AN INTERESTING

21:12.338 --> 21:14.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IDEA THAT THIS GUY HAS WERE TO

21:14.006 --> 21:17.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GET TRACTION, THAT PERHAPS IT

21:17.143 --> 21:19.278 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD HAVE A MORE WIDER EFFECT

21:19.278 --> 21:20.579 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAN OTHER ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

21:20.579 --> 21:23.282 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

21:33.993 --> 21:36.762 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN YOUR OPINION WILL THIS

CHANGE, WILL THIS MODIFICATION

21:39.665 --> 21:41.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT?

21:41.267 --> 21:42.902 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
