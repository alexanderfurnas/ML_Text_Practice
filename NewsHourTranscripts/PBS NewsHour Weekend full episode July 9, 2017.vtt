AFTER A NINE-MONTH OFFENSIVE,

00:31.833 --> 00:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE AMERICAN-BACKED IRAQI ARMY

00:33.466 --> 00:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WON THE BATTLE FOR MOSUL TODAY.

00:36.633 --> 00:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY OUSTED ISIS FIGHTERS FROM

00:38.000 --> 00:38.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CITY IT HAD HELD FOR THREE

00:38.966 --> 00:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARS.

00:40.700 --> 00:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOLDIERS WAVED IRAQI FLAGS AND

00:42.400 --> 00:44.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CELEBRATED IN THE STREETS, EVEN

00:44.433 --> 00:45.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOUGH SPORADIC RESISTANCE BY

00:45.966 --> 00:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CORNERED ISIS MILITANTS

00:46.833 --> 00:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTINUES.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS SAFE ENOUGH FOR IRAQ'S

00:49.600 --> 00:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRIME MINISTER HAIDER AL-ABADI

00:51.233 --> 00:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

00:54.466 --> 00:56.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TROOPS ON THEIR VICTORY.

00:56.566 --> 00:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS VICTORY HAS HAD ITS COSTS.

00:58.833 --> 01:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IRAQI ARMY CASUALTIES WERE HIGH:

01:00.966 --> 01:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ARMY WON'T REVEAL FIGURES,

01:02.633 --> 01:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE PENTAGON HAS SAID THE

01:04.033 --> 01:05.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELITE UNIT THAT SPEARHEADED THE

01:05.366 --> 01:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFFENSIVE SUFFERED 40% LOSSES.

01:08.500 --> 01:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN ADDITION, THOUSANDS OF IRAQI

01:10.100 --> 01:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CIVILIANS DIED, SO MANY TRAPPED

01:12.000 --> 01:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

POPULOUS CITY.

01:16.333 --> 01:18.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AN ESTIMATED 900,000 IRAQI

01:18.000 --> 01:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN DISPLACED,

01:20.100 --> 01:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND MOST OF MOSUL HAS BEEN

01:21.166 --> 01:23.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REDUCED TO RUBBLE.

01:23.466 --> 01:25.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST OVER THREE YEARS AGO, ISIS

LEADER ABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADI

01:27.433 --> 01:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASCENDED THE PULPIT OF MOSUL'S

01:29.133 --> 01:31.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GRAND MOSQUE AND PROCLAIMED AN

01:31.166 --> 01:32.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISIS CALIPHATE, OR ISLAMIC

01:32.466 --> 01:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATE, STRETCHING FROM IRAQ TO

01:33.833 --> 01:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYRIA.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW THAT MOSQUE LIES IN RUINS,

01:37.466 --> 01:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ISIS'S STRONGHOLD IN SYRIA,

01:39.900 --> 01:41.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CITY OF RAQQA, IS UNDER

01:41.566 --> 01:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIEGE BY AMERICAN-BACKED

01:42.500 --> 01:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

REUTERS REPORTER STEPHEN KALIN

01:46.166 --> 01:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS IN IRAQ AND JOINS ME NOW VIA

01:47.866 --> 01:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SKYPE.

01:48.266 --> 01:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, HOW SIGNIFICANT WAS THIS

01:49.433 --> 01:50.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOMENT?

01:50.600 --> 01:52.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> VERY SIGNIFICANT.

01:52.066 --> 01:53.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS WE'RE GETTING VERY CLOSE

01:53.266 --> 01:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO THE END OF A NEARLY NINE

01:55.033 --> 01:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MONTH BATTLE.

01:56.733 --> 01:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE STILL A SMALL POCKET

01:59.400 --> 02:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF TERRITORY IN MOSUL THAT

02:01.000 --> 02:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISLAMIC STATE CONTROL, BUT WE

02:02.833 --> 02:04.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY EXPECT THAT TO BE FINALLY

02:04.866 --> 02:05.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE DONE TOMORROW.

02:05.900 --> 02:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT HAPPENS

02:07.033 --> 02:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW?

02:08.900 --> 02:10.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> NOW, IN MOSUL, THE CITY HAS

02:10.666 --> 02:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO START REBUILDING.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LOT OF THE CITY HAS BEEN

02:13.466 --> 02:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DESTROYED.

02:14.966 --> 02:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I TALKED TO THE UNITED NATIONS A

02:16.533 --> 02:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FEW DAYS AGO, AND THEY TOLD ME

02:17.833 --> 02:19.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT JUST THE INITIAL STAGES OF

02:19.466 --> 02:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REBUILDING-- GETTING PUBLIC

02:21.300 --> 02:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFRASTRUCTURE WORKING AGAIN,

02:23.733 --> 02:25.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH WILL TAKE ABOUT A YEAR AND

02:25.400 --> 02:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COST MORE THAN $1 BILLION.

02:28.033 --> 02:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ON TOP OF THAT I MEAN

02:30.133 --> 02:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S MUCH MORE LONG TERM

02:31.400 --> 02:32.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RECONSTRUCTION THAT HAS TO

02:32.600 --> 02:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPEN.

02:34.533 --> 02:35.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL THE FIVE BRIDGES INSIDE

02:35.866 --> 02:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOSUL ARE DESTROYED.

02:38.833 --> 02:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOST OF THE OLD CITY IS IN

02:41.266 --> 02:42.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUINS.

02:42.466 --> 02:43.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY ARE

02:43.600 --> 02:44.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEAVILY DAMAGED.

02:44.666 --> 02:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE'S HOMES ARE DESTROYED AND

02:46.300 --> 02:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LIVING THREE

02:48.466 --> 02:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARS UNDER BRUTAL RULE SO THEY

02:51.133 --> 02:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE TO REALLY YOU KNOW READJUST

02:52.900 --> 02:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BEING BACK PART OF THE IRAQ.

02:56.633 --> 02:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: EVEN IF YOU

02:58.533 --> 02:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REBUILD ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:59.600 --> 03:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE THAT

03:00.700 --> 03:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE LEFT?

03:01.933 --> 03:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO

03:03.133 --> 03:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE FLED.

03:04.533 --> 03:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN ISIS CAME, A FEW HUNDRED

03:06.900 --> 03:10.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOUSAND PEOPLE LEFT THE CITY.

03:10.666 --> 03:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEFORE THEY SORT OF SHUT DOWN

03:14.633 --> 03:17.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANY AVENUE TO ESCAPE, SO WHEN

03:17.066 --> 03:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BATTLE BEGAN NINE MONTHS

03:18.900 --> 03:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGO, THERE WERE... WE ESTIMATED

03:21.100 --> 03:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT ONE-AND-A-HALF-MILLION

03:22.433 --> 03:23.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE INSIDE THE CITY.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THAT 900,000 PEOPLE WERE

03:25.566 --> 03:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISPLACED.

03:27.300 --> 03:28.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT A THIRD OF THAT WAS TO

03:28.600 --> 03:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAMPS OUTSIDE OF THE CITY.

03:30.133 --> 03:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REST WERE TO OTHER HOUSES,

03:33.133 --> 03:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELATIVES' HOMES, FRIENDS' HOMES

03:34.600 --> 03:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSIDE THE CITY.

03:36.066 --> 03:37.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO MOST OF THE POPULATION

03:37.666 --> 03:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY STAYED INSIDE THE CITY

03:39.266 --> 03:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT NOW THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

03:41.633 --> 03:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIND A WAY TO REBUILD THEIR

03:44.033 --> 03:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOMES THAT WERE DESTROYED AND

03:46.166 --> 03:49.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GET BACK TO A NORMAL LIFE.

03:49.066 --> 03:50.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHILE A BIG

03:50.666 --> 03:51.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITY-- THIS IS JUST CITY-- THERE

03:51.866 --> 03:53.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE STILL LOTS OF CITIES THAT

03:53.300 --> 03:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE UNDER ISIS CONTROL,

03:54.600 --> 03:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SMALLER ONES.

03:56.333 --> 03:57.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YES, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

03:57.933 --> 04:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SMALLER CITIES TO THE SOUTH AND

04:01.400 --> 04:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEST OF MOSUL AND WE'RE

04:03.533 --> 04:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPECTING THAT THE MILITARY

04:05.300 --> 04:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAMPAIGN WILL CONTINUE WITH THE

04:06.833 --> 04:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HELP OF THE U.S.-LED COALITION.

04:10.066 --> 04:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BATTLE IS NOT OVER AGAINST

04:12.633 --> 04:15.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISIS BY ANY STRETCH IN IRAQ.

04:15.166 --> 04:17.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN ADDITION TO THOSE CITIES,

04:17.266 --> 04:18.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE AN

04:18.600 --> 04:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSURGENCY, THAT THERE WILL

04:20.266 --> 04:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE ASYMMETRICAL TERRORIST

04:22.000 --> 04:24.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTACKS IN MOSUL AND OTHER PARTS

04:24.866 --> 04:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF IRAQ.

04:25.833 --> 04:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT'S... REALLY STABILIZING

04:29.066 --> 04:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IRAQ WILL CONTINUE TO BE AN

04:30.433 --> 04:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPORTANT MISSION FOR THE

04:31.500 --> 04:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TWO THINGS MAKE THIS GATHERING

08:28.933 --> 08:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE IMPORTANT THIS YEAR.

08:30.400 --> 08:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

CREATED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP

08:35.566 --> 08:37.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REQUESTED ALL 50 STATES TO

08:37.000 --> 08:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROVIDE DETAILED PERSONAL VOTER

08:38.700 --> 08:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFORMATION TO FIGURE OUT, THEY

08:40.300 --> 08:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY, HOW TO PROTECT THE

INTEGRITY OF THE VOTE FROM

08:42.000 --> 08:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRAUD.

08:43.433 --> 08:44.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOST STATES ARE REFUSING TO

08:44.966 --> 08:46.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPLY EITHER PARTIALLY OR

08:46.566 --> 08:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPLETELY, BECAUSE HANDING OVER

08:48.466 --> 08:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME OF THIS INFORMATION

08:49.833 --> 08:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIOLATES SOME STATE PRIVACY

08:51.433 --> 08:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAWS.

08:52.100 --> 08:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OTHER REASON WE'RE PAYING

08:53.600 --> 08:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTENTION TO WHAT SECRETARIES

08:55.133 --> 08:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THANKS FOR JOINING US.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM EVERY INDICATION, IT SEEMS

09:19.533 --> 09:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP BELIEVES

09:21.633 --> 09:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUTIN IN HIS DENIAL THAT THE

09:23.233 --> 09:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIANS MEDDLED IN THE

09:24.700 --> 09:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTION.

09:26.366 --> 09:27.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO THE SECRETARIES OF STATE

09:27.766 --> 09:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED

09:29.500 --> 09:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND

09:30.666 --> 09:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECURITY?

09:32.700 --> 09:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, PART OF THE PROBLEM

09:33.800 --> 09:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE IS WE DON'T REALLY KNOW

09:34.933 --> 09:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT THAT EVIDENCE IS BECAUSE WE

09:36.700 --> 09:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON'T HAVE SECURITY CLEARANCE

09:38.666 --> 09:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WE ARE KIND OF THE LAST TO

09:40.200 --> 09:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW AND LOT OF THIS WE READ IN

THINK YOU MIGHT'VE BEEN HACKED."

09:55.533 --> 09:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> NO, AND THAT'S BEEN SORT OF

09:56.833 --> 09:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A PROBLEM.

09:58.233 --> 09:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALTHOUGH ALL 50 STATES DO ALL

CLEAR: THE ONLY THING REALLY AT

10:05.733 --> 10:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RISK HERE IS THE VOTER FILE.

10:09.233 --> 10:10.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REGISTRY OF ALL THE VOTERS

10:10.766 --> 10:12.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN EACH STATE AND THEY'RE KEPT

10:12.166 --> 10:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON A STATEWIDE BASIS.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT NONE OF THE ACTUAL ELECTION

10:15.233 --> 10:16.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EQUIPMENT IS EVER TOUCHED.

10:16.966 --> 10:18.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S NOT ON THE INTERNET.

VOTER FILE OR EVEN CAUSING SOME

10:25.000 --> 10:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONFUSION, THAT CAN CAUSE

10:26.200 --> 10:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINGS LIKE DELAYS AT THE POLLS

10:28.266 --> 10:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR PERHAPS CREATE DISINCENTIVES

10:30.100 --> 10:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR PEOPLE TO SHOW UP.

10:32.433 --> 10:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> INDEED IT COULD.

10:34.933 --> 10:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGEST

10:36.133 --> 10:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAMAGE THAT COULD BE DONE, WOULD

10:37.433 --> 10:38.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE THE CONFUSION THAT WOULD

10:38.500 --> 10:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESULT.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALTHOUGH WE ALL HAVE PAPER

BACKUPS OF ALL THESE LISTS.

10:42.466 --> 10:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE REAL DAMAGE IS MORE TO,

10:44.500 --> 10:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I GUESS YOU WOULD SAY, TO THE

INTEGRITY OF THE VOTE, THE

CONFIDENCE THAT PEOPLE HAVE THAT

10:48.733 --> 10:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR VOTE'S BEING COUNTED HAS

10:50.000 --> 10:51.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN THE BIGGEST LOSER IN THIS

10:51.066 --> 10:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHOLE THING.

10:52.466 --> 10:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

CONFIDENT THAT ALL OUR SYSTEMS

11:01.766 --> 11:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE SECURE, THAT RUSSIA OR ANY

11:03.333 --> 11:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER FOREIGN COUNTRIES CANNOT

11:04.900 --> 11:07.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO THIS TO US AGAIN?

11:09.533 --> 11:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN BE.

SYSTEMS.

11:16.433 --> 11:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LOCAL OFFICIALS ARE THE ONES

THAT ACTUALLY KEEP THE LISTS AND

THEY LOG ON TO THESE SYSTEMS.

11:22.133 --> 11:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT I THINK THE BEST DEFENSE

11:23.533 --> 11:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAINST ALL THAT IS THE FACT

11:24.933 --> 11:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY ARE KEPT IN 50 STATES

11:26.900 --> 11:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN 50 SEPARATE DATABASES, AND

ALL THE ELECTION RESULTS AND

11:30.566 --> 11:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERYTHING ARE TALLIED LOCALLY.

11:32.666 --> 11:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S AN EXTREMELY DECENTRALIZED

11:34.300 --> 11:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYSTEM AND THAT'S A BLESSING

11:36.033 --> 11:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE END.
