JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.239 --> 00:06.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.240 --> 00:07.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:08.008 --> 00:12.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: From
his income
taxes to his foundation, Donald
Trump faces

00:12.980 --> 00:18.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a string of controversies, while
Hillary Clinton
talks economics on the trail.

00:18.318 --> 00:25.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: In a shocking vote, voters
in Colombia
reject a landmark peace deal
with rebels that

00:25.292 --> 00:28.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would have ended five decades of
conflict.

00:28.428 --> 00:35.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as ISIS clings to its last
major base
in Iraq, joint forces team up to
take back

00:35.369 --> 00:39.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the city of Mosul and push the
terrorist group
out of the country forever.

00:39.640 --> 00:45.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: This road is the
front line
before getting to
ISIS-controlled Mosul, and

00:45.579 --> 00:50.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all along the front line here,
it is divided
up between the various groups
who are fighting

00:50.817 --> 00:52.619 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ISIS.

00:52.653 --> 00:56.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus: ahead of
tomorrow night's
debate, a look at the two vice
presidential

00:56.056 --> 01:01.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nominees and what to expect in a
Mike Pence/Tim
Kaine showdown.

01:01.762 --> 01:04.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:04.231 --> 01:08.402 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:08.435 --> 01:20.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thirty-six days
to go, and
the Trump campaign is struggling
again to

01:20.547 --> 01:22.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
get back on message.

01:22.416 --> 01:28.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, questions about Donald
Trump's taxes,
treatment of women and even his
charity swirled

01:28.155 --> 01:31.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today, and his opponent was
quick to strike.

01:31.191 --> 01:33.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang has our report.

01:33.860 --> 01:40.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Hillary Clinton
pounced on reports
that Donald Trump might have
avoid income

01:40.767 --> 01:47.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taxes because of business losses
to suggest
he may not be the businessman he
says he is.

01:47.407 --> 01:50.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Yesterday, his campaign was
bragging it makes

01:50.744 --> 01:51.712 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
him a genius.

01:51.745 --> 01:52.713 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:52.746 --> 01:54.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Here's
my question.

01:54.147 --> 01:58.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What kind of genius loses a
billion dollars
in a single year?

01:58.118 --> 01:59.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:59.853 --> 02:06.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: This is
Trump to a
T. He's taking corporate excess
and made a

02:06.493 --> 02:08.295 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
business model out of it.

02:08.328 --> 02:13.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The New York Times
published part
of Trump's 1995 federal tax
return showing

02:13.700 --> 02:21.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he declared a loss of $916
million from
real estate and other business
failures.

02:21.241 --> 02:26.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That could have legally allowed
him to avoid
paying income taxes for 18
years.

02:26.980 --> 02:30.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Clinton campaign quickly
produced a TV
ad on the issue.

02:30.317 --> 02:35.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: A new report shows he
may not have
paid any federal taxes for
almost 20 years.

02:35.422 --> 02:37.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: He
didn't pay any
federal income tax.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
That makes me smart.

02:39.626 --> 02:43.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: If he thinks that
makes him smart,
what does he think of you?

02:43.563 --> 02:47.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Late today at a rally
in Colorado,
Trump fired back.

02:47.801 --> 02:52.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: As a businessman
and real estate
developer, I have legally used
the tax laws

02:52.939 --> 03:00.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to my benefit and to the benefit
of my company,
my investors and my employees.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:02.682 --> 03:07.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I mean, honestly,
I have brilliantly
-- I have brilliantly used those
laws.

03:07.854 --> 03:13.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have often said, on the
campaign trail,
that I have a fiduciary
responsibility to

03:13.593 --> 03:21.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pay no more tax than is legally
required,
like anybody else, or, to put it
another way,

03:21.268 --> 03:26.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to pay as little tax as legally
possible.

03:26.373 --> 03:32.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The Republican
nominee is under
fire on several other fronts,
including allegation

03:32.212 --> 03:37.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he routinely demeaned women
on his reality
TV show "The Apprentice."

03:37.284 --> 03:43.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Associated Press reported
Trump asked
some female contestants to wear
shorter dresses,

03:43.123 --> 03:47.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
openly discussed which ones he
would like
to sleep with, and made lewd
comments about

03:47.661 --> 03:49.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
women on the show and on the
crew.

03:50.030 --> 03:54.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the New York state attorney
general, a
Democrat who is backing Clinton,
ordered the

03:54.367 --> 04:00.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Trump Foundation to stop
fund-raising in the
state, saying it's not properly
registered.

04:00.107 --> 04:05.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In addition, Trump was
criticized for comments
made about PTSD sufferers at a
forum with

04:05.712 --> 04:07.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
veterans in Virginia.

04:07.514 --> 04:09.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
When you talk about the mental
health problems,

04:09.983 --> 04:14.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when people come back from war
and combat
and they see things that maybe a
lot of the

04:14.888 --> 04:18.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
folks in this room have seen
many times over,
and you're strong and you can
handle it, but

04:18.291 --> 04:20.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a lot of people can't handle it.

04:20.160 --> 04:23.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Later, the Marine who
asked the
question said he found Trump's
answer thoughtful

04:23.897 --> 04:25.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and understanding.

04:25.565 --> 04:30.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican vice presidential
hopeful Mike
Pence campaigned in Virginia.

04:30.203 --> 04:33.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democratic running mate Tim
Kaine was off
the campaign trail.

04:33.707 --> 04:36.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They meet tomorrow night for
their one and
only debate.

04:36.877 --> 04:39.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

04:39.246 --> 04:44.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: U.S.
relations with Russia hit a new
low today.

04:44.718 --> 04:50.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Washington called off talks with
Moscow on
the conflict in Syria, amid
fierce air attacks

04:50.457 --> 04:52.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the city of Aleppo.

04:52.292 --> 04:56.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The State Department said the
Russians failed
to keep commitments they made in
a cease-fire

04:56.997 --> 04:58.798 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
deal.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH TRUDEAU, State
Department Spokesperson:
Russia and the Syrian regime
have chosen to

05:00.700 --> 05:06.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
pursue a military course
inconsistent with
the cessation of hostilities, as
demonstrated

05:06.706 --> 05:11.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by intensified attacks against
civilian area,
targeting of critical
infrastructure such

05:12.012 --> 05:16.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
as hospitals, preventing
humanitarian aid
from reaching civilians in need.

05:16.516 --> 05:21.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Earlier, Russian
President
Vladimir Putin suspended a deal
with the U.S.

05:21.254 --> 05:24.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on disposing of weapons-grade
plutonium.

05:24.191 --> 05:30.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He cited unfriendly actions and
U.S. failure
to meet its obligations under
the agreement.

05:30.931 --> 05:37.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hurricane Matthew bore down on
Haiti, with
winds of 140 miles per hour and
up to 40 inches

05:37.304 --> 05:38.505 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of rain.

05:38.538 --> 05:41.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's one of the strongest
Atlantic storms
in recent years.

05:41.608 --> 05:47.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, late today, it was centered
about 230
miles southwest of
Port-au-Prince, the Haitian

05:47.080 --> 05:48.915 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
capital.

05:48.949 --> 05:53.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Outer bands of wind and rain
were already
battering the impoverished
country's southwestern

05:53.687 --> 05:55.055 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tip.

05:55.088 --> 05:59.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The eye is expected to pass
near, or over,
that area late tonight.

05:59.259 --> 06:04.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The state of Ohio will resume
executing condemned
prisoners in January.

06:04.831 --> 06:10.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That follows an unofficial
three-year moratorium
due to shortages of lethal
drugs.

06:10.070 --> 06:16.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, today, the state attorney
general's office
said that it now has a new
three-drug combination.

06:16.476 --> 06:21.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Attorneys for death row inmates
immediately
said they will file a new court

06:21.948 --> 06:27.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Los Angeles police are facing
protests over
a fatal shooting on Saturday.

06:27.487 --> 06:33.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officers say they chased and
ultimately killed
an 18-year-old black man,
Carnell Snell, after

06:33.460 --> 06:36.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he jumped from a car that had
faulty license
plates.

06:37.030 --> 06:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The incident sparked protests
last night.

06:39.666 --> 06:43.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, today, police Chief Charlie
Beck said
that Snell had a loaded weapon.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLIE BECK, Los Angeles,
California, Police
Chief: At one point during their
foot pursuit,

06:46.373 --> 06:52.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which was 200 to 300 yards in
total, they
observed him remove a handgun
from his waistband

06:52.345 --> 06:54.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and hold it in his left hand.

06:54.080 --> 06:58.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while holding the handgun in
his left
hand, he turned in the direction
of the pursuing

06:58.118 --> 07:01.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
officers, at which time an
officer-involved
shooting occurred.

07:01.154 --> 07:05.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Beck also
defended police actions
in a second fatal shooting.

07:05.725 --> 07:11.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said a Hispanic man pointed
what turned
out to be a replica handgun at
officers, and

07:11.064 --> 07:12.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they opened fire.

07:12.866 --> 07:18.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. Supreme Court opened
its fall term
today, and refused a White House
appeal to

07:18.038 --> 07:20.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rehear a key immigration case.

07:20.340 --> 07:25.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In June, the court tie-voted on
the president's
policy of shielding millions of
immigrants

07:25.879 --> 07:27.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from deportation.

07:27.113 --> 07:31.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, a lower court ruling against
the plan
remains in effect.

07:31.051 --> 07:36.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The court has had only eight
members since
Justice Antonin Scalia died in
March.

07:36.856 --> 07:42.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was Black Monday in Poland,
with thousands
of women wearing black and
protesting against

07:43.029 --> 07:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a bill imposing a total ban on
abortion.

07:46.866 --> 07:52.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Demonstrators nationwide shut
down businesses
and government offices and
blocked roads.

07:52.205 --> 07:55.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Later, they held a huge rally in
Warsaw.

07:55.875 --> 08:00.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Poland is heavily Catholic, and
already has
one of the most restrictive
abortion laws

08:00.213 --> 08:01.581 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Europe.

08:01.614 --> 08:06.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A Japanese biologist has won
this year's Nobel
Prize in medicine.

08:06.786 --> 08:12.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yoshinori Ohsumi was honored
today for discoveries
on how cells break down and
recycle.

08:12.625 --> 08:18.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His work in the 1990s may now
aid research
on fighting cancer, Alzheimer's
and other

08:18.565 --> 08:20.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
diseases.

08:20.367 --> 08:25.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Japan today, Ohsumi said he
never imagined
that his experiments with yeast
would mean

08:25.105 --> 08:26.906 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a Nobel.

08:26.940 --> 08:30.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YOSHINORI OHSUMI, Nobel Prize
Winner (through
translator): There is one thing
I would like

08:30.043 --> 08:31.978 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to stress.

08:32.011 --> 08:35.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I began this research,
there was no assurance
whatsoever that it would lead to
some connection

08:35.181 --> 08:37.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with cancer or human longevity.

08:37.384 --> 08:39.252 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's not why I started.

08:39.285 --> 08:42.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Such is the nature of how
fundamental research
unfolds, and I stress the
importance of the

08:42.989 --> 08:44.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fundamentals of science.

08:44.791 --> 08:50.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Along with a
Nobel medal, Ohsumi
receives prize money worth
$930,000.

08:50.497 --> 08:58.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street today, the
Dow Jones industrial
average lost 54 points to close
below 18254.

08:58.905 --> 09:03.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 11, and the S&amp;P
500 slipped
seven.

09:03.376 --> 09:08.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a shocking
result, Colombia voters reject a
deal to end

09:08.948 --> 09:15.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
50 years of war; the impending
battle to recapture
Mosul from the Islamic State; a
heated race

09:16.022 --> 09:24.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for New Hampshire's Senate seat;
and much
more.

09:24.964 --> 09:33.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now to a major upset in South
America.

09:33.206 --> 09:38.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, voters in Colombia
rejected a peace
deal between their government
and the largest

09:38.311 --> 09:40.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rebel group, known as the FARC.

09:40.480 --> 09:45.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was hoped the deal would put
an end to
50-plus years of conflict that's
left hundreds

09:45.652 --> 09:47.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of thousands of people dead.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the latest.

09:49.722 --> 09:55.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Sunday's
stunning outcome
in Colombia touched off
celebrations in parts

09:55.562 --> 09:57.330 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Bogota.

09:57.363 --> 10:01.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Voters narrowly rejected a peace
accord with
the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia,

10:01.534 --> 10:04.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
or FARC, this despite
predictions it would
win easily.

10:04.604 --> 10:08.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLAUDIA, Colombia (through
translator): We
have all been victims of the
FARC and this

10:08.408 --> 10:13.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
victory is calling to the
government to renegotiate
the agreements, not to hand over
the country

10:13.780 --> 10:15.248 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the FARC.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's very emotional.

10:17.083 --> 10:18.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is what Colombia wants.

10:18.818 --> 10:22.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But yes-voters
complained
opponents of the peace deal were
misguided.

10:22.956 --> 10:26.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO SANGUINO, Colombia
(through translator):
Fifty percent of the people who
went out to

10:26.893 --> 10:31.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vote allowed themselves to be
convinced by
a message of hate, a message of
revenge, a

10:31.764 --> 10:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
message of keeping us in the
past.

10:33.566 --> 10:37.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The government
and the leftist
rebels signed the peace pact one
week ago

10:37.170 --> 10:39.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
after four years of
negotiations.

10:39.239 --> 10:45.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would formally end a conflict
that's claimed
at least 220,000 lives since the
1960s, and

10:45.745 --> 10:50.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
displaced millions more, but it
still needed
ratification.

10:50.350 --> 10:55.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After Sunday's rejection,
President Juan Manuel
Santos and the top FARC
commander appealed

10:55.255 --> 10:57.090 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for calm.

10:57.123 --> 10:59.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS, Colombian
President (through
translator): I call on those who
decided to

10:59.092 --> 11:02.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or not to support the agreement
to end the
conflict with the FARC.

11:02.862 --> 11:07.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now we are all together, going
to decide between
the path that we should take so
that peace

11:07.400 --> 11:08.368 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is possible.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I will not give up.

11:10.236 --> 11:14.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIMOCHENKO, FARC Leader (through
translator):
The FARC maintains its
willingness for peace

11:15.008 --> 11:20.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and reiterates its position to
use only words
as weapons to work towards the
future.

11:20.146 --> 11:24.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Colombian people who dream
of peace, you
can count on us.

11:24.784 --> 11:26.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Peace will win out.

11:26.586 --> 11:30.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Even former
President Alvaro
Uribe, a leader of the no
campaign, warned

11:30.924 --> 11:32.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
against reprisals.

11:32.559 --> 11:36.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALVARO URIBE, Former Colombian
President (through
translator): We all want peace.

11:36.296 --> 11:37.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Nobody wants violence.

11:38.031 --> 11:42.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We ask that the FARC are
protected and that
all crimes, including drug
trafficking and

11:42.335 --> 11:44.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
extortion, are stopped.

11:44.237 --> 11:48.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The United
States had backed
the accord, and, today, a White
House spokesman

11:48.308 --> 11:50.009 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
voiced hope.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
The good news is that all sides
including

11:52.345 --> 12:00.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the voters, I think, are still
focused on
trying to reach this negotiated
peace, and

12:00.386 --> 12:03.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that certainly is within the
national security
interests of the United States
to end this

12:03.623 --> 12:08.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
war, and we are going to
encourage all sides
to pursue that peace.

12:08.661 --> 12:14.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For now, a
cease-fire remains
in effect, as negotiators ponder
the way forward.

12:14.701 --> 12:18.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To help us understand the future
of this peace
process, we're joined now by
someone intimately

12:18.871 --> 12:21.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
involved in securing the deal in
the first
place.

12:21.975 --> 12:25.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernard Aronson is the U.S.
special envoy
for talks between the Colombian
government

12:26.012 --> 12:27.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and the FARC rebels.

12:27.213 --> 12:28.147 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Welcome.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Fifty years of fighting.

12:30.483 --> 12:34.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hundreds of thousands of people
have been
killed, millions of people
pushed out of their

12:34.854 --> 12:35.955 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
homes.

12:35.989 --> 12:38.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why did voters reject this peace
plan?

12:38.391 --> 12:40.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BERNARD ARONSON, U.S. Special
Envoy for the
Colombian Peace Process: Well, I
think the

12:40.226 --> 12:44.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
woman who spoke about it in your
introduction
spoke for a lot of Colombians,
which is they

12:45.031 --> 12:49.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have suffered enormously, they
have been victimized,
they're bitter about that,
rightfully so,

12:49.969 --> 12:53.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they felt the FARC got off
too easy in
this peace accord.

12:53.573 --> 12:56.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether that's true or not is up
to debate,
but many Colombians felt that
way and they

12:56.876 --> 13:01.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
turned out, and, by a very small
majority,
rejected the accord.

13:01.714 --> 13:06.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: A very, very
small majority,
I mean, 50 to 49, almost.

13:06.552 --> 13:08.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Pick up that idea, though.

13:08.388 --> 13:14.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The argument that many of them
made is that
the FARC were involved in drug
trafficking,

13:14.060 --> 13:20.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
killings, kidnappings,
extortion, and to them
this deal felt like the FARC was
able to walk

13:20.133 --> 13:21.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
away scot-free.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.669 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that a legitimate criticism?

13:22.702 --> 13:25.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BERNARD ARONSON: It isn't true
that they were
going to wake away scot-free.

13:25.638 --> 13:30.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What the agreement did was set
up a system
of justice called transitional
justice.

13:30.810 --> 13:36.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All the FARC members who were
accused of war
crimes, atrocities or atrocities
or violations

13:36.215 --> 13:40.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of international human rights
had to go before
these tribunals, confess all of
their crimes,

13:41.020 --> 13:45.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all their criminal activity,
give up any gains
they made from it, and then
subject themselves

13:45.892 --> 13:50.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to sanctions by the court, which
included
restrictions on liberty, though
maybe not

13:50.530 --> 13:54.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prison, per se, and some kind of
sanction
of work.

13:54.701 --> 13:59.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have been sentenced to
spend five or
eight years removing land mines.

13:59.305 --> 14:05.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the people in Colombia whose
family were
kidnapped and who were killed or
driven off

14:05.445 --> 14:10.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their land, and they felt that
that wasn't
an appropriate punishment.

14:10.183 --> 14:13.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that's part of the
discussion that has
to go forward now between the
government and

14:13.986 --> 14:15.188 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the opposition.

14:15.221 --> 14:17.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Well, what
does happen at
this point?

14:17.090 --> 14:22.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, before this vote was
held, the government
said if the vote goes no, we're
not coming

14:22.128 --> 14:23.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
back to the negotiating table.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The FARC said the same thing.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, where does the leave the
peace process?

14:27.166 --> 14:29.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BERNARD ARONSON: Well, but you
just heard
President Santos, in fact, say,
they are going

14:29.769 --> 14:31.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to try to renegotiate.

14:31.437 --> 14:35.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what he wants to do, and
what he's
doing correctly, is try to reach
out to a

14:35.708 --> 14:40.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
broad spectrum of Colombian
political leadership,
including the no campaign, which
obviously

14:40.747 --> 14:45.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has to have a seat at the table
now, and see
if they can come up with some
new consensus

14:45.885 --> 14:48.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that they can start to discuss
with the FARC.

14:48.187 --> 14:51.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether they will get there or
not is an open
question, but it's certainly
worth an effort.

14:51.691 --> 14:55.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this president has been
pretty relentless
in his pursuit of peace.

14:55.061 --> 14:57.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But do you
think the FARC
-- and you know many of these
leaders.

14:57.997 --> 15:00.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have worked with them
intimately over
the years.

15:00.333 --> 15:04.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you think they are going to
tolerate a
further conversation where all
of a sudden

15:04.537 --> 15:09.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the government says, I know we
had a deal,
but now we have a new deal to
work out and

15:09.142 --> 15:11.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you guys are going to have to be
punished
more severely?

15:11.043 --> 15:12.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BERNARD ARONSON: Right.

15:12.044 --> 15:13.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not an easy sell.

15:14.013 --> 15:18.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, if the
opposition can be
brought into the deal so that
there is a national

15:18.951 --> 15:24.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
consensus behind it, that's good
for the peace
process, it's good for the FARC,
because,

15:24.123 --> 15:28.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a country as divided as
Colombia is today,
to go forward with the
agreement, you would

15:28.528 --> 15:30.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
have made it a political
football for the
opposition.

15:30.830 --> 15:33.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It could be obstructed and torn
apart.

15:33.266 --> 15:37.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this way, the hope is -- and
it's a hope
at this point -- is that you can
create a

15:37.303 --> 15:41.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
national consensus which will be
enduring
and will unite the country.

15:41.073 --> 15:45.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let's say that
it does forward
and there is some sort of
process reignited.

15:45.912 --> 15:51.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the things I know that
was an issue
at this was the FARC rebels to
disarm and

15:51.250 --> 15:54.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of their soldiers would
then be reintegrated
into Colombian society.

15:55.021 --> 15:57.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My understanding is, many of
these are very,
very young people.

15:57.924 --> 16:03.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How does someone who's lived
their entire
life as a guerrilla soldier
suddenly put down

16:03.229 --> 16:05.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
arms and reintegrate into
society?

16:05.798 --> 16:09.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BERNARD ARONSON: Well, Colombia
actually has
a long history over the last 20
or 30 years

16:09.168 --> 16:12.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of reintegrating and
demobilizing guerrilla
forces.

16:12.205 --> 16:16.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what they do is a very sort
of systematic
approach with a presidential
institute.

16:16.142 --> 16:19.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They teach these young fighters
to read and
write, if they're not literate.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They teach them a job skill.

16:21.047 --> 16:23.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They reunite them with their
families.

16:23.549 --> 16:24.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They provide housing.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They often provide direct entree
to a job
opportunity.

16:27.820 --> 16:33.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not 100 percent foolproof,
but they actually
have a pretty good track record
of demobilizing

16:33.159 --> 16:34.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
guerrilla forces.

16:35.027 --> 16:38.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You are
someone who's worked
in this region for decades and
you know the

16:38.664 --> 16:40.499 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
players involved intimately.

16:40.533 --> 16:45.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, in the light of this
vote, do you have
any sense of hope that this is a
chance that

16:45.304 --> 16:48.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is going to be restarted in
a meaningful
way?

16:48.407 --> 16:52.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BERNARD ARONSON: Colombians on
the yes vote
and the Colombians on the no
vote want peace.

16:52.945 --> 16:54.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't want to go back to
war.

16:54.313 --> 16:56.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They want a negotiated
settlement.

16:56.115 --> 17:01.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I don't think it's
impossible the Colombians
can come together on a new
consensus.

17:01.854 --> 17:06.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Getting the FARC to give up what
they had
and go to a different set of
agreements is

17:06.759 --> 17:09.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not going to be easy, but they
don't have
other options either.

17:09.795 --> 17:13.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't want to go back to
war, and war
is not an option for them.

17:13.366 --> 17:19.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So this is an uphill fight, but
getting to
the peace accords was a very
long and torturous

17:19.305 --> 17:20.273 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
process.

17:20.306 --> 17:21.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, this is well worth the
effort.

17:21.607 --> 17:23.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Santos wants to do
this.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The United States obviously
support him.

17:25.311 --> 17:28.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Bernard Aronson,
thank you very much for being
here.

17:28.114 --> 17:33.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BERNARD ARONSON: Thank you.

17:33.753 --> 17:48.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now the first of
three reports
this week on the fight for Iraq.

17:48.634 --> 17:53.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thirteen years after the U.S.
military invasion,
the country still struggles to
stand on its

17:53.739 --> 17:59.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
own, as it faces profound
challenges, none
more dire than the threat posed
by the Islamic

17:59.712 --> 18:02.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
State, which controls parts of
the country.

18:02.214 --> 18:06.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, in partnership with the
Pulitzer
Center on Crisis Reporting,
special correspondent

18:06.986 --> 18:12.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jane Ferguson and producer Jon
Gerberg look
at the coming crucial battle to
reclaim the

18:12.658 --> 18:17.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
city of Mosul from ISIS and to
drive it from
Iraq once and for all.

18:17.997 --> 18:25.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Hungry and
crushed together
in the punishing sun, these
Iraqis, refugees

18:25.037 --> 18:29.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in their own land, desperately
grasp for food.

18:30.009 --> 18:34.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have fled south of Mosul
City, where
fighting between government
forces and ISIS

18:34.513 --> 18:37.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has been raging for months.

18:37.950 --> 18:43.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New offensives have ISIS in
retreat, but with
their homes, and all they know,
engulfed in

18:43.990 --> 18:47.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the battle, they have come here.

18:47.293 --> 18:53.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Escaping from Mosul just days
ago, this woman
says she and her family of seven
were lucky

18:53.065 --> 18:54.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to get away.

18:54.834 --> 18:59.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Running away from ISIS is
dangerous, and she
didn't want to be identified.

18:59.238 --> 19:04.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
There are many
people who want to leave, but
cannot.

19:04.610 --> 19:06.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The ones they catch, they break
their legs.

19:06.846 --> 19:10.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They just use a block on the
sidewalk and
break their legs.

19:10.449 --> 19:14.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the person has already gone
very far, they
just kill them.

19:14.086 --> 19:17.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: We are 60 miles
south of Mosul.

19:17.790 --> 19:22.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just up the road, these troops
are fighting
the ISIS insurgency.

19:22.528 --> 19:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iraqi special forces have
already pushed ISIS
from many areas of the country.

19:27.533 --> 19:33.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The battles have been tough,
destroying almost
everything in sight.

19:33.939 --> 19:39.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Iraqi army has fought for
months over
these areas south of Mosul City,
swathes of

19:39.712 --> 19:43.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
land and villages just like this
that they
have been pushed out of.

19:43.749 --> 19:49.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But even though they retook this
land several
months ago, civilians have yet
to return.

19:49.221 --> 19:55.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These soldiers now have their
sites set north,
planning to take back the city
of Mosul, the

19:55.127 --> 19:59.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Islamic State's last remaining
major urban
base in Iraq.

19:59.832 --> 20:05.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At 23, Mahmoud has fought and
won several
battles against the group.

20:05.237 --> 20:08.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And these men are ready to take
Mosul.

20:08.107 --> 20:12.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): By
God, my morale
is high.

20:12.344 --> 20:13.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Praise be to God.

20:13.813 --> 20:14.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Praise and thanks be to God.

20:14.947 --> 20:16.549 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will kick is from Mosul.

20:16.582 --> 20:21.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: That confidence
is a major
turnaround from just two years
ago.

20:21.120 --> 20:27.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, ISIS rushed into Iraq from
Syria and
swept down these very roads, as
the Iraqi

20:27.726 --> 20:30.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
army collapsed and ran away.

20:30.463 --> 20:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was a humiliating shock for
the country's
security forces.

20:34.733 --> 20:40.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISIS declared their conquest a
new caliphate,
or Muslim empire, with the
capital based in

20:40.973 --> 20:45.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Raqqa, Syria, only 140 miles
from the border.

20:45.544 --> 20:50.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was from Mosul that the
group's leader,
Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, first
appeared in public,

20:50.883 --> 20:57.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
preaching in the city's Grand
Mosque, demanding
obedience from Muslims around
the world.

20:57.289 --> 21:02.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the past year, Iraq's
military has been
fighting back, retaking former
ISIS strongholds

21:03.028 --> 21:06.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Fallujah and Ramadi.

21:06.098 --> 21:11.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now the Iraqi military is
planning a showdown
with ISIS in Mosul, a battle
they hope will

21:11.704 --> 21:14.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
push the group out of the
country.

21:14.573 --> 21:19.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraqi special forces commander
General Maan
al-Saadi, believes is will soon
be on the

21:19.812 --> 21:21.614 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
run.

21:21.647 --> 21:23.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GENERAL MAAN AL-SAADI, Iraqi
Special Forces
Commander (through translator):
No one accepts

21:23.082 --> 21:25.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them, whether civilian or
military.

21:25.417 --> 21:27.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are living in the 21st
century.

21:27.353 --> 21:29.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Who would accept bloody savages
and killers?

21:29.622 --> 21:35.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Across Iraq, the
U.S. leads
a coalition of 19 countries
fighting ISIS,

21:35.561 --> 21:44.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but the push to retake Mosul
will be an Iraqi
military effort, with U.S.
military support.

21:44.103 --> 21:49.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American airstrikes, guided by
the precision
of surveillance drones, have
already hammered

21:49.108 --> 21:51.410 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISIS for more than two years.

21:51.443 --> 21:56.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Heavy vehicles, and attack
helicopters, designed
to press the fight on the
ground, can already

21:56.749 --> 21:59.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be seen on U.S. bases here.

21:59.318 --> 22:05.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And last week, the Pentagon
announced an additional
600 U.S. troops are heading to
Iraq, bringing

22:05.090 --> 22:10.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the number of American boots on
the ground
to more than 5,000.

22:10.262 --> 22:13.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the Americans will not be on
the front
lines.

22:13.432 --> 22:17.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That task falls to these regular
Iraqi troops.

22:17.269 --> 22:22.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have already fought ISIS in
other, smaller
cities, and now each soldier is
getting a

22:22.308 --> 22:30.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
month of extra training for the
tough door-to-door
urban warfare expected in Mosul.

22:30.649 --> 22:38.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will be a huge test for these
men, with
Da'esh, as they call ISIS here,
likely to

22:38.123 --> 22:41.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
challenge their fighting skills
more than
ever before.

22:41.527 --> 22:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To prepare for the variety of
threats, roadside
bombs, booby traps, suicide car
bombs and

22:47.900 --> 22:55.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more, coalition partners from
the Australian
military are training these
young fighters.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.676 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have a clear, limited goal.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.511 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

22:59.545 --> 23:03.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW LOWE, Australian Army:
When you only
have four weeks of training,
it's important

23:03.115 --> 23:08.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to keep in the back of our minds
is that we
are not training them to be like
us.

23:08.887 --> 23:13.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are training them to be what
they need
to be to defeat Da'esh.

23:13.259 --> 23:19.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what we say in the training
role, amongst
the task group, is, make them
better than

23:19.632 --> 23:20.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Da'esh.

23:20.866 --> 23:23.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Iraqi soldiers
alone cannot
defeat ISIS.

23:23.902 --> 23:29.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The upcoming battle for Mosul
will involve
a complex mix of fighting
groups, some at

23:29.708 --> 23:31.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
odds with one another.

23:31.777 --> 23:37.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iranian-backed Shia militias,
like these currently
on the front line near Tikrit,
will be another

23:37.716 --> 23:41.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fighting element.

23:41.687 --> 23:47.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Accused of taking orders from
Shiite commanders
in Tehran, they are blamed for
stirring sectarian

23:47.226 --> 23:49.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tensions in Sunni areas.

23:49.928 --> 23:55.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mosul is a largely Sunni city,
and their participation
in the upcoming fight has been
politically

23:55.901 --> 23:58.570 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
divisive.

23:58.604 --> 24:07.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iran-backed fighters allied with
U.S.-backed
forces reflect the reality of
Iraq today.

24:07.313 --> 24:12.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are many players who have
found a common
goal in defeating ISIS, but it's
often the

24:12.484 --> 24:17.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
only thing uniting them.

24:17.323 --> 24:22.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Northern Iraq, Peshmerga
forces from the
semi-autonomous Kurdish region
near Mosul

24:22.494 --> 24:25.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will also play a role in the
fight for the
city.

24:25.931 --> 24:30.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have been at odds with the
Baghdad government
for decades, seeking
independence and a country

24:30.836 --> 24:32.271 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of their own.

24:32.304 --> 24:37.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They also see parts of Mosul as
rightly theirs.

24:37.276 --> 24:39.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This young Kurdish fighter told
us what motivates
him

24:39.912 --> 24:44.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEZAR ESMAEL MUSTAFA, Kurdish
Fighter (through
translator): This is for our
future, for the

24:44.149 --> 24:45.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
future of Kurdistan.

24:45.384 --> 24:48.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is an honor and we will give
our lives
for this cause.

24:48.487 --> 24:53.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: But the Kurdish
fighters, also
trained by and allied with the
U.S.-led coalition,

24:53.625 --> 24:56.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't want the Shia militias
joining the fight.

24:56.962 --> 25:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their spokesman told "PBS
NewsHour" plainly,
the Kurds do not approve.

25:01.266 --> 25:02.301 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
BRIG.

HALGURD HIKMAT, ®MD-UL /Peshmerga
Spokesman
(through translator): The Shia
militias are

25:05.037 --> 25:06.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
foreigners to the people of that
area.

25:06.472 --> 25:08.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have no relations with the
land and the
people.

25:08.907 --> 25:12.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If they participate, they will
create conflict.

25:12.077 --> 25:17.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: This is where the
battle for
Mosul will begin.

25:17.282 --> 25:23.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Qayyarah, a small town just 35
miles south
of Mosul, was occupied by ISIS
until they

25:23.055 --> 25:25.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were pushed out just over a
month ago.

25:25.758 --> 25:29.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now some signs of life are
returning.

25:29.128 --> 25:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the entrance to the town, a
hand-painted
sign reads: "Here is Qayyarah,
the key to

25:34.433 --> 25:35.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
liberating Mosul."

25:35.501 --> 25:42.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIS set fire to Qayyarah oil
wells in retreat.

25:42.341 --> 25:47.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This road is the front line
before getting
to ISIS-controlled Mosul, and
all along the

25:47.880 --> 25:53.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
front line here, it is divided
up between
the various groups who are
fighting ISIS.

25:53.485 --> 25:58.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It represents just how complex
the battle
for Mosul will be.

25:58.257 --> 26:06.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. Major General Gary Volesky,
commander
of the Army's 101st Airborne
Division, knows

26:06.532 --> 26:11.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the difficulties involved in
getting Iraq's
combative factions to work
together.

26:11.103 --> 26:16.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"PBS NewsHour" traveled with the

Qayyarah Air Field, destroyed by
ISIS as they

26:16.442 --> 26:19.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
left here, he says.

26:19.845 --> 26:25.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This will be the major hub,
where U.S. support
troops and Iraqi forces will
work together

26:25.117 --> 26:26.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

the stakeholders
recognize the importance of
Mosul.

26:31.156 --> 26:34.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, we have been to meetings
with both
the Kurds, the Iraqis, a lot of
the different

26:34.560 --> 26:40.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stakeholders, if you will, and
they all understand
that they have got to come
together to defeat

26:40.566 --> 26:41.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Da'esh.

26:41.567 --> 26:43.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's what they are doing.

26:43.368 --> 26:47.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: In 2003, during
the early days
of the American occupation here,
the 101st

26:47.339 --> 26:50.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Airborne was responsible for
Mosul.

26:50.242 --> 26:53.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Colonel Brett Sylvia knows that
role has now
changed.

soldier.

26:56.715 --> 27:01.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is no doubt that if
you ask me where
I wanted to be, it would be up
front, you

27:01.520 --> 27:04.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know, with a rifle in my hand
leading.

27:04.256 --> 27:06.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But that's not our role today.

27:07.025 --> 27:10.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our role is to advise and assist
them.

27:10.496 --> 27:13.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, to be honest with you, it
may very well
be the right strategy.

27:13.365 --> 27:20.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: U.S. commanders
hope their
latest efforts will prevent
another 13 years

27:20.038 --> 27:21.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

now.

27:25.944 --> 27:31.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I do think about it a lot,
about, what
I am doing today in order to be
able to create

27:31.416 --> 27:36.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a long-lasting stability, such
that he may
not have to come here?

27:37.022 --> 27:43.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Stability of any
kind has eluded
this land for so long that
refugees fleeing

27:43.095 --> 27:46.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mosul will have to survive in
places like
this.

27:46.965 --> 27:51.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As many as a million civilians
live in Mosul
City right now.

27:51.303 --> 27:58.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When they flee, the humanitarian
crisis could
accelerate from grave to
disaster.

27:58.110 --> 28:01.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Camps are already stretched
beyond capacity.

28:01.480 --> 28:06.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The United Nations is
frantically trying to
expand this facility to absorb
the expected

28:06.552 --> 28:08.353 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
new arrivals.

28:08.387 --> 28:13.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: It is also going to start
to be raining,
and the winter season is going
to make any

28:13.292 --> 28:17.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
construction a lot more
challenging and the
living conditions a lot more
difficult.

28:17.162 --> 28:18.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So it's really a race against
time.

28:18.830 --> 28:23.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Despite the
hardship, it's
better than living under ISIS
rule.

28:23.502 --> 28:28.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

is miserable
here, but better than where we
were before.

28:28.941 --> 28:31.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A price cannot be set for
freedom.

28:31.944 --> 28:33.712 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
People's freedom is priceless.

28:33.745 --> 28:39.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: How long they
must stay here
will depend on how the fight for
Mosul plays

28:39.651 --> 28:40.986 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out.

28:41.019 --> 28:43.889 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Defeating ISIS is a short-term
goal.

28:43.922 --> 28:48.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But once they have been pushed
out of the
city, keeping those who have
fought them from

28:48.393 --> 28:52.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
turning on each other will be
the next challenge.

28:52.097 --> 28:58.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their hatred of ISIS is the only
thing that
binds many of Iraq's fighting
forces together.

the Granite State is home to
something else

29:54.159 --> 30:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
special, a contest between two
respected and
popular Senate candidates.

30:01.266 --> 30:05.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican U.S. Senator Kelly
Ayotte, out
gathering votes at an apple
festival this

30:05.904 --> 30:09.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
weekend, is defending her seat.

30:09.708 --> 30:14.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democratic Governor Maggie
Hassan, rallying
volunteers, is hoping to win it.

30:14.212 --> 30:19.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Polls show it is a toss-up race,
a sharp partisan
fight, even as both brandish
they are not.

We froze in-state tuition at our

of the most bipartisan records
in the Senate.

30:33.031 --> 30:36.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have certainly been called a

30:40.605 --> 30:42.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Neither is flashy.

30:42.374 --> 30:47.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

conservative
for the state, in lockstep with

defunding Planned Parenthood,

get guns online

it's standing

against a woman's right to make
her own health
care decisions, those decisions
of Senator

31:06.565 --> 31:11.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ayotte, her positions and her

have pulled us backwards.

31:11.303 --> 31:17.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

31:29.488 --> 31:31.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for individuals and small
businesses.

31:31.323 --> 31:36.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%

31:36.595 --> 31:39.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
registration fees on the people

raised them for
others, citing urgent needs like

the opioid crisis.

31:49.841 --> 31:55.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump

neither Hassan

31:59.885 --> 32:02.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nor Ayotte joined them on stage.

32:02.187 --> 32:06.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ayotte has said she's voting for

not endorsing him.

32:06.892 --> 32:12.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

his business

America's crumbling
roads.

32:37.823 --> 32:40.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIM JALBERT: I don't vote for a
person based
on a single issue.

32:40.792 --> 32:43.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I vote for a person based on
what they're
going to do in total.

32:44.029 --> 32:50.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I look at the two of them,

that Ayotte, with her demeanor
and her style,

32:50.402 --> 32:52.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will probably do more for New

32:52.304 --> 32:57.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But Hassan and
Democrats
would love a so-called Trump
drag on down-ballot

32:57.709 --> 33:00.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

NORMAN ORNSTEIN, Resident
Scholar, American
Enterprise Institute: If the
Democrats can't

33:06.084 --> 33:13.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
win in a purple state with a
large number
of highly educated voters who
are turned off

33:13.658 --> 33:19.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by Donald Trump, they're going
to have a much
more steeply uphill battle in
accomplishing

33:19.397 --> 33:20.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the goal of winning the Senate.

33:20.799 --> 33:24.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Let's look at
the Senate
battle map.

33:24.469 --> 33:29.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
To take over the Senate,
Democrats need to
gain four Senate seats if
Clinton is president

33:29.140 --> 33:34.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and her V.P. can break a tie, or
five seats
if Trump wins.

33:34.079 --> 33:36.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Democrats have a big advantage.

33:36.248 --> 33:39.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Look at the 10 most competitive
Senate seats.

33:39.150 --> 33:42.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Nine are red, held by
Republicans.

33:42.187 --> 33:45.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is Democrats' best chance
at a Senate
takeover?

33:45.323 --> 33:51.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, sources in both parties
believe they
will pick up Illinois and
Wisconsin.

33:51.229 --> 33:52.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That would be two.

33:52.731 --> 33:56.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In North Carolina and Missouri,
incumbent
Republicans are on the ropes.

33:56.401 --> 33:57.636 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
If they lose?

33:57.669 --> 34:01.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's two more Democratic
pick-ups, for four
total.

34:01.439 --> 34:07.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Democrats may lose Nevada,
or the presidency,
so they need to pick up at least
one more

34:07.712 --> 34:12.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seat from a toss-up state like
New Hampshire.

34:12.083 --> 34:16.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That battle is playing out at
the 140-year-old
Deerfield Fair.

34:16.588 --> 34:20.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a jumble of food and
politics.

34:20.725 --> 34:25.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Andrew Robertson is splitting
his ticket,
voting Clinton for president,
but for Senate?

34:25.463 --> 34:30.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW ROBERTSON, New Hampshire:
yes, I think
I'm probably likely to vote for
Senator Ayotte,

34:30.101 --> 34:32.504 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in large part because of her
experience.

34:32.537 --> 34:34.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Others are an
equal mix.

34:34.372 --> 34:38.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAROL WYNNE, New Hampshire: I
really admire
Maggie Hassan.

34:38.376 --> 34:43.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She appears to have incredible
work ethic
and a great heart.

34:43.515 --> 34:46.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Unenthusiastically, I am
supporting Ayotte.

34:46.551 --> 34:48.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Why
unenthusiastically?

34:48.386 --> 34:54.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Well, basically because
Ayotte has not
been as supportive to the
Republican nominee

34:54.426 --> 34:56.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as she should be.

34:56.194 --> 34:59.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Enthusiastic
support from
the Senate will be key to
passing the next

34:59.831 --> 35:06.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president's agenda, likely to
include several
Supreme Court nominations.

35:06.237 --> 35:08.073 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Norm Ornstein:

35:08.106 --> 35:12.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: This year, I
really do believe
that the battle for control of
the Senate

35:12.444 --> 35:20.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is very close in importance to
that battle
for control of 1600 Pennsylvania
Avenue.

35:20.552 --> 35:25.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Those high
stakes have meant
sky-high spending here in the
Granite State,

35:25.190 --> 35:28.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and not just from the
candidates, but from
dozens of outside groups.

35:28.927 --> 35:33.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have flooded the airwaves
with tens of
millions of dollars in ads.

35:33.064 --> 35:36.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's in a state with just
over one million
people.

35:36.101 --> 35:40.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's by far the most spending
per person of
any Senate race.

35:40.672 --> 35:48.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ads from pro- and anti-gun
groups, from Planned
Parenthood, from big-money
groups on the left

35:48.079 --> 35:58.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and right all creating an
airwaves war, as
two popular candidates try to
outperform their

35:58.156 --> 36:02.027 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
parties' presidential nominees.

36:02.060 --> 36:06.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This makes voter contact, in
this retail politics
state, pivotal.

36:06.464 --> 36:12.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, there, Ayotte has a
challenge: Usually,
Senate and presidential
campaigns coordinate,

36:12.437 --> 36:14.906 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but not so with Republicans this
year.

36:14.939 --> 36:18.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ayotte is on her own to identify
and get out
her voters.

36:18.777 --> 36:22.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All this means, right now, it's
any woman's
race.

36:22.280 --> 36:26.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour" I'm Lisa
Desjardins
in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

36:26.651 --> 36:30.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: From the Senate
to the vice
presidential race.

36:30.088 --> 36:37.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Indiana Governor Mike Pence and
Virginia Senator
Tim Kaine may not be as
well-known or as polarizing

36:37.162 --> 36:39.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as the candidates at the top of
the ticket.

36:39.164 --> 36:43.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, polls show more than
one-third of
registered voters don't know
enough about

36:44.002 --> 36:48.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
either of them to form an
opinion, this despite
the fact that, if Trump wins, he
would be

36:48.773 --> 36:53.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the oldest newly elected
president to take
office, while Clinton would be
the second

36:53.812 --> 36:55.547 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
oldest.

36:55.580 --> 36:58.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Americans will have a chance to
compare the
two running mates when they face
off on the

36:58.616 --> 37:01.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
debate stage tomorrow night in
Virginia.

37:01.886 --> 37:05.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We take a look now at how these
two competitors
got to where they are today.

37:05.790 --> 37:07.492 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

37:07.525 --> 37:08.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TIM KAINE (D-VA), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
Are we going to let him get away
with it?

37:08.326 --> 37:09.294 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AUDIENCE: No!

37:09.327 --> 37:10.295 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

37:10.328 --> 37:11.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIM KAINE: Absolutely not.

37:11.329 --> 37:12.964 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We can't.

37:12.997 --> 37:14.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Today, they
represent polar
opposites of the political
spectrum.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

37:15.934 --> 37:18.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE PENCE (R-IN), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
I know that I know we will make
America great

37:18.103 --> 37:19.070 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
again.

37:19.104 --> 37:20.905 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

37:20.939 --> 37:24.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But long before
they were vying
to be the nation's second in
command, Mike

37:24.275 --> 37:30.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pence and Tim Kaine began their
path to politics
under strikingly similar
circumstances.

37:30.782 --> 37:37.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both were sons of the Midwest,
in Pence's
case, Columbus, Indiana, raised
by a gas station

37:37.856 --> 37:41.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
owner and a homemaker, in a
large Irish-Catholic
family.

37:41.926 --> 37:43.695 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

37:43.728 --> 37:47.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: I'm really just a
small-town boy
who grew up in Southern Indiana
with a big

37:47.866 --> 37:49.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
family and a cornfield in the
backyard.

37:49.801 --> 37:55.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kaine grew up in
Kansas city,
Missouri, the elder of two
brothers, his father

37:55.640 --> 37:58.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a metalworker, his mother a
teacher.

37:58.143 --> 37:59.978 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

38:00.011 --> 38:02.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM KAINE: I wanted to be a man
for others,
somebody who fought for the
rights of others,

38:02.881 --> 38:06.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had others' back, would stand up
for others,
especially if others wouldn't.

38:06.284 --> 38:11.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Catholic
Church played
an integral role in both men's
early lives.

38:12.023 --> 38:18.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Jesuit-educated Kaine came
from a family
that he says cared very much
about the church,

38:18.663 --> 38:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and very little about politics.

38:21.199 --> 38:25.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeff Schapiro has covered Kaine
for The Richmond
Times-Dispatch for more than a
decade.

38:26.004 --> 38:30.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF SCHAPIRO, The Richmond
Times-Dispatch:
I think the Jesuit connection is
important

38:30.074 --> 38:37.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for several reasons, most
notably the idea
of liberation theology, that
faith manifests

38:37.849 --> 38:39.684 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
itself in political action.

38:39.717 --> 38:45.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Like Kaine, Pence
was a Catholic
school kid, serving as an altar
boy, sometimes

38:45.423 --> 38:47.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
seven days a week.

38:47.091 --> 38:53.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The future GOP governor also had
an early
interest in politics, Democratic
politics,

38:53.198 --> 38:54.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
says Maureen Groppe of The
Indianapolis Star.

38:54.866 --> 38:57.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN GROPPE, The Indianapolis
Star: He
was a youth coordinator for the
Democratic

38:57.802 --> 39:00.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Party in his county at one
point.

39:00.905 --> 39:02.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He revered the Kennedys.

39:02.740 --> 39:05.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He had a bust of JFK.

39:05.143 --> 39:08.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He voted for Carter, but his
politics started
to change in college.

39:09.013 --> 39:12.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said Ronald Reagan inspired
him to become
a Republican.

39:12.383 --> 39:18.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He thought that Reagan embodied
the ideals
of America that he was raised to
believe in.

39:18.690 --> 39:21.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Both men went on
to study law.

39:21.359 --> 39:25.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Kaine took a detour to
Honduras to work
with a Jesuit mission.

39:26.030 --> 39:31.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF SCHAPIRO: Then, when he
indicated to
the Jesuits present there that
he was a law

39:31.803 --> 39:37.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
student, he was told that that
was not necessarily
a skill that would be useful in
a Third World

39:37.442 --> 39:39.277 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

39:39.310 --> 39:46.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he spent a year teaching
crafts, metalwork,
carpentry to youngsters at this
missionary.

39:46.618 --> 39:48.386 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

39:48.419 --> 39:50.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM KAINE: And it convinced me
that we have
got to advance opportunity and
equality for

39:50.455 --> 39:54.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everybody, no matter where they
come from,
how much money they have, what
they look like,

39:54.826 --> 39:57.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what accent they have, or who
they love.

39:57.061 --> 39:58.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

39:58.830 --> 40:02.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: After law school,
the newly
wed Kaine settled in Richmond,
Virginia, to

40:03.001 --> 40:07.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be close to his wife's family
and launch his
legal career.

40:07.772 --> 40:12.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pence did the same in his home
state, Indiana,
and mulled his next step.

40:12.510 --> 40:15.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN GROPPE: When he was
thinking about
what he wanted to do with his
life, he thought

40:15.480 --> 40:21.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about his gifts, his talents,
and he thought
he had a gift for articulation
for advocacy.

40:21.619 --> 40:24.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he wanted to try and use
that in some
way.

40:24.422 --> 40:30.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: After two failed
runs for Congress
in the '80s, that gift led Pence
to start

40:30.395 --> 40:32.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his own radio talk show.

40:32.230 --> 40:33.197 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

40:33.231 --> 40:34.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: And I'm supposed to
be a cynic.

40:34.232 --> 40:35.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm supposed to not appropriate
you people.

40:35.800 --> 40:38.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAUREEN GROPPE: He said that his
show was
Rush Limbaugh on decaf.

40:39.003 --> 40:42.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he also likes to say that
he's a conservative,
but he's not in a bad mood about
it.

40:42.607 --> 40:48.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also during this
time, Pence
moved away from his Catholic
upbringing, joining

40:48.079 --> 40:51.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an evangelical Christian church
in Indianapolis.

40:51.516 --> 40:55.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In 2000, Pence ran for Congress
again.

40:55.219 --> 40:57.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The third time was the charm.

40:57.121 --> 41:02.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He quickly earned a reputation
as a champion
for conservative causes, leading
the fight

41:02.660 --> 41:04.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to defund Planned Parenthood.

41:04.529 --> 41:06.297 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

41:06.331 --> 41:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: Millions of pro-life
Americans
shouldn't be asked to fund the
leading abortion

41:08.800 --> 41:10.568 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
provider in the United States.

41:10.601 --> 41:15.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But he didn't
always fall in
line with the Republican Party's
leadership,

41:15.406 --> 41:21.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fighting against President
Bush's signature
education program and expansion
of Medicaid.

41:21.346 --> 41:22.513 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

41:22.547 --> 41:25.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: I rise on behalf of
the fringe
in America.

41:25.817 --> 41:33.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As Pence built
his Washington
resume, Kaine was launching
himself into Virginia

41:33.725 --> 41:35.526 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
politics.

41:35.560 --> 41:39.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First serving on city council,
Kaine went
on to become the first white
mayor of Richmond,

41:40.031 --> 41:42.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a majority-black city, in nearly
a decade.

41:42.900 --> 41:48.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF SCHAPIRO: His relationship
with African-Americans
has been enduring.

41:48.639 --> 41:53.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it manifests itself not just
in politics,
but in faith.

41:53.177 --> 41:58.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He and Anne Holton attend a
majority-black
African-American Roman Catholic
parish.

41:58.249 --> 42:03.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He went on to
serve as lieutenant
governor under then governor and
now fellow

42:03.654 --> 42:08.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Mark Warner, and was
next elected
governor himself.

42:08.726 --> 42:15.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For Kaine, the 2008 financial
collapse and
the nation's worst mass
shooting, 32 dead

42:15.900 --> 42:19.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at Virginia Tech University,
would consume
his attention.

42:19.437 --> 42:21.305 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

42:21.339 --> 42:25.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM KAINE: As you wrestle with
your sadness,
as you wrestle with your own
feelings of anger

42:25.543 --> 42:32.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or confusion, as you wrestle
with the despair,
do not let hold of that spirit
of the community

42:32.550 --> 42:35.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that makes Virginia Tech such a
special place.

42:35.787 --> 42:37.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do not lose hold of that.

42:37.555 --> 42:42.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Although Governor
Kaine was
unable to convince a Republican
legislature

42:42.126 --> 42:47.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to adopt stricter background
checks following
the shooting, he did close a
loophole that

42:47.965 --> 42:50.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had permitted the mentally ill
to purchase
guns.

42:50.635 --> 42:52.503 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

42:52.537 --> 42:56.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TIM KAINE: I have always
believed that, however
you serve, what matters is
whether you actually

42:56.441 --> 42:58.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
deliver results for people.

42:58.543 --> 43:03.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Schapiro says
these experiences
helped Kaine hone his political
skills.

43:03.848 --> 43:05.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFF SCHAPIRO: He can be very
calculated.

43:05.716 --> 43:07.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He can be very cagey.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has an acute sense of the
jugular.

43:09.520 --> 43:13.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kaine's political
star continued
to rise.

43:13.391 --> 43:20.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He helped Barack Obama win
Virginia in 2008,
was named national party chair
the next year,

43:20.231 --> 43:25.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and in 2012 ran for the Senate,
and won easily.

43:25.203 --> 43:31.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Kaine entered Congress, Mike
Pence gave
up his House seat to run for
governor of Indiana.

43:31.876 --> 43:34.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His tenure has been rocky at
times.

43:34.846 --> 43:41.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2015, Pence signed and
defended a controversial
law that critics charged would
let businesses

43:41.853 --> 43:43.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
discriminate against gays and
lesbians.

43:43.921 --> 43:48.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN GROPPE: The business
community in
Indiana really rose up against
it.

43:48.392 --> 43:51.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, when he agreed to make
changes to
the law, that satisfied neither
side.

43:52.029 --> 43:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The conservatives thought he had
capitulated
and the other side thought that
the changes

43:55.800 --> 43:57.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
didn't go far enough.

43:57.602 --> 44:01.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Pence did earn
praise from
conservatives for implementing
significant

44:01.873 --> 44:06.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tax cuts and signing a stricter
state abortion
law.

44:06.511 --> 44:11.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump tapped Pence to be
his running
mate just as he was mounting a
tough reelection

44:11.916 --> 44:13.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bid in Indiana.

44:13.784 --> 44:20.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Groppe says Pence is motivated
by aspirations
for higher office, but also by
his Christian

44:20.091 --> 44:21.893 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
faith.

44:21.926 --> 44:25.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN GROPPE: It's a central
part of his
life, and I think he also sees
it as a reason

44:25.863 --> 44:29.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why -- connected to what he's
doing in public
office.

44:30.001 --> 44:32.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said he sees public service
as a calling.

44:32.537 --> 44:34.038 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

44:34.071 --> 44:36.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: I'm a Christian, a
conservative
and a Republican, in that order.

44:36.440 --> 44:38.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

44:38.276 --> 44:43.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In a similar
vein, Schapiro
says Kaine is driven by a belief
that politics

44:43.214 --> 44:44.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can be faith in action.

44:44.982 --> 44:51.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF SCHAPIRO: Faith becomes
sort of the broad
umbrella under which Kaine
operates.

44:51.856 --> 44:55.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't know that it's the only
thing.

44:55.226 --> 45:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is politics and government
as opportunities
for change, as instruments for
good.

45:02.934 --> 45:05.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is what interests and
motivates Kaine.

45:05.570 --> 45:09.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, as we look
forward to
tomorrow night's vice
presidential debate,

45:09.807 --> 45:15.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm joined by our Politics
Monday team, Amy
Walter of The Cook Political
Report and Tamara

45:15.613 --> 45:17.281 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Keith of NPR.

45:17.315 --> 45:19.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, hello to both of you.

45:19.584 --> 45:24.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Only six weeks to go, tomorrow
counting, until
this election.

45:24.555 --> 45:27.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's talk about these vice
presidential candidates.

45:27.191 --> 45:33.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amy, this is not a contest
that's generated
nearly as much, this debate,
interest as the

45:33.531 --> 45:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
first presidential debate.

45:35.733 --> 45:36.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How much is at stake?

45:36.734 --> 45:38.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Yes.

45:38.135 --> 45:39.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's almost impossible for these
two to generate
any more enthusiasm.

45:39.837 --> 45:41.606 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

45:41.639 --> 45:45.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you have two candidates
in Hillary
Clinton and Donald Trump that
have outsized

45:45.710 --> 45:49.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
personalities, that suck up the
oxygen in
the room completely.

45:49.714 --> 45:52.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These two candidates haven't
just simply been
overshadowed when it comes to
the debates,

45:52.550 --> 45:56.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but they have been overshadowed
on the campaign
trail throughout the course of
this campaign.

45:56.053 --> 45:59.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as you pointed out, these
are already
two candidates that aren't
particularly known.

45:59.624 --> 46:04.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, look, I think the stakes
are pretty high
here, especially for Mike Pence.

46:04.462 --> 46:10.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is going to be his challenge
tomorrow night
to keep the attention away from
all the problems

46:10.234 --> 46:14.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Donald Trump has had this
last week or
so, many of which have been
self-inflicted,

46:14.071 --> 46:22.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and to focus back on the issues
and the message
that Trump and the Trump
campaign would like

46:22.213 --> 46:26.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be focused on, mainly to
prosecute the
case against Hillary Clinton,
Barack Obama

46:26.917 --> 46:28.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and the path forward.

46:28.686 --> 46:31.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, so, Tam, if
that's what
Mike Pence has to go, what does
Tim Kaine

46:32.023 --> 46:33.791 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have to do?

46:33.824 --> 46:36.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Well,
he has to come out and not have
any sunlight

46:36.294 --> 46:41.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between himself and Hillary
Clinton, which
he has done a very good job of
falling in

46:41.532 --> 46:43.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
line.

46:43.334 --> 46:47.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They didn't necessarily agree on
TPP, but,
by the time he was announced as
V.P., he -- they

46:47.938 --> 46:49.674 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
agreed.

46:49.707 --> 46:55.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think also he intends to
come out and
try to show separation between
Mike Pence

46:55.780 --> 47:02.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Donald Trump, and show that
there are
areas where Pence and Trump do
not see eye

47:02.787 --> 47:08.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to eye, where, you know, Pence
has said that
this isn't a name-calling kind
of campaign,

47:08.559 --> 47:11.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the same time that Donald
Trump was calling
people names on Twitter.

47:11.262 --> 47:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and we know
vice presidential
debates may get attention at the
time, but

47:15.099 --> 47:17.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ultimately they have not had a
great deal
of effect.

47:17.601 --> 47:18.569 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But we will see.

47:18.602 --> 47:20.104 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

47:20.137 --> 47:23.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No, I think there's still --
it's still going
to be an important discussion.

47:23.607 --> 47:27.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the question is, for how
long will we
have this discussion?

47:27.611 --> 47:32.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Will by the next morning there
be another
tweetstorm or another front-page
story that

47:32.650 --> 47:36.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
detracts us from what came out
of this debate?

47:36.287 --> 47:39.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you both
have referred
to Donald Trump's controversies
of the last

47:39.156 --> 47:42.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
week, Tam, most recently over
his income taxes.

47:42.560 --> 47:44.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
New York Times broke the story
over the weekend.

47:44.762 --> 47:46.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Right.

47:46.664 --> 47:51.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He lost over $900
million on
his -- indicated on his return,
in 1995, suggesting

47:51.602 --> 47:55.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he could have gone 18 years
without paying
any income taxes.

47:55.473 --> 47:57.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this something that's likely
to affect
this campaign?

47:57.675 --> 48:00.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: This is a
fascinating question
to me.

48:00.377 --> 48:05.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Hillary Clinton campaign is
already out
with an ad criticizing him about
this.

48:05.249 --> 48:08.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the last debate, he said, "It
makes me
smart."

48:08.486 --> 48:13.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the ad now says, if you're
smart, what
does that say about the rest of
us?

48:13.057 --> 48:18.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Donald Trump is out today
saying, yes,
I took advantage of the system.

48:18.095 --> 48:19.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's the system.

48:19.363 --> 48:21.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I can fix it because I know
the system.

48:21.499 --> 48:29.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this $900 million loss in a
single year
is part of his story.

48:29.673 --> 48:33.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of the story that he's
been telling
about himself, that he went on
tough times

48:33.677 --> 48:38.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then he built himself back
up and was
able to become this successful
businessman

48:38.916 --> 48:41.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
once again from the ashes of his
previous
businesses.

48:41.886 --> 48:47.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's unclear whether this
changes the
narrative in any way.

48:47.491 --> 48:52.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it almost feeds the story
that Donald
Trump has been telling about
himself all along.

48:52.329 --> 48:54.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is that how you
see it?

48:54.165 --> 48:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes, or that's it's
sort of already
-- to your point, it's already,
like, baked

48:56.066 --> 48:57.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in, into how voters perceive
him.

48:57.768 --> 48:59.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

48:59.503 --> 49:01.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And the reality is
-- and you
have seen this on the campaign
trail, too

49:01.338 --> 49:06.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- you talk to voters about his
issues, whether
it is -- because we have known
for a while

49:06.977 --> 49:10.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now, thanks to public records,
that there
were years where he didn't pay
taxes.

49:10.481 --> 49:15.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know that he had many of his
products outsourced
to foreign companies.

49:15.186 --> 49:19.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are the sorts of things
that should
hurt a traditional candidate.

49:19.290 --> 49:22.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obviously, somebody like Mitt
Romney was by
making these statements.

49:22.493 --> 49:23.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Severely by it.

49:23.928 --> 49:25.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Severely by this.

49:25.729 --> 49:28.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet he still has tremendous
support among
people who see him as a success,
and to the

49:28.132 --> 49:34.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point that Tam made, that he's
saying the
only person who can destroy the
system, a

49:34.271 --> 49:37.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rigged system, is somebody who's
benefited
from a rigged system.

49:37.107 --> 49:39.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's talk
quickly about
some of the other stories that
have been out

49:39.944 --> 49:42.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there about Donald Trump.

49:42.346 --> 49:47.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tam, the Associated Press report
today that
the women who work for him on
the reality

49:47.585 --> 49:52.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TV show "The Apprentice" say
that he used
demeaning remarks against a
number of them,

49:52.356 --> 49:54.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
used sexist language.

49:54.191 --> 49:59.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amy, and the ongoing story about
Miss Universe,
that is something that has just
dominated

49:59.163 --> 50:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the news for the last number of
days.

50:02.466 --> 50:07.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are we watching -- and then some
polls have
come out showing some damage to
him in some

50:07.471 --> 50:09.206 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
states.

50:09.240 --> 50:11.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this the kind of thing that
is -- if the
taxes aren't going to resonate,
what about

50:11.876 --> 50:13.677 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this?

50:13.711 --> 50:16.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, throughout
this campaign,
what we have seen is, wherever
the focus is,

50:16.213 --> 50:19.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wherever the spotlight is, that
hurts that
candidate.

50:19.750 --> 50:25.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, a couple of weeks ago,
it was about
Hillary Clinton, and it was
about the pneumonia

50:25.723 --> 50:31.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the video and the FBI and
the e-mails,
and you saw her numbers sink.

50:31.896 --> 50:35.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now we have had a very bad
couple of weeks
for Donald Trump.

50:35.900 --> 50:37.701 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
His numbers start to get a hit.

50:37.735 --> 50:40.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the question, of course, is,
how long
will this continue?

50:40.905 --> 50:45.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, more importantly, how long
does Donald
Trump help it continue?

50:45.476 --> 50:49.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's done a masterful job
throughout this
campaign of taking a one- or a
two-day bad

50:49.146 --> 50:52.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
story and turning it into a
weeklong terrible
story.

50:52.316 --> 50:57.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But can you draw
a line, Tamara,
from all this focus on this and
how he's doing?

50:57.154 --> 51:01.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, well, I think
that you
can clearly say that the Alicia
Machado story,

51:01.625 --> 51:07.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Miss Universe story, and the
story about
"The Apprentice" and the
possible sexual harassment

51:07.331 --> 51:12.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the set, that is already
feeding into a
narrative that has existed for a
long time,

51:12.836 --> 51:17.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the things that he said on
"The Howard
Stern Show" -- Donald Trump is
not performing

51:17.508 --> 51:19.343 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
well with women.

51:19.376 --> 51:23.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is not performing well with
college-educated
Republican women even, is not
performing as

51:23.714 --> 51:24.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
well as he should be.

51:25.015 --> 51:27.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think that we can't say
that it hasn't
had an effect.

51:27.518 --> 51:29.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It seems like there is an
effect.

51:29.653 --> 51:31.288 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's just sort of baked in.

51:31.322 --> 51:32.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're saying it
just feeds
the narrative that's already out
there.

51:32.156 --> 51:34.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

51:34.058 --> 51:36.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just quickly,
Hillary Clinton
has her own worries, Amy, and
the polls continue

51:36.593 --> 51:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to show difficult getting
younger voters excited,
wanting to vote.

51:42.099 --> 51:46.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was just in Georgia this
weekend talking
to a number of young voters who
just say they're

51:46.637 --> 51:47.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not going to vote, even among
African-Americans.

51:47.805 --> 51:49.640 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

51:49.673 --> 51:52.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Hillary Clinton's
biggest challenge
is the fact that she's an emblem
of the status

51:52.743 --> 51:55.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
quo at a time when people
dislike the status
quo more than anything.

51:55.379 --> 51:59.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think her biggest
challenge with younger
voters isn't that she's not
liberal enough,

51:59.783 --> 52:04.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but it's that she's saying the
system will
be able to solve your problems,
when the very

52:04.555 --> 52:07.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people she's trying to appeal to
say the system
is rigged and broken.

52:07.491 --> 52:09.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly,
Tam, her
campaign's aware of this?

52:09.893 --> 52:11.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Obviously, they're
aware of
it.

52:11.395 --> 52:14.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have been doing a lot of
events that
are targeted at millennials.

52:14.198 --> 52:16.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Her message is targeted at
millennials.

52:16.100 --> 52:20.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Friday, no one noticed
because Donald Trump
tweeted a lot the night before
in the middle

52:20.938 --> 52:22.806 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the night.

52:22.840 --> 52:26.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she did a big rollout
related to national
service, which is targeted at
the very hopes

52:26.944 --> 52:29.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of millennials to give back to
their country.

52:29.213 --> 52:33.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, we are
going to
leave it there, a whole lot
going on, six

52:33.050 --> 52:34.251 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
weeks to go.

52:34.284 --> 52:40.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tamara Keith, Amy Walter, thank
you both.

52:40.224 --> 52:43.594 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

52:43.627 --> 52:46.964 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

52:46.997 --> 52:52.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online right
now: the latest Nobel Prize
winner in medicine

52:52.736 --> 52:58.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
won for his discoveries in a
process that's
essential to our health, but
complex to explain.

52:58.942 --> 53:05.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We take a deeper look at the
science behind
his accomplishment on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:06.016 --> 53:08.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:08.118 --> 53:13.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Tuesday, as you heard, join
us for special
live coverage of the vice
presidential debate.

53:13.424 --> 53:14.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:14.758 --> 53:24.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
