JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:05.706 --> 00:07.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:07.574 --> 00:13.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: More
details trickle
out about the Orlando massacre
and the shooter.

00:13.146 --> 00:16.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We get the latest from our team
on the ground.

00:16.049 --> 00:21.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Tuesday: It
was used in Sandy Hook, San
Bernardino, Aurora

00:21.788 --> 00:29.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
,and now Orlando. The
AR-15-style weapon is
becoming a favorite among mass
shooters. A

00:29.229 --> 00:31.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
look at America's most
controversial rifle.

00:31.899 --> 00:37.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And with a rise in
homegrown terror
attacks, what the White House
and local programs

00:37.738 --> 00:41.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are doing to fight violent
extremism in America.

00:41.174 --> 00:44.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RIZWAN JAKA, All Dulles Area
Muslim Society:
If you see someone that is going
to do harm

00:44.211 --> 00:49.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to our country or you hear about
it, we absolutely
must tell law enforcement. That
is our Islamic

00:49.516 --> 00:50.751 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
duty.

00:50.784 --> 00:57.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:57.991 --> 01:00.794 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:00.827 --> 01:11.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The search for
answers in Orlando
is taking authorities down new
avenues tonight.

01:11.705 --> 01:17.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Emerging accounts today raised
more questions
about the man who shot 49 people
to death

01:17.811 --> 01:20.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
before people shot and killed
him.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham reports from
Orlando.

01:22.082 --> 01:25.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: When you saw his
picture, what went
through your mind?

01:25.886 --> 01:31.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM VAN HORN, Florida: We just
went, oh, like,
yes, that makes sense. There,
that's Omar.

01:31.124 --> 01:35.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It's a new
wrinkle into
the investigation into Orlando
shooter Omar

01:35.629 --> 01:41.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mateen. Some of the patrons of
the Pulse nightclub
are now saying Mateen was a
frequent visitor.

01:41.301 --> 01:47.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM VAN HORN: He used to come in
the bar about
-- on the weekends. Sometimes,
he would be

01:47.274 --> 01:53.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there. Sometimes, he would miss
a couple of
weeks and then be in again. He
was a regular.

01:53.380 --> 01:57.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This
afternoon, the nightclub's
owner said through a spokeswoman
that the

01:57.351 --> 02:01.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reports are -- quote -- "untrue
and totally
ridiculous."

02:01.088 --> 02:05.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the Associated Press
reported the FBI
is investigating those claims,
as well as

02:05.292 --> 02:08.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
others that Mateen may have used
a dating
app for gay men.

02:08.628 --> 02:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN WEST, Florida: The last
contact was
like three months ago. And as
soon as I saw

02:13.000 --> 02:16.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the picture on the news, I
quickly noticed
the person's face.

02:16.737 --> 02:20.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: These
allegations come as
something of a departure from
what was previously

02:20.507 --> 02:25.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
said about the attacker.
Mateen's father has
said his son became upset months
ago after

02:25.445 --> 02:30.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seeing two men kissing in Miami,
but, otherwise,
never seemed homophobic.

02:30.884 --> 02:36.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Investigators are also talking
to the gunman's
wife. NBC News reports she told
federal agents

02:36.123 --> 02:40.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that she tried to dissuade her
husband from
carrying out the attack. She
also said she

02:40.494 --> 02:44.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was with him when he bought
ammunition and
a holster, and once drove him to
the club

02:44.865 --> 02:47.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because he wanted to scope it
out.

02:47.100 --> 02:51.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, some of those who
escaped with
their lives spoke today at
Orlando Medical

02:51.538 --> 02:53.340 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Center.

02:53.373 --> 02:56.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGEL COLON, Orlando Attack
Survivor: I hear
him, and he's shooting everyone
that's already

02:56.309 --> 03:02.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dead on the floor, making sure
they're dead.
I look over, and he shoots the
girl next to

03:02.416 --> 03:06.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me. And I'm just there laying
down. I'm thinking,
I'm next. I'm dead.

03:06.253 --> 03:11.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Angel Colon
was shot several
times. Fighting back tears, he
described his

03:11.525 --> 03:13.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rescue by police.

03:13.293 --> 03:17.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGEL COLON: I don't feel pain,
but I just
feel all this blood on me from
myself, from

03:17.931 --> 03:23.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my other people. And he just
drops me off
across the street, and I look
over and there's

03:23.870 --> 03:25.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just bodies everywhere. We're
all in pain.

03:25.739 --> 03:30.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All this as
the FBI continues
to scour the scene of the
shooting. Lines

03:30.677 --> 03:35.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of agents and officers worked
through the
club's grounds this morning,
laying down markers

03:35.248 --> 03:37.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and identifying potential clues.

03:37.951 --> 03:42.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the investigation here in
Orlando ends
its third day, there's been a
flurry of activity

03:42.189 --> 03:46.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Washington. President Obama
and members
of the U.S. House were briefed
by top national

03:46.293 --> 03:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
security officials. Today, the
president called
again for cracking down on
assault-style weapons,

03:52.499 --> 03:55.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and barring those on a terror
watch list from
buying guns.

03:55.802 --> 04:01.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Otherwise, despite extraordinary
efforts across

04:01.174 --> 04:07.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our government, by local law
enforcement,
by our intelligence agencies, by
our military,

04:07.280 --> 04:12.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
despite all the sacrifices that
folks make,
these kinds of events are going
to keep on

04:12.919 --> 04:14.788 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
happening.

04:14.821 --> 04:17.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: After the
session with the
president, FBI Director James
Comey also briefed

04:17.824 --> 04:21.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
members of the House on the
investigation,
behind closed doors.

04:21.795 --> 04:26.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And around the country,
thousands of Americans
are responding in their own
ways, with tributes

04:26.166 --> 04:30.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and vigils in a number of cities
last night.
In New York, supporters gathered
in front

04:30.871 --> 04:36.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the historic Stonewall Inn,
where the modern
gay rights movement began. And
back in Orlando,

04:36.443 --> 04:41.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thousands met in the city's
downtown. There,
they lit candles and read aloud
the names

04:41.381 --> 04:43.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the 49 killed.

04:43.183 --> 04:47.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dew Sizemore, who lost six of
his friends
to the shooting, said the
ceremonies gave

04:47.954 --> 04:49.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
him a small sliver of comfort.

04:49.756 --> 04:53.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEW SIZEMORE, Florida: And I
feel like I can
leave here and start to heal.
And it's the

04:53.326 --> 04:57.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beginning, the beginning of a
long road ahead
of us, but hopefully tonight
will help a lot

04:57.330 --> 04:59.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of people. It helped me.

04:59.099 --> 05:02.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The president
is planning
on coming here to Orlando
Thursday, where

05:02.235 --> 05:06.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he will likely meet with family
members and
victims of the shooting.

05:06.706 --> 05:09.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham
in Orlando, Florida.

05:09.676 --> 05:15.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the day's other
news: President
Obama rebuked Donald Trump for
his renewed

05:15.582 --> 05:20.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
call to ban Muslim immigrants.
In a sharply
worded speech, the president
dismissed such

05:20.754 --> 05:28.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
appeals as not the America we
want. The Republican
nominee-to-be fired back in an
e-mail to reporters,

05:28.495 --> 05:34.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying of the president: "He
continues to
prioritize our enemy over our
allies, and,

05:34.301 --> 05:36.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for that matter, the American
people."

05:36.403 --> 05:39.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will listen to some of the
president's
speech after the news summary.

05:39.706 --> 05:44.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Donald Trump took
a new broadside
from his presumptive November
opponent as

05:44.477 --> 05:50.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well. In Pittsburgh, Hillary
Clinton accused
him of falsely claiming that she
would curb

05:50.317 --> 05:53.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gun rights or let in a flood of
new refugees.

05:53.687 --> 05:59.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
These are demonstrably lies. But
he feels

05:59.459 --> 06:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
compelled to tell them because
he has to distract
us from the fact he has nothing
substantive

06:07.234 --> 06:08.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to say for himself.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

06:10.403 --> 06:15.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Republican
Party's national
chair, Reince Priebus, defended
Trump against

06:15.041 --> 06:20.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comments by both the president
and Hillary
Clinton. He said their policies
wouldn't prevent

06:20.347 --> 06:24.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terror attacks, but instead take
away Americans'
gun rights.

06:24.918 --> 06:30.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the top elected Republican,
House Speaker
Paul Ryan, put some distance
between himself

06:30.590 --> 06:33.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Trump on the issue of
keeping Muslims
out.

06:33.426 --> 06:37.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House:
I do not think a Muslim ban is
in our country's

06:37.230 --> 06:40.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interest. I do not think it is
reflective
of our principles, not just as a
party, but

06:40.900 --> 06:46.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a country. And I think the
smarter way
to go in all respects is to have
a security

06:46.106 --> 06:47.841 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
test and not a religious test.

06:47.874 --> 06:52.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All of this came
as Donald
Trump turned 70 years old today.
If elected,

06:52.779 --> 06:56.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he would be the oldest person to
assume the
office of the presidency.

06:56.549 --> 07:01.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In France, police
carried out
a series of raids after an
attacker killed

07:01.554 --> 07:05.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two police officials overnight
at their home
outside Paris.

07:05.592 --> 07:11.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The killer, Larossi Abballa,
claimed to -- claimed
allegiance, that is, to the
Islamic State.

07:11.398 --> 07:17.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was shot dead by police after
a three-hour
stand-off. A prosecutor said
Abballa had a

07:17.037 --> 07:21.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
list of other targets, including
public officials
and journalists.

07:21.374 --> 07:26.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: French police
also detained
43 Russian soccer fans suspected
of attacking

07:26.946 --> 07:32.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
English supporters at the Euro
2016 soccer
tournament. Reinforcements
deployed across

07:32.819 --> 07:38.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Northern France, ahead of
upcoming matches.
And the European Soccer
Federation warned

07:38.258 --> 07:41.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russia faces expulsion, if
there's more violence.

07:41.428 --> 07:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PEDRO PINTO, European Soccer
Federation: We
have reaffirmed our desire to
work directly

07:46.566 --> 07:52.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the security forces, with
the police
forces here in France to make
sure that the

07:52.205 --> 07:56.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
security and safety of all
participants is
of the utmost priority.

07:56.743 --> 08:01.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Adding to the
trouble: Labor
protests in Paris once again
turned violent,

08:01.881 --> 08:07.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as demonstrators battled police;
20 officers
and six protesters were injured.

08:07.220 --> 08:12.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Back in this
country, the Senate
defied a presidential veto
threat and overwhelmingly

08:12.425 --> 08:18.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
passed a defense policy bill. It
authorizes
$602 billion in military
spending, but it

08:18.865 --> 08:25.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also bars the Guantanamo Bay
prison from closing,
and it blocks any new base
closings.

08:25.538 --> 08:29.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Similar provisions are also
contained in a
House bill, but the White House
has warned

08:29.209 --> 08:31.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the president will not accept
them.

08:31.244 --> 08:35.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wall Street fell
for a fourth
day over worries about interest
rates and

08:35.915 --> 08:41.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Britain's vote on the European
Union. The
Dow Jones industrial average
lost 57 points

08:41.488 --> 08:49.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to close near 17675. The Nasdaq
gave up five
points, and the S&amp;P 500 slipped
three.

08:49.696 --> 08:55.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
new efforts
to counter violent extremism
before an attack;

08:55.802 --> 09:01.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a look at the gun used in the
Orlando and
San Bernardino shootings;
Russian hackers

09:01.875 --> 09:09.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
steal Democrats' research on
Donald Trump;
and much more.

09:09.416 --> 09:22.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: How much do words
matter? Donald
Trump has regularly criticized
President Obama

09:22.762 --> 09:29.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Hillary Clinton for not
using the term
radical Islam to define the
threat of terrorism.

09:29.335 --> 09:34.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Mr. Obama, in extensive
remarks delivered
at the Treasury Department
today, struck back,

09:34.374 --> 09:39.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
saying the presumptive
Republican nominee's
plan to ban Muslims from the
U.S., and the

09:39.279 --> 09:41.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
language he uses to make his
point, is dangerous.

09:41.714 --> 09:46.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
There is no magic to the phrase
radical Islam.

09:46.719 --> 09:52.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is a political talking point.
It is not
a strategy.

09:52.158 --> 09:58.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the reason I am careful
about how I describe
this threat has nothing to do
with political

09:58.298 --> 10:06.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
correctness and everything to do
with actually
defeating extremism.

10:06.473 --> 10:14.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Groups like ISIL and al-Qaida
want to make
this war a war between Islam and
America,

10:14.781 --> 10:20.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or between Islam and the West.
If we fall
into the trap of painting all
Muslims as a

10:20.253 --> 10:26.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
broad brush, and imply that we
are at war
with the entire religion, then
we are doing

10:26.960 --> 10:29.462 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the terrorists' work for them.

10:29.496 --> 10:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we are now seeing how
dangerous this kind
of mind-set and this kind of
thinking can

10:34.434 --> 10:42.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be. We are starting to see where
this kind
of rhetoric and loose talk and
sloppiness

10:42.442 --> 10:49.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
about who exactly we are
fighting, where this
can lead us.

10:49.883 --> 10:54.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We now have proposals from the
presumptive
Republican nominee for president
of the United

10:54.521 --> 11:01.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States to bar all Muslims from
emigrating
into America. We hear language
that singles

11:01.995 --> 11:12.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out immigrants and suggests
entire religious
communities are complacent in
violence.

11:12.639 --> 11:22.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where does this stop? The
Orlando killer,
one of the San Bernardino
killers, the Fort

11:22.815 --> 11:30.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hood killer, they were all U.S.
citizens.
Are we going to start treating
all Muslim-Americans

11:30.123 --> 11:37.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
differently? Are we going to
start subjecting
them to special surveillance?
Are we going

11:37.397 --> 11:41.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to start discriminating against
them because
of their faith?

11:41.467 --> 11:46.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have heard these suggestions
during the
course of this campaign. Do
Republican officials

11:46.205 --> 11:48.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
actually agree with this?

11:48.074 --> 11:53.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have gone through moments in
our history
before when we acted out of
fear, and we came

11:53.513 --> 12:01.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to regret it. We have seen our
government
mistreat our fellow citizens,
and it has been

12:01.788 --> 12:05.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a shameful part of our history.

12:05.792 --> 12:12.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a country founded on
basic freedoms,
including freedom of religion.
We don't have

12:12.699 --> 12:22.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
religious tests here. Our
founders, our Constitution,
our Bill of Rights are clear
about that.

12:22.709 --> 12:28.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if we ever abandon those
values, we wouldn't
only make it a lot easier to
radicalize people

12:28.114 --> 12:34.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here and around the world, but
we would have
betrayed the very things we are
trying to

12:34.454 --> 12:43.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
protect, the pluralism and the
openness, our
rule of law, our civil
liberties, the very

12:43.997 --> 12:48.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things that make this country
great, the very
things that make us exceptional.

12:48.701 --> 12:56.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the terrorists would
have won. And
we cannot let that happen. I
will not let

12:56.309 --> 12:57.443 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that happen.

12:57.477 --> 13:00.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That was
President Obama speaking
today.

13:00.380 --> 13:05.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Omar Mateen didn't come to the
U.S. from another
country to carry out the attack
in Orlando.

13:05.918 --> 13:12.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was born and raised here.
Authorities are
trying to understand whether and
how he adopted

13:12.191 --> 13:16.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
radical ideas before he turned
to unspeakable
violence.

13:16.729 --> 13:21.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Obama administration says
that stopping
the radicalization of young
people who live

13:21.434 --> 13:25.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the United States is a
national security
priority.

13:25.371 --> 13:30.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"NewsHour" producer P.J. Tobia
has the story
of one part of that effort.

13:30.043 --> 13:34.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: America, you claim to
have the greatest
army history has known.

13:34.847 --> 13:40.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: This is a call to
arms by the
so-called Islamic State, aimed
squarely at

13:40.086 --> 13:42.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
young, disillusioned American
Muslims.

13:42.588 --> 13:46.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Liars, fornicators,
corporations,
and for the freedoms of
sodomites.

13:46.993 --> 13:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: This is the U.S.
government's
digital counterpoint to ISIS'
call for recruits.

13:53.099 --> 13:58.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the FBI's Don't Be a Puppet
Web site,
an online role-playing exercise.

13:58.271 --> 14:03.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a kind of choose your own
adventure experience,
users walk through the steps of
extremism

14:03.209 --> 14:05.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the evolution into a violent
radical.

14:05.545 --> 14:08.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
YAAMA FUJIKURA, Japanese
American: When a
rock comes through your window
and you're

14:08.481 --> 14:11.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
eating supper, you better have a
plan.

14:11.217 --> 14:16.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: And this is the
government's offline
strategy, a program where the
elderly, like

14:16.556 --> 14:21.394 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
this 89-year old
Japanese-American woman,
share their own stories of
discrimination

14:21.427 --> 14:25.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Muslim teens, hoping to
prevent their
anger from festering into
violence.

14:25.832 --> 14:33.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
YAAMA FUJIKURA: And this
business of becoming
terribly bitter and terribly
unkind to others

14:33.906 --> 14:35.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is not the way out.

14:35.575 --> 14:37.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: There are some people here
who have been
through some pretty messy
things.

14:37.810 --> 14:43.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: It is all part of
the Obama administration's
efforts of countering violent
extremism, or

14:44.016 --> 14:49.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CVE. Opponents argue it's a way
for the government
to spy on Muslims. Advocates say
it's a way

14:49.722 --> 14:54.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for American Muslims to work
with law enforcement,
identifying and preventing
radicalization

14:55.027 --> 14:56.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
before attacks happen.

14:56.796 --> 15:02.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mehreen Farooq runs a federally
funded CVE
initiative in Montgomery County,
Maryland.

15:02.034 --> 15:04.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the program that pairs
Muslim teens with
the elderly

15:04.737 --> 15:09.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEHREEN FAROOQ, CVE Initiative:
We have brought
together various NGOs, different
faith community

15:09.075 --> 15:15.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
leaders, educators,
counterterrorism experts,
gang prevention experts, to
understand, what

15:15.114 --> 15:20.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are the resources that we have
here and what
can we do to build community
resilience and

15:20.319 --> 15:22.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to prevent violent extremism?

15:22.188 --> 15:25.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: One issue has been
getting young
men to participate, but there
are strategies

15:25.992 --> 15:27.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for reaching them as well.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MUHAMMED, Muslim Community
Member: They're
genuinely good kids and
everything, but they

15:30.363 --> 15:32.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
may be a little lost in life.

15:32.165 --> 15:36.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: This man is a member
of a large
Muslim community in the
mid-Atlantic region.

15:36.369 --> 15:41.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will call him Muhammed. We
have concealed
his identity and altered his
voice, at his

15:41.841 --> 15:43.676 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
request.

15:43.709 --> 15:47.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Muhammed isn't part of any
government program,
but he seeks out young Muslim
men, usually

15:47.413 --> 15:51.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in their early to mid-20s, who
have explored
the dark message of Islamic
extremism.

15:51.717 --> 15:58.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MUHAMMED: My goal is to take
them away from
that and let them know that
that's just a

15:58.524 --> 16:00.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bunch of fantasy.

16:00.092 --> 16:03.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Teens who think the
deck is stacked
against them are an easy target.

16:03.062 --> 16:06.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MUHAMMED: They really want to be
married or
they really want to have sex,
but the only

16:06.766 --> 16:13.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
way to have sex is to be
married, and the
only way to get married is to
have a career.

16:13.272 --> 16:16.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the only way to have a
career is to go
to college or go get some kind
of a skill.

16:16.809 --> 16:20.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For them, that looks like an
awfully tall
mountain to climb.

16:20.646 --> 16:24.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: ISIS propaganda, on
the other
hand, offers immediate
gratification through

16:24.984 --> 16:26.786 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
jihad.

16:26.819 --> 16:33.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MUHAMMED: You need to be coming
over to Syria
or Somalia. There's free sex
slaves and wives

16:33.059 --> 16:39.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and all of this utopia. That
resonates to
them because now they see a path
to having

16:39.298 --> 16:41.167 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a proper family.

16:41.200 --> 16:44.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Muhammed introduces
these young
men to male role models in the
Muslim community.

16:44.770 --> 16:47.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RIZWAN JAKA, All Dulles Area
Muslim Society:
South Asian food that will go to
South Asian

16:47.506 --> 16:49.275 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
households.

16:49.308 --> 16:53.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Rizwan Jaka argues
for working
closely with the government.
He's the board

16:53.179 --> 16:58.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president at the All Dulles Area
Muslim Society
in suburban Virginia.

16:58.050 --> 17:03.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The society doesn't receive
federal CVE funds,
but partners with a local FBI
field office

17:03.356 --> 17:07.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Department of Homeland
Security. It also
sponsors Boy and Girl Scout
programs.

17:07.593 --> 17:11.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RIZWAN JAKA: If you see someone
that is going
to do harm to our country or you
hear about

17:11.764 --> 17:15.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it, we absolutely must tell law
enforcement.
That is our Islamic duty.

17:15.635 --> 17:19.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
P.J. TOBIA: Secretary of
Homeland Security
Jeh Johnson visited the
society's mosque twice

17:20.006 --> 17:25.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last year. This year, the
organization received
a community leadership award
from the FBI.

17:25.878 --> 17:30.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, members took part in
an interfaith
vigil for those killed in the
Orlando attacks.

17:30.516 --> 17:34.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RIZWAN JAKA: We bring the FBI
here for town
hall meetings and speaking to
the community

17:34.220 --> 17:38.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
during prayer services, engaging
together
for a better society.

17:38.257 --> 17:42.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Parents have brought
troubled
youth who have broken no laws,
but shown an

17:42.194 --> 17:47.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interest in ideology of the
Islamic State,
to the society's imam, Mohamed
Magid.

17:47.133 --> 17:51.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RIZWAN JAKA: Imam Magid actually
talks with
them, especially when they ask
about ISIS,

17:51.504 --> 17:57.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because there's this twisted
idealism that
people have of ISIS, these few
individuals,

17:57.710 --> 18:01.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and he challenges them. Imam
Magid says look,
I know, where in the Koran does
it say you

18:01.914 --> 18:03.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can burn someone alive?

18:03.549 --> 18:07.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: The push for CVE
comes straight
from the top.

18:07.219 --> 18:13.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In 2011, President Obama
released his first
CVE strategy. Last year, the
White House hosted

18:13.292 --> 18:18.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an international summit with
representatives
from more than 100 nations and
dozens of American

18:18.064 --> 18:22.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Muslim groups. The Department of
Homeland
Security's CVE Task Force
provides oversight

18:22.868 --> 18:26.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the entire government's
strategy in this
area. The president is asking
for more than

18:27.006 --> 18:29.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
$96 million for these programs
in 2017.

18:29.575 --> 18:33.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEH JOHNSON, U.S. Secretary of
Homeland Security:
This is as critical as any other
homeland

18:33.612 --> 18:35.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
security mission that we have
going right
now.

18:35.614 --> 18:39.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Secretary Johnson
has spoken widely
about the role of America's
Muslims in stopping

18:39.885 --> 18:44.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terrorist attacks. "NewsHour"
co-anchor Judy
Woodruff discussed it with him
last week.

18:44.890 --> 18:49.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEH JOHNSON: The global
terrorist threat has
evolved to include, not just
terrorist-directed

18:49.495 --> 18:55.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attacks, but terrorist-inspired
attacks by
homegrown, home-born violent
extremists. In

18:55.334 --> 18:59.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this environment, it's critical
that we dedicate
ourselves to CVE.

19:00.006 --> 19:03.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Johnson describes
the initiatives
as a way to connect with
minority communities.

19:03.976 --> 19:09.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEH JOHNSON: To build bridges,
send the message
let us help you in your efforts
to counter

19:09.648 --> 19:13.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
violent extremism in your
community if you
see someone going in the wrong
direction.

19:14.020 --> 19:18.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Some argue the
approach is too
soft, ignoring what they see as
the real problem,

19:18.858 --> 19:20.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Islamic terrorism.

19:20.893 --> 19:24.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, some Muslim groups
and civil libertarians
say that countering violent
extremism programs

19:25.031 --> 19:29.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
turns teachers and imams into
spies, and innocent
Muslims into suspects.

19:29.235 --> 19:32.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DALIA MOGAHED, Institute for
Social Policy
and Understanding: Stigmatizing
people doesn't

19:32.238 --> 19:38.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make us safer. It actually
alienates young
people and can make them more
susceptible,

19:38.177 --> 19:42.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
more vulnerable to the
propaganda of extremists.

19:42.348 --> 19:46.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Dalia Mogahed
researches American
Muslims and is the co-author of
"Who Speaks

19:47.019 --> 19:48.854 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for Islam?"

19:48.888 --> 19:53.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DALIA MOGAHED: Its premise is
that a community
is predisposed to violence. For
no other reason

19:54.026 --> 20:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than because of their faith,
they are essentially
a pool of suspects and are
engaged on that

20:00.566 --> 20:07.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
premise. There is a
securitization of the
relationship between the U.S.
government and

20:07.106 --> 20:08.941 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Muslims.

20:08.974 --> 20:11.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: She thinks that this
securitization
can have ripple effects within
the community.

20:11.343 --> 20:16.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DALIA MOGAHED: When you get to a
situation
where educators or mental health
professionals

20:16.582 --> 20:23.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are being asked to act as
informants, you
are going to create an
environment where people

20:23.823 --> 20:25.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
aren't trusting their teachers.

20:25.658 --> 20:31.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEH JOHNSON: It's not at all
throwing a net
of suspicion on these groups. I
totally agree

20:31.664 --> 20:36.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we shouldn't do that, but
if they see
somebody traveling in the wrong
direction,

20:36.502 --> 20:40.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contact law enforcement, contact
a community
leader, say something to
somebody.

20:40.573 --> 20:45.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Meanwhile, some
Muslim parents
fear that if a child suddenly
developed has

20:45.177 --> 20:49.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an interest in the so-called
Islamic State,
reporting that interest could
lead directly

20:49.882 --> 20:51.717 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to a jail cell.

20:51.750 --> 20:56.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEH JOHNSON: Parents should
encourage someone
who is upset about something,
who finds a

20:56.889 --> 21:02.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
certain appeal, to channel that
interest and
energy into a more positive,
peaceful direction.

21:02.394 --> 21:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are many different ways to
counter violent
extremism beyond just contacting
law enforcement.

21:08.033 --> 21:12.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Many of those ways
hope to build
trust in Muslim communities that
feel under

21:12.605 --> 21:14.206 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the microscope.

21:14.240 --> 21:24.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm P.J.
Tobia.

21:24.350 --> 21:31.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The weapon used in
the Orlando
shootings is at once one of the
most popular

21:31.090 --> 21:38.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and most reviled weapons in
America, the AR-15,
the civilian version of the U.S.
military's

21:38.297 --> 21:39.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
standard issue rifle.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang has a closer look.

21:41.767 --> 21:47.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The NRA says it's
America's most
popular rifle, used legally and
safely by

21:47.840 --> 21:53.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
millions of people. A lawyer for
victims'
families says it's the gold
standard for mass

21:53.712 --> 21:58.851 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
murder of innocent civilians.

21:58.884 --> 22:05.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The AR-15 has been used in some
of the nation's
worst mass shootings, at the
Sandy Hook Elementary

22:05.090 --> 22:11.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
School in Newtown, Connecticut,
a movie theater
in Aurora, Colorado, an Oregon
community college,

22:11.664 --> 22:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and now an Orlando gay club.

22:14.200 --> 22:19.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To learn more about the rifle,
its popularity
among gun enthusiasts and its
place in American

22:19.672 --> 22:24.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
culture, we went to a Northern
Virginia gun
range to speak with former
Deputy Assistant

22:24.443 --> 22:30.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Defense Secretary Phillip
Carter, himself
a gun owner, who knows the AR-15
well from

22:30.182 --> 22:32.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his service as an Army officer.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why is this weapon so popular?

22:34.386 --> 22:36.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHILLIP CARTER, Former U.S.
Deputy Assistant
Defense Secretary: So, the AR-15
is America's

22:36.355 --> 22:38.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
rifle because it's what
America's military
carries.

22:38.958 --> 22:44.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's modeled on the M-16 that's
been carried
by America's Army and America's
Marine Corps

22:44.263 --> 22:50.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the rest of our services
since Vietnam.
Today, roughly 20,000 troops
carry a similar

22:50.035 --> 22:54.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rifle in Iraq and Afghanistan,
and even those
who don't serve feel that
they're part of

22:54.974 --> 22:56.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that effort when they carry the
AR-15.

22:56.642 --> 23:01.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: I have read that the
recoil is
a bit gentler than some other
rifles.

23:01.747 --> 23:06.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHILIP CARTER: So, the recoil on
the M-16
or the AR-15 is designed to be
light, so that

23:06.719 --> 23:11.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you can keep it on target and
continue to
shoot bullet after bullet after
bullet. It's

23:11.757 --> 23:13.525 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by design.

23:13.559 --> 23:17.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a massive spring here in
the stock
that absorbs quite a bit of the
recoil. There's

23:17.863 --> 23:23.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also, by design, a gas system
that takes a
lot of the gas from the firing
of each bullet,

23:23.769 --> 23:29.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it evaporates it, so that
when each bullet
is fired, that gas and that
recoil isn't coming

23:29.475 --> 23:33.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back on the shoulder each time,
but it's actually
in the rifle in a more
constructive manner.

23:33.812 --> 23:38.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And that feature
would also allow
a shooter to keep steady.

23:38.384 --> 23:43.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHILIP CARTER: It's a military
rifle. It's
designed to deliver masses of
bullets to a

23:43.622 --> 23:49.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very specific target over time.
This is a
weapon designed to kill in mass
quantities.

23:49.995 --> 23:51.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a military weapon.

23:51.797 --> 23:55.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: So this is
essentially a civilian
version, you said, of the M-4 or
the M-16.

23:55.367 --> 24:00.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHILIP CARTER: Yes. This is very
much like
a civilian version of a Humvee
or a civilian

24:00.239 --> 24:04.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
version of some other type of
military gear.
There are some modifications to
this that

24:04.310 --> 24:07.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have been made to make it a
civilian variant.

24:07.146 --> 24:12.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's different on the civilian
versions
is, it only allows semiautomatic
fire. So

24:12.217 --> 24:19.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you flip this to fire, and it
allows you to
shoot one shot at a time. The
military versions

24:19.858 --> 24:25.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would allow you to switch to
semiautomatic
and then, once more, either for
three-round

24:25.631 --> 24:29.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bursts or for fully automatic,
if you're shooting
an older variant of the M-16.

24:29.935 --> 24:31.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Fully automatic,
meaning?

24:31.904 --> 24:36.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHILIP CARTER: You squeeze the
trigger, and
the weapon keeps firing until
the magazine

24:36.975 --> 24:42.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
runs dry. Your ability to put
bullets down-range
with this weapon is limited
mostly by your

24:42.748 --> 24:44.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ability to reload it.

24:44.817 --> 24:50.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the magazine for this rifle
looks like
this. This is a 30-round
magazine that carries

24:50.389 --> 24:57.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
30 bullets of the
5.56-millimeter variety.
And it goes into the magazine
well right here.

24:57.730 --> 25:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's very easy to reload. It's
very easy to
get more ammunition in there and
continue

25:01.266 --> 25:03.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to shoot at your target.

25:03.035 --> 25:09.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The ammunition for the M-16 or
the AR-15 is
a 5.56-millimeter bullet. It's a
very small

25:09.675 --> 25:14.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and very fast bullet that does a
lot of tissue
damage when it hits a person. So
just the

25:14.113 --> 25:19.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tip here is the bullet. It's
roughly the size
of your pinkie tip. But it's
propelled forward

25:19.385 --> 25:25.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by a massive cartridge of powder
that shoots
this at a very high velocity,
creating a bullet

25:25.657 --> 25:30.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that can punch through targets,
whether they're
human or otherwise, with a great
deal of lethality

25:30.896 --> 25:32.598 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and power.

25:32.631 --> 25:36.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other thing about this
bullet is, because
it's so small and moves so fast,
it tends

25:36.268 --> 25:40.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to tumble or become volatile
when it hits
a person, and so it tends to
create a very

25:40.906 --> 25:45.844 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
wound and very
difficult-to-treat wounds.
Again, it's a military weapon.
It's not designed

25:45.878 --> 25:49.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for hunting, where you might
want to preserve
the meat so that you can eat it.
It's designed

25:49.615 --> 25:51.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to wound or kill soldiers in
combat.

25:51.417 --> 25:55.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: There are hundreds of
companies
in the United States that make
verges of the

25:55.854 --> 26:01.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AR-15. The NRA says the weapon
can be used
not only for hunting, but for
sports shooting

26:01.794 --> 26:03.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and self-defense.

26:03.629 --> 26:10.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

26:10.569 --> 26:21.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

26:21.680 --> 26:27.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": an
aquarium moving
its dolphins to an ocean
sanctuary; and one

26:27.119 --> 26:32.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year after the mass shooting in
Charleston,
how that city's Mother Emanuel
AME Church

26:32.925 --> 26:34.860 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is healing.

26:34.893 --> 26:39.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But, first: The
Democratic National
Committee said today Russian
government hackers

26:39.665 --> 26:45.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have penetrated its computer
network. Breaches
by two separate groups allowed
hackers to

26:45.137 --> 26:51.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
access e-mails, internal chats,
and opposition
research Democrats have compiled
on presumptive

26:51.343 --> 26:54.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Republican nominee Donald Trump.

26:54.112 --> 26:58.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hackers may have had access for
a year. The
Washington Post reported that
computer networks

26:59.017 --> 27:01.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for Hillary Clinton and Trump
were also targeted.

27:01.653 --> 27:07.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We get some insight on how this
happened and
why from Dmitri Alperovitch. He
is the co-

27:07.526 --> 27:13.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
founder of CrowdStrike, the
intelligence company
that investigated the breach for
the DNC.

27:13.165 --> 27:18.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Sasha Issenberg, a
contributor for Bloomberg
Politics and author of the book
"The Victory

27:18.337 --> 27:22.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lab: The Secret Science of
Winning Campaigns."

27:22.374 --> 27:27.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Dmitri Alperovitch, how
significant an intrusion
was this into the Democratic
Party's file?

27:27.679 --> 27:29.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH, Co-Founder
and CEO, CrowdStrike:
This was a pretty scary
intrusion.

27:29.648 --> 27:34.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, there were two
intrusions in
place here. Two separate Russian
government-affiliated

27:34.286 --> 27:38.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actors, we believe, that are
part of the intelligence
services of Russia infiltrated
the network

27:38.724 --> 27:43.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first in the summer of last year
and were
able to get access of the
communications service

27:43.495 --> 27:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the DNC, essentially giving
them the ability
to monitor the e-mail traffic
that was going

27:47.699 --> 27:53.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through their servers, and a
completely separate
actor that penetrated that
network in April

27:53.338 --> 27:58.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this year and went straight
for the research
department of the Democratic
National Committee,

27:58.343 --> 28:02.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
specifically looking for the
opposition files
on the Republican presidential
candidate,

28:02.915 --> 28:04.616 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump.

28:04.650 --> 28:07.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: How did the DNC find
out? How
were they alerted to this
intrusion, and how

28:07.352 --> 28:09.087 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were you?

28:09.121 --> 28:12.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: Well, in
early May, they
discovered that there was
something off on

28:12.357 --> 28:15.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the network that was highly
suspicious. And
they called us in.

28:15.260 --> 28:17.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Their internal I.T.
people?

28:17.462 --> 28:21.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: Their
internal I.T. people
determined that something may be
off. They

28:21.233 --> 28:23.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
didn't yet know if it was a
breach. They asked
us to come in and evaluate.

28:23.735 --> 28:28.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, within 24 hours, we were
able to ascertain
with our software deployed on
all their machines

28:28.540 --> 28:32.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there was in fact two breaches
from two separate
Russian intelligence services
that were inside

28:32.711 --> 28:34.479 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that network.

28:34.513 --> 28:38.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Sasha Issenberg, you
wrote a book
about how dependent campaigns
have become

28:38.383 --> 28:44.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on data and the things needed to
support that
amount of data, specifically
about the 2008

28:44.489 --> 28:51.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama campaign. So, in this
case, what kinds
of things exist in this -- in
these records?

28:51.063 --> 28:56.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SASHA ISSENBERG, Author, "The
Victory Lab":
Yes, you know, parties at this
point are largely

28:57.002 --> 28:58.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hubs of information.

28:58.770 --> 29:03.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They gather intelligence on the
electorate,
on -- data on individual voters
that they

29:03.942 --> 29:09.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
use the make tactical decisions,
and then
they're kind of a permanent
research operation,

29:09.414 --> 29:14.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
especially at times like this,
where there
are open primaries within a
party, and you

29:14.219 --> 29:15.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't know who the nominee is
going to be.

29:15.988 --> 29:20.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the DNC basically says to
the Clinton
campaign or Sanders or O'Malley
campaigns,

29:20.659 --> 29:25.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we will spend the year building
resources
for you that we can hand to you
when you're

29:25.163 --> 29:32.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the nominee. In this case, a
dossier on Donald
Trump, probably the DNC has more
information

29:32.337 --> 29:37.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in its files on its servers than
any other
organization that has been
researching Donald

29:37.576 --> 29:41.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump for an hour -- for a year
-- pardon
me -- and not just Trump, but
his circle,

29:41.747 --> 29:43.482 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his advisers, his staffers.

29:43.515 --> 29:48.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so a foreign intelligence
organization
that wants to understand who
those people

29:48.687 --> 29:52.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are, the relationships they
have, potential
points of leverage or influence
would probably

29:52.658 --> 29:56.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
find that the DNC has more of it
sitting around
than anyone else.

29:57.029 --> 30:00.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now, Sasha, it
should be said
that Clinton's campaign says
that they were

30:00.332 --> 30:04.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not compromised, which doesn't
mean that information
that they, as you point out,
have on file

30:04.670 --> 30:08.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the DNC wasn't compromised,
but we're
not talking about financial or
donor records

30:08.874 --> 30:10.676 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
here, are we?

30:10.709 --> 30:14.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SASHA ISSENBERG: From what we
quarter from
the reports -- and, as Dmitri
says, it seems

30:14.446 --> 30:18.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like there was a goal to go to
the opposition
research department.

30:18.884 --> 30:23.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Somebody like Hillary Clinton,
who has been
in public life for a while, you
have to imagine

30:23.321 --> 30:29.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that foreign intelligence
gathering operations
have tried to gather information
on her, so

30:29.828 --> 30:34.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they can try to game out
how she thinks
and how she approaches things
and who her

30:34.066 --> 30:35.967 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
contacts are.

30:36.001 --> 30:40.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump is sort of new to
the world as
a political figure. And so for
foreign governments

30:40.405 --> 30:50.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that want to assess risk,
geopolitical decision-making
or potentially understand how to
get at him,

30:50.082 --> 30:56.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you imagine that the DNC just
has that information
available. A lot of this is
stuff that is

30:56.221 --> 30:59.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the public domain, stuff from
court filings
from...

30:59.591 --> 31:01.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But it's all in one
place.

31:01.359 --> 31:03.095 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

31:03.128 --> 31:04.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SASHA ISSENBERG: It's all in one
place and
they have done a lot of the
legwork for you.

31:04.529 --> 31:07.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Mr. Alperovitch, why
do we think
Russia is behind this?

31:07.132 --> 31:10.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: Well, we
actually believe
that it's not just Russia, but
two specific

31:10.569 --> 31:12.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
intelligence agencies within
Russia.

31:12.871 --> 31:17.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is the military intelligence
agency called
the GRU, and the other possibly
the FSB, which

31:17.876 --> 31:22.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the successor to the Soviet
KGB. It's actually
interesting, because we saw no
collaboration

31:22.647 --> 31:24.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whatsoever between those two
threat actors.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: One hand didn't know
what the
other was doing?

31:25.951 --> 31:28.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: Not only did
they not
know what they were doing. They
were actually

31:28.954 --> 31:32.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doing some of the same things
repeatedly,
not knowing that someone already
had that

31:32.758 --> 31:34.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
information that they were
after.

31:34.659 --> 31:37.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is actually not unusual
for Russia.
They have a very aggressive
competition between

31:37.996 --> 31:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their intelligence agencies.
They're always
trying to one-up one another, to
look better

31:41.767 --> 31:44.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in front of Putin, to get more
budget, more
power.

31:44.369 --> 31:48.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But how -- what use
is this kind
of information, especially if a
lot of it

31:48.740 --> 31:53.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is in the public record anyhow?
What use is
it to foreign governments like
Russia?

31:53.945 --> 31:58.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: Well, one,
they really
want to understand what is
Donald Trump thinking.

31:58.283 --> 32:02.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No one knows really. He doesn't
have a long
history in politics. He said
some complimentary

32:02.654 --> 32:06.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
things of Putin. Is that
something that he's
going to continue if he's
president following

32:07.025 --> 32:08.794 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that policy?

32:08.827 --> 32:11.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the other thing is that is
interesting
is they probably didn't know
what they would

32:11.797 --> 32:17.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
find. They didn't know that all
this information
was public. In the Russian -- in
Russia, you

32:17.702 --> 32:22.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have political parties engaged
in all kinds
of nefarious activity. And they
may just assume

32:22.174 --> 32:24.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that in America it works the
exact same way.

32:24.142 --> 32:26.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And what do you do
to stop it
from happening again?

32:26.278 --> 32:29.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: Well, this
weekend, we
actually did a complete
remediation of that

32:29.347 --> 32:33.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
network. We cleaned it up. We
kicked out both
adversaries simultaneously.

32:33.618 --> 32:38.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So as of this week, that network
is now clean,
and DNC actually asked us to
monitor it with

32:38.156 --> 32:41.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our software going forward,
because we are
pretty certain that the Russians
are going

32:41.293 --> 32:45.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to try to regain access to that
network. Their
interest in the political system
of the United

32:45.263 --> 32:47.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
States certainly is not going to
go away.

32:47.132 --> 32:51.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, Sasha, what do
campaigns
do as they become more and more
dependent

32:51.736 --> 32:55.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on this kind of electronic web
of information
to protect themselves?

32:55.140 --> 32:59.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SASHA ISSENBERG: Well, you know,
we saw a
different type of data breach at
the DNC six

32:59.044 --> 33:04.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
months ago, when a Bernie
Sanders staffer
was found to have been able to
access information

33:04.683 --> 33:08.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the Clinton campaign had
developed on
individual voters.

33:08.253 --> 33:12.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, that type of tactical
information,
you imagine, is not of much use
to foreign

33:12.557 --> 33:18.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
governments. And I suspect that
foreign governments
will find that a lot of the
information that

33:18.697 --> 33:23.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they would get through an
opposition research
department isn't particularly
strategically

33:23.468 --> 33:25.303 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
valuable.

33:25.337 --> 33:27.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the goal of opposition
research ultimately
is to get this stuff into the
public eye.

33:27.739 --> 33:31.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so if the DNC thought that
it was revealing
about Donald Trump, they would
probably be

33:31.309 --> 33:35.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
similarly angling to get it out
into the public.
This is not information that's
designed to

33:35.680 --> 33:37.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be kept under wraps for too long
if it's tasty.

33:37.749 --> 33:41.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And the RNC should
be worried
as well, I imagine.

33:41.286 --> 33:46.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sasha -- Sasha Issenberg of
Bloomberg Politics
and author of "The Victory Lab,"
and Dmitri

33:46.658 --> 33:49.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Alperovitch of CrowdStrike,
thank you both
very much.

33:49.928 --> 33:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: Thank you.

33:55.033 --> 34:00.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SASHA ISSENBERG: Thanks, Gwen.

34:00.171 --> 34:06.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next: our weekly
science segment.

34:06.044 --> 34:10.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a sea change coming to
one of the
country's most popular
aquariums. As many

34:10.515 --> 34:15.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have grown concerned about
keeping dolphins
in captivity, Baltimore's
National Aquarium

34:15.987 --> 34:20.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today announced that it will
move its pod
of dolphins to the first
sanctuary for these

34:20.992 --> 34:22.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
mammals in the world.

34:22.928 --> 34:27.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The decision to end the dolphin
exhibit comes
after SeaWorld and Ringling
Brothers have

34:27.933 --> 34:30.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
announced their own changes.

34:30.168 --> 34:35.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Science correspondent Miles
O'Brien broke
the story for our Leading Edge
series.

34:35.106 --> 34:37.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: This is Chesapeake.

34:37.742 --> 34:39.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Oh, it's
Chesapeake. Hi, Chesapeake.
Hey.

34:39.711 --> 34:45.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's time for a quick physical
exam, and Chesapeake,
the bottlenose dolphin, appears
to be doing

34:45.650 --> 34:50.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fine. She is one of eight
dolphins held by
the National Aquarium in
Baltimore.

34:50.989 --> 34:55.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: We're going to take a look
in her mouth.
And they have teeth and they
grab each other

34:55.226 --> 34:56.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and they break teeth.

34:56.795 --> 34:58.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: She doesn't need
the orthodontist.
They're nice and straight.

34:58.830 --> 35:05.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Born into captivity 24 years
ago, she has
always lived indoors, in a
concrete tank,

35:05.103 --> 35:10.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a sterile, artificial world that
bears no
resemblance to the natural
environment where

35:10.575 --> 35:17.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dolphins belong. But it appears
she and the
rest of this pod are destined
for a sea change.

35:17.215 --> 35:20.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN RACANELLI,®MD-BO / CEO,
National Aquarium:
We're announcing today that we
are moving

35:20.118 --> 35:26.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our dolphins to a sanctuary, a
seaside natural
seawater sanctuary by the end of
the year

35:26.658 --> 35:28.493 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2020.

35:28.526 --> 35:32.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: John Racanelli is
CEO of the
National Aquarium, and he's
announcing something

35:32.597 --> 35:38.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that has never been done before.
The aquarium
plans to build a large outdoor
Marine mammal

35:38.136 --> 35:43.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sanctuary in Florida or the
Caribbean, a seaside
pen carved from nature.

35:43.408 --> 35:48.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN RACANELLI: This is a
million-and-a-half
gallons. This, we'd be looking
at tens of

35:48.079 --> 35:53.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
millions, maybe hundreds of
millions of gallons
of water, seawater, not
manufactured saltwater,

35:53.151 --> 35:55.053 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as we do here.

35:55.086 --> 36:00.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The decision
comes amid a rising
tide of opposition to
dolphinariums all over

36:00.191 --> 36:01.659 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the world.

Heather Morris is a frequent
protester at
the Inner Harbor in Baltimore.

36:05.163 --> 36:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEATHER MORRIS, Animal Rights
Activist: I
think that is a crucial step in
them pioneering

36:09.134 --> 36:15.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a path to what is the right
thing for us to
do with these animals now, to
get them back

36:15.774 --> 36:21.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into an environment that is like
their natural
habitat. There is no OK scenario
for them

36:21.279 --> 36:23.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be in captivity.

36:23.148 --> 36:28.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And yet the
National Aquarium
is alone in taking this bold,
expensive step.

36:28.820 --> 36:32.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There are about 30 other
dolphinariums just
in the U.S.

36:32.090 --> 36:36.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Leaping three feet out
of water
and through a small hoop is only
one of the

36:37.028 --> 36:40.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
accomplishments of Flippy the
pride of the
studios at Marineland Florida.

36:40.732 --> 36:44.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Humans have been
capturing
and training dolphins for
entertainment for

36:44.702 --> 36:51.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about 80 years. Over time, the
shows got more
elaborate, even garish, the
crowds larger,

36:51.543 --> 36:56.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and the venues added the
dolphins' cetacean
cousins, orcas, to the marquees.

36:56.815 --> 37:02.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A multibillion-dollar business
evolved that
forces wild animals and their
progeny to perform

37:02.620 --> 37:09.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for humans in exchange for food.
They are
trained to do circus tricks,
give thrill rides,

37:09.527 --> 37:16.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and be docile with customers in
glorified
petting zoos, often called a
dolphin experience.

37:16.668 --> 37:21.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Looking at their permanent
smile, it is easy
to misconstrue what this
experience is really

37:21.706 --> 37:23.475 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like for them.

37:23.508 --> 37:25.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RIC O'BARRY, Former Dolphin
Trainer: It's
really the dolphin smile that
has created

37:25.944 --> 37:30.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
this multibillion-dollar
industry, and it's
literally an optical illusion.

37:30.949 --> 37:36.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Ric O'Barry was
once the highest
paid dolphin trainer in the
world. He began

37:36.988 --> 37:43.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
capturing, training and breeding
dolphins
at the Miami Seaquarium in the
1960s. He eventually

37:43.228 --> 37:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
became the head trainer for a TV
series that
launched the cetacean show
business to a new

37:49.434 --> 37:51.035 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
level.

37:51.069 --> 37:54.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMEN (singing): They call him
Flipper, Flipper,
Flipper, faster than lightning.

37:55.006 --> 38:02.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: "Flipper" aired
on NBC from
1964 until 1967. Flipper was
actually five

38:02.580 --> 38:08.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
female dolphins. The pressure to
perform and
the stress of captivity took its
toll on the

38:08.653 --> 38:11.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dolphins' health. One of them
became despondent.

38:11.156 --> 38:18.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RIC O'BARRY: Flipper died in my
arms of suicide.
Yes, I know that's a very strong
word to use

38:18.530 --> 38:26.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for an animal, but it's the only
animal that
is not an automatic air
breather. Every breath

38:26.571 --> 38:29.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they take is a conscious effort.

38:29.674 --> 38:34.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Think about that for a second.
Every breath
is a conscious effort, which
means they can

38:34.679 --> 38:39.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
end their life any time they
want to if it
becomes too difficult, too
stressful, by simply

38:39.684 --> 38:41.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not taking the next breath.

38:41.553 --> 38:47.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: By 1970, O'Barry
had a complete
change of heart. Ever since, he
has tirelessly

38:47.091 --> 38:52.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
traveled the world crusading to
shut down
the shows, and end the era of
captivity.

38:52.630 --> 38:54.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RIC O'BARRY: We have to admit we
made a mistake.

38:55.033 --> 38:59.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: We found him at
The Hague,
testifying before the Dutch
Parliament, which

38:59.204 --> 39:01.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is pondering the fate of a
controversial dolphinarium.

39:01.806 --> 39:05.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RIC O'BARRY: It's been a failed
experiment.
It's time to admit that. And
we're going to

39:05.610 --> 39:10.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do the best we can. And it's
going to phase
it out. It's going to take many
years to phase

39:10.081 --> 39:11.783 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it out.

39:11.816 --> 39:17.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: His long campaign
picked up
a lot of steam in 2009 with the
release of

39:17.155 --> 39:22.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Academy Award-winning
documentary "The
Cove." The film reveals the
brutal reality

39:22.927 --> 39:30.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the annual corral of wild
dolphins in Taiji,
Japan. Fishermen there identify
the more desirable

39:30.468 --> 39:36.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dolphins, separate them from
their families,
and sell them to dolphin shows
for big money.

39:36.341 --> 39:38.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The rest of the animals are
slaughtered and
sold as meat.

39:38.910 --> 39:45.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: They only get $600 for a
dead dolphin,
but they can get more than
$150,000 for a

39:45.817 --> 39:47.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
live show dolphin.

39:47.518 --> 39:51.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: While the Taiji
capture and
slaughter has not ended, O'Barry
believes

39:51.389 --> 39:56.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it is just a matter of time
before the dolphin
shows will, and sanctuaries are
built.

39:56.327 --> 40:00.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RIC O'BARRY: When I first
started doing this
work trying to educate the
public, I was coming

40:00.265 --> 40:05.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from a place of guilt. Yes,
there is no question
about that. People thought I was
crazy. Dolphin

40:05.303 --> 40:10.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
captivity issue? What are you
talking about?
That's not a problem. Well,
today, it's a

40:10.775 --> 40:18.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mainstream issue. And so I see a
lot of change.
I'm encouraged. I'm very
encouraged.

40:18.483 --> 40:27.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN RACANELLI: Baby boomers
grew up on "Flipper,"
and millennials grew up on "Free
Willy." So

40:27.625 --> 40:32.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attitudes are changing. And that
is certainly
a factor. It's something we pay
close attention

40:32.130 --> 40:34.032 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to.

40:34.065 --> 40:38.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So are the
researchers who
make it their mission to seek
out these fascinating,

40:38.503 --> 40:44.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
intelligent mammals in the wild.
Marine mammalogist
Denise Herzing is founder and
research director

40:44.909 --> 40:47.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the Wild Dolphin Project in
Jupiter, Florida.

40:47.445 --> 40:52.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENISE HERZING, Founder, Wild
Dolphin Project:
It's definitely time we looked
at creating

40:52.150 --> 40:57.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dolphin retirement centers. We
have done it
for other species. We have done
it for chimps,

40:57.322 --> 41:01.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
elephants, giraffes. You name
it, we have
done it. Dolphins are hard. It's
a different

41:01.592 --> 41:05.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
environment, in a big sea pen.
It's expensive.
But we owe it to them, I think.

41:06.030 --> 41:10.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: For more than 30
years, she
and her team have studied wild
spotted dolphins

41:10.835 --> 41:16.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that live in shallow water off
the Bahamas,
hoping to understand their
behavior and the

41:16.207 --> 41:17.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
depths of their intellect.

41:18.009 --> 41:29.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over the years, they have built
a catalog
of 300 dolphins. In a typical
field season,

41:29.420 --> 41:36.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they will carefully track,
observe and record
video of about 100 individuals.
Herzing is

41:36.728 --> 41:42.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
focused on dolphin
communication. What might
the whistles and clicks mean?

41:42.700 --> 41:44.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How smart are they?

41:44.569 --> 41:52.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENISE HERZING: Very smart. They
problem-solve.
They can think in the abstract
and recognize

41:52.276 --> 41:58.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that. They have very good
comprehension and
cognitive skills, so they can
understand artificial

41:59.016 --> 42:03.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
languages that are presented to
them. They
understand word order, word
meaning.

42:03.488 --> 42:08.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Smart and
adaptive as they
are, captive dolphins will need
a lot of help

42:08.826 --> 42:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moving from indoor confinement
to a sanctuary,
even one that is cordoned off
and human-tended.

42:15.733 --> 42:20.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Baltimore, the man in charge
of the transition
is veterinarian and chief
science officer

42:20.571 --> 42:25.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brent Whitaker. He's been here
since the first
dolphins arrived in 1990.

42:25.343 --> 42:30.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BRENT WHITAKER, National
Aquarium: These animals
have been born in pools without
fish, without

42:30.081 --> 42:34.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rocks, without seaweed, without
natural sunlight,
without thunderstorms, without
hurricanes,

42:34.485 --> 42:39.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
without all sorts of things that
other natural
dolphins have already
experienced from growing

42:39.524 --> 42:41.225 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up with.

42:41.259 --> 42:44.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They don't know that. They are
going to have
to learn those things, and we're
going to

42:44.529 --> 42:48.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to help them learn the best
we can, but
we're not dolphins. So, there is
a challenge

42:48.633 --> 42:50.435 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

42:50.468 --> 42:53.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And if all goes
as planned,
by 2020, parents and children
will no longer

42:53.504 --> 42:59.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be able to see the dolphins here
in the flesh.
Will future generations be
missing out on

42:59.210 --> 43:00.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a teachable moment?

43:00.945 --> 43:03.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENISE HERZING: I really wonder,
what are
you really teaching your kids?
Are you teaching

43:03.881 --> 43:08.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your kids it's OK to confine an
animal, to
capture an animal for human
viewing?

43:08.619 --> 43:13.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN RACANELLI: I think we will
be able to
ensure that people still get a
chance to tune

43:13.791 --> 43:19.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into the lives of these dolphins
in a way
that still inspires them, yet
not have to

43:19.831 --> 43:23.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have them here in Baltimore.
Maybe dolphin
Skype is in our future.

43:23.434 --> 43:28.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And maybe then,
when people
dial up the dolphins for a
virtual visit in

43:28.639 --> 43:34.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their more natural habitat,
their smile will
be more than an illusion.

43:34.846 --> 43:43.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Miles O'Brien, the "PBS
NewsHour," Baltimore.

43:43.788 --> 43:56.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Next, we revisit the
city of Charleston,
South Carolina, which suffered
through its

43:56.501 --> 43:59.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
own mass shooting one year ago
this week.

43:59.637 --> 44:05.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nine people were gunned down
inside e-mail
Emanuel AME Church, including
its pastor,

44:05.610 --> 44:11.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Reverend Clementa Pinckney.
Alleged white
supremacist Dylann Roof was
charged on multiple

44:11.215 --> 44:15.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
counts, including murder and
hate crimes.
He could face the death penalty.

44:15.453 --> 44:20.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This past winter, the Reverend
Betty Deas
Clark took over as Emanuel's
pastor.

44:20.191 --> 44:24.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown spoke with her
recently, before
this week's shootings. She
traveled to Orlando

44:24.629 --> 44:29.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yesterday to support families
there and to
speak out in favor of gun
control.

44:29.567 --> 44:33.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Rev. Dr. Clark,
thank you for
letting us come visit.

44:33.938 --> 44:35.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. DR. BETTY DEAS CLARK,
Pastor, Emanuel
AME Church: Thank you for
coming.

44:35.506 --> 44:37.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let me ask you,
one year later,
how is your congregation faring?

44:37.441 --> 44:43.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. BETTY DEAS CLARK: Well, I
would like
to think that they're
processing, but yet

44:43.381 --> 44:50.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still grieving. It's a process
that may take
years, but it's good to see
signs of them

44:50.521 --> 44:52.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
being able to smile, to laugh
again.

44:52.890 --> 44:57.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right away, of
course, there
were expressions of forgiveness
to an extent

44:58.029 --> 45:02.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that I think amazed many in the
nation and
around the world.

45:02.233 --> 45:09.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is that still the sense that is
there, the
forgiveness, or are there other
emotions involved

45:09.440 --> 45:11.175 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as well?

45:11.208 --> 45:16.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. BETTY DEAS CLARK: Well,
there are an
array of emotions. But
forgiveness is more

45:16.247 --> 45:25.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than an emotion. It is a choice.
And so while
we confess forgiveness, we yet
still have

45:25.222 --> 45:29.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
feelings of many different
degrees, and that's
OK.

45:29.360 --> 45:31.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Anger?

45:31.128 --> 45:37.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. BETTY DEAS CLARK: It's OK
to be angry.
It's OK. It's OK to be tearful.
It's OK to

45:37.568 --> 45:43.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sometimes want to pull away from
the world
and just be by yourself. It's
OK, because

45:43.674 --> 45:49.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the road and the path for
grieving, it's different
for every individual.

45:49.146 --> 45:55.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: As a pastor, I
wonder, do you
think, how could this happen,
where is God,

45:55.820 --> 45:57.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
where was God at this moment?

45:57.688 --> 46:02.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. BETTY DEAS CLARK: Well, my
first response
was just as they were in Bible
study on that

46:02.493 --> 46:12.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wednesday night, so was I. And
so I guess
my first line of questioning
was, why them?

46:12.803 --> 46:16.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then it was to say, it could
have been
me.

46:16.907 --> 46:24.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But to say where was God, I
never asked that
question, simply because I truly
believe that

46:24.348 --> 46:30.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
God is omniscient. In other
words, he's everywhere
at the same time. And I believe,
that if God

46:30.621 --> 46:33.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
allowed it, he had a reason for
doing so.

46:33.457 --> 46:39.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This congregation
and you yourself
have spoken out about gun
control issues in

46:39.230 --> 46:39.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the aftermath, correct?

46:39.930 --> 46:41.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REV. BETTY DEAS CLARK: Correct.

46:41.165 --> 46:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And what would
you like to
see happen?

46:42.967 --> 46:47.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. BETTY DEAS CLARK: Well, I
would like
to see situations such as the
case with Dylann

46:47.905 --> 46:53.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Roof and not having a proper
complete background
check, I would like to see that
come to an

46:53.778 --> 46:55.713 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
end.

46:55.746 --> 47:01.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would like to see that loop
closed, because
it has already shown us how
dangerous it actually

47:01.919 --> 47:08.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, and can be again, until we
do something
positive and permanently about
it.

47:08.159 --> 47:13.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Dylann Roof
himself now faces
the death penalty. Do you
yourself have feelings

47:13.364 --> 47:14.832 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about that?

47:14.865 --> 47:19.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REV. BETTY DEAS CLARK: I never
considered
myself neither judge nor jury.

47:19.136 --> 47:26.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what I see is a young man
who -- someone
once asked me, if I were to meet
him, if he

47:26.577 --> 47:31.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were to ask to have an audience
with me, what
would I say. I would tell him
Jesus loves

47:31.949 --> 47:40.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him. I would tell him that there
is life beyond
June 17. And that's what I would
say.

47:40.725 --> 47:45.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had the opportunity a couple
of weeks ago
to meet his aunt. She came to
me, and she

47:45.730 --> 47:52.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was a little timid, probably
wondering, what
would I say and how would I
react? And I saw

47:52.169 --> 47:58.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that she was crying. And I
reached out to
her to give her a hug, and she
stepped back,

47:58.509 --> 48:04.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and she said, "Well let me tell
you this first."
She said, "I'm Dylann Roof's
aunt."

48:04.415 --> 48:10.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I said, "But you still need a
hug. Can I hug
you?" And she said yes.

48:10.254 --> 48:12.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And then you
talked?

48:12.289 --> 48:14.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REV. BETTY DEAS CLARK: And then
we talked,
and then we prayed. We did.

48:14.125 --> 48:19.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I asked you at
the beginning
how your congregation is doing a
year later.

48:19.597 --> 48:29.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What about the city, the
culture, all that
that provoked about race
relations in this

48:29.707 --> 48:31.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country? Where do you see
things?

48:31.609 --> 48:35.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. BETTY DEAS CLARK: Well,
while it may
have provoked the need to deal
with race relations,

48:35.746 --> 48:45.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it also brought to surface how
loving, how
caring and how united this city
really is,

48:45.322 --> 48:54.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because, in the aftermath of
June 17, the
community joined together,
walked together,

48:54.665 --> 48:58.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prayed together, worshiped
together.

48:58.569 --> 49:04.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, while we do have a way
to go, we have
come a long way.

49:04.475 --> 49:05.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You feel that?

49:05.342 --> 49:07.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
REV. BETTY DEAS CLARK: I
honestly do.

49:07.812 --> 49:16.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Rev.
Dr. Betty Clark,
thank you so much.

49:16.086 --> 49:26.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REV. BETTY DEAS CLARK: Thank
you.

49:26.931 --> 49:35.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
we take a
moment to remember the 49 people
whose lives

49:35.306 --> 49:40.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were tragically cut short Sunday
morning in
Orlando, Florida. Here now are
their names

49:40.845 --> 49:46.116 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and faces.

49:46.116 --> 49:50.855 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and faces.

50:42.306 --> 50:47.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I'm Gwen Ifill.

50:47.878 --> 50:52.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I'm Gwen Ifill.

52:45.863 --> 52:47.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

52:47.631 --> 52:53.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.

52:53.871 --> 52:57.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
